With the first Rafale squadron, the 17 'Golden Arrows' fully operational at the Ambala airbase with its full complement of 18 fighters, the 101 squadron has been resurrected with five jets that have touched down in India, IAF sources said. The remaining 13 of the 36 twin-engine Rafales, contracted under the Rs 59,000 crore deal inked with France in September 2016, are slated to arrive in batches before April next year. The IAF is "absolutely on target" on the Rafale induction plan, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said on Saturday. "The formal ceremony for the 101 Squadron, which had earlier been 'number-plated' with the retirement of its old MiG-21 fighters, in Hasimara has been slightly delayed due to the Covid pandemic. But it will happen within a month or so," a source said. While Group Captain Rohit Kataria is the commanding officer of the 17 squadron, Group Captain Neeraj Jhamb 'Jammy' is heading the 101 squadron, he added. Ambala and Hasimara were selected as the 'main operating home bases' for the 4.5-generation Rafales, though the omni-role fighters can operate from anywhere in the country as and when required. Hangars, shelters, maintenance facilities and infrastructure for the Rafales have come up at both the airbases. The Hasimara airbase, close to the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction, was established with Toofani aircraft after the 1962 war with China. Along with the Russian-origin Sukhoi-30MKIs already deployed at air bases like Tezpur and Chabua, the Rafales will now add a greater combat punch against China in the eastern sector. With a combat range of 780 km to 1,650 km depending on the mission, the Rafales come armed with a deadly weapons package, advanced avionics, radars and electronic warfare systems to prevent jamming by adversaries and ensure superior survivability in hostile contested airspace, as was earlier reported by TOI. The Rafales, for one, are armed with long stand-off weapons like the over 300-km range Scalp air-to-ground cruise missiles. They are also equipped with top-notch Meteor air-to-air missiles, which with a strike range of 120 to 150 km are better than any missiles currently carried by Pakistani or Chinese jets.  IAF had also ordered the Hammer air-to-ground precision-guided munitions for the Rafales, in a deal that came last year amid the ongoing military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh. With a strike range of 20 to 70 km, the Hammer munitions are designed to destroy bunkers, hardened shelters and other targets in all terrain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iaf-set-to-deploy-rafales-in-hasimara-for-eastern-front-with-china/articleshow/83699361.cms||Rajat Pandit

Mehbooba is said to be reluctant to commit herself to the meeting despite her party's political affairs committee signalling that it wants her to be part of it. The National Conference-led People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, of which PDP is a part, is assembling on Monday morning to take a call on the Union home ministry's invitation. Mehbooba's indecision stems from the agenda for the meeting, a PDP official said. "Delimitation and elections in J&K are not our priorities right now. Before convening a dialogue on these topics, the Centre should have taken some confidence-building measures. A final decision on whether PDP will be part of the discussions will be taken after the Gupkar alliance meets," he said. Unofficially, the constituents of the five-party Gupkar alliance — including the Left — are said to be keen on joining the meeting. "We basically have no option but to meet the PM for the first political discourse since the special status of J&K was nullified on August 5, 2019," a top functionary of the alliance said on Sunday. The Union home ministry has formally invited 14 political functionaries from J&K to the meeting with the PM. The list includes Srinagar MP Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, both former CMs, besides Mehbooba, CPM state secretary Younus Tarigami and Apni Party chief Altaf Bukhari. The J&K delimitation commission headed by a retired high court judge already includes Farooq and two senior NC colleagues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mufti-dithers-on-joining-pm-meet-but-gupkar-keen/articleshow/83700527.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The three persons were booked under 15 sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC), some of them non-bailable, and under IT Act on the basis of a complaint filed by Rai's brother, Sanjay Bansal. Bansal alleged that former journalist Vineet Narain put up a "malicious" post on Facebook accusing him and his family members of grabbing property in Bijnor's Nagina area. He also alleged that Indonesia-returned Alka Lahoti and another person, Rajneesh, "conspired" with Narain to defame his family and "hurt religious sentiments of people of the country". Nagina is the home town of VHP leader Rai. Bijnor's superintendent of police (SP) Dharamveer Singh said, "A case has been registered against Vineet Narain, Alka Lahoti and Rajneesh. They had put up a derogatory post on Facebook making allegations of corruption against Champat Rai's family members. We have set up an inquiry into the matter. Prima facie allegation seems to be false. The accused tried to tarnish the image of Rai and hurt the religious sentiments of people. However, a probe is on and documents are being checked." The case was filed under IPC sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion), 293 (circulating obscene objects), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings), 417 (punishment for cheating), 419 (punishment for cheating by personation), 448 (punishment for house-trespass), 465 (punishment for forgery), 457 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night), 469 (whoever commits forgery, intending that the document or electronic record forged shall harm the reputation of any party).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-booked-for-post-tarnishing-image-of-ram-mandir-trusts-general-secretary/articleshow/83700879.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||India||Covid-19: 34% of RAT results false negatives, turn positive on RT-PCR testing, finds study||MUMBAI: An analysis of antigen negative tests that came positive when retested with RT-PCR has proved that the rapid test missed up to 33.7% of cases. The finding assumes importance since more than 60% of the daily Covid-19 tests in Maharashtra are done using the rapid antigen test (RAT), preferred for ease of use and shorter turnaround time. The study was based on field data from tests carried out at Parel-based Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Research in Reproductive Health (ICMR-NIRRH) between July 7 and August 7, 2020. The institute studied its own database of 412 antigen negative reports that were retested with RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), the gold standard test to detect coronavirus. It found that the repeat RT-PCR could pick up 139 positives (33.7%) that were missed by antigen. Of the 139 positives, 91 (65%) were symptomatic, while 48 (27%) were asymptomatic. The asymptomatic cases included people who were subjected to a Covid test as they were high-risk contacts of confirmed cases, people in police custody, pregnant women, newborns and patients who were to undergo a surgery. The highest positivity of 45% was found in high-risk contacts followed by 12.2% among police custody individuals, 22.2% in pregnant women and 33.3% in individuals hospitalised for pre-operative or other medical conditions. "Confirmation of antigen negative tested individuals by RT-PCR, especially for asymptomatic or high-risk groups, is critical for prompt isolation and clinical management," the paper that was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology stated. Lead author Kiran Munne underlined that the RAT showed lower sensitivity than RT-PCR test both for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. According to Dr Smita Mahale, co-author and former director of ICMR-NIRRH, the findings are significant since the extent of 'false negatives' is proved from data from real world settings. "People need to be educated that an antigen negative test is not a stamp of being infection-free. If the person has symptoms or is a high-risk contact, he/she must be sensitised about the need to get tested again," she said. The state is carrying out an average of 2.4 lakh tests of which around 1.3 lakh are antigen tests . In a report last week, Dr Pradeep Awate, the state surveillance expert, had said RAT has been increased to cover hotspots in rural areas, where the reach of laboratories was limited. In districts such as Amravati, up to 84% tests are done using antigen method, while it's as high as 91% in Bhandara and 87% in Gadchiroli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/34-of-rat-results-false-negatives-turn-positive-on-rt-pcr-testing-finds-study/articleshow/83701379.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The state has also pleaded in court for remarks made against it to be "expunged" from the order. The matter is likely to be heard by a five-judge bench on Monday. The petition by Bengal home secretary B P Gopalika says the state government should be given a chance to probe and report on the list of 3,423 complaints provided to HC by West Bengal Legal Services Authority (WBLSA) on June 10. The government further said that allegations that police superintendents didn't act on many such complaints needed to be verified. In its petition, the state says it "did not get any opportunity to peruse the report or to look into the complaints mentioned in the report of the West Bengal Legal Services Authority and verify the allegations made in the complaints as referred to in such report and assist this hon'ble court." It adds that SP and police stations "have also not been given an opportunity to respond as to whether it had received the complaints and whether steps have been taken on such complaints". It futher said "before referring the matter" to NHRC, the state should have been provided a copy of the WBLSA report and its response taken. The HC had on June 18 made some remarks against the state and its order even said the "state from the very beginning had been denying everything".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/post-poll-violence-recall-or-modify-nhrc-probe-order-bengal-govt-urges-hc/articleshow/83701704.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

Deaths reported during the week (June 14-20) also dipped below 14,000 - at an average of less than 2,000 a day - for the first time in the last nine weeks. The country reported 13,886 deaths during June 14-20, down from 25,058 fatalities in the previous week.  While daily fatalities have been steadily declining, the sharp drop in the weekly toll was because of a big dip in "backlog" deaths. This week, at least 5,151 such deaths were added to the toll as opposed to 11,875 last week. Backlog deaths are fatalities that the authorities have acknowledged after a considerable time lag because of late reporting, oversight or other reasons. Maharashtra has reported by far the highest number of old deaths so far, at least 22,875 out of a total of over 27,600 recorded so far since the first week of May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-weekly-covid-19-deaths-see-sharpest-fall-ever/articleshow/83702386.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||India||No showpiece for poll campaigns, would rather work independently: Navjot Singh Sidhu||PATIALA: While he has been using social media to launch attacks on his own party’s government in Punjab, Navjot Singh Sidhu has avoided long interactions with media since his resignation from the state cabinet over a change of portfolio in July 2019. Finally breaking his silence, the Congress MLA answers questions on speculations that he is aspiring to be the deputy CM or the Punjab Congress president. He insists that he is not after any position and has full faith in the Congress high command. You say you’ve been reflecting over the past few months. How do you see the current situation in the state?The system has been governed by two powerful families, who have controlled it, through officers, belittling the legislature. For what? For business interests. The people of Punjab elected MLAs. They did not choose any officers. But when you make a system accountable to the officers, where is the power of the people? I joined in after Prashant Kishor came and met me almost 60 times. I told him that I have an agenda – the power of the people should not be restricted to a select few for their selfish interests. For me, politics is a mission, not a profession. I went to the system about sacrilege. It is like someone hitting our souls. I begged for justice in the assembly, and released CCTV footage of the firing incident. I started and ended the 2019 Lok Sabha campaign with the sacrilege issue. The system wanted to take action on this top priority issue in the past six months. When there is a threat to your position, only then you take note. Were you sleeping for over four years? Why nothing happened on power purchase agreements (PPA). Where is the White Paper? You quit as minister for local government in 2019. What had transpired?There is no independence. One person controls it all. It’s alright if you are with them. Otherwise they stall their (ministers’) works. I had a proposal of five bridges for Amritsar that I put forth before (former CM) Parkash Singh Badal. I revived that proposal (during the present regime). The system said, “no”. I followed my pro-people agenda from the very first cabinet meeting. I gave a proposal to change the liquor policy. It is not Rs 300 crore or 500 crore but about Rs 30,000 crore. Citing the example of Tamil Naidu, I said, “Let’s change this policy, sir”. The proposed corporation would have given employment to people, generating money to be spent for the ETT teachers. Why implement pay commission recommendations in the last six months (of the government)? I went to the system with a mining policy. Punjab has three rivers, but the last government generated only Rs 40 crore. I went to Telangana: Rs 10 crore to Rs 2,500 crore from one river in five years. I said fix the rates. I went to the system for a law against the cable mafia. I talked about Justice Kuldeep Singh Report’s report on land grabbing in Mohali and elsewhere. I sought a change in the way private buses are given permits. My portfolio was changed because of my speech demanding justice for sacrilege, in Bathinda. The system put the ‘Minister of Power and Renewable Energy’ plate outside my office. I said, “no”. I said I will reject the system that has rejected all of my proposals... I went back home, meditated and contemplated during these months. People said, ‘Sidhu is silent’. But I brainstormed each day. Punjab doesn’t need a Gujarat or Delhi model, but a Punjab model inspired by Guru Nanak. The state’s exchequer has gone to individual pockets, loans taken to return loans. People of Punjab think the loan is on the state government, but it will be recovered from them. After this, the system invited me for tea and then lunch and said, “take this ministry”. But I said no. The system said: “All of us want him (Sidhu) in the cabinet, he’s so dear.” What changed suddenly? Or is it that you want to use me in the election campaign and then put the showpiece back into the closet? I say: You fulfil the agenda; I will support you without a post. You may even appoint me in the zila parishad. But if you do not fulfil people’s aspirations, no post will matter to me. Why would I work under such a system? I would rather work independently, wherever the high command wants me to. Am I a ‘darshani ghoda’ or a showpiece? What exactly was offered to you at these meetings?It does not matter. Positions do not matter to me – is it for an office or a car. They could have offered anything. If they implement the real agenda of the people, I will follow them. When you say ‘the system’, are you referring to the CM, the cabinet or the bureaucracy?I categorically said at the start – two powerful families and their selfish and business interests that have mortgaged Punjab. That is the ruin that has happened. What’s your reaction to the latest row over jobs to Congress MLAs’ sons?Is there any merit in it? It is contrary to the spirit of Indian Constitution. I have set an example. My son gave up assistant advocate general post and my wife didn’t accept the position of the Warehousing Corporation chairperson. Should the power of the people go to the poorest of the poor or richest of the rich. If sympathy is the criterion, who should benefit? Have you been in touch with the party high command all this while?I was in touch with them, appraising them about the whole situation. They are supreme and wonderful people. I have full faith in them… One man here has taken the party for the ride. Who takes decisions as the home minister and then shifts the blame? I held him accountable. There is nothing personal, I have no animosity with anyone. I say fulfil the aspirations of people. Has the party high command thought of any roadmap for you?When I have never asked for anything then why would I clamour for all this. My only agenda is to resurrect Punjab, focussing on the solutions. There are attempts to digress from the main issues. Do you think you can contribute better as the deputy CM or as the state party president?How? When he doesn’t allow you to work. I told you all the ‘nos’ that I got (for my proposals). You met the AICC’s Kharge panel. What did you tell them?I shared the same thoughts with the panel too. This agenda is the only goal of my life. Would you react to the CM's interview that you aspire to be the deputy CM or the party president?See, I have said they are liars. I said, prove it. I have never asked for any position from anyone in my life. I have rejected so many offers all these years. I fight for the people of Punjab and they trust my character. The CM recently said that his doors are closed for you.Who is he to close the doors? Is the CM the Congress? The Congress is the worker, it’s the high command… Have I ever attacked him personally? I only want to remind him of his responsibilities. And are you saying the bureaucracy is in collusion?It’s not about that. The people elected MLAs, not officers. The officers are being used by him. They are good people but accountable to the chief ministers, who can give them a posting or remove them. You’ve made a system accountable to the officers. I always say the bureaucracy is functioning with him. The issue is belittling the legislature and slaving the ministries. In the end, can you clarify about your stay in Patiala?My stay in Patiala is in a house that my father built at exactly my age. Is it a crime if I am spending time here to fight an illness? I do not want to trouble people about my personal problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/im-not-a-showpiece-to-be-used-for-polls-navjot-sidhu/articleshow/83702805.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||India||J&K: Polls have to wait till delimitation panel finishes task||NEW DELHI: The PM's plan for a meeting with political parties from J&K on Thursday may have started speculation about significant concessions to the Valley but it may be still some time before their likely demands - holding of polls to install an elected government and restoration of statehood - can be met. For, the administration heads of the 20 districts in UT may take at least another one or two months to send full data sought by the Delimitation Commission regarding the physical features, demographic pattern and administrative challenges of their respective districts. Sources said this information is crucial to the commission as the updated nomadic headcount of the districts will be required for delineating 'reserved' constituencies. Though delimitation will be based on the 2011 Census, the delimitation panel usually seeks updated data from districts. Holding of polls to install a government in J&K will depend on completion of the delimitation process. TOI has learnt that the June 24 meet will not only hear J&K political parties' views but also update them on progress on the development and security front since the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019. Giving an opportunity to J&K's parties to vent their concerns is being seen as an outreach by the Centre to involve all stakeholders in taking the democratic process forward. The Delimitation Commission is likely to hold a virtual meeting with all district deputy commissioners in the coming days to discuss the data shared by them on 18 parameters, even though sources said the DCs are likely to seek further time to submit full data. Sources told TOI that a second meeting with associate members - MPs of all six LS constituencies - is likely to be convened by the commission in near future. Once the draft delimitation map is ready, it will be placed in public domain for objections. Public hearings will follow before the delimitation award is finalised. Then, the Election Commission will need to do a special summary revision of electoral rolls in J&K before polls can be scheduled. For now, sources told TOI that deputy commissioners of the 20 districts have sent provisional data to the Delimitation Commission but full data may be compiled only by July end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-polls-have-to-wait-till-delimitation-panel-finishes-task/articleshow/83703026.cms||Bharti Jain

While a maximum of 51mm of rainfall was recorded at Rajkot, in Vadodara many trees were uprooted due to the strong winds that accompanied the rain. Rains continued to pound Rajkot for the third consecutive day on Sunday. Many roads in the city faced waterlogging issues within three hours of heavy downpour. On Sunday, the west zone of the city received the highest rainfall at 51mm followed by 44mm in the central zone and 34mm in the east zone. Waterlogging was reported at Raiya Chokdi, Madhapar chokdi, Azad chowk, Popatpara Nala, Saurashtra Kala Kendra, Laxminagar Nalu and Prem Mandir area of Rajkot city. In Vadodara, the skies were overcast since morning and the weather department had predicted rain. It being Sunday, the Barodians thronged the Akota-Dandia Bazaar Road to enjoy the cool breeze and rains. But the heavy showers accompanied with strong winds left them surprised. According to weather officials, Vadodara city received 20mm of rain within an hour on Sunday. The roads in the old city including Raopura, Dandia Bazaar, Mandvi, Panigate and Khanderao Market were left waterlogged for a couple of hours. “At least a dozen trees were uprooted due to the rains. We are still getting complaints,” said a fire official. The Vadodara civic authorities, though, are on overdrive to ensure that city roads don’t face waterlogging or witness potholes during the monsoons. Apart from the city, Padra taluka received 40mm of rain on Sunday. In Saurashtra region, Jamnagar’s Kalavad received the highest rainfall of 75mm. Many parts of Saurashtra region received light to moderate rainfall. Vadia, in Amreli district, received 34mm of rainfall while Thangadh of Surendranagar received 35mm and Maliya-Miyana of Morbi district received 36mm of rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/downpour-leaves-rajkot-vadodara-waterlogged/articleshow/83696213.cms||---

Bengal will continue to offer the vaccine to only the priority group in the 18-44 category for now. Health officials said they will wait for a few days and observe the quantity of vaccines the central government sends before opening up the drive to all. “There still is a shortage of vaccine and we are prioritizing the specially identified group. Let’s see how much vaccine we get so that we can inoculate all above 18,” said state health secretary Ajay Chakraborty. The state had started vaccinating close to 5 lakh people a day in March and April. But low supply forced it to scale down the drive and the number of doses administered daily has dipped below 3 lakh at present. In June, the Prime Minister had announced that states would no longer be required to procure vaccines as the Centre would send them from June 21. “But the state had already identified the priority group and that is the first target. As of now, there is no change in policy. But we will increase the volume of vaccination daily according to what we receive,” said the DHS. The state had purchased 18 lakh doses in May and placed orders for 22 lakh doses. The last order was recalled a few days ago after the Centre announced doses for all age groups at government CVCs. While the private CVCs have been inoculating all eligible recipients, the state had reserved the 18-44 drive only for the prioritized group that include hawkers, workers associated with transport, media professionals, family of healthcare workers, domestic helps and so on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-unit-vax-only-for-priority-group/articleshow/83698225.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Rising diesel price makes veggies dearer||KOLKATA: The upswing of vegetable prices continued on Sunday with diesel prices marching towards Rs 95 a litre. However, the agriculture marketing department sources predicted a steeper price rise in the coming days with the supply line hitting an unprecedented low with record damage to crops this season. “Though some vegetables that were under flood water were sold dirt cheap, you cannot preserve them for more than 24 hours, even in refrigerators. But the water has prevented farmers from growing fresh vegetables and this will affect the supply line at least for the next couple of weeks, pushing up prices further,” said Kamal Dey, a member of the market task force of the Bengal government. “The good quality brinjal crossed the Rs 100 mark. Prices of beans, carrot and capsicum breached the Rs 150 mark. Bitter gourd was sold at Rs 90-Rs 100 a kg, forcing buyers to purchase lower quantities than usual. Vendors are also bringing fewer vegetables due to the restricted selling window of four hours,” said Dilip Adhikari, a retailer at Jadubabur Bazar. “The quality of vegetables available is poor and they are rotting faster. So we are buying less and coming to markets daily. The prices are also very high. Unless the diesel price stabilizes, we will keep burning holes in our pockets,” said Arup Roy, a school teacher from Behala. “The price rise of essentials can majorly be attributed to costlier fuel. The carrying cost had risen manifold and it is being revised almost on a daily basis,” said state’s agri-adviser Pradeep Mazumdar. This is why the price of a commodity which is low at the rural market becomes costly in city markets, he said. “Except Nadia, stretches in Hooghly, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas are inundated. The vegetable supply to haats in these districts has reduced by one-fourth,” said Dey, also the president of West Bengal Vendors’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rising-diesel-price-makes-veggies-dearer/articleshow/83698261.cms||Falguni Banerjee

The government said the PCA was constituted following verdicts of the Supreme Court and Telangana High Court. Earlier, the YSRC government had appointed Kanagaraj (85) as state election commissioner (SEC) in April, 2020 by replacing Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar. The government brought in an ordinance to trim Ramesh Kumar’s term to three years from five years following his decision to postpone local body elections citing Covid-19 in March 2020. Kanagaraj was hurriedly made to travel to Vijayawada from Chennai and take charge as SEC. After a four-month-long legal battle, the high court reinstated Ramesh Kumar as the SEC. The Supreme Court too refused to entertain an appeal filed by the government, prompting Ramesh Kumar’s reinstatement as SEC in July 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/justice-kanagaraj-appointed-pca-chair/articleshow/83696123.cms||Samdani MN
---||Delhi||How this rural helpline is trying to fill in the Covid knowledge gap||NEW DELHI: With over 200 calls a day from around 70-95 villages in India, a new rural health helpline is making sure that the knowledge gap regarding Covid-19 is filled.  To help rural India with Covid prevention, diagnostic startup Divoc Health has launched a free helpline number 9614953953 for the general public to access credible information around Covid-19. Queries are cleared through an automated interactive voice response system. “Around 37% of the calls that we are getting are from people asking us for information on prevention of Covid, around 28% are related to the cure of Covid and the danger signs and roughly 11% are related to vaccines,” said Dr Kanav Kahol, founder and CEO of Divoc. He stated that vaccine hesitancy was a phenomenon in rural areas and a lot of work and a consistent programme would be required to address it. Kahol claimed that their service was reaching out to 70-95 villages from states like Karnataka, Bihar, Goa, etc. This initiative is set up by the diagnostic centre in collaboration with a fintech company Kaleidofin, which provides information about the coronavirus pandemic in several languages. Kahol further said, “Having credible and complete information is a necessity to fight this pandemic, especially in rural areas of the country, and hence, we urge people to be vigilant and only rely on authentic and official sources of information.” The helpline, he said, has information in different languages like Hindi, English, Gujarati, Maithili, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam, and it’s being made available to all rural users nationwide. “This helpline is automated but in case someone wants more information, we can connect them to doctors for teleconsultation as the call volume has gone up recently,” the CEO of the organisation said. Divoc Health was formed to reverse the Covid-19 pandemic using innovative products and approaches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-this-rural-helpline-is-trying-to-fill-in-the-covid-knowledge-gap/articleshow/83699836.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

However, most of the streets on Sunday wore a deserted look owing to the weekend Covid lockdown. The police checked over 3,000 vehicles in the past 48 hours and challaned over 200 people for not carrying required documents. Police also inspected several localities, including Rajapur, Ashok Nagar, Mumfordganj, Mutthiganj, Attarsuiya, Cantt, Alopibagh and Daraganj after receiving reports that owners of grocery shops had partially opened shutters and attended customers in early morning hours. Checking drive was also intensified in the old city areas and over 10 persons were challaned on charges of opening their shops despite lockdown. The mobile police teams patrolled market areas in evening hours and fined over 138 people for not wearing masks in the last 24 hours. A close vigil is also being maintained on micro containment zones. Even as the city has less than 180 active cases, senior police officials continue to urge citizens to follow Covid protocol. A senior cop said that mobile teams continued to make announcements to appeal to people to stay indoors during the weekend lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cops-maintain-strict-vigil-to-enforce-weekend-lockdown/articleshow/83697054.cms||---

Talking to TOI on Sunday, UP minister of state (independent charge) for religious affairs and tourism, Neelkanth Tiwari, said, “The commissioner of Varanasi division has been given additional charge as director of DRA. The procedure for selecting a site for DRA office in vicinity of Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) has begun and construction would begin after the site is finalized.” Director Deepak Agrawal said, “Apart from setting up office, recruiting staff for the office has become top priority.” On December 11, 2020, the state cabinet chaired by chief minister Yogi Adityanath approved the proposal to set up DRA to ease administrative functioning in promoting religious sites as tourism hubs. As per the decision, the DRA headquarters would be established with the help of Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board (KVSADB) and the DRA’s sub-office would be set up at Kailash Mansarovar office building in Ghaziabad. The minister said, as the holy city was the cultural capital, seat of learning, birth and work place of legendary individuals, it was selected to house the first DRA office. He said the ground for establishing DRA had already been prepared in 2019. Since inception of the religious affairs department in 1985, the absence of a directorate created hurdles in implementation of government schemes despite being responsible for maintenance and infrastructural development of religious, cultural, historical and architectural buildings around religious sites. Minister Neelkanth Tiwari also mentioned how the state government had worked to improve facilities for devotees at key pilgrimage sites, including Varanasi, Ayodhya, Mathura-Vrindavan, Chitrakoot and Vindhyachal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/div-commissioner-appointed-head-of-directorate-of-religious-affairs/articleshow/83697057.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

On June 10, the union ministry had invited companies to bid for development and monetising 32 contract areas comprising 75 oil and gas fields at 11 sites, 20 shallow water off-shore sites and a site located in deep water off-shore. These are for the development of discovered small oil and gas fields under Discovered Small Field Policy through the directorate general of hydrocarbons (DGH). The bid also allows foreign companies and joint ventures to take up the contract. Vadatheru, which comes under Cauvery delta off-shore, is one of the sites discovered by the ministry for the award of contract of oil and natural gas exploration. The ministry notified that the exploration will be allowed on a 463.2 sqkm in the site. This announcement sparked strong opposition from activists. Villagers of Neduvasal in Pudukkottai protested against the bid on Sunday. Environmental organisations termed the action by the Centre autocratic despite the former AIADMK-led government declaring the Cauvery delta region as a protected special agriculture zone in February 2020. The zone includes eight districts including Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagappattinam,Pudukkottai, Cuddalore, Ariyalur, Karur and Trichy. “The notification said the petroleum ministry mentioned about the petroleum mining lease obtained by oil and natural gas Corporation (ONGC) upto 2027. If the ministry attempts to carry out exploration of hydrocarbon citing the permission, Tamil Nadu government should take efforts to stop the process,” said Poovulagin Nanbargal an environmental organisation in a statement. Chief coordinator of the federation of associations against methane extraction T Jayaraman said the move was an insult to the stand of the government. He also pointed out the contract duration for the development and production for 20 years and the ‘hydraulic fracturing’ method to be applied for the hydrocarbon extraction. “The method of extraction will be detrimental to the environment. We appeal to the state government to step into the issue and take Cauvery delta zone off the list of DSF,” said Jayaraman on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/protest-against-oil-exploration-bid-in-cauvery-delta-region/articleshow/83494453.cms||---

Two hours after the call, the doctor received a message wherein his photo was found to have been superimposed on obscene pictures. The caller threatened to release the photographs on Facebook if the doctor did not pay up. The doctor has now approached Phoolbagan police, who registered an FIR. The additional OC has been assigned to investigate the case. According to the complaint, the doctor received the video call around 9pm. The caller spoke Hindi and described a patient’s condition. After the call ended, he received another call from a different number. The extortion message came around 11pm. The doctor, like a number of his colleagues, has been treating patients over video calls for the past few months due to the pandemic. “The unidentified accused made a video call from two mobile numbers and during the video call, the accused allegedly took a screenshot of him talking. The accused then superimposed it on some obscene pictures. Thereafter, the extortionists began threatening to post those pictures on social media. They forced the doctor to transfer Rs 5,100 to the accused person’s account. The accused then asked for more money transfers in the future,” said an officer. The case has been drawn up under IPC sections pertaining to 384 (extortion), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 500 (defamation) along with sections 67 and 67A of the Information Technology Act. TOI tried calling the doctor and texting him, but has not received any response yet. The cops believe that members of the Bharatpur (Mewati) gangs or their offshoots in the city might be behind the incident. The Phoolbagan police said that while the cyber cell will provide technical assistance, the detective department might take over if required. These cyber frauds have been operational in the city for over 11 months now with the first such case being reported barely a couple of months after the lockdown was imposed last year. The police are likely to question a gang of four arrested two days ago on similar charges, sources claimed. The cops have urged citizens not to be intimidated by these extortionists and instead approach the police. “The accused are sitting far away from the victim and will continue threatening unless strong legal steps are taken,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/blackmailer-morphs-doctors-photo-after-video-call-makes-him-pay-rs-5k/articleshow/83698138.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Pandit is a resident of Shivahi Patti in Muzaffarpur. The dead child was identified as Neeraj Kumar, a resident of Laxminia village under the Baruraj police station area in Muzaffarpur district. His body was recovered from a canal on the outskirts of Laxminia village on Saturday. Pandit, a daily wager, had been living at Laxminia for the last one month. SHO of Baruraj police station Mukesh Kumar said a local court forwarded Pandit to judicial custody on Sunday. He said the matter came to light after locals spotted Neeraj’s body in the canal on Saturday morning. “Neeraj had gone missing on Friday night. His family members had, however, not lodged any complaint with the police till the body was recovered,” he said. The SHO said Neeraj’s 45-year-old mother lodged a complaint against Pandit on Saturday, accusing him of kidnapping and killing his son. “On the basis of the FIR, Pandit was detained for interrogation and later arrested. Pandit admitted that he had taken the child to the banks of the canal and strangulated him to death on Friday night,” he said. “Pandit told police that Neeraj had seen his mother with him in an objectionable position a few days back,” he said, adding police are trying to find out whether the woman is also involved in the murder. “She will be interrogated soon,” the SHO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/muz-man-arrested-for-killing-10-year-old-boy/articleshow/83695612.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Bihar: Wife accuses Sheohar DM of assault, cruelty||PATNA: Sheohar DM Sajjan R, a 2015-batch IAS officer, has been accused of domestic violence, cruelty, demanding dowry and separating his 2-year-old daughter from her mother. Sajjan’s wife GSS Sitara has lodged an FIR against him with Town police station in Muzaffarpur under sections 498A, 279, 337 and 338 of IPC on Friday. Sitara is presently living at Muzaffarpur with her mother V Bharathy. The couple also has a one-year-old son, who lives with Sitara. However, Sajjan denied the allegations and said, “The FIR has been lodged to blackmail me. I am trying to speak to my wife for resolution. I am trying to call her to Sheohar but she is not coming due to her ego problem.” Regarding their daughter, the DM said she is suffering from a genetic disease and he had to call his mother from Chennai to take care of her. Both Sajjan and Sitara are from Chennai. Sitara alleged that Sajjan violently assaulted her in Sheohar on March 1 and her mother V Bharathy sent an email to senior authorities in Bihar from Chennai for help following which senior bureaucrats brought her to a Magistrate Colony quarter in Muzaffarpur. In the FIR, whose copy is with TOI, Sitara alleged that Sajjan ‘abducted’ their minor daughter three months back. She also alleged that Sajjan had pushed her out of the moving car at Magistrate Colony on June 15 when she begged to keep the daughter with herself for some time. As per the FIR, Sajjan had reached Muzaffarpur to celebrate their son’s first birthday. Sitara’s mother was also injured in the incident, she alleged. Sitara alleged that whenever she asks to return their daughter, Sajjan asks her to withdraw the maintenance petition filed after she started living at Muzaffarpur. However, Sajjan said the problems started soon after their marriage. “My wife wants to live separately. She wants money as well as our children too,” he said, adding that he was exploring legal options besides trying to resolve the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/wife-accuses-sheohar-dm-of-assault-cruelty/articleshow/83695761.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Many fall ill after taking meal at ‘shradh’ of ex-ML leader in Jehanabad||PATNA: Several people, who had taken meal at the ‘shradh’ of former CPI-ML state secretary Ramjatan Sharma at Amarpura village under the Pali police station area in Jehanabad district on Friday night, fell ill on Saturday and were admitted to different hospitals. Sharma (79) had passed away at Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology in Patna on June 6 following a cardiac arrest. Though Jehanabad DM Navin Kumar said only four people had fallen ill from among 60 who had attended the function, a local said at least 500 villagers had gathered at the event and more than 100 of them developed fever, diarrhoea and vomiting by Saturday morning. Incidentally, only 20 people are allowed to attend ‘shradh’ functions amid Covid-induced partial lockdown in the state. Jaya Prakash, a local, told TOI over phone on Sunday that at least 500 people had gathered at the function as Sharma had huge support base in the region. “People had come from at least seven villages, including Amarpur Pali, Nigar Pali and Makhdumpur,” he said, adding 100 of them fell ill by Saturday morning and were rushed to different hospitals in Jehanabad and Patna. However, the DM said just four ill people were being treated at Kako PHC. “There is nothing serious. The SDO had visited the spot,” he said. SHO of Pali police station Akash Kumar said they came to know about the mass illness on Sunday. “An FIR has been lodged by Kako circle officer Dinkar Kumar against Sharma’s son Mrityunjay Kumar for violating lockdown norms. At least 60 people had gathered at the function,” he said. Randhir Kumar, a sub-inspector posted at Pali police station, said Sharma’s son, an engineer, had come to Amarpura from Bengaluru to perform the ‘shradh’ rituals. “No prior information about the function was given to the police. Several ill people took medicines on their own and got cured,” Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-fall-ill-after-taking-meal-at-shradh-of-ex-ml-state-secy/articleshow/83695724.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||Sebi freezes PNB Hsg’s Rs 4,000 crore deal with Carlyle||MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi has asked PNB Housing Finance (PNBHFL) to put on hold its preferential allotment plan to PE major Carlyle Group and its associates as the valuation of shares was ultra vires of the home finance company’s articles of association (AoA). Sebi has also asked the company to appoint a new and independent valuer for the shares’ valuation before selling any more, PNBHFL’s disclosure to the exchanges showed. In its letter to PNBHFL, Sebi said that the resolution about preferential allotment in its notice of the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) was “ultra-vires of AoA and shall not be acted upon until the company undertakes the valuation of shares as prescribed under 19(2) of AoA, for purpose of preferential allotment, from an independent registered valuer as per the provisions of applicable laws”. Sebi also directed the company’s board to consider this new report “while deciding on the preferential issue of shares and warrants”. The regulatory directive came after SES, an institutional shareholders advisory firm, pointed out that the allotment of shares to the PE major and its associates, valued at Rs 4,000 crore, was ultra vires of PNBHFL’s AoA. SES also said that the way the whole deal was structured was skewed against minority shareholders, currently holding about 15% in the mortgage lender. An EGM is scheduled for June 22. As part of the whole process through which Carlyle and its associates were to become the majority owner of the mortgage lender, replacing public sector banking major PNB, an open offer has also been rolled out by HSBC, the banker to the offer. After Sebi asked for a preliminary report on the matter from PNBHFL through the exchanges in the first week of June, a company spokesperson had told TOI that the share-allotment proposal was arrived at after following all the rules and laws. In its disclosure to the exchanges too, PNBHFL reiterated its stand and said that the company had “acted in compliance with all relevant applicable laws, including the applicable pricing regulations prescribed by Sebi, and the AoA of the company”. It also said that the preferential allotment was in the best interests of PNBHFL, its shareholders and all relevant stakeholders. Since the time it became public knowledge that the PE major along with its associates would become its new owners, the stock price of PNBHFL had more than doubled within a month to its 52-week high of Rs 924 by June 8. However, since the controversy about the preferential allotment erupted, the stock has corrected to its Friday close of Rs 739 on the BSE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-freezes-pnb-hsgs-rs-4k-cr-deal-with-carlyle/articleshow/83698610.cms||---

The administration has also sanctioned houses under the YSR Jagananna housing project. The chief minister’s camp office road-widening will be taken up after evacuation of the families. The CM had directed officials not to remove any of the dwellings located opposite his bungalow in Amarareddy Nagar in Tadepalle after taking over the reins of the state about two years ago. He also met some of the dwellers and promised them support and directed security personnel not to cause any trouble to the residents. However, senior police officials including from the intelligence wing convinced the chief minister of removing encroachments from the camp office road in view of growing security concerns. With the road leading to the CM’s bungalow being only 30-feet-wide, cabinet ministers and senior officials face trouble in maneuvering their vehicles. Taking security and traffic reasons into consideration, the district administration decided to widen the road and sought the CM’s permission. According to sources, the CM has given the green signal for evacuation after several rounds of discussions with officials. The CM also directed officials to grant two cents of land to all evacuees against one cent granted under the YSR Jagananna housing project and granted them additional compensation for rehabilitation. All the dwellers are staying in thatched houses. “We will give full support to the beneficiaries in completing the construction of their houses as they have been staying in thatched houses for several decades,” said Mangalagiri legislator Alla Ramakrishna Reddy. He added that they would complete roads, drinking water facility and drainage in the colony before the completion of houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/encroachers-near-cms-bungalow-get-house-sites/articleshow/83696468.cms||Samdani MN

The welfare measures for women have also reaped Nitish rich electoral dividends over the last 16 years. But academics and social activists feel the state has miles to go yet to realise the dream of ‘aadhe hum, aadha hamara’! While the 50% reservation for women in panchayati raj institutions and urban bodies laid the foundation for a kind of social revolution, to be adopted later by several other states, the Mukhyamantri Balika Cycle Yojana started in 2007 and Mukhyamantri Balika Protsahan Yojana for girl students not only earned Bihar worldwide praise, but also paved the way for enrolment of girl students in schools at a large scale. The Mukhyamantri Nari Shakti Yojana started in 2008 and the 35% quota for women in all state government jobs further boosted the empowerment measures for them. The latest in the list are interest-free Rs10 lakh loan scheme with half the subsidy for entrepreneurship and financial empowerment of women and 35% seats as the administrative heads at block and police station levels booked for them will, no doubt, benefit the society at large in the years to come. “The schemes so far have, no doubt, been partially successful in empowering women, but it will take time to bear the fruits on expected lines because of lack of education. The changes are visible and women are better aware about their rights now compared to the pre-2005 era in Bihar. The 50% quota for women in panchayats and urban local bodies proved to be the gamechanger though it is said that the male members of their families, in many cases, run the show,” Padma Shri awardee litterateur Usha Kiran Khan told TOI on Sunday. “Unless educated, women can neither know their rights nor duties. The government should focus on the proper training of the ASHAs, ANMs and Mamata workers. During the Covid period, they were provided kits for distribution without basic knowledge and importance of what they were distributing. Though half the primary school teachers are women appointed through panchayati raj institutions and urban bodies in their own categories, many of them are not good for their jobs. Social discrepancies and male chauvinism are the other factors hampering women empowerment,” Khan said. Though she hailed the steps being taken by the state government, Padma Shri recipient and social activist Sudha Varghese stressed the need for a “composite scheme” for women empowerment. “Otherwise, those who are already capable will only benefit from the government quota and all,” she said. “Empowerment is needed at social, financial and political levels. In panchayats, women representatives are still made to sign on the dotted lines either by their husband, son or other male family member. The change should be real. Move from Bailey Road canal towards Khagaul and you will see lines of huts of scheduled castes and Mahadalits. Do you think the women will benefit from the 35% administrative posts reserved for their category? They need to be educated first! There is hardly any change in their educational status over the years despite the Mukhyamantri Akshar Anchal Yojana implemented in 2009-10,” she told TOI. The Nitish government implemented Mahadalit, Alpsankhyak and Extremely Backward Class Akshar Anchal Yojana in 2013 to provide elementary education to the women and link the deprived children of these categories to schools. Recently, Nitish announced 33.3% reservation for women in admission in all engineering and medical colleges as well as the proposed sports university in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/women-empowerment-bihar-makes-strides-but-miles-to-go/articleshow/83696536.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

Chirag’s uncle and his bête noire Pashupati Kumar Paras represents the Hajipur seat in the Lok Sabha. Talking to mediapersons after the executive committee meeting in New Delhi, Chirag said, “The yatra will cover all the districts in a span of two months and conclude with a mega rally in Patna. The same day, a meeting of the national council of the party will be held.” Referring to the recent development, Chirag said he was prepared to face a Mahabharat-type battle against his kin. “I have the blessing of my mother and all the people who have extended their support in my toughest ever battle (read 2020 assembly polls),” he said. Five proposals were adopted at the meeting, including conferment of Bharat Ratna award posthumously on Ram Vilas Paswan for his 50 years of contribution in nation building and spotless political career. The Chirag-led faction claimed that 66 members of the national executive committee attended the meeting. While 43 members were physically present, the remaining 23 members attended the meeting through videoconferencing. Chirag-led faction's state president Raju Tiwari said besides the national principal general secretary, a national vice-president, four national general secretaries, nine national secretaries, 20 state presidents and 10 presidents of different units attended the meeting. Chirag blamed the ruling JD(U) for the political turmoil in the LJP. He alleged that the JD(U) tried to cause a split in the LJP by promising a ministerial berth to a senior leader in the Union cabinet. Asked about possible reunion of the Paswan family, the Jamui MP said, “I have no personal grudge against anybody. The doors are open for all.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-faction-of-ljp-to-launch-yatra-from-hajipur-on-july-5/articleshow/83695845.cms||Ramashankar

The officer on special duty (OSD) at the health directorate, Anand Prakash, on Saturday has asked the civil surgeon to explain within 48 hours as to why action should not be initiated against him for alleged gross anomalies in the recruitment of doctors and paramedical staff in the district for a period of three months. “I would not like to make any comment on the issue,” Choudhary told this newspaper over phone on Sunday. The action followed a report submitted to the state health department by district magistrate Pranav Kumar on Thursday, recommending disciplinary action against the civil surgeon on the basis of an inquiry report. Earlier, a three-member team headed by Muzaffarpur DDC probed the allegations of irregularities in the appointments. Altogether 780 doctors, ANMs, GNMs, ward boys and data entry operators were appointed on the directive of the health directorate for vaccination and the selected candidates were subsequently deputed at the Muzaffarpur Sadar hospital and different primary health centres in the district. The district performed well in the vaccination drive after the posts were filled with daily wagers. However, an audio went viral on social media claiming that money changed hands in the recruitments. Taking a note of the audio, the DM ordered an inquiry. The probe team found the allegations true. Subsequently, the DM ordered the civil surgeon to terminate the services of the 780 candidates. On Thursday, the civil surgeon cancelled their appointment, leading to protest by the selected candidates. The protest prompted the civil surgeon to withdraw the termination order and he allowed them to perform their duty till July 23. In the meanwhile, the heath directorate cancelled the appointments and sought an explanation from the civil surgeon. Reliable sources said a suspended JD(U) MLC and an MP played an important role in the appointment of doctors and paramedical staff on daily wages.

---||Allahabad||Now, international travellers receiving second dose before prescribed gap of 12-16 weeks||Prayagraj: Officials of the health department have started vaccinating people who intend to travel internationally for education, employment as well as those who are part of the Indian contingent participating in Tokyo Olympics. They are being administered the second dose of Covishield before the prescribed period of 12-16 weeks from the first dose. A special international vaccination centre has been set up at Moti Lal Nehru Medical College, and as many as 24 recipients have already been administered the jab. Nodal officer (vaccination) at MLN Medical College, Dr Utsav Singh, told TOI, “Since the Union government permitted people travelling abroad for certain purposes to receive the second dose of Covishield vaccine before the prescribed gap of 84 days, a special vaccination site has been set up the MLN Medical College. Now, the second dose will be administered to such people after 28 days from the first dose of Covishield, as per the SOPs.” Dr Singh further added, “Travellers who intend to go aboard for education, work, those who live overseas but are trapped in India due to the Covid lockdown, and dependents (whose family members are settled in aboard) have been asked to submit the certified copies of their passport, visa, call letter/work permit from foreign companies, college IDs, Aadhaar card and other relevant documents before receiving the second dose. “Once the formalities are completed and they have received the second dose of vaccine, vaccination certificates will be issued to the travellers,” added Singh. As per the SOPs issued by the central government, “The competent authority will check whether a period of 28 days has elapsed after the first dose was administered. They will also check the authenticity of the purpose of travel, based on documents related to admission offers or the associated formal communications for education.” Moreover, with the Tokyo Olympics round the corner, the Union government has also allowed athletes, sports persons and the accompanying staff of Indian contingent to get themselves a shot of Covishield vaccine under this arrangement. Officials, however, said that vaccination in such cases must be availed through passport, which is one of the permissible IDs as per the guidelines. The passport number will then be printed on the vaccination certificate. However, if the passport was not used during the administration of the first Covishield dose, “the details of the photo ID card used for vaccination will be printed on the vaccination certificate. In such a case, a mention of the passport number on the vaccination certificate is not to be insisted upon,” the SOPs stated. As many as 7,37,023 shots have been administered to recipients of all age groups in the district till June 20. While 6,09,067 beneficiaries have taken the first dose of vaccine, a total of 1,27,956 recipients have also received the second dose. Asm any as 10,347 vaccine shots were administered in the district in the past 24 hours, which included 9,721 recipients of the first dose and 626 of the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/now-international-travellers-receiving-second-dose-before-prescribed-gap-of-12-16-weeks/articleshow/83697032.cms||---

There are several other ways of getting an FIR registered and one must explore all the avenues for getting justice, said Supreme Court lawyer Nand Sagar on Sunday. Addressing a national workshop on ‘Stages of criminal trial and rights of victims’ organised by the Legal Aid Clinic of Central University of South Bihar (CUSB)’s School of Law and Governance at Gaya, Sagar pointed out that if the station house officer (SHO) does not register an FIR, one can make a representation to the DSP or SP against his harassment by the SHO and his refusal to lodge the FIR. And if even the DSP or SP fails to entertain the complainant, he should file an application before the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) under Section 156(3) for lodging the FIR by making SP, DSP and SHO a party. The CJM will give directions to the officer concerned for lodging the FIR, he said. Sagar explained from his own experience the difference between theoretical legal knowledge and the practicalities in the courtroom. Elaborating the applications of IPC, CrPC and Evidence Act, he explained the process of lodging an FIR in detail. He also discussed bail and its types and various stages of criminal trial. Patna high court lawyer Savita Ali, who is also the director of Bihar Legal Network, drew the attention of the participants towards the half-hearted approach of the state government towards implementation of existing laws, causing general people to suffer. She explained how lack of awareness about compensations, legal remedies and various legal tools results into non-accessibility of the benefits, especially to women victims. CUSB faculty D N Singh welcomed the guests. CUSB law student Rashmi Sinha moderated the discussions. CUSB teacher Neetu Kumari proposed a vote of thanks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/an-aggrieved-person-has-many-ways-to-lodge-fir/articleshow/83696460.cms||B K Mishra
---||Kolkata||High car count makes checks difficult for cops||Kolkata: The new set of enhanced restrictions that kicked in from June 16 — with several concessions allowed in several trading and businesses — has been a different challenge for Kolkata Police compared to the month when the restrictions first started. While the general compliance level among the majority of the population has been satisfactory, cops felt a few areas — like unusual traffic density in the peak morning hours — require some intervention. Statistics released by Kolkata traffic police show they have seized 37,319 vehicles in the first month of restrictions. From June 16 to noon on Sunday, there have been 3,366 seizures. The average prosecutions have dipped from 1,286 per day in the first week of June to 842 now. Cops said there were two primary reasons — a larger number of vehicles permitted to ply and difficulty in checking such a large volume during peak hours. For the first time, seizures in the second half of the day were almost eight times that in the morning. While the seizures in the mornings of June 17 and 18 were 93 and 97 respectively, the total seizures on both days stood at 819 to 902. In a positive development, night violations that had shot up in the beginning of this month are on a decline after successive crackdowns. Out of the 3,617 night violations in the past month, the initial days barely had 18-25 violations each night. This shot up to 358 on June 10 but dipped to 158-172 in the past five days. Lalbazar said several thousand private office goers had applied for e-pass. “However, once they were assured we would allow movement with e-cards, the demand has dropped,” an officer said. TOI had reported how citizens denied e-passes had written to Kolkata Police asking them to reconsider. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said, “We are checking each case of alleged violation compassionately. Anyone with proper documents need not worry.” Cops said news of app cabs, taxis and autos operating have reached them. “We are looking into the circumstances and taking action,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-car-count-makes-checks-difficult-for-cops/articleshow/83698184.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Business||DHFL lenders set to vote on giving more to small investors||Mumbai: Lenders To DHFL will vote on a proposal to distribute up to Rs 1,853 crore more to smaller investors and retirement funds in the bankrupt housing finance company this week. This complies with the National Company Law Tribunal’s order that asked the lenders to consider giving a higher amount to smaller investors. Between what was approved by the committee of creditors earlier and the proposed distribution mechanism, lenders will have to shell out Rs 1,853 crore, which is around 5.4% of the resolution plan value. The resolution proposes to pay the Army Insurance Group Fund, Air Force Group Insurance Society and The Navy Children’s School in full as suggested by the NCLT. This will result in an additional Rs 86-crore outgo for lenders. It also proposes that all fixed deposit holders get 40% of their admitted claims, which is in line with the recovery for secured creditors resulting in an additional payout of Rs 965 crore. In terms of the approved resolution plan, FD holders would have got a pittance as they are dissenting creditors and entitled to only their share of liquidation value. In the case of non-convertible debentures, lenders have proposed creating four categories based on the size of the investment. The resolution proposes investors up to Rs 10 lakh as well as retirement funds be paid 40% of their admitted claims even if they do not qualify for it. The additional payout to NCD holders works out to Rs 891 crore. According to legal experts, more than the payout, lenders would be worried about opening the doors for other categories of claimants as many other institutional investors could claim that they are ultimately representing small investors. Fresh litigation could then derail the resolution process which is already subject to several pending litigations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dhfl-lenders-set-to-vote-on-giving-more-to-small-investors/articleshow/83698496.cms||Mayur Shetty

Also, Videocon Telecommunications will be retailed as a wholly owned subsidiary of the new entity. The merger of the Videocon Group companies is part of the resolution plan. The resolution process involves extinguishing shares of VIL and Value Industries and delisting their shares. The process has already begun with the suspension of trading. According to the resolution plan, financial creditors who voted in favour of it will get 8% equity shareholding in VIL on post-money, fully diluted basis. This provides them with an upside as Vedanta has big plans for the electronics industry. Of the 11 companies that merge into Videocon, Applicomp CE is engaged in the manufacture of home appliances including refrigerators, mobile phones and LED televisions. SBI, IDBI Bank, Union Bank and other public sectors were the top lenders to VIL. Vedanta’s acquisition of the Videocon Group is through Twin Star Technologies. Twin Star was earlier in talks with the government to set up a $10-billion display fabrication unit in the country in 2016. While the project did not take off, the company has again resumed talks for a display unit for which it has partnered with South Korea’s LG Electronics for technology. With televisions completely shifting to flat panels, there is a high level of import dependency. The electronics and IT ministry had invited expressions of interest from companies to set up display fabrication units in India and had promised to come up with schemes to incentivise manufacturing in India. According to the ministry, the displays account for 25% of the cost of smartphones and 50% in the case of television sets. It added that India’s display market is estimated to be $7 billion and is expected to grow to $15 billion by 2025. The other 10 companies merging into VIL are Evans Fraser, Millennium Appliances, Electroworld Digital Solutions, Techno Kart India, Century Appliance, Techno Electronics, Value Industries, PE Electronics, CE India and Sky Appliances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/videocon-lenders-to-get-8-stake-in-merged-co/articleshow/83698579.cms||---
---||Business||‘Social media issue not unique to India’||NEW DELHI: T V Narendran, CEO and MD of Tata Steel, who has taken over as the new president of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), says the country is not unique to what is happening with social media companies and calls for regulations to be contextually appropriate. In an interview to TOI, he sees the impact of the second Covid wave to be less severe on the economy. Excerpts: What is your assessment of the second wave of the pandemic?The second wave economically has been less impactful than the first. From a humanitarian point of view, the second wave impacted much more. During the first wave, the lockdown happened very quickly, the industry was underprepared, the whole supply chain was disrupted. This time we did not have that kind of complete lockdown. Industry was better prepared. Globally, things are better. The impact of the stimulus by multiple countries is playing out, so India’s exports are strong. Global disruption of supply chains hasn’t happened like last year. The challenge for the governments is to make sure that people exercise discipline and not take undue risks going forward. The only concern we had was will the rural economy take off like last year, or is the situation in the rural community much worse than we think? The indication that we are getting over the last few weeks is that the rural economy is not too bad. If I talk to tractor manufacturers, they say things are not so bad. Monsoons are ahead of expectations. If we have a good monsoon and rural markets are strong, that’s a good place to start the recovery, and then the space to watch is the auto sector. Things are better than we thought three or four weeks back. That’s why we feel there’s a need for stimulus just to make sure that we don’t slip. Do you see stagnant consumption to be a challenge?It is important for us to work through the companies, through industries to make sure that jobs are created, jobs are protected as much as possible. Second, how do we ensure vaccination happens? If you have a Covid 3.0, you can’t take too many of these kinds of disruptions every few months because that will derail the whole growth aspiration or agenda totally. Then you can’t do anything about jobs or anything about everything else. Vaccination is step one. Step two is that we protect livelihoods as much as we protect lives. We need to focus on parts of the economy which are more stressed so that job losses are minimised in those areas and hence consumption is back. The other thing is can we have some temporary reduction in GST for consumer products for the next six months. Which is not a permanent change, but more to kind of help people manage their expenditures better if they spend more on medical kind of expenses, at least that they don’t feel the pinch so much. And for the rural economy: How can we increase the allocation for the MGNREGA scheme and make sure the money is spent productively? Do you see the second wave’s impact and now the tussle with big tech companies hurting India’s image as an investment destination?Everyone has gone through the pandemic, dealt with it differently, different impact. If we get vaccination back on track very quickly, I hope we can get back some of the confidence that the world had in us, which will come back once we get the economy back and the vaccination on track. The other aspect on the social media tussle with the government — this is happening across the world. Australia has had an issue, Europe is always having issues, there are different dimensions to it, which are getting played out. These are loosely regulated space and, as regulations come up, there will be issues, there will be conversations, and hopefully we will find the right balance. India is not unique in what is happening with social media companies. You can argue the finer points of the debate but at a very fundamental level, the fact regulations will evolve to deal with these challenges — which are new challenges — is inevitable. What CII can do is to work with the government, with industry, to make sure the regulatory environment transitions very smoothly into what is appropriate because many of these rules are also not factored in. You look at the 15% minimum corporate tax that has been proposed. The tax laws were framed for physical supply chains and not for these kinds of supply chains or for corporates to be positioned anywhere. So, as the world changes, regulations also have to change to be contextually appropriate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/social-media-issue-not-unique-to-india/articleshow/83698661.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Business||Government set to raise funding for exports scheme, clear dues||NEW DELHI: After months of dilly-dallying, the Centre is set to clear the pending dues of exporters. The allocation under Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products (RoDTEP) scheme, that was put in place, is being enhanced to Rs 17,000 crore for the current financial year, against Rs 13,000 crore provided earlier. In addition, Rs 2,000 crore is being provided to clear the arrears of services exporters for 2019-20 under the now-defunct Service Exports from India Scheme (SEIS). The finance ministry had hoped to save a large amount of funds due to reworking the export promotion schemes. It had also re-deployed large parts to the production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes, which will entail an allocation of close to Rs 2 lakh crore over five years. The move follows extensive consultation between the finance and commerce ministries, with the entire mechanism being finalised at the highest level. Proposals for the Cabinet have also been moved and a decision is expected too, official sources told TOI. The twin moves will offer much-needed relief to exporters, especially those in the services space, who have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Even for goods exporters, refund of levies has not come through, despite the government announcing the new scheme RoDTEP from April to ensure that goods shipped from India do not become uncompetitive due to state and central levies. In the absence of payments, exporters have been forced to borrow or dip into their already depleted reserves to meet capital requirements, which has added to their costs. While the finance ministry was not seeing anything wrong with the steps it had taken in the Budget, the entire problem was due to lower allocation made by it. Due to lower budget, the scheme was getting restricted to only a few segments. The enhancement of the allocation will now enable the commerce and revenue departments to refund duties paid by all exporters. “The coverage of RoDTEP will be available to all the 11,000 tariff lines for which rates will be notified,” said an officer. A mechanism is also being proposed for units in special economic zones (SEZs), with the details to be worked out in the coming months. A panel comprising experts as well as industry representatives will look into the mechanism. There is, however, no clarity yet on some of the dues from the erstwhile Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) that was abandoned as the US dragged India to the WTO, arguing that it was not compliant with global rules. In fact, several other schemes have been wound up too, making RoDTEP the primary tool, with the focus now shrinking to refunding levies, instead of providing incentives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-set-to-raise-funding-for-exports-scheme-clear-dues/articleshow/83698728.cms||Sidhartha

Her shoulders kept drooping lower as work from home became a routine, leading to neck and back pain. Soon, Ridhi realised she would have to make yoga part of daily regimen to stay fit, besides controlling pandemic driven anxiety. A similar situation is being faced by several people in the city, and may of have have found solace and relief in yoga. “Many people realised they were leading a sedentary life and the WFH setup affected their posture. Back problems, neck cramps and general spinal posture have become a knotted issue,” said yoga instructor Ekagrta Gupta on the eve of the International Yoga Day. “Not just working adults, but several children also joined the online session during the pandemic. Parents realised that their kids’ time in front of the screen was causing botched up postures, aches and pains. Not many people know but a good posture helps in better breathing, blood circulation, energy levels, digestion, more productivity and less fatigue,” she added. Ten years in the business of being a yoga instructor, Shesh Shukla, also saw a 100% increase in people inquiring about his yoga classes during the pandemic. “Majority of these queries and people joining the classes were those who had swelling in their shoulder nerves and collar bones because of excessive work on the computer. Since there was no outdoor activity, the work stress had increased on their bodies,” he said. “Before Covid-19 struck, we used to get an average of two online queries but now these are five to six in a day. All of the corporate webinars organised during the pandemic were also about bad postures and how yoga could help in rectifying it, breathing through anxiety and wholistic relaxation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/denizens-adopt-yoga-for-physical-mental-well-being/articleshow/83700777.cms||---

Dr Nigam Prakash Narain, former head of paediatrics department at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), said the prediction of early arrival of third wave was based on irresponsible behaviour of the citizens after easing of restrictions. “People have stopped following Covid safety protocols, thereby inviting third wave of pandemic. In the first Covid wave, the percentage of children getting affected in the country was nearly 3.8% and the figure rose to 12% in the second wave. It is expected that children will be affected more in the third wave. However, the severity of the third wave will not be fierce as maximum people would develop immunity against the disease by then,” Dr Narain said. All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) has already set up a 60-bed Covid ward in paediatric department for the children aged between one and 17 years. A 20-bed PICU (paediatric intensive care unit) and a 10-bed paediatric surgery unit have also been prepared. Also, 10 NICU (newborn intensive care unit) beds have been readied. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal incharge for Covid-19 at AIIMS-P, said the hospital would increase the number of beds if required. IGIMS-Patna has prepared itself for the expected third wave of the pandemic by setting up a 40-bed Covid ward in the paediatric department. “We are prepared to save lives of children. The hospital has a 40-bed ward for kids equipped with six ventilators. An eight-bed PICU and a four-bed NICU have also been set up,” the hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said. Acharya Kishore Kunal, secretary of Mahavir Mandir Trust, said a 60-bed Covid ward for Kidas would be created at the Mahavir Vatsalya Aspatal soon. “We are developing a separate floor for the Covid ward for kids with all the facilities. It will be ready by August,” he said. At NMCH-Patna, a 36-bed Covid ward has been set up in the newly constructed Mother-Child Hospital building. The hospital also has a 50-bed ICU facility for Covid patients, including NICU and PICU. Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, nodal officer for Covid-19 at NMCH-P, said the hospital has made all preparations for the third wave. “The hospital’s own liquid oxygen plant of 3,000 cubic litre per day capacity would be ready in next 14-15 days,” he said. The state health department had recently asked the Bihar Medical Services and Infrastructure Corporation Limited to make quick supply of equipment required for NICU, PICU and SNCU (sick newborn care unit) at various medical college and hospitals and sadar hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hospitals-ready-beds-for-kids-as-experts-predict-3rd-covid-wave/articleshow/83696262.cms||Faryal Rumi

Justice N Nagaresh considered a petition (WP-C No. 10960/2021) filed by Nighil Abraham of Kannur through advocate I Dinesh Menon. The petitioner had bought the SUV from a used-car dealer in New Delhi. An application was then filed by the petitioner to the joint regional transport officer of Thalassery for a fresh registration and tax for two years was also paid. NOC obtained from the registering authority in New Delhi was also produced. However, MVD officials informed him that a fresh registration cannot be issued for the vehicle as it was registered to the assistant director of IB and as no auction was allegedly held. Though the petitioner approached the registration authority in New Delhi, they said the vehicle has been deleted from the list of vehicles as NOC has been issued. The court said the MVD cannot take the stand that fresh registration cannot be given after the petitioner has filed all the required documents and has paid the tax. It is a genuine grievance, the court said while directing MVD to consider the petitioner’s representation and take an appropriate decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-comes-to-aid-of-man-as-mvd-denies-ib-vehicle-registration/articleshow/83698039.cms||---

The city registered vaccination of 13,191 beneficiaries while 3,166 took the jab in rural on Sunday. With the civic body allowing vaccination of 30-44 age group at two drive-in centres, 365 beneficiaries took the jab on Sunday — 184 at Glocal Square mall and 181 at VR Mall. Vaccination dropped below 50 per day at these two centres before roll out vaccine for 30-plus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sputnik-jab-here-citizens-may-have-to-wait-8-10-days/articleshow/83699878.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Goa||Goa: Weeks into monsoon, dams cross 50% mark||PANAJI: In less than a month of the monsoon’s arrival in Goa, the state has received abundant rainfall and this has led to the reservoirs filling up to 50% or more of its capacity within three weeks. The Selaulim reservoir has seen its water levels surge by close to 20% over the last couple of weeks, with the dam now filled to 51% of its capacity. Selaulim supplies raw water for treatment to meet drinking water needs in most of South Goa. Chapoli reservoir, which supplies raw water to Canacona taluka, is filled to 57% of its capacity. Two other minor reservoirs in South Goa at Gaunem and Panchwadi have seen their water levels rise to 59% and 46%, respectively. In Bicholim, the Amthane reservoir is nearing almost full capacity with levels rising to 88%. The reservoir caters to water requirements of parts of Bardez and Bicholim talukas. In the case of Amthane, water levels had already gone up due to water being pumped from the rivers into the reservoir to be able to meet drinking water needs in the summer. Usually, the reservoirs in Goa see their water levels rise significantly only during the fag end of June or well into the month of July. But the state has received heavy rainfall from the first week of the monsoon’s arrival this year. In Goa, the Anjunem reservoir in Sattari is the only one which is yet to see it being replenished. Water levels at the dam stand at 19%, up by only 6% since the levels recorded at the end of the summer season. This is also due to the large capacity of the reservoir. Across the border, the Tillari reservoir in Dodamarg, which provides water to both Goa and Maharashtra, has seen its water level go upto 63%. But even during the peak of summer this year, the water levels in Tillari still stood around 60%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/weeks-into-monsoon-dams-cross-50-mark/articleshow/83699918.cms||---

Located within the sprawling Kerala Police Academy campus, the facility is the first of its kind in Asia, according to senior police officials. The cemetery has been built near the retirement and rehabilitation centre “Vishranthi” at the academy. The construction of this facility is part of Kerala Police’s vision to have a serene, peaceful, and dignified space for burial ceremonies and memory of “dog officers” who died serving the people of Kerala through the K-9 squad. There are ten tombs at the cemetery to enable multiple burials in the same pit, on a rotation basis. The tombs are arranged in a circular fashion and a table has been built in the middle for placing the dead body during the funeral ceremony. Each tomb is covered with granite slabs, and there is a board made of teak wood for engraving the names of the resting dogs and a cypress tree has been planted at the head of each tomb. The facility has been constructed in a ten-cents plot, and the project cost was Rs 10 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-dogs-can-rip-at-thrissur-facility/articleshow/83698135.cms||---

After yet another hike on Sunday, the price of the fuel in Amravati had touched Rs 97 a litre and was nearing a century mark, officials from oil marketing companies said. The price of petrol in the state has already crossed Rs 100 in all cities/towns/districts, with the price at Parbhani being the highest at Rs 105.70 a litre on Sunday. Petrol price in Mumbai escalated to a new all time high of Rs 103.36 per litre while revised rate of diesel was Rs 95.44 at the city pumps. Transporters said they were pushed to the wall. They will observe a one day protest on diesel hike across the country on June 28. “An urgent meeting was convened a couple of days back on theissue of continual surge in diesel prices and the government’s apathy to the plight of transport fraternity which is struggling for survival and sustenance,” said a senior transporter. A memorandum will soon be submitted to the PM, the transporter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/after-petrol-now-diesel-at-almost-rs-100-in-maharashtra-state/articleshow/83701892.cms||Somit Sen

The firm, which won the bid, is yet to undertake the work as clearance from the health department, the owner of the project, is pending. According to Inkel officials, they had got an informal approval from the government more than a month ago. “Now, we are waiting for a formal reply. If we award the contract without a formal approval, it may lead to controversies later. The contractor which won the bid is a Rajasthan-based firm and it is already carrying out certain works in Kerala. That too in the health sector. So, the firm will be able to start the work immediately once the work is awarded,” sources associated with the project said. “The firm should complete all the works within two years of starting it,” sources said. The work on the structure of the CCRC should have been completed by August 2020. But the work has registered a progress of just around 40% so far. Despite the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) providing adequate funds for the work, it continued to lag behind schedule without any justifiable reason. So, the contractor was terminated a months ago. Now, the new contractor is to carry out the civil works on the structure, which had been doing by the terminated contractor. The new firm should also do the MEP works. It is on the 10 acres in the medical college campus that the CCRC structure is coming up. The procurement of medical equipment required for the CCRC has been entrusted with Kerala Medical Services Corporation Ltd (KMSCL). Many of the machinery are to be imported. Given the pandemic situation, it may take quite some time to procure it. KMSCL is making procurement of medicines and other equipment required for Covid control. So, chances are high for delay in procuring the medical equipment to be imported from other countries. Similarly, Covid situation and subsequent restrictions in countries from where the equipment is to be imported puts a question mark on when it would be shipped. Meanwhile, a team from KIIFB visited the CCRC work site on Sunday. CCRC, which now functions from a building in Ernakulam Government Medical College premises, remains headless. Dr Moni Kuriakose, who had been the director of CCRC, had resigned a couple of months ago. The government is yet to appoint a new head for the CCRC. District collector S Suhas, the special officer of the CCRC, is busy with Covid control measures and other assignments. So, the operations of the CCRC, which now temporarily functions from the medical college building, as well as the work on the new structure lack proper monitoring.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/inkel-yet-to-award-work-for-constructing-ccrc-building/articleshow/83698183.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

As many as 859 residents of Bicholi and 1,020 Rasuplura have received the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. AK Singh, Fatehabad community health centre in charge, said, “All those above 18 years of age have received the first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine. Spot registration was done at special camps organized for vaccination at both villages.” The chief development officer’s offer to grant an additional Rs 30 lakh developmental works to those villages that achieved 100% vaccination also spurred Bicholi village head Guddi Devi to take on the vaccination drive in earnest. “I conducted a meeting with village elders and set a target for 100% vaccination. And, we have achieved the target.” Rasulpura village head Manju Devi’s support to health department teams pitching for vaccination helped. “People were having difficulty in online registration for vaccination. To sort out the problem, three special camps were organized at the village. Spot registrations were conducted and all the people above 18 years of age were covered under the vaccination drive.” Meanwhile, the health department has set a target of vaccinating 21,000 people every day from Monday onwards. Of the 45 lakh population of Agra district, 6.30 lakh people in urban areas and 2.80 lakh in rural areas have been vaccinated, officials claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/two-agra-villages-achieve-100-covid-19-jab-1/articleshow/83696069.cms||---

Care Chellanam, an initiative of the Kerala Region Latin Catholic Council, has submitted suggestions to the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (Kufos), which is entrusted with conducting a study report for the Model Fishing Village project. The proposal submitted by the association talks about eight sectors coastal conservation, sustainable housing, employment opportunities, education, health, infrastructure development, tourism and culture. In the five-page document, the residents have made some suggestions regarding each sector. “Kufos officials have interacted with us regarding the project and sought our suggestions. We told them that prime importance must be given to protect the coast and a permanent solution to the sea erosion that is destroying our houses. Without ensuring a solution to the sea erosion, all other developments projects will be unsuccessful,” said Fr John Kandathil Parambil, coordinator of Care Chellanam and vicar of Velankanni Church, Chellanam. Kufos has been seeking opinion from the public regarding the Model Fishing Village project. By June-end, a report is expected to be submitted based on which the government will decide on how to implement the project. Kufos vice-chancellor Riji John said that due to the pandemic, the collection of suggestion is done online. “The construction activities like seawall have to be done by specified agencies of the government. We are preparing a study report based on the memorandums and suggestions from people of various sectors in Chellanam,” John said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/care-chellanam-submits-memorandum-to-kufos/articleshow/83698215.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Vedic learning helps brain development, boosts functioning of lungs: Study||LUCKNOW: Vedic education, which involves reciting and memorising Vedic hymns and mantras in Sanskrit, in certain ways aids brain development, according to a study undertaken by researchers at the Centre of Biomedical Research (CBMR), Lucknow. Published in the recent issue of ‘Scientific Report’ (a journal of the ‘Nature’ series), the study noted that Vedic learning led to improved sensory function, better brain plasticity, learning and memory skills, besides improving respiratory function. “The powers of Vedic education lies in the techniques used to enable a scholar recite and memorise Vedic text in a certain characteristic way (in which words and syllables are not altered). To master the language and text, the scholar needs extraordinary memory, powerful control on breathing and proper alignment of motor articulation. When the elements fall in sync over the years, the magic is created. In the process, the scholar’s brain develops in unusual ways besides strengthening lungs,” explained Uttam Kumar, the principal author who led the study. The researchers, also including Anshita Singh and Prakash Padakannya from Christ University, Bengaluru, pointed out that in the long-term Vedic course, the commonly used methods include Vedic recitation through techniques like Pada Paath (in which the sentence is broken down into words instead of stringing them together), Krama Paath (which involves pairing the words successively and sequentially such as the first word to the second, and so on) and Jata Paatha (first and second words are first recited together and then recited in reverse order and then again in original order). Brain plasticity or neuroplasticity is the key to brain development. According to scientific journal, Neural Plasticity, brain plasticity is the ability of the neural networks in the brain to change through growth, re-organisation, practice and experience. Structural plasticity is the ability to eliminate redundant pathways and build new ones among neurons through learning. This characteristic is often associated with individual’s ability to adapt to changes and even overcome diseases and problems. The assessments also indicated that trained Vedic scholars have better immediate recall memory skills and more grey and white matter in multiple brain regions. Grey matter is vital for processing information in the brain while white matter is essential for making effective connection with multiple brain regions. The study also identified changes in surface morphology and cortical thickness in crucial brain regions. These changes in multiple regions of the brain clearly indicate the gross structural plasticity changes that is directly linked to Vedic learning. Researchers studied brain activity of 25 Vedic scholars with the Brain Analysis Technique magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and compared them with the same number of non-Vedic scholars who could read Sanskrit. In the assessment, structure of the brain and their function were observed. Three inter-related but distinct computational analysis techniques were used to understand brain plasticity phenomena such as brain’s grey and white matter measurement, brain thickness measurement and assessing changes in brain surface morphology. Director, CBMR, Prof Alok Dhawan said: “The study establishes the edge of structured learning which is being challenged by many societies. However, the work has proven that Vedic learning pedagogy impacts brain and lung health against systems and methods which exert stress on children. With Sanskrit being in demand in the world of computers, it may not be a bad idea for parents to encourage their children to learn it.” Faculty at Central Sanskrit University, Lucknow, Prof Madan Mohan Pathak said, “We believe that Vedas are the starting point of all knowledge running this world. But there is no dearth of people who question the power of Vedic learning. The work offers a befitting reply to such ignorant minds. Vedic hymns were recited by gods for the benefit of human race.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vedic-learning-helps-brain-devptboosts-functioning-of-lungs-study/articleshow/83700933.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Massive fire tears through bank at Halwasiya building||LUCKNOW: Sparks from a power interface triggered a massive fire on the ground floor of Punjab National Bank’s main audit branch in Halwasiya building, Hazratganj, forcing a swift evacuation of families trapped in the rear portion of the building on Sunday evening. Three firemen suffered severe burns during the rescue mission, which witnessed 12 fire tenders battling the mammoth blaze. Two floors of the three-storeyed building are with the bank, which was closed on the weekend and this proved to be a saving grace during the evacuation exercise. However, the building’s matchbox-like contours with no fire exits proved to be a nightmare for firemen amidst the leaping flames and billowing smoke. Around 4.15 pm, some passers-by spotted the fire and send an SOS to police and fire department even as panic spread in the upscale Hazratganj area bringing traffic to a grinding halt. SHO, Hazratganj, Shyam Babu Shukla who was the first to reach the spot, said the fire broke out at the ground floor of the bank and later engulfed the first floor with the smoke spreading through the building. The police officer immediately sought reinforcements and began rescuing families stuck at the rear half of building after cordoning off the area. Chief fire officer, Lucknow, Vijay Kumar Singh, said, “Prima facie it appears that an overheated UPS blew up triggering a short-circuit that escalated into a fire. It took over an hour to douse the flames and the ground floor of the bank was wrecked. There were no casualties, but with no ventilation and fire exits, firemen used oxygen tank kits and smashed window panes to gain entry,” said the officer. Senior bank officials, including circle head of Punjab National Bank, A H Kinder, rushed to the spot. Kinder told TOI he has ordered an inquiry and losses were being estimated. He said, the customer area of the ground floor was damaged, but files and cash were intact. Two of the seven residents evacuated from the building, Hari Om and Pooja, thanked police for the swift operation. “I was not aware about the fire and was watching the cricket match. Suddenly, police and firemen rushed in and took me out safely,” he said. The building’s fire safety arrangements are under investigation as it did not have a fire exit. The alarm was functional only in ATM kiosks on the ground floor. The chief fire officer said, they would also check when a fire audit of the building was last conducted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/massive-fire-at-pnb-bank-branch-at-halwasiya-building/articleshow/83700742.cms||---

UP government spokesperson and cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh said how could one (Akhilesh Yadav) be so ignorant about the pro-farmer measures taken by the Yogi government over the past four years. Singh asked Akhilesh why he did not acknowledge the state government’s loan waiver of Rs 36,000 crore which has benefited about 86 lakh marginal farmers. He said it was during the SP regime that sugar mills were put on sale, while the Yogi government has revived several mills in the past four years. The minister said the UP government had also made a record payment of more than Rs 1.37 lakh crore to sugarcane farmers compared to total payment of Rs 95,000 crore during the previous regime. As far as wheat purchase is concerned, he said, the state government procured record over 55 lakh metric tons of wheat during the current rabi season. Singh said the SP chief should be ashamed of his false narrative and undermining the efforts of the present government towards doubling the income of the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-chief-ignorant-about-govts-pro-farmer-measures-bjp/articleshow/83700866.cms||---

Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, who is also the minister for secondary and higher education, said the students of UP Board Class 12 would be awarded marks on the evaluation formula of 50:40:10. “In the final result, 50% weightage will be given to marks scored by students in Class 10, 40% to the marks scored in Class 11 (half-yearly/annual examination) and 10% will be based on marks obtained in Class 12 (Pre-Board examination),” the deputy CM said. “For Class 10, the evaluation formula will be 50:50 – 50% weightage will be given to marks secured in Class 9 (half-yearly/annual examination) and the rest will be on the basis of marks secured in Class 10 Pre-Board examination,” he said. “The state government has decided to pass 29,94,312 candidates of high school and 26,10,316 students of intermediate without examinations. A committee was constituted under the chairmanship of the additional chief secretary, secondary education, Aradhana Shukla, to decide the formula for high school and intermediate board examination results. Suggestions were invited from the public before finalizing the formula,” the deputy chief minister said. He added that as many as 3,910 suggestions were received from various stakeholders like state legislators, educationists, parents, teachers, and others. “After considering the suggestions, the committee prepared the formula in the interest of students. To evaluate its students, the state government has used a different formula as compared to the Central Board of Secondary Education as the education system/process of the two boards is different. It was for the first time that Pre-Board examinations were held in UP Board while it is an old practice in case of CBSE Board,” he said. Total 56,04,628 candidates were registered in 2021. At least 29,94,312 candidates have registered in high school examination, out of which 29,74,487 (99.34%) are institutional and 19,825 (0.66%) are individual candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-board-announces-evaluation-formula-for-class-10-12-students/articleshow/83705630.cms||---

The development could potentially mark Sharma's entry into the BJP organisation as a key player ahead of UP assembly elections due next year. While the party kept the schedule of Santhosh and Singh under wraps, sources said that Sharma is expected to be present when the two top BJP leaders meet state leaders to discuss the road map to consolidate the party's position at present being targeted by a belligerent opposition in the wake of the pandemic and allegations of irregularities in the land deals for the proposed Ram temple complex in Ayodhya. On Sunday, senior UP BJP ranks, including state president Swatantra Dev Singh and general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal held a closed-door meeting with senior party functionaries, an apparent exercise to zero down on the issues which need to be taken up with the two senior BJP leaders. The meeting of Santhosh and Singh also comes days ahead of the Zila Panchayat (ZP) chairperson polls which have been touted as a semi-final electoral contest in the run-up to 2022 big poll battle. While the nomination process for ZP chairman is scheduled on June 26, polling will be held on July 3. Sources said that the issue of winning maximum possible ZP chairperson seats might also come up for discussion. The two senior leaders are expected to meet not only party state leaders but also CM Yogi Adityanath and his ministerial colleagues. The meeting, labelled as a politically strategic exercise of the saffron party, comes almost a fortnight after Santhosh and Singh met PM Modi and later BJP national president JP Nadda to provide them the feedback they gathered from the UP BJP ranks during their three-day stay in the state capital between May 31 and June 2. A senior UP BJP leader said that the two leaders are expected to convey the message of the top party leadership besides indicating the programmes which need to be taken for stepping up the party's electoral outreach. "There are certain issues which will be taken up by the party after detailed discussion with the senior leadership. We cannot disclose them at this point of time," a senior UP BJP leader told TOI. The saffron camp has been abuzz with a series of high level meetings which are ostensibly seen as a precursor exercise before the party rolls out its organisational machinery in the run up 2022 state elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bl-santhosh-radha-mohan-back-in-lucknow-today-for-review-meet/articleshow/83700838.cms||Pankaj Shah

A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi disposed of the public interest litigation filed by M Selva Kumar, a resident of Tuticorin district. The petitioner stated that on account of the lockdown, the folk artists in the state are unable to perform and are suffering financially. He stated that the government had announced financial assistance of Rs 1,000, but it was provided only to a few people. He sent a representation to the authorities seeking to distribute Rs 1,000 as financial assistance.

Witnesses are being examined in the ongoing trial before the Madurai first additional district court. Though Madras high court had on March 18 directed to complete it in six months following a petition filed by Jeyaraj’s wife Selvarani, the case hearing was adjourned in the last two occasions and has been posted for July 2 now. It was late in the evening on June 19 last year that the duo was picked up by the Sathankulam police from Beniks’ mobile phone shop. They were brutally assaulted by the police at the station that night and lodged in the Kovilpatti sub jail the next day. Beniks succumbed to injuries on June 22 while his father died the next morning. Ten policemen of the Sathankulam station — inspector Sridhar, SIs Balakrishnan, Raghu Ganesh, head constables S Murugan, A Samadurai and constables M Muthuraja, S Chelladurai, X Thomas Francis, S Vailmuthu and SSI Paldurai were arrested following the incident. All the accused are lodged at the Madurai central prison. Since SSI Paldurai died due to Covid-19, CBI which had completed investigations filed the final report against nine policemen before the Madurai CJM court on September 25, 2020. The Madurai CJM court had committed the case to the principal district court at Madurai for trial. Subsequently, the trial was transferred to the first additional district court. The trial commenced in December last year and framing of charges has been completed. Subsequently, the court had proceeded with the examination of witnesses. On March 10, the court said that on perusal of records the accused have been charged under Section 120B of IPC. However, there was no material available to frame charge under this section as the criminal conspiracy should have taken place prior to taking the deceased duo from their shop. Charges were framed under IPC Section 342 (2 counts) against A1 to A9, Section 201 against A1 to A7 and A9, Section 182 against A4, 193 against A3, Section 211 and 218 against A3 and A4, Section 302 (murder) r/w 34 (2 counts) of IPC against A1 to A7 and A9 and Section 302 r/w 109 of IPC against A8 were framed, read over and explained to the nine accused.

The HC will hear the case on July 2. A division bench of Justice I P Mukerji and Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya in their order on Friday said that “keeping in view the situation created by the Covid-19 pandemic, no school or other institution in this state should remove any student from its rolls on the ground of non or short payment of fees without the leave of this court till 31st July or until further orders, whichever is earlier.” The fresh HC directions came after the division bench on June 4 started hearing a PIL which urged the HC’s October 2020 order asking schools to charge 80% of fees to be implemented again in the 2021-22 because schools have not started physical classes. On October 13, 2020, a HC division bench of which justice Bhattacharya was a member, had passed an order that there will be no increase in the school fees during the financial year 2020-21 and that “from the month beginning April 2020 till the month following the one in which the schools reopen in the physical mode” all the 145 schools (who were involved in the case) would “offer a minimum 20 per cent reduction of the fees across the board”.

Congress national spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said, BJP leaders were trying to “sell” the religion “astha” (faith) and “vishwas” (confidence) of the people. “The 1250% increase in prices of land in 79 days was nothing short of a ‘hera-pheri’ (irregularities) and a ‘mahapaap’ (sin),” he said, specifically mentioning the deal between the temple Trust and one Deep Narayan. Surjewala claimed Deep Narayan was a BJP functionary in the party’s IT cell and a relative of Ayodhya mayor Hrishikesh Upadhyay. The case involves 890 sqmt of land, which Surjewala said, was sold by Narayan to the trust for Rs 2.5 crore after buying it for Rs 20,000, three months ago. He said, BJP leaders were involved in “usurping” donations collected from scores of Ram Bhakts. “The loot in the name of Lord Ram is Ramdroh,” he said. The Congress spokesperson said, instances of shady land deals for construction of the temple were a pointer to “dacoity” orchestrated with the support of those in power. The Congress leader also cited a deal where land worth Rs 2 crore was allegedly purchased by Trust at a cost of Rs 18.5 crore. He said, trust member Anil Mishra and Upadhyay were witnesses in the sale deed. As a matter of fact, the allegation was vehemently countered by the trust with its general secretary Champat Rai maintaining that land was purchased at a price which was below the market rate. Rai had said, those levelling allegations never contacted the Trust for details. He also appealed to the people not to get misguided by rumours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-engineering-loot-of-ram-temple-donations-through-illegal-land-deals-surjewala/articleshow/83700951.cms||---

Party sources said that the meet is expected to be organised virtually and addressed by BJP national president JP Nadda and other senior party leaders. While a formal plan of the meeting is yet to be made public, sources said that the party the brass plans to hold the meeting later this month. The meeting is proposed to churn out political resolutions and campaigns that would lay the party’s blueprint of strategy to consolidate its position. The last state executive was organised on March 15 in Lucknow, just ahead of the panchayat elections which saw BJP announcing its supported candidates, a move that had triggered a political frenzy in the opposition camp. The meet was addressed by Union defence minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh and CM Yogi Adityanath. Before that, UP BJP state executive was held in Meerut in August 2018 during the tenure of the then state president and Chandauli MP Mahendra Nath Pandey. This had also attained much political relevance in the wake of the 2019 Lok sabha elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-bjp-to-hold-state-executive-meet-soon-to-draft-poll-plan/articleshow/83701021.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh TMC to follow West Bengal model||LUCKNOW: The Trinamool Congress will be a cadre-based (karyakarta pradhan) party in UP, similar to what it is in West Bengal. The UP unit of the TMC is building itself from scratch and in doing so it is imitating the West Bengal model where it won the third straight term this May. The three-member central committee of the TMC is overseeing the party’s strategy for UP as it tries to add more members in the state ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. The UP TMC on May 24 launched the membership drive as a first step towards raising the structure of the party. Party’s president in UP Neeraj Rai said, “We met the new members we made in some of the districts in the last two days and what we have given them as the first responsibility for the party is to tour the state and add more members at the ground level. Once they give us a proper list of the members we will get the list verified. It’s essential we check the intention and background of people before we take them into the party’s fold.” The membership drive was first launched in Lakhimpur Kheri. By now, districts like Prayagraj, Unnao, Barabanki, Mirzapur, Banda, Hamirpur and Mahoba have brought in new members, but the state unit, as a safe bet, would verify each of them before going public with their names. The `karyakartas’ from BSP and BJP might be showing more interest in joining the TMC in the state. Though the TMC has been active in UP since 2005 the party’s organization got a rejig after it became a national party in 2016-17. This time, the party is harbouring an ambition to contest on maximum seats as an individual party and not as an alliance partner, like it did in the past by extending support to the bigger players of the UP politics. The state unit of the party has set for itself three key roles at present -- finding new members, strengthening its existing structure in districts and figuring out issues that will become the party’s poll plank. The party would be more active in rural UP, again drawing a leaf from West Bengal where the TMC has a strong presence in rural areas. The UP unit of the TMC would harp on setting up agriculture-based small-scale industries in villages to generate employment. The welfare schemes running in West Bengal would be talked about in UP also. The TMC in UP is also deliberating on what would be the issues that it would base its election campaign on. Lack of employment is the first that the party organization has agreed upon. The issues would be assessed for every constituency. The party has formed over 63 district units already.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-tmc-to-follow-w-bengal-model/articleshow/83700999.cms||Neha Shukla

Subash Chandrabose, 77, a siddha practitioner, lives in a dilapidated house along with his wife Seethalakshmi, 66, in Kuchapatti, a hamlet in Tiruchuzhli panchayat union. Villages with few inhabitants are not new to Virudhunagar due to its drought-prone living conditions. Their hamlet is seven to eight kms away from the nearest town Tiruchuzhi, and about four kilometres away from the nearest villages of Kuchampatti Pudur and Udayanendhal. Chandrabose earns a living treating snake bites and other ailments for which around ten people visit him a week. People from other villages would also come during the local temple festival but leave immediately. Otherwise, the couple are left to the company of several ghostly houses and pitch darkness when night falls. Their damaged house indeed has electricity and he has a mobile phone to reach out for help. Chandrabose says he belongs to a family of zamindars who ruled the region long ago. ``We were a very affluent family, but some curse befell us and today there is nothing to show of it,’’ he says. The couple have three children, a son and two daughters, who lead their independent lives and are not in touch with them. The septuagenarian travels to the neighbouring villages on his two-wheeler to buy groceries. On coming to know about the couple through social media and officials, district collector J Meganatha Reddy visited the village on Saturday and handed over an order for a Rs 2.47 lakh green house which will be constructed on their patta land, in four months. The collector said it was on chief minister M K Stalin’s direction, that the welfare of all sections of the society should be given attention, that the house is being constructed under the solar powered green house scheme. The couple showed the collector their rare medicines,including ‘navabashana’ tablets. They expressed gratitude at the gesture as they had been worrying about the condition of their house. Meganatha Reddy told TOI that he had asked officials to do the ground work on coming to know about the couple. ``I visited them and asked them why they had not left the village like the other people, but they told me that they wanted to live here till their last,”' he said. The collector told them that he will participate in the house warming ceremony in four months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/lonely-couple-to-get-green-house-in-deserted-village/articleshow/83700000.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Medicinal farming a boon to farmers of Bundelkhand||LUCKNOW: The state government on Sunday said that the policy to promote cultivation of medicinal plants was helping in the improvement of the farmers’ condition. A state government spokesperson said that farmers belonging to Bundelkhand are especially taking to cultivation of medicinal plants both for monetary gains as well as health benefits. The farmers are showing a keen interest in growing basil, aloe vera, ashwagandha, brahmi, satavar, vach, artemisia, kaunch, kalmegh and sarpagandha. He said that the state government has been encouraging farmers to diversify crop for cultivation in order to enhance their incomes. “Today, many farmers in UP are cultivating a variety of crops and making more money than they used to in the past,” he said. The scheme, which has been operational since 2009-10, started benefiting farmers when the Yogi government involved state AYUSH Society to promote the concept. To encourage farmers to opt for medicinal farming, the government also announced a grant per hectare for them. As a result, the number of farmers who take up medicinal farming directly and indirectly has increased significantly during the present regime as compared to the previous governments. More than 15,000 farmers have, so far, benefited from this initiative of the state government while cultivation of medicinal plants has expanded to 9,705 hectares in the state. The demand for medicinal crops has also increased substantially amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/medicinal-farming-a-boon-for-farmers/articleshow/83700905.cms||---

They had extracted her liver and lungs as part of a ‘tantrik’ (occult) ritual on Diwali. The childless couple had indulged in the macabre crime so that they could have children. District magistrate, Kanpur Nagar, Alok Tiwari said, "We have slapped the National Security Act against the four accused, including Parshuram and his wife Sunaina with regard to the case." A youth and his accomplice hacked to death the seven-year-old girl of their neighbour in Kanpur’s Ghatampur police area in November 2020, extracted her liver and lungs and presented them to his uncle and aunt to be eaten as part of a ‘tantrik’ (occult) ritual on Diwali so that the childless couple could have children. Police had arrested all the four accused as several vital organs, including lungs and liver of the child were missing. Her family members had alleged that the murder could be the fallout of an occult practice. After the arrest and interrogation of the two youths, the police initially claimed that the girl had been killed by the duo for resisting their attempt to outrage her modesty. However, during sustained grilling, the youth—Ankul--broke down and confessed to have killed the girl along with his friend Veeran as part of a human sacrifice ritual after being asked by his childless uncle Parshuram and aunt Sunaina. Talking to TOI police said, “Ankul confessed that he had killed the girl with the help of his friend in an inebriated state. He also alleged that his uncle and aunt gave them Rs 1,000 and asked them to abduct and perform the sacrifice of their neighbour’s seven-year-old daughter and bring her vital organs on Diwali night as they believed it was an auspicious time”. The human sacrifice was supposed to solve their problem of childlessness even 21 years after their marriage, the police added. Locals alleged that Parshuram used to approach ‘tantriks’ and astrologers for the past few years so that his wife could get conceived.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/nsa-invoked-against-four-for-killing-7-year-old-girl-as-part-of-occult-ritual/articleshow/83697091.cms||---

---||Kochi||Cost escalation: Problems mount for parking facilities||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The errors in estimates prepared by consultancy agency Kitco, which forced the city corporation to source additional funds for multi-level car parking (MLCP) facilities, have added to the woes surrounding the MLCP facility at the civic body’s main office as well. The state high-powered steering committee had approved the tender bids for MLCPs at the corporation’s main office and at Putharikandom at a tender excess of Rs 75 lakh. The project involves setting up of a semi-automated MLCP system using puzzle parking technology, internal and external electrical installations, fire alarm, fire fighting system with sump and landscaping and allied works. Already, lack of a revenue model plagues the project. The monthly maintenance cost is slotted at Rs 3 lakh. Expenses for power, labour and other aspects are also anticipated for which budgeting has to be done. The detailed project report has projected four times occupancy on a daily basis. The facility can accommodate 102 cars at a time and it is estimated that around 400 cars could be parked in the facility daily. The corporation officials have pointed out that even if the facility can be perceived as a kind of service, the cost based sustainability will be a key factor in the long run. The suggestion of free parking for corporation staff had earlier led to a debate. The officials had pitched a third party lease model so that the entire financial responsibility and maintenance can be shifted to the party that wins the lease. However, the proposal has not even been discussed. It is not the first time, corporation picked on Kitco for wrong estimates. In 2017, the city corporation, in an unprecedented move had pulled up the consulting agency regarding a proposal for upgradation of surface water drainage system in the city. In a presentation held at the corporation, Kitco officials faced the heat after Palayam Rajan, the then ward councillor, Nanthencode expressed doubts regarding the proposal and raised concerns whether it was prepared after conducting proper field visits. The development standing committee also took up the matter and pressed for random check of the proposal and estimate prepared by the agency. Former mayor V K Prasanth had directed the engineering wing to constitute a technical committee which would conduct parallel check on the proposal and the estimate. Kitco team countered the allegations and said field visits were done to back up the proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cost-escalation-problems-mount-for-parking-facilities/articleshow/83698258.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Kochi||Kerala: Bund across river results in waterlogging, says study||KOCHI: A temporary bund constructed across the backwaters for facilitating the work on Vallarpadam railway line obstructs the flow of water and causes waterlogging in places, including Kalamassery, Eloor, Aluva and Muppathadam, a study by the irrigation department has revealed. Industries minister P Rajeeve has given instructions to officials to take urgent measures to break the bund. The bund constructed in 2009 was not dismantled even after completion of the work on the railway line leading to the International Container Transhipment Terminal (ICTT) at Vallarpadam. It is near Vaduthala Don Bosco Kadavu, which is the confluence point of river Periyar and the backwaters, that the bund had been constructed. This caused sedimentation of silt and debris of the railway line and pillars along one kilometre. “It is a grave issue which should be addressed at the earliest. The reason behind the waterlogging had not been known for the past several years. Unlike in the case of other issues, nobody brought the issue to the notice of authorities. A few days ago, I got WhatsApp messages from two persons stating that a bund constructed for facilitating the work on the ICTT is still there in the backwaters and it obstructs the flow of water,” said Rajeeve. “Then, I gave instructions to officials to conduct a study immediately. Officials have submitted the preliminary report to me. They will be submitting the final report in a day or two. After going through the report, I will hold a meeting with district collector S Suhas. Then, we will convene a joint meeting of various agencies like DP World, the private firm which constructed the railway line, and Cochin Port Trust (CPT) will be convened somewhere in the next week for chalking out plans,” Rajeeve said. The sedimentation has also posed a threat for fishing in those areas. Of the 19 gaps between the 20 pillars of the ICTT railway line in the area, navigation is possible via two. Based on complaints filed by various agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including Social Welfare Action Society, Rajeeve had asked the officials to conduct a study to identify the real cause for waterlogging in the area. The removal of the bund will also help the dredging activities being carried out by the CPT, the study report states. It also recommends that the DP World, the firm which operates the ICTT, and the private firm which had undertaken the work on the railway line should be made part of the bund removal. The contractor of the railway line had agreed to dismantle the bund and remove the silt. For clearing the flow of water in the area, where the width of the backwater is 780m, around 15.6 lakh square metre silt will have to be removed. The silt had settled in the area in the past one decade. Another hurdle is identifying an area for storing the silt removed from the backwaters. The authorities are planning to hand pick one of the islands near the area for storing the silt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bund-across-river-results-in-waterlogging-study/articleshow/83698311.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Doctors: Curb numbers at events and marriages in Nagpur city for few more days||NAGPUR: While welcoming the district and civic administrations’ decision to extend shop timings till 8pm from Monday, doctors in the city want strict vigil on marriage ceremonies and curbs on crowding at public places to continue for some more days. From Monday, marriage halls and lawns would be allowed to have maximum 100 guests. Covid cases had started spiking from mid-February, ultimately leading to the devastating second wave. A lot of Covid patients had history of attending marriages held during January and February. Many of the Covid patients reported not only this year but also after the first wave in September 2020 had been guests at marriage ceremonies. According to doctors, the continued restrictions on marriage ceremonies at halls/lawns is one of the reasons the district has seen drastic fall in daily cases. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said one must avoid places of crowding where one has to remove the mask. “Unlocking is a good move as far as reviving economy is concerned but authorities need to keep a strict check on crowding and violations. The chain of transmission can gain pace anytime. There is lockdown in other places but people from there are visiting the district,” he said. Dr Ravindra Sarnaik , who is part of different Covid task force, advised people to still limit their outings as “epidemic is an ongoing process”. “The onus is on the community now. Regulation will be meaningless unless they are followed. It will be meaningful when people ensure no one in family is infected,” he said. Referring to previous violations, Dr Sarnaik said people bypassed norms by booking two adjacent marriage halls to invite more people. “In such cases, the guests from outside district too come and it becomes difficult to pick up asymptomatic carriers. Emotions are fine but the disease has to be taken seriously,” he said. Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA) secretary Dr Alok Umre suggested people to ensure their families and guests are vaccinated. “Planning must start at least a month in advance. If vaccination is planned, the risk will be minimized. Citizen must understand we don’t need new problems like the third wave. Unfortunately, Covid-apt behaviour has been forgotten too soon. It is a problematic disease and now we must understand this,” he said. “When Covid testing is compulsory for air passengers, why vaccination or testing can’t be made a must before attending functions?” said Dr Umre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/docs-curb-numbers-at-events-and-marriages-for-few-more-days/articleshow/83700048.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Chairman of the complex, VP Kamat said he first read the report in TOI following which he approached botanist Daniel D’Souza, who had initiated the revival of the fallen Copper Pod tree at 18 June road. “It was remarkable that they managed to revive such an old tree in Panaji. The complex residents discussed the matter and realised that it can be done with the neem tree as well. We then sought help from D’Souza and the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) to replant the fallen tree,” Kamat said. A resident, Abhishek R, said that the tree fell on Wednesday evening, but its roots were intact. “The following day, once the CCP arrived with a team of tree trimmers and a JCB vehicle, we replanted the tree by 11.30am,” he said. The fallen neem tree left the children’s play area damaged, denting the swings and slide. No casualties were reported due to the tree fall. This, however, was not the first incident of loss of green foliage at the complex. Last month, owing to the cyclonic storm Tauktae, four large trees, estimated to be about 15 years old, were uprooted in the complex. These were a tamarind tree, an Ashoka tree and two flower trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/uprooted-neem-tree-replanted-in-panaji-residential-complex/articleshow/83700204.cms||Nida Sayed

Kahar Molla, a resident of Picnic Garden, has been arrested and a case of attempt to murder has been registered. Both victims are residents of Barisha and work in the same factory. While Tuhin Kumar Dey (53) is the manager, Saswata Chakrabory (29) is a driver. They have been admitted to a private hospital near Ruby crossing. Dey has received injuries on his shoulder and left hand, and Chakraborty has severe injuries on his neck and is stated to be critical. Police said the case was registered on the basis of Dey’s statement. He said Molla got into an argument with them around 6.30pm and the attack took place 10 minutes later. “The accused repeatedly hit the victims with a round, sharp blade-like object, used for cutting cloth. He had fixed the blade with an iron rod,” said an officer. “Dey claimed Molla was unhappy with his wage. But Molla, during interrogation, said he was denied the right pay after putting in hours of work in the Covid times. He claimed he lost his cool after being denied multiple times. We will speak to other employees in this regard,” said the officer.

---||Nagpur||‘Careful unlock, fast vax drive can prevent third wave in Vidarbha’||NAGPUR: More than two weeks post unlock in most parts of Vidarbha, Covid-19 cases and deaths are going down daily. There have been many positives for Vidarbha in last two weeks. The test positivity rate has gone down significantly despite testing remaining high. The number of hospitalized patients has dropped drastically. Vaccination for 30-44 age group has already started in the region. Now, vaccination is also in full swing. A little care for two more weeks and Vidarbha is all set to skip the third wave, even in rural areas, said experts. “Epidemiologically, there are two reasons behind sudden drop in cases and deaths. First and foremost is virus has weakened. Secondly, our population is nearing herd immunity. We are not considering the second reason so far. But the virus has definitely weakened and it’s the best opportunity for us,” said epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte. According to him, the next three to four weeks are crucial and aggressive vaccination will ensure that a large population remains safe in future. “Vaccination is now available for everyone above 30 years. In next two weeks, the government is planning vaccines for 18+ too. Initial response is enthusiastic. It should continue,” said professor Sanjay Khadse, resident deputy collector of Akola. According to doctors, a careful unlock process is also must. “Public places like cinema halls, auditoriums and restaurants are now open with 50% capacity which is a good step. Open air events should be promoted. If cases stay under control for two more weeks, it will be win-win situation for Vidarbha,” said intensive care specialist Dr Sanjay Boraste. Conditions in rural Vidarbha are also improving. A senior member of Covid task force, who was not willing to be named, accepted that a large chunk of rural cases remained unreported. “The caseload in rural Vidarbha must be at least three times more than what it is officially. Villages are smaller clusters with low population density. Rural Vidarbha will be considerably safe if vaccination is ensured,” said the member. Real ‘positives’ - After 2 weeks, all 11 districts are in Level 1 of unlock - 50 lakh people already vaccinated, more to get jab from today - Average 30k tests conducted daily, less than 400 testing positive - Toll reduced to 7 on Saturday, 3 on Sunday - 7 districts having less than 500 active cases, 2 less than 100 - Cases/deaths from rural areas reduced significantly||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/careful-unlock-fast-vax-drive-can-prevent-third-wave-in-vid/articleshow/83700094.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Goa||Third Covid wave may hit Goa by August, cannot slack off: Expert panel||PANAJI: Even as the second wave of Covid-19 continues to ebb, members of the the state’s expert panel warned against slacking off ahead of the third wave, and said that if people abandon Covid-appropriate behaviour, it may hit the state earlier and harder no matter what preparation the government puts in. State epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said that cases may continue to drop through July and rise again in mid-August, peaking in September. His warning comes a day after AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria warned the nation that the third wave may hit in six to eight weeks if Covid-appropriate is not followed Doctors and experts also stressed on the need to get vaccinated at the earliest, as a vaccinated population would drastically reduce the number of severe cases and pressure on hospitals, as well as deaths. “If the state does what needs to be done, Goa will succeed in deferring the second wave. People should also act responsibly, because the government alone cannot beat the virus,” said a senior doctor who is part of the state’s expert committee. Another top doctor said that while nobody can predict the exact nature of the anticipated third wave, people’s complacency towards Covid-appropriate behaviour and enforcement agencies’ apathy in implementing measures can raise chances of hastening its onset. However, the senior doctor said that if a large segment of the population is vaccinated, the wave may not be as severe as the second. “There will be fewer severe cases and mortalities if more people are vaccinated, and fewer hospital admissions too,” he said. The expert said that even amid the uncertainty, the pandemic will not go away suddenly. “It will run its full course. It cannot be controlled by vaccination alone. Measures are a must to delay the onset of the next wave, and if it does occur, to flatten its curve,” he said. A doctor who has treated Covid-19 patients added that the strategy of the state should be to test, isolate and declare containment zones in areas having a positivity rate of over 5%, and even for those with a rate of less than 5%, reopening should be slow. “If all areas are opened together before the second wave touches the baseline, the third wave may start earlier,” he said. However, he said there is no saying for sure whether it will be milder or more dangerous than the second. “It all depends on the percentage of people who fall sick and if a new strain emerges,” a senior doctor said. “Onset and severity of the wave will depend on enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour, containment measures, and vaccination coverage.” If the strain is more virulent and infectious, like it happened with Delta in the second wave, it will overwhelm whatever preparedness has been done. The strains — alpha, beta and delta — that have already affected people cannot distress them again, he said, adding that alpha and beta were seen during the first wave and delta is dominant in the second wave. “A virus will always mutate,” a senior doctor said. “In some parts of the country, the delta+ strain has been detected, and it is said to be more infectious than the delta strain. Again, how much and how fast it will spread, nobody knows.” Meanwhile, Betodkar said that the government is vigorously preparing for the third wave. He said that although manpower and infrastructure requirements are being considered and preparations are underway, predicting the impact is difficult. “The task force has already accepted and commenced implementation of most of the recommendations of the expert committee,” a senior doctor and member of the expert committee said. The expert committee, under the chairpersonship of GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar, has met three times since last month, while the state task force committee headed by chief minister Pramod Sawant has had two meetings. An expert member said that bed requirement has been fulfilled — the South Goa district hospital and super-speciality block put together have over 1,000 Covid beds, including 200 ICU beds for the adult population, and the state machinery is now looking at making arrangements for the paediatric population. “The SGDH and super-speciality block, along with Covid care centres, are adequate to meet the peak of the next wave for general Covid-19 cases. It is better to be prepared by anticipating a worst-case scenario,” he said. “This time, the government is taking all possible measures to be ready.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/third-wave-may-hit-goa-by-aug-cannot-slack-off-expert-panel/articleshow/83700139.cms||Bindiya Chari

The children, hailing from Kunwarpur village, were grazing cattle near the river when the accident took place. Their families are yet to lodge a complaint with police. Sources said like every other day, cousins Altamash (11) and Ismail (11) along with their neighbour, Monis (7), had gone towards the river with their cattle. It had been raining the whole day and the large pit was filled to the brim, making the sand and mud around it very slippery. After the other children ran towards the village to seek help, villagers pulled out the bodies. They were taken to a hospital in neighbouring Chandausi town by their families but it was too late.Photo credit: Arvind Singh A few children playing nearby said Monis suddenly slipped into the water. As he started drowning, Altamash and Ismail tried to rescue Monis. But they, too, lost their balance in the slippery mud and fell into the water. None of the children knew how to swim and drowned. After the other children ran towards the village to seek help, villagers pulled out the bodies. They were taken to a hospital in neighbouring Chandausi town by their families but it was too late. Bachchu Singh, SHO of Islamnagar police station who was recently transferred from Bareilly, told TOI, “The pit is a few months old. No illegal mining activity has been reported here since I took charge. The level of water in the pit was more than normal because of incessant rainfall. All the three children belong to the families of marginal farmers. We had asked them to give the bodies for an autopsy but they refused and did not give any written complaint. After completing the formalities, we handed over the bodies to their families.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/3-kids-drown-in-deep-pit-dug-by-mining-mafia-in-budaun/articleshow/83696266.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh toddler wins 'lottery' gets Rs 16 crore drug medicine for free||MEERUT: When Ishani was a few months old, her parents noticed that something was amiss. The infant had weak muscle control and movements and several tests later, they found out why. Ishani was suffering from Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a rare genetic disorder caused by loss of nerve cells in the spinal cord. “She was just 14 months old when we were told she has SMA. She had her whole life ahead of her,” said Abhishek Verma, the girl’s father. A single shot injection - Zolgensma - could save her, but at Rs 16 crore, the world’s costliest drug was out of reach for the parents who belonged to a middle income household in Meerut. In February this year — a few months after her diagnosis — the family decided to launch a crowdfunding campaign. “We had heard of an Indian family which was able to crowdfund their child’s treatment for SMA,” Verma told TOI. In three months, however, Ishani’s parents were able to raise only Rs 6 lakh towards their goal of Rs 16 crore. In the meantime, Verma had to quit his job at a private company in Delhi so he could focus on his daughter’s treatment. “It was a race against time. Ishani was turning two in August,” said Verma. Zolgensma is administered to children below the age of two years. Without treatment, activities such as speaking, walking, breathing and swallowing become difficult. But just when the family’s hope was giving way to despair, Verma got news that “changed their daughter’s life”. “In first week of June, we were informed by All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi, where she was being treated, that Ishani would be getting the medicine for free. She was given the drug on June 17 and will be in isolation for the next six months,” he said, adding that they would be donating the amount they raised online to other families fighting SMA. The drug for Ishani came from Novartis which is allocating up to 100 doses of the medicine free of charge through its global Managed Access Program (MAP) in 2021. In 2020 as well, the Swiss manufacturer had given away doses of the drug for free. The firm had said that a third party would run a blinded selection for eligible children every two weeks. But the program had come under criticism for being a “lottery system” of sorts. So far, Novartis has given away 170 doses for free. A total of 700 SMA patients across the world have received Zolgensma till date, according to the pharma company. TOI had earlier reported that three girls — one from Bengaluru and two from Hyderabad — had also received the drug for free under Novartis’ initiative at the Bangalore Baptist Hospital this month. So far, five children have received the drug at the hospital and two more kids from Bengaluru are set to receive it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/toddler-gets-rs-16-cr-drug-for-free-under-lottery-system/articleshow/83696301.cms||---

With the extended deadline is to be over by mid-September, the number of total PNG connections given by the IOAGPL is around 3,500 whereas the target is 40,000. As per the original schedule, IOAGPL should have given 40,000 connections by September 2020. But the agency, which could give around 2,500 connections by then, approached Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) seeking extension. IOAGPL cited 2018 floods and the pandemic for the slow pace of the progress of the project. Then, PNGRB gave extension for the project for a year.  “We are unable to carry out the work due to lockdown and other restrictions. Dearth of workforce is another issue. Many of the guest workers, who are being deployed for digging up trenches for laying PNG pipes, have gone back to their homes,” an official with IOAGPL said. It is in the municipalities like Thrikkakara, Eloor and Tripunithura that the laying of pipe for CNG pipeline network is being carryout now.  Some other local bodies, including Kochi corporation, have also given their consent for digging up roads for laying pipelines. “Earlier, the difficulty in getting a nod from local bodies for digging up roads was a major hurdle. Now, that many of the local bodies have given its approval, we are unable to carry out the work,” sources with IOAGPL said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/extended-deadline-nears-end-ioagpl-yet-to-meet-target/articleshow/83698360.cms||---
---||Mumbai||20 cases of new Delta-plus variant in India, 8 in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The count of samples that have tested positive for the emerging Delta-plus variant has reached nearly 20 in the country, experts confirmed on Sunday. Maharashtra accounts for at least eight of these cases with almost all being reported from Ratnagiri. The highly infectious Delta variant (B.1.617.2) has further mutated to form the Delta-plus or ‘AY.1’variant. “We have found 15-20 cases of Delta-plus from Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Madhya Pradesh, among other states. We need to watch it closely, although for now, Delta remains the dominant and the stronger variant,” said Dr Sujeet Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi. Aspects about transmissibility or severity of Delta-plus are being studied by INSACOG (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia), Dr Singh said, adding that they would also be analysing samples dating to previous months to see if it already existed in March or April. This variant has been seen in Europe since Marchalthough it was brought into the public domain on June 13. “We are studying retrospective samples too. We have begun to look at the clinical details to understand it better,” he said, adding that the Centre will be making a statement about the variant in a day or two. Till June 7, India had reported six cases of Delta-plus. In Maharashtra, five cases of Delta-plus were first detected in Ratnagiri in May, following which 50 samples were sent for genome sequencing to CSIR-Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology (IGIB). The second batch returned three positive results in early June. Ratnagiri is among only three districts in Maharashtra to have a weekly positivity rate of over 10%. In the week ended June 17, Ratnagiri had a positivity rate of 11.9%, while the state’s average was 5.2%. Dr TP Lahane, head of medical education and research department, said all eight patients suffered from mild Covid and have recovered. “The cases have been in the district for over a month, but we haven’t seen any significant jump in transmission,” he said. “Delta-plus accounts for less than 0.005% cases in Ratnagiri,” he said, adding that no other confirmed cases have been found in other districts. Media reports on Sunday said cases were also found in Navi Mumbai and Palghar. Dr Dayanand Suryawanshi, district health officer of Palghar, said they had a case, where the individual was found to have a mutation, but not Delta-plus. "The patient had loose motions and no other symptoms; so, we had sent his samples for sequencing. The report had come in early April which said it was some other mutation and not Delta-plus. We had created a containment zone but haven’t found too many cases. There was only one other case from that area," he said. State officials didn’t reveal details whether there were cases in Panvel or any other parts of the state. Dr Lahane said all districts have been told to send 100 samples each over the next 2-3 weeks. “Since May, over 3,500 samples have been sent. Samples of severe cases, infection post-vaccination and villages where there is high transmission will be sent for analysis," he said. Dr Rahul Pandit, who is a member of the state taskforce, said, "Every new variant of interest can become a variant of concern so they must be contained and nipped in the bud."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/20-cases-of-new-delta-plus-variant-in-india-8-in-maharashtra/articleshow/83700399.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Lockdown cuts middle class food intake too||HYDERABAD: A survey by a team of economists reveals that Covid-19 has suppressed food consumption of not only the poor households but also significantly reduced the consumption of the middle classes. According to the survey, food consumption inequalities have worsened as the consumption share of the top 20% increased, while it reduced significantly for all the other classes. “In the early phase of the pandemic, it was the bottom 40% of households that experienced the most severe decline in food consumption. But as the pandemic deepened, consumption declined across all classes of households,” the survey published in online preprint portal MedRxiv said. The survey revealed that besides the poorest, the Covid-19 pandemic was particularly severe for the middle class affecting 40% to 80% in the group. In the early periods of the pandemic, and during the lockdown, consumption decline was more severe for the bottom 40% compared to the top 40% which experienced an insignificant change in consumption The survey covered rural households in several states. Mudit Kapoor, associate professor of economics at the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), New Delhi; Shamika Ravi, senior fellow, Brookings Institution; and AK Shiva Kumar, development economist and policy advisor, published the results of their survey based on the World Bank’s Covid-19 related shocks studies. The World Bank Covid-19 shocks studies covered several states across the country, including the Telugu states. As part of the survey, they focussed on consumption inequality across varying classes—rich, middle class and the poor. They said the impact of the lockdowns during the pandemic (ever since it was first imposed on March 25, 2020) has been extremely severe on the overall economy and particularly on consumption. According to the economists, for the quintile class 40% to 60% consumption declined by 9.6% and fell from Rs 311.6 to Rs 281.5 per week. However, for the 60% to 80% quintile class consumption declined insignificantly by 4.4% and fell from Rs 469.1 to Rs 448.5 per week. In contrast, for the top 20%, consumption increased marginally though insignificantly by 2% from Rs 973.8 to Rs 993.6 per week. The survey also pointed out that the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for consumer durables fell drastically from 117 in February 2020 to 6 in April 2020 when India was in the midst of a national lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lockdown-cuts-middle-class-food-intake-too/articleshow/83700188.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Madurai||Madurai: Covid care facilities shut, hotels back in business||MADURAI: With Covid-19 cases coming down significantly in Madurai district, a few Covid care centres (CCC) set up at hotels have returned to commercial operations. At present, the centres opened by the district administration at schools and colleges also have fewer patients. Private hospitals in the city made use of nearby hotels as they ran out of beds during the peak of the second wave. Asymptomatic patients were given accommodation in such facilities, and doctors visited patients on a regular-basis. As the beds at such facilities became vacant during the past couple of weeks, they have resumed commercial operations. But many of them have closed down after sanitization for want of customers. A hotelier from KK Nagar said that they have given the facility for a private hospital for more than a month. With the beds vacant for the last two months, they have closed down the hotel. “The state government has allowed hotels to provide accommodation only for people on business visits. There are hardly any people travelling for business purposes. So, we have closed the hotel since it is not viable to run it without any customers. We are planning to open our business only when inter-district movement is allowed without restrictions and we are allowed to cater to the public,” he said. A few hotels, which opened their doors for people to quarantine themselves, too have closed now. Many hotels in the city came forward to offer quarantine facilities a month ago. However, hardly a few managed to attract customers. “Only four-to-five hotels succeeded in attracting customers for quarantining in Madurai. Whereas, hotels in other cities such as Chennai and Coimbatore witnessed good patronage,” said president of Madurai Travel Club G Raveendran. More than 2,270 beds are available in government hospitals and 2,088 beds at private hospitals in Madurai district. Officials from the health department said that around 2,100 patients are undergoing treatment in the district. Out of them, around 470 are in home isolation. Officials said that there are 38 CCCs in Madurai district with 2,689 beds. Out of which 2,459 are empty at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/covid-care-facilities-shut-hotels-back-in-business/articleshow/83700154.cms||V Devanathan
---||Kochi||Kerala: Hanging solar fence successful in Thundathil range||KOCHI: The experiment to ward off man-animal conflict in a small area has turned fruitful in Kuttampuzha. The forest officials installed hanging solar fence on a two-km stretch on one side of the road at ward number one in the panchayat as their efforts by installing solar fence was futile. The hanging solar fence was installed at Meeran city four months ago and the Thundathil forest officials say the experiment has been successful so far. Armed with success, forest officials will extend the length of the hanging solar fence in the area. In regular solar fence, five lines, where the current is passing, connected to each post, is installed at places to prevent wild animals from entering the human habitations. Solar power electrifies the lines. There is disruption of power supply during cattle movement and maintenance is a difficult task. “In hanging solar fence, we used a power line hauling over the normal fence and jutted out half meter away from the normal lines. The posts in normal fence face threats from wild elephants as they normally stamp it out and move forward. As short power lines are hanging from the new line, elephants cannot move forward without touching it. The small power lines hanging also function as a deterrent. We did this as a pilot project on a 2km stretch on one side of the road and it has turned out to be successful. Wild elephants often damage normal solar fence when they move to a nearby water source and eat the crops during summer,” said Muhammad Rafy, Thundathil forest range officer. However, ward member Rekha Raj said the hanging solar fence is limited to a small area where the presence of wild animals is less compared to other areas. “Elephants are still coming to human habitations, situated above the road. A wild elephant entered the area the other day too. We need a permanent solution to the issue,” says Rekha Raj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hanging-solar-fence-successful-in-thundathil-range/articleshow/83698370.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa Express||On November 30, 1985, when Goa made their debut in the Ranji Trophy cricket tournament, there was nervousness in the air. Goa were playing at home in Vasco and didn’t know what to expect against visiting Kerala. The start of the three-day encounter wasn’t encouraging. Goa lost their first six wickets for a mere 81 runs on the board, bringing Sharad Pednekar to the crease. Born in Bombay, now Mumbai, Pednekar had carved a reputation for himself as a top-notch fast bowler who rubbed shoulders with many of the greats. But here, as Suresh Mahadevan watched from the other end, he had to put his batting skills to use and save Goa the embarrassment. Pednekar ended up scoring 40 runs, the highest for Goa in their first innings score of 188 (Namdev Phadte scored 72 of the 153 runs in the second). He also grabbed three wickets in the first innings to emerge as the most successful player on the state’s debut. For someone who generated so much speed and showed so much promise when he was still in his early twenties, it’s surprising that Pednekar played just 15 first class games. He quit quite unexpectedly with 38 wickets — best of 4 for 51 against Karnataka — at an average of 28.78 after just three years. “Maybe I should have continued playing,” says Pednekar, now 60 and leading a retired life in the city. “At the time, there was hardly any incentive for playing cricket. We got paid almost nothing. In fact we had to pay from our pockets. I also thought it was better to make way for youngsters.” Cricket in the eighties, as Pednekar reminds us, wasn’t really a well-paying sport. Players got paid Rs 140 for a three-day game and Rs 20 as pocket allowance. It’s a different world now with Rs 1.4 lakh on offer for each game in the Ranji Trophy. No wonder nobody thinks like Pednekar and steps aside at the height of their game. That Pednekar had real talent was never in doubt. Having represented Podder College in Mumbai, which has produced the likes of Dilip Vengsarkar, Ravi Shastri and Sanjay Manjrekar, he was among the known faces. But the city was teeming with so much talent that it would take only something special to make it to the top. Around the same time, Goa were pencilled to make their debut in the Ranji Trophy and he chose to return home. “Goa were in the south zone, which was clearly the strongest in the country. We had to play against Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, all teeming with top-notch players. It was very challenging,” says Pednekar. Whenever he bowled, he put his heart into it. He was marked as the dangerman by most opponents with former India captain Kris Srikkanth once telling his teammates at the Panjim Gymkhana ground, “don’t take any chances against Pednekar.” Interestingly, Srikkanth himself took a chance with the first ball which he drove back to the bowler, but Pednekar dropped the catch. “I wasn’t expecting it,” he says. When opportunities were there for the taking against big names, Pednekar, however, grabbed it with both hands. His wickets include, amongst other greats, Gundappa Viswanath, Brijesh Patel, Sadanand Viswanath, Sandeep Patil, Sanjay Manjrekar, Eknath Solkar and his all-time favourite Mohammed Azharuddin. “Azhar was a treat to bowl. He was a different kind of a batsman, not your regular player. He was artistic. If you bowl an out-swinger, he could still flick you to the midwicket boundary. You had to use your brains to get him out. You had to innovate. Azhar’s wicket was always priceless,” says Pednekar, who has been the state’s chief selector in the past. Pednekar came up with consistent performances at the national level but never managed to catch the eye of selectors. “We didn’t have officials who could make a case for us,” he says. “If Goa had some representation, like say a Chetan Desai or Vinod Phadke (both influential Goa Cricket Association officials), it would have been a different story.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-express/articleshow/83716021.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Actress held in porn film-making case granted bail||MUMBAI: Four months after the crime branch arrested model and TV actress Gehana Vasisht alias Vandana Tiwari in an alleged pornography racket, the Dindoshi session court on Saturday granted her bail. The Dindoshi additional session court judge LS Chavan granted Gehana bail on a personal bond of Rs 25,000 with one or two sureties in the Malvani police. While granting bail, the Dindoshi sessions court directed that Gehana cannot leave the country without the permission of the court. While at Byculla jail, Gehana was infected with Covid-19 and was kept in a jail quarantine centre. She also suffered a stroke and was admitted to JJ hospital by prison authorities, said her publicist Flynn Remedios. Earlier, her bail application had been rejected by the Dindoshi sessions court as the chargesheet was not filed. Gehana has to complete the bail formalities and furnish sureties before the court to secure her release. In February, the property cell of the crime branch led by inspector Kedar Pawar and assistant inspector Laxmikant Salunkhe raided a bungalow in Madh Island in Malad and busted a live porn video film making racket and rescued a woman. The police arrested five persons namely Yasmin Rowa Khan and four others under various IPC sections of cheating, indulging in obscene act in public places and publicly exhibiting or circulating obscene books or literature and under the Information Technology Act. During the investigation, police also froze a bank account of this production house which has a balance of Rs 36.50 lakh. The police said that this income could have been generated from the subscriptions of porn apps on which the accused used to upload videos. The police had seized a high-definition DVR video camera, six mobile phones, laptop, spotlight, camera stand, memory card containing several video clips and dialogue/script.  During investigation, the police arrested model and actor Gehena Vashist who would upload these videos on various apps including one based in the UK.  The gang used to lure aspiring candidates looking for a break in films, sign agreements and then force them to act in the porn movies. Crime branch which had made tall claims to probe the role of UK-based businessman and husband of an actress could not do so after key officers of the case were transferred out of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-actress-held-in-porn-film-making-case-granted-bail/articleshow/83702073.cms||Ahmed Ali

The PHC will come up at a cost of Rs 2.95 crore. The building will be completed in six months. Sidhu said in view of the growing population of Mohali and villages in the district, health facilities would be provided to every corner. Saying that the cost of equipment at the primary health centre would be separate, he thanked residents of Seneta village, including sarpanch Bhagat Ram and the panchayat for giving 22 kanals of land in prime location and along the main road to the PHC. He said the PHC would become a major hospital in future and provide health facilities to nearby villages. According to him, the medical college was being started on the site of six phase Civil Hospital. It was proposed to set up a civil hospital in Sector 66, Mohali, for which the process of acquiring nine acres of land from GMADA was almost complete. There is also a proposal to set up a primary health center at Aerocity in Mohali, Sidhu said. On the Covid pandemic, Sidhu said there was a great deal of awareness among people about vaccination and the state government was working day and night to provide maximum vaccines to people. He also said that the state government had stepped up Covid testing. He appealed to people to take all precautionary measures against Covid and follow government instructions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-village-to-get-phc-for-rs-2-95-cr/articleshow/83698376.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa, which has 0.1% of India’s area, has 37% of its listed birds||KERI: During the last winter season, when birders set out on their annual birding expedition across Goa, they were delighted to have spotted four new species in the state. This has taken the number of listed birds found in Goa to 481, which is almost 37% of the tally of birds listed across India, though it is the smallest state in terms of geographical area. Malabar starling, chestnut winged cuckoo, great bittern and white browed fantail are the newest bird presence recorded in the state. The Malabar starling is generally found in south-west India, while chestnut winged cuckoo in South-East Asia. The presence of great bittern or Eurasian bittern is a sub-family of the heron, whereas white browed fantail breeds across tropical regions of Indian sub-continent and South-East Asia. But these birds have been spotted and added to the list of recorded birds found in Goa for the first time. “With the addition of four species of birds, the richness of Goa’s landscape in supporting avifauna has been highlighted,” Aranya Environment and Research Organisation president Harshada Gawas said. The recorded bird numbers in Goa stood at 477 at last count, with the last two additions being of the migratory greater flamingo and lesser flamingo. Goa’s recorded bird species roughly constitute 5% of the total 10,000-odd bird species listed globally. Compare the geographically tiny state’s 481 to the 525 bird species listed in the vast state of Karnataka. This has helped make Goa a popular destination with birdwatchers from India and abroad. Peru has the largest number of birds listed for any country in the world with its count standing at 2,000, while the recorded bird species in India are between 1,200 and 1,300, of which Goa has nearly 481. “Goa is blessed with a wide variety of habitats and this has made Goa a bird watcher’s paradise. The habitats are very easily accessible and one can travel from the coast to the dense forests within a matter of hours. One is able to sight many of the Western Ghats endemics quite easily here,” Goa Bird Conservation Network’s Omkar Dharwadkar said. Goa offers a diverse habitat within a small area — the coast, the mid-elevation plateaus and the Western Ghats, which as one of the eight biodiversity hotspots in the world is comparable to the habitats of the Amazon, Congo and Borneo. The Western Ghats, the coastal plains and mid highlands with creeks, islands, estuaries, rocky headlands, grasslands, marshy land, paddy fields and the hilly forest cover has been offering refuge to the varied species of birds, while also attracting many migratory species, largely from eastern Europe, who come here to escape the harsh winter. The first comprehensive checklist of birds of Goa was meticulously prepared by Heinz Lainer, listing 382 species of birds in 1999. As per the current checklist of birds of Goa, there are 481 species in which 120 are rare, 3 are critically endangered and 13 are vulnerable. The Western Ghats that has four wildlife Sanctuaries and one national park is home to 16 species of endemic birds. In 2018, based on robust rules for verification of all records from Goa, 473 species were published in Indian Birds, authored by Pronoy Baidya and Mandar Bhagat. On November 13, 2020, with the new additions the total species count reached 477. “Conservation of natural habitats is needed, as it will allow species of avifauna to thrive in their environment. Along with habitat loss, human activities and climate change have been responsible for affecting the species of birds. Favourable habitats bring a unique abundance of diverse species of birds,” Keri’s Vivekanand Environment Awareness Brigade’s volunteer Narayan Gawas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-which-has-0-1-of-indias-area-has-37-of-its-listed-birds/articleshow/83700214.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

The mismatch in numbers include both first and the second jabs. As per the PHD data, 10,76,862 people took the first dose in the district till June 17, while as per the office of deputy director of health services (DDHS), which also compiles the NMC-ZP data, the number of beneficiaries was 9,82,335 — a difference of 94,527. Similarly, there is a difference of 6,861 when it comes to second dose. As per the PHD, 3,01,757 beneficiaries have taken the second dose, while the number is 2,94,896 as per the DDHS data. Discrepancies are also noticed in the data regarding the first and second doses administered to healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs), 18-44 age group and 45-plus. An official from the DDHS office told TOI, “NMC may have missed vaccination done by private centres. We are cross-checking the data of ours and the PHD.” At present, four private hospitals are also running the vaccination programme. Two private hospitals are engaged in corporate vaccination. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, “Data of the state’s PHD will be accurate as it is being taken from the Co-Win application. We are tallying the data of government and private centres daily. I have directed the officials to verify and do reconciliation.” ZP chief executive officer Yogesh Kumbhejkar said, “Directives have been given to cross-check vaccination numbers of all centres. There seems no problem in the rural numbers and will rectify, if any.” DDHS Dr Sanjay Jaiswal did not respond to TOI’s call and messages. Interestingly, the number mismatch is not limited to Nagpur district alone. Similar discrepancies are being noticed in the data of other districts in Nagpur division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-dept-says-13-8l-jabs-given-in-dist-nmc-zp-claims-12-8l/articleshow/83700051.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Hyderabad||Only 74,000 of 6 lakh vaccinated in non-Hyderabad urban local bodies||HYDERABAD: Data from the state health department shows that vaccination for high-risk groups is largely skewed in the state, with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) seeing the maximum coverage. Compared to 2.9 lakh of 6.5 lakh beneficiaries covered so far in GHMC, only 74,000 out of 6.08 lakh in other urban local bodies have been covered up to last week. The state meanwhile has a total of 14.96 lakh of estimated people falling in the high-risk category, of which 5.30 lakh have been covered (latest details up to June 7 available). The largest chunk of people falling in the high-risk group are in the GHMC area, followed by the 128 municipalities and municipal corporations around the state. The third highest number of people falling in the high-risk category are there in the remaining parts of other districts (largely rural and semi urban areas) with 1.20 lakh people in the category, while another 1.17 lakh are in the Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (GWMC). While the state government had prioritised vaccinating the high-risk workers, it is the lack of accessibility that is hampering the even distribution. “Majority of the vaccination centres are in located in and around Hyderabad city which means that these workers have to come to Hyderabad to take the jab. Since vaccination had not been carried out in the government centres in most of the semi urban areas over the last one and half month and the private centres were also not holding drives, many had missed out,” said an official from the state health department. Meanwhile, the coverage in rural areas however has been very good with 1.19 lakh of the 1.20 lakh high risk-workers being already covered. This officials attribute to special drives carried out in these areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/only-74k-of-6l-vaccinated-in-non-hyd-urban-local-bodies/articleshow/83700211.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Meerut||Three booked for post 'tarnishing' image of Ram mandir trust's general secretary||BIJNOR: Police in Uttar Pradesh’s Bijnor district on Sunday filed an FIR against three persons, including an NRI woman, for allegedly trying to “tarnish” the image of the brother and family members of Ram Mandir trust general secretary Champat Rai. The three persons were booked under 15 sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC), some of them non-bailable, and under IT Act on the basis of a complaint filed by Rai’s brother, Sanjay Bansal. Bansal alleged that former journalist Vineet Narain put up a “malicious” post on Facebook accusing him and his family members of grabbing property in Bijnor’s Nagina area. He also alleged that Indonesia-returned Alka Lahoti and another person, Rajneesh, "conspired" with Narain to defame his family and "hurt religious sentiments of people of the country". Nagina is the home town of VHP leader Rai. Bijnor’s superintendent of police (SP) Dharamveer Singh said, “A case has been registered against Vineet Narain, Alka Lahoti and Rajneesh. They had put up a derogatory post on Facebook making allegations of corruption against Champat Rai’s family members. We have set up an inquiry into the matter. Prima facie allegation seems to be false. The accused tried to tarnish the image of Rai and hurt the religious sentiments of people. However, a probe is on and documents are being checked.” The case was filed under IPC sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion), 293 (circulating obscene objects), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings), 417 (punishment for cheating), 419 (punishment for cheating by personation), 448 (punishment for house-trespass), 465 (punishment for forgery), 457 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night), 469 (whoever commits forgery, intending that the document or electronic record forged shall harm the reputation of any party). Other sections include: 470 (forging document or electronic record), 471 (using as genuine a forged document which is known to be forged), 504(intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505 (with intent to incite, or which is likely to incite, any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community), 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication). They were also booked under sections 66D, 71 and 74 of IT Act. Narain is chairman of The Braj Foundation and a journalist, according to his Facebook profile. The other accused, Lahoti, 52, left her job in Indonesia and returned home in Nagina to take over the cowshed after her father’s death a few years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-booked-under-15-ipc-sections-for-fb-post-against-ram-mandir-trust-gen-secy/articleshow/83696403.cms||Harveer Dabas

The farmers’ outfit is planning to take out a tractor march from Saharanpur on June 24 which is expected to reach Delhi the following day. “Thousands of farmers are expected to join the march which will take a halt in Meerut the same evening,” a BKU leader said. Its leader Naresh Tikait told TOI that farmers are left with no option but to intensify the ongoing protests with the government. On Sunday, a large number of BKU activists gathered at BKU national office in Muzaffarnagar and held a meeting. Naresh Tikait said, “What do we do? We have no choice other than speed up the protest being held at the Ghazipur border. The government is not paying heed to what the farmers want.” Tikait also targeted police for harassment of farmers. According to the BKU’s Muzaffarnagar district president, Dheeraj Latian, “Farmers will start the march from Saharanpur district on June 24 and will stop at the toll plaza in Meerut for a night and will restart the march for the Delhi border the next morning.” Sources in BKU said that meetings are being held in every village to mobilise farmers and ensure that thousands of them reach the protest site in NCR. The BKU leaders have been urging the Union government to resume talks with farmers on the deadlock over farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/thousands-of-farmers-to-reach-delhi-border-in-tractors-on-june-25-says-bku/articleshow/83696459.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Need to focus on behavioural change, urge experts||HYDERABAD: With Covid-19 here to stay for some more time and unlock process on, public health experts call for focus on behavioural change among people and state governments to build strong behavioural change communication sections again. Experts say that during the 90s and late 80s, governments had focused and invested on sexual behavioural change of people with HIV/Aids cases, which was at peak at that time. There has to be a similar effort now, they said. A study by UNICEF in Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka had in the past clearly identified that dedicated behavioural change communication section with adequate technical manpower was crucial for helping state health department in bringing the change in public. “Our study also noted that many innovative steps were done by the three states, which were making huge behaviour change in the community when it came to various health behaviours like immunisation, family planning, malaria, TB and HIV/Aids control,” Administrative Staff College of India’s Centre for Health Care Management head Dr Subodh Kanthamuthan, who carried out the study, told TOI. University of Hyderabad’s School of Medical Sciences Professor BR Shamanna observed: “There is enough information of Covid-19 protocols, but there is a lot of misinformation and people need to demystify about many things. Behavioural change does not happen overnight, there is constant need to work in this area,” he said. Quoting some examples of good behaviour change communication techniques, they said in Mysore of Karnataka, major exhibitions and festivals display tableaux, drama and folk arts related to various health programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/need-to-focus-on-behavioural-change-urge-experts/articleshow/83700264.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

In areas where students are unable to log in for live teaching sessions due to connectivity or other issues, teachers have been told to prepare worksheets and pre-recorded videos and send them, to ensure there is no interruption in learning, Bhagat said. TOI had reported on Sunday how students in Goa's rural pockets are getting set to once again trek through forest and up hills in search of internet network to access their online lessons. “Teachers will have to prepare videos and worksheets and reach out to students who are not able to access online classes,” he said. “They will have to give special attention to students in Class I and Class V, which are entry-level classes for primary education and high school education, respectively. Teachers will have to get in touch with the parents of such students and ensure that minimum learning levels for the class are achieved.” Around 2.8 lakh students from Class I to XII will resume classes online for the new academic year from Monday. The director said that teachers have to especially focus on students in Class I and II, as students who entered primary schools last year too were not able to attend regular schools due to the pandemic. “Students in these classes do not know what schools are like at all. Teachers will have to bring these students up to date,” said Bhagat. He also said that telecast of recorded teaching programmes for school students on local channels and Doordarshan by the state council for educational research and training will also resume shortly. The director said that though teachers of Class X and XII are engaged in the work of preparation of results, classes for the new batch for these standards will start from Monday itself, along with other students. Only classes for Class XI students will be delayed, as the Class X results are yet to be declared after cancellation of the public examination and therefore, admissions to Class XI have not been taken up. Bhagat said that school teachers have also been instructed to follow all guidelines to prevent any Covid-19 infections in school premises, where they are reporting for work. “Teachers cannot sit in a common staff room,” he said. “They have been told to sit in separate rooms by occupying whichever rooms are vacant. Teachers who are pregnant, lactating mothers or have disabled children have been allowed to work from home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/use-recorded-videos-worksheets-to-reach-all-students-teachers-told/articleshow/83700253.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Forest officials claim that this is a result of the Covid-19 pandemic that is urging people to grow their own food and herbs. “People are keeping themselves occupied by indulging in potting and planting activities. Due to Covid-19 and the curfew, there is a huge response for saplings this year,” deputy conservator of forests, North Goa, Santosh Phadte said. He further informed that while there is interest in growing medicinal plants, sometimes buyers purchase a range of varieties like teak, jamoon, and amla. “On some days, about 3,000-4,000 saplings are going out for sale at the nursery in Campal. We have therefore been receiving very good response from the range forest office,” said additional PCCF and chief wildlife warden, Santosh Kumar. While the social forestry division of the forest department is providing fruit-bearing saplings, the research and utilisation division is providing the medicinal plants at the Campal range forest office. “Saplings have also been distributed among MLAs across Goa, who are planting and distributing them in their respective jurisdiction. We will take up a plantation drive during Vanamahotsava as well, which falls in July. Our target is to distribute five lakh saplings – both fruit-bearing as well as medicinal plants – across Goa,” Kumar said. Saplings available for sale include chandan, chafa, stevia, bramhi, lakshmitaru, amla, hadjod, shatavari, tulsi, neem, ashwagandha, sitafal, noni, soursop, akarkara, lemon, lemon grass, aloe vera, mandukparni, giloe, bael, chitrak, kalmegh, pachauli, behda and nirgundi, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sale-of-seedlings-rise-in-pandemic/articleshow/83700568.cms||---

Those who visited were informed that they would get the Rs 2000 second installment of Covid relief and the 14-item grocery kit next week. The distribution of dole and grocery kit began on June 15. Some rice cardholders who got tokens were disappointed when the shops were closed in advance by 10.30 am though they were supposed to remain open till 12.30 pm and between 2 pm and 5 pm on working days. Madurai district has a total of 8,72,014 rice card holders eligible for the relief. As the distribution is restricted to 100 cards per shop per day, about 1.35 lakh cardholders should have received their Covid relief by now.  However, sources said the number is much lower. S Santhi, a customer in Yagappa Nagar, said her token was for Monday but she had gone a day in advance, at 10.30 am and was shocked to find the shop closed. A shopkeeper of one of the PDS shops, said the Rs 2000 dole amount was already with them, but the supply of the 14 item grocery kit was not sufficient.  “Yesterday we had just 15 kits in hand,’’ he said. Sources at the district civil supplies office said they had not stopped the distribution of dole or groceries, but there was a slight delay in the supply of items and that it would be rectified from early next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/fewer-relief-kits-force-ration-shops-to-shut-early/articleshow/83700261.cms||---

The monkeys started crowding round the troughs as soon as the water was poured into them. Monkeys in this temple are an attraction and when people come to the temple, they also feed these animals. This year, however, due to the closure of the temples due to the lockdown, the monkeys were forced to forage for food in the forest. As the windy season has started, the water sources inside this hill were drying up. People, who have been volunteering to feed people during the lockdown, have also been regularly providing food like biscuits and fruits to these animals. “I know that we should only give them fruits, but getting biscuits and nuts was easy and we have been bringing it twice a week,” said A Raja, a volunteer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/water-troughs-placed-for-monkeys-in-alagarkoil-hills-amid-scarcity/articleshow/83700302.cms||---

D S Neelakandan, the saloon owner, has been providing the discount for the last four days. He had initially announced it for four days, but has decided to extend it for another week. Around 15 people have benefited each day from this scheme. Neelakandan, 43, a BBA graduate, was working in a private bank until a few years ago taking care of two-wheeler finances. He quit the job and opened a salon in Kamarajar Salai with the help of his wife Buvaneswari, a beautician. He opened his second store on Pandiya Vellala Street at West Masi-DM Court Junction a year back, where the discount scheme is being provided. “The only way we have in front of us to get out of the pandemic is by vaccinating a majority of the population. I still see some people are hesitant to get vaccinated. I made the discount offer to motivate some of them. One can obtain the benefit even if one of the members from the family is inoculated,” Neelakandan said adding that the verification would be done through Cowin certificate. Neelakandan said that discounts are available for all sorts of services including cutting, shaving, pedicure, manicure and facials. He said that it is not easy to give away 50% of the revenue generated in the business, especially when few customers visit for services as he has to pay for three employees. He said that he started the new branch only a few weeks before the Covid-19 outbreak last year. “The store was under lock and key for a few months. The government has allowed saloons to function between 6 am and 5 pm. Only a few visit saloons due to covid scare. The revenue generated at present would be adequate only to meet the running cost,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/at-this-salon-get-50-off-if-you-got-the-jab/articleshow/83700290.cms||V Devanathan

---||Kochi||Thiruvananthapuram: Race for low TPR tightens, local bodies step up testing||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With weekly test positivity rates (TPRs) being used as the crucial measure of prevalence of Covid-19, local bodies in the district have more than tripled their testing rates to drag down the TPR to golden scales of below 5%. At the same time, some of the local bodies where TPR read healthy figures barely five days ago may witness a change of category from low spread to moderate spread or even higher. As on June 19, seven local bodies in the district brought down the TPR to 5% or below with Aryankode recording as low as 1.92% (weekly TPR). Aryankode did a dramatic turnaround in TPR by testing more than seven times the number it did two weeks ago. For instance, the weekly TPR of Aryankode on June 14 was 19.41% and it did 170 tests between June 8 and 13. In the last week, Aryankode scaled up the testing to 1,248 and yielded just 24 positives. In the first week of June, Aryankode had recorded weekly TPR of 29.25%. Panchayats like Vamanapuram, Ottasekharamangalam, Panavoor and Perumkadavila where weekly TPR was below 6% as on June 19 were dealing with TPR above 20% two weeks ago. All these panchayats doubled and tripled the tests in the following days and TPR dropped sharply to low figures. Two weeks ago, Vamanapuram did only 262 tests and TPR was 27.1% and in the past one week, the authorities did 889 tests and now the TPR is 3.49%. The remaining local bodies which pulled down the rates to the gold standard of 5% also increased testing considerably. However, Nanniyode panchayat which was sitting pretty with a weekly TPR of 6.66% five days ago saw the rate increase to 10.11%. “We got some unexpected cases in Navodaya ward where not a single case was reported until two months ago. We did a random testing and detected a few cases. Some of them were asymptomatic; especially the elderly persons who stayed at home; two women and a man. We also had a case of breakthrough infection in a ward where a person who was earlier tested positive and vaccinated twice again tested positive. Contact testing led to confirmation of cases in family and his relative’s family who stayed in the neighbourhood,” said Nanniyode panchayat president Shylaja Rajeevan. Kurupuzha ward in the panchayat where many cases were reported also threw up more cases, upping the TPR of the panchayat.  Medical authorities said that it was mainly home clusters which led to a slight spike in cases in the panchayat. Panchayats like Madavoor, Navayikulam, Kallikadu which had recorded weekly TPR of 10% or below on June 14 also now deal with a TPR of above 10%. Madavoor recorded a weekly TPR of 18.12% as on June 19 whereas Navayikulam showed 13.1%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/race-for-low-tpr-tightens-local-bodies-step-up-testing/articleshow/83698395.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Ludhiana||Cops who have not got first dose will not get July salary||Ludhiana: Cops who have not got their first dose of vaccine would not get the salary for July unless they show an advice by a doctor against taking the jab due to a medical condition. This step has been taken by Ludhiana commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal to ensure 100% vaccination in the police force. In a conversation with the TOI, Agarwal said vaccination was the reason that no city cop died during the second wave. “During the first wave of Covid-19, around 500 police personnel of Ludhiana commissionerate had tested positive, of which 80 who had severe infection were admitted to hospitals and two lost their lives. However, in the second wave, only 80 contracted the virus and nobody was hospitalised. Only two or three cops admitted themselves to hospitals as a precautionary measure and also to stay away from their families. No cop died during the second wave and the reason was vaccination. During the second wave, over 65% of the cops had got the first dose of vaccine. Though some, despite the first dose, contracted the virus, they had mild symptoms and recovered quickly,” he said.“To ensure cent percent vaccination, I took this decision. If there is a genuine reason, like a cop is pregnant or there is some major health issue, they can get it in writing from the doctors. So far, out of 4,500 cops about 4,300 have got the first dose,” he added. Agarwal said, “October salary will be given to the cops who get the second dose. This decision is being taken to save precious lives. Our joint commissioner of police (headquarters) J Elanchezhian has some severe allergies and initially the doctors had advised him not to get the vaccine. However later, when doctors studied similar cases, the JCP was allowed to get the jab. He got both the doses and later tested positive, but he recovered in home isolation. I would also advise Ludhiana residents to get themselves vaccinated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cops-who-have-not-got-first-dose-will-not-get-july-salary/articleshow/83696540.cms||Payal Dhawan

During the search, the anti-evasion wing of the department recovered Rs 40 lakh cash from the house of hosiery businessman Yogesh Jain, who, during investigation by tax officials, confessed that he was evading GST by executing undeclared supply transactions and also issuing fake bills. According to the department, Yogesh is a relative of Sahil Jain, who was, on November 11 last year, booked and arrested for issuing fake invoices of Rs 393 crore and passing on fake input tax credit (ITC) worth Rs 33.02 crore through 23 dummy firms. In January, Sahil was released on bail, but later an FIR was registered against him and some unknown persons for securing bail on forged papers. Prior to this, an FIR was also registered against his wife and others for allegedly operating his locker a day after his arrest.About the new case, Ashutosh Baranwal, principal commissioner, Ludhiana CGST, said, “It was believed that some crucial documents related to the Rs 393-crore GST fraud were secreted at the residence of Yogesh Jain. A search was conducted on June 19, and Rs 40 lakh cash was recovered from the cupboards of a bedroom. The amount is suspected to be the proceeds of the crime. On questioning, Yogesh confessed that he was evading GST by indulging in undeclared supply transactions. He was receiving and supplying goods without issuing proper invoices and mostly generating ungenuine bills.” “Sahil is the kingpin of the GST fraud. Yogesh’s links with Sahil got him into trouble and helped us unearth his fraud,” Baranwal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/probing-rs-393cr-bogus-billing-gst-dept-unearths-another-fraud/articleshow/83696526.cms||---

According to the state media bulletin, the number of active cases in the district on June 19 was 794. The count was 807 on March 6 before the second wave peaked.

---||Ludhiana||Not even 20% vaccinated in 18-44 age group in Ludhiana||LUDHIANA: Even as Ludhiana recorded 1-million vaccination on June 19, it is yet to achieve 20% immunization in 18-44 age group, which has majority of persons to be jabbed. The health experts say vaccination is important to prevent the third Covid wave. Ludhiana district immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Puneet Juneja said, “Of around 22-24 lakh to be vaccinated (on the basis of voter list) in various age groups, about 15-16 lakh are 18 to 44 years old and the remaining 8-9 lakh are above 45 years old. Till recently, around 2,08,000 in the 18-44 age group were vaccinated.”  Vaccination for 18+ started lately, which explained the low percentage. There was sufficient vaccine stock for this age group and 36,000 doses arrived on Friday, he indicated. The health department officials said till Saturday evening, 2,51,350 who are 18-44-year-old were vaccinated in the district, which was roughly between 16% and 17% of them. Till Saturday evening, 4,79,844 of those between 45 and 60 years old were vaccinated, which was roughly between 54% and 60% of them. Of the total 10,19,456 vaccinations in Ludhiana in the period, 24.7% are in the 18-44 age group. Of 2,51,350 persons vaccinated in this bracket, 2,10,767 were administered Covishield and 40,583 Covaxin. The health department officials said they faced shortage of vaccine especially for 18-44 age group because of which their vaccination couldn’t be done aggressively. They added that now that they were getting the stock, their inoculation pace would gain pace. Meanwhile, the eligible persons are waiting to get immunized, especially at government set-ups. “I am scared of the disease as one of my family members was infected a month ago and we spent almost all our savings on his treatment. Now, we are dependent on the government to provide us with free vaccine. But every time I go to the government centre, I am told they have run out of stock. I cannot pay Rs 1,000 for a vaccine as my family has 10 members, which means it will cost us Rs 10,000,” said Manoj Kumar, 30, a watchman of Kitchlu Nagar.  “There is a need to immunize most of the eligible persons before the probable third wave strikes. In developed countries, vaccination has helped. So apart from other measures, it is necessary in the fight against Covid,” said former senior medical officer Dr Rajinder Gulati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/not-even-20-vaccinated-in-18-44-age-group-in-dist/articleshow/83696547.cms||Shariq Majeed

This is rare because it will be the second year in a row when there will be no major outdoor activity or mass congregation for IDY around the globe due to the pandemic, and yet people in large numbers are embracing Yoga from the quietude of their homes. Over the last six years of observation of IDY, Yoga has emerged as a significant public health movement across the world. This has been particularly true in India, where the role being assigned to Yoga in the policy and practice of public health has significantly grown. The ministry of AYUSH and ministry of youth affairs and sports recently came together to grant formal recognition to yogasana as a competitive sport. Yogasana represents the physical dimension of yoga, and is amenable to the format of a competitive sport. Thanks to its basic strengths, yogasana has the potential to emerge into a global sporting discipline. This will ensure new technologies and new strategies being inducted into the discipline. Our athletes and officials will be able to build fruitful and fulfilling careers in this field. Yoga not only improves overall health and immunity but also contributes to a quicker recovery of patients from diseases. In the current scenario where large sections of the population are enduring stress and anxiety related challenges due to Covid-19, Yoga offers effective solutio- ns. Thus, in these troubled ti- mes when wellness is a goal for all of us, "Yoga for Wellness" becomes an appropriate and natural theme for IDY-2021.

PFHPNPL was awarded the tender by the then BJP-led government for the agro-processing facility in Nagpur’s MIHAN area. Land in the area was made available at a 75% discount. According to the agreement signed in March 2017, the developer had to begin production within 18 months (excluding the monsoon period). Not only is the Patanjali project yet to begin production, the first phase of the project has now been granted an extension till December 31 by the MVA government. The approvals were granted by the Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) board headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The price of 230 acres of MADC land, where the project was to come up, was reduced from Rs 1 crore to Rs 25 lakh per acre and given at Rs 58.6 crores on a 66-year lease. “This was extensively discussed in the board meeting, and it unanimously granted approval for the extension on the condition that it start production by then,” said MADC MD Deepak Kapoor. MADC had sent queries to the company last year, regarding the status of the project. “They said their plans got affected by the pandemic. This has happened to several companies in MIHAN,” said Kapoor. They also said that they were in the process of arranging finances from several banks,” he added. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd MD Acharya Balkrishna did not respond to mail on phone calls from TOI. Since then, Patanjali informed MADC that they had secured loans from a few banks and that they had appointed a new general manager for the project. Machinery had also been moved onto the site and cleaning operations were on, officials said. Kapoor informed the MADC board that PFHPNPL had already invested Rs 500 crore from its proposed investment of Rs 1,500. He also said that 70-80% of the project work for the first phase was already complete. “After Rs 500 crore has been invested, cancelling the project would serve no purpose.

Police officials also claim that a major part of consignment was taken away by deceased gangster Jaipal Bhullar, who along with co-accused Jassi Kharar was later gunned down by Kolkata police in New Model Town. On May 29, Baljinder Singh Babbi of Mahlla Khurd in Moga, and Darshan Singh of Sahauli village in Ludhiana were arrested by Punjab Police from Dabra in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh . On May 30, they had arrested Manjeet Singh, an ex-serviceman of Burj Nakliyan, and his neighbour-cum-helper Pala Singh, who works as Class IV employee at a cooperative society, after 70kg poppy husk was allegedly recovered from their possession.

Hyderabad has emerged as the vaccination capital of the world by producing one-third of the global vaccines. Covaxin is developed and being manufactured in the city. “The testing of each batch of vaccine produced in the country is being carried out only at Central Drug Laboratory, Kasauli. And for the entire process of sending the vaccination batch from Hyderabad to Kasauli takes approximately 30-45 days, which is time-consuming, and cost-intensive,” KTR added. Over the next few months, a significant number of coronavirus vaccines will be produced in Hyderabad and that the official reports and projections of the Union government state that almost 50% of the total Covid-19 vaccine supply between August and December 2021 will be from Hyderabad. “For the projected capacity of a billion doses in Hyderabad between August and December 2021, having a testing centre in Hyderabad could result in accelerated throughput of about 8-10 crore additional vaccine doses per month in the country’s overall supply,” KTR said. Referring to experts’ predictions on the third wave between September and December, he said vaccines were the only solution for this fight against Covid-19. KTR assured the Centre that the state government would extend complete support in establishment of vaccine testing facility on a fast track mode. “A state-of-the-art full-fledged facility can be built in parallel to cater to testing requirements on a long term to ensure uninterrupted supply of vaccines,” KTR stated. Telangana government would facilitate land as required in the Genome Valley, which has emerged as the vaccine hub, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/establish-vax-testing-facility-in-city-ktr-to-centre/articleshow/83696632.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Chandigarh||PGI study on pancreatitis mgmt gets global acclaim||Times News Network Chandigarh: For the first time globally, the department of surgical gastroenterology, PGI published a path-breaking study, which has established the role of streptokinase in the management of the dreaded severe acute pancreatitis disease. Prof Rajesh Gupta, head of the department of surgical gastroenterology, PGIMER stated, “Streptokinase has been used since early 1960’s for dissolution of intravascular thrombosis in Pulmonary thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, and deep vein thrombosis. The department of surgical gastroenterology, in close collaboration with the department of medical gastroenterology started off-label use of streptokinase in 2013. The idea to use streptokinase in patients of severe acute pancreatitis was conceptualised after we observed its successful use in chest collections by pulmonologists.” He added, “We first conducted experimental work in 2013 to look at the effect of streptokinase on pancreatic necrosis removed at the time of surgery and results were heartening. This encouraged us to use Streptokinase in two patients who were critical and not fit for surgery. We observed that the addition of streptokinase in irrigation fluid in the abdominal drain led to gradual improvement in their clinical condition and both patients recovered without the need of surgery. We published this work in a top journal of pancreatic disease in 2014, namely, Pancreatotology.” Researchers subsequently planned the first study in 2015 and later conducted three more studies. “Results of our study have clearly shown that there was a significant decrease in the need of surgery with the use of streptokinase and there was no increase in complications with its use, which were major apprehensions. Ours is the first large study involving more than 100 patients where streptokinase has been proven efficacious in the management of severe pancreatitis with infected necrosis. We have observed that results of Streptokinase were better with higher doses,” said Prof Rajesh. The team has recently completed another study where they compared the use of streptokinase with hydrogen peroxide and found encouraging results with streptokinase. “This study is at present under consideration of another prominent journal. Now, we are planning a bigger study involving various surgical and medical gastroenterology departments in different parts of the country. This is the first time in the world that streptokinase has been found to be a useful adjunct in the management of severe acute pancreatitis,” said Prof Rajesh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-study-on-pancreatitis-mgmt-gets-global-acclaim/articleshow/83698421.cms||Shimona Kanwar

They have demanded that the administration scrap the tender and issue separate tenders for different works in the project.As per the detailed project report, a 150km pipeline network would be laid in these villages. The project also involves the construction of three sewage treatment plants.“The works are of different types, so the agencies executing them should be different. Asking one agency to carry out all types of work is not good — it’s not healthy. It appears that the tender was issued keeping a specific agency in mind,” Prithviraj Sutar, leader of Shiv Sena in PMC, alleged.Senior PMC officials have refuted the allegation and said no agency has been appointed. They said the bidding process was still on and that the picture would become clear in a week’s time.“Better coordination of all the is the only reason behind this amalgamation. Though the works are of a different nature, they are interlinked. Holding one agency responsible would make it easier,” a senior civic official said.He said multiple bidders have shown interest in the project. “There are a few more days for interested parties to submit their bids,” the official said.The proposal to merge 34 villages in PMC limits was approved in 2013-14, but no progress was made until a citizens’ group — Haveli Taluka Nagari Kriti Samiti — moved the Bombay high court. An HC directive ensured that 11 villages were merged in 2017 — nine partly and two — Uruli and Phursungi — completely. This increased the population in PMC limits by 2 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drainage-project-tender-for-11-villages-draws-oppn-flak/articleshow/83698432.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: No vaccine, no schools, says parents||HYDERABAD: Is the decision to reopen schools physically in Telangana taken in haste? At least parents think so as they say that it is very early to reopen educational institutions, especially schools, and added that the state should not experiment with and risk the lives of children, who are yet to be vaccinated. They said that the state is trying to help managements to collect fees under various heads by reopening schools in July. “We all know what happened when the state reopened physical classes for students of class 6 and above during the end of last academic year. Schools have turned into hotspots and affected children, teachers, and other staff along with parents. When we are just coming out of the second wave, it is hard to understand why the government is being reckless and is paving a way for the third wave by opening educational institutions,” said K Venkata Sainath of Hyderabad Schools Parents Association, adding that just like last year managements will collect fees and leave students to their fate afterward. They termed reopening schools for physical classes at this stage as ambitious and added that the state should rethink its decision as it is only going to help managements. “It’s way too early and ambitious. We definitely can’t afford to experiment on children who are not yet vaccinated. They should wait until the vaccine is given to children and continue only with online or digital classes,” said Sangeetha Rao, parent of a class 8 student studying in a well-known ICSE school in the city. She said that at least for those with access to online classes, the last academic year went smoothly and the same should be continued this year as well. Parents said that children are already scared after seeing their family members and others suffering from Covid-19 with some even experiencing it first-hand as they themselves tested positive. They said that children should not be exposed to anymore trauma by asking them to live in fear of catching the virus and spreading it to their loved ones by attending schools. Parents further said that with monsoon ahead, it would be very hard to differentiate between common cold, fever and Covid-19 and students will be forced to go through unnecessary medical tests and also miss classes. They said that it would be hard to maintain social distancing even if a class with the strength of 45 to 50 students is divided into two or three parts and for children to wear masks and follow Covid-19 guidelines for the entire day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-vaccine-no-schools-parents/articleshow/83696670.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Chandigarh||When Milkha rooted: 'Bhaag, Labh, Bhaag'||Chandigarh: Among the thousands and thousands of Indians who listened to the radio commentary of the 1960 race in Rome and rooted for Milkha Singh was a young Labh Singh, who had no idea of Olympics but, seeing the atmosphere, swore to go to its next edition. "It was Milkha Singh who inspired me to work hard and aim for glory,” recalls now Brigadier Labh Singh, who later competed in the men’s triple jump event at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Milkha's last. About memories shared with The Flying Sikh, he said: At the pre-Tokyo national camp in 1963, held at NIS-Patiala's, I met him for the first time. He was sports director in Punjab and, being the only Army officers of the contingent, we alone were lodged in the Maharaja guest room. Later, we were room mates in the Olympic Village.” The brigadier said: “To be with my hero was surreal. I found him so nice. He always talked to me, motivated me. A simple human truthful about everything, he used to say: 'There's no easy way about anything. This is your first Olympics. Try to be the best but don't lose heart if the result doesn't go your way. Your coach will tell you a lot of things but always believe in yourself and put no limits on your practice.' I understood the philosophy of training from him.” In the 1970 Asian Games at Bangkok, where brigadier Labh Singh won two medals (triple jump silver and long jump bronze), Mikha cheered him from the stands. "I could hear him shouting: ‘Come on Labh’. He was so happy for me," recalled the brigadier, who also won triple jump bronze at the 1966 Games.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/when-milkha-rooted-bhaag-labh-bhaag/articleshow/83698428.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Farmer’s daughter creates cricketing history in Bristol||KOLKATA/DEHRADUN: Sneh Rana’s fighting knock of unbeaten 80 at No. 8 helped India draw the one-off Test against England in Bristol on Saturday In the process, she became the first Indian woman and fourth overall to have both a fifty plus score and a 4-wicket haul on Test debut. Sneh, 27, hails from a farmer’s family in Sinaula on the outskirts of Dehradun. What made the 27-year-old’s performance stand out was the fact that she turned out for India Women just two months after her father Bhagwan Singh Rana’s death due to heart attack. “She was very upset after papa passed away, but did not give up training,” elder sister Ruchi said. “It was like a balm for her, even though we knew she was in distress.”“She was very upset after papa passed away, but did not give up training,” elder sister Ruchi said. “It was like a balm for her, even though we knew she was in distress.” Sneh was out of India reckoning for five years and has just returned to all formats after a gap of five years. Sneh’s journey started as a nine-year-old at the Little Masters Cricket Academy. She was picked during a talent search tournament in Sinaula. “She was too shy to play in front of us. Our academy coach Kiran Sah coaxed her to bat. She was exceptional,” coach Narendra Sah, Kiran’s husband, said. “Sneh has given a fitting tribute to her father through her performance which has incidentally come just a day before Father’s Day,” said Kiran. “It is an extremely proud moment for all of us and a reward for Sneh’s decade-long dedication and hard work. She came to me for coaching when she was nine years old,” said Shah. “Sneh has given a fitting tribute to her father through her performance which has incidentally come just a day before Father’s Day,” said Kiran.“She was very upset after papa passed away, but did not give up training,” elder sister Ruchi said. “It was like a balm for her, even though we knew she was in distress.” Sneh was out of India reckoning for five years and has just returned to all formats after a gap of five years.

Recalling how Sneh got moulded into an all-rounder, Kiran said, “In our academy, girls are forced to face the pace bowling of big boys and that is why they get to hone different aspects of their cricketing skills.” Sneh went on to play for Haryana and Punjab in the U-19 and senior levels before being selected for Railways. She made her India debut in 2014. The road to this day has not been an easy one for Sneh. A knee injury and a string of poor performances saw her fall out of favour with the selectors. Until Wednesday, Sneh had played 12 limited overs matches for India, having made her international debut against Sri Lanka in 2014. Her only appearance away from home was in the 2016 ODI tour of Australia and her last T20I match was against Sri Lanka at home that year. However, Sneh did not lose hope. Determined to make a comeback, she joined the Abhimanyu Cricket Academy. “She was recovering from a knee injury, and I got her connected to the U Mumba kabaddi team physio. She gradually recovered and started working on her all-round game,” said coach Manoj Rawat. “I spoke to her almost every day during the Test and encouraged her to prove herself as a batter.” An all-format pick for the tour, Sneh returned to the side on the back of her domestic performance in the 50-over format earlier this year. She led Railways in the league stage and was the highest wicket taker with 18 scalps. With the bat, her 160 runs at a strike-rate of 123.07 in the middle-order was pivotal to their victorious campaign. “She is very cool as a leader and never panics in difficult situations. She reads the game very well,” Railways’ teammate Shubh Lakshmi Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/farmers-daughter-creates-cricketing-history/articleshow/83694835.cms||Kathakali Banerjee
---||Hyderabad||Govt trying to save aid: Pvt schools||Hyderabad: Not just the parents, but even many private school managements are not completely on board with the state’s decision to physically reopen schools from July 1 as they claim that the government is reopening schools only to save financial aid, Rs 2,000 per month and 25 kg rice, being provided to private teachers. They questioned why the state is planning to reopen schools when no one has demanded to resume physical classes, especially when the experts are claiming that the third wave is going to affect children the most. “It is shocking that the state is planning to reopen schools for physical classes. We don’t know why the state is ready to risk lives of students, teachers and others involved by reopening schools,” said S Srinivas Reddy, former president of Telangana Recognised School Management Association (TRSMA). He said that the only reason that they can think of behind reopening schools is to save financial aid given to states. In the last two months, the state government has provided financial aid to 2.4 lakh teachers working in recognized private schools in the state. About Rs 120 crore is spent to provide this aid to date. Managements said that they were busy preparing to start online classes and added that the state’s announcement on reopening schools has come as a shocker to them. “It’s like a miracle for us. We were not expecting such a decision and hope that everything will run smoothly,” said K Umamaheshwar Rao, correspondent, Nightingale High School. Rao, who is running his schools for the last three decades said that the managements will try their best to run schools, but is not sure if parents will be willing to send their wards to schools. They also questioned what would happen to teachers if schools have to shut down again in a month or two because of Covid-19 cases. With guidelines yet to be released, they said that the state should first start classes only for higher class students and subsequently decide on classes for younger students based on the outcome. Some of the managements, however, said that the move will reduce learning loss, help teachers and managements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-trying-to-save-aid-pvt-schools/articleshow/83696708.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Delhi||Delhi Police get nod to keep drug kingpin Sharafat Sheikh in custody for a year||NEW DELHI: In a first-of-its-kind case, Delhi Police’s Crime Branch has received the nod to keep drug lord Sharafat Sheikh in preventive custody for one year under Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (PITNDPS) Act. This Act is not used frequently by police because of the stringent process put in place to get the required approval. “The basic objective of this preventive detention law is to target the main operators such as organisers, financiers, kingpins and others who generally remain and operate behind the scene,” DCP (crime) Chinmoy Biswal said. The approval requires ratification by a central advisory board comprising of three high court judges, headed by Chief Justice of Delhi high court, which conducts almost like a mini-trial to judge the merits of the case. On its recommendation, the central government gives the final approval. Sheikh, currently lodged in Tihar Jail, was first arrested in a criminal case in 1986. He went to jail, met drug traffickers there and got lured into the trade. “He began his foray into the illegal trade as a peddler but soon climbed up the ladder to become one of the top suppliers of heroin in Delhi/NCR,” said the DCP. “His family is also involved in drug trafficking and numerous cases have been registered against them for selling of drugs,” he added. “Of late, he had become active again, but was operating through conduits. As the illicit drug trafficking activities clandestinely organised by him were needed to be curbed immediately, the provisions of PITNDPS Act were invoked,” Biswal said. A proposal was prepared by Narcotics Cell, Crime Branch and sent to the revenue department of the Union finance ministry for approval, said an officer. Keeping in view his active involvement in drug trafficking cases, the proposal was put up before a screening committee comprising of six members, headed by the Narcotics Control Bureau chief.  The committee found it fit and orders were subsequently issued. Further, the detention order was ratified by the central advisory board. Officials explained preventive detention under the 1988 Act was neither a substitute for the normal laws nor intended to be used in lieu of such laws.  This additional weapon in the armoury of the law enforcement agencies is aimed at organised trafficking of drugs. Sheikh went to jail after his drug trafficking racket was busted last year. In July 2020, his associates were caught while trafficking heroin. During their interrogation, it emerged that Sheikh had joined the trade again. Sheikh was even found operating from Tihar Jail in 2007 through his family members.  His call to his son and brother to negotiate a deal by paying Rs 9,000 was intercepted and his brother was caught red-handed. Many of his family members, including his former wife, were subsequently arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-get-nod-to-keep-drug-kingpin-in-custody-for-a-year/articleshow/83698495.cms||---

NSUI Telangana president Balmoor Venkat on Sunday said the decision of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to reopen educational institutions, including schools and colleges, from July 1 might result in the spread of coronavirus at a faster rate and could advance the projected third wave. “Medical experts have already warned that the third wave will have an impact on children. The state government should withdraw its decision on reopening of schools and colleges from July 1 in the larger interests of students and their parents,” Venkat said. NSUI would launch state-wide agitations if the government did not reconsider its decision. “The state should not play with the lives of students. Bangaru Telangana can be achieved only if the youth are healthy, alive and kicking with enthusiasm,” the NSUI state president said. NSUI members would not hesitate to block the movement of TRS leaders in their respective constituencies if the government goes ahead with its decision before vaccination of all the students, Venkat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nsui-to-oppose-reopening-of-schools-and-colleges/articleshow/83696750.cms||---

---||Business||Empowering women: More companies now offer medical cover for egg freezing||MUMBAI: Offering a medical cover to employees for egg-freezing has found favour with more companies. Accenture India and WeWork India are among the new ones to offer this benefit to their employees. Egg-freezing, or egg-harvesting, is a rather expensive treatment that involves preservation of a woman’s eggs to be used later for childbearing. In 2017, only 2% of the Working Mother & Avtar ‘Best Companies for Women’ offered medical cover for egg-freezing. The percentage rose to 5% in 2018 and, in 2020, there were 11% companies (roughly 35 in number) offering the benefit. Avtar founder Saundarya Rajesh said, “Egg-freezing is the placing of the power of choice in the hands of women professionals, to help them beat the biological clock.” While 53% of the Working Mother & Avtar Best Companies for Women have some form of support to employees and their partners for infertility treatment, 11% offer medical cover for egg-freezing. This indeed provides women the freedom to choose their motherhood window, but the idea is yet to gain traction in India, where daughters are given the mantra of ‘earlier the better’.” In the conflict between pursuing career goals versus responding to the societal and familial pressure of childbearing, Rajesh said it takes a lot of effort on the part of the woman to even suggest the idea of egg-freezing. Breaking stereotypes, such policies are gender-neutral at Accenture. Lakshmi C, MD and lead (HR) at Accenture in India, said, “According to studies, one out of six couples in urban India face challenges with fertility and seek medical interventions, which can be expensive and complex. Our enhanced medical cover, which includes fertility and surrogacy treatments, is aimed at supporting our people in their journey towards parenthood and is available to all our people and their partners.” WeWork India, which caters to a predominantly millennial workforce with an average age of 31 years, has 47% women employees. Priti Shetty, head of people at WeWork India, said, “In addition to providing our women employees with an environment that empowers them with skills, growth needs recognition, etc, we also introduced infertility cover to our existing group medical policy lately. This includes coverage up to Rs 1 lakh on IPD/OPD basis per family, including egg-harvesting and egg-freezing treatments. The medical coverage of ‘egg-freezing’ treatment empowers our women employees to have reproductive autonomy, which is every woman’s right as they channel through their personal and professional life and can feel liberated to make a decision as and when they deem fit.” While one would assume women are delaying childbearing with egg-freezing benefits because of the pandemic, an industry expert said, on the contrary, most parents in India who use these benefits are keen on starting a family almost immediately. Harvesting of eggs can cost anywhere between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh for retrieval, in addition to annual charges of storage.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: With waterlogging, potholes appear on many stretches||KOLKATA: Severe waterlogging has wreaked havoc on some of the city’s arterial roads. Some of the worst stretches of roads that have developed craters and are crying for an urgent repair include Asutosh Mukherjee Road (Bhowanipore), Harish Mukherjee Road, Chittaranjan Avenue, APC Roy Road, Motilal Gupta Road (Behala) and NSC Bose Road (Tollygunge) among others. Some of these arterial roads were dug up before the arrival of monsoon for laying water pipes or repairing other underground utility services. For instance, the stretches of Harish Mukherjee Road (near SSKM Hospital) and Asutosh Mukherjee were dug up for the laying of water pipes. According to a Kolkata Municipal Corporation official, the roads department had taken up a repair drive of several dug up roads but the work could not be completed before the arrival of monsoon. Motorists or bikers, however, are complaining about the poor condition of major thoroughfares and demanding an immediate repair work. Abir Bose, a resident of Girish Park, had a narrow escape while returning home on Saturday evening as his bike hit a pothole and overturned. “I couldn’t figure out the pothole as it was filled with rain water. My bike overturned but I was saved somehow,” Bose said. A KMC civil engineering department official said that the stretches of Chittaranjan Avenue had developed several potholes and the civic body’s roads department would have to do a thorough repair. Sumit Jaiswal a resident of Tollygunge, who works for a food delivery app, faced a similar plight on Motilal Gupta Road — an arterial road that connects Tollygunge with Behala — on Sunday morning. “I was in a hurry to deliver food at Behala Chowrasta and hence dodged multiple craters on the entire stretch of the road. Finally, I failed to dodge one and my bike overturned. I received injuries but was saved luckily,” Jaiswal said. Several residents from Behala, Tollygunge, Bhowanipore, Central Avenue and Mahatma Gandhi Road have complained to their respective ward coordinators, seeking their intervention in repairing the roads. Kolkata traffic police too has taken note of such public grievances and communicated the same to the civic brass, urging them for an immediate intervention. A senior KMC official in the roads department said that some roads had been damaged due to excessive rains and that the civic body had already taken up patchwork repair on the stretches where several craters came up. “We have taken up patchwork in several stretches of major roads. We are waiting for a few dry spells when we will be able to properly repair the roads ravaged by rains,” said the KMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/with-waterlogging-potholes-appear-on-many-stretches/articleshow/83698476.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Chandigarh||Govt art museum: The story of an oyster and its pearls||A Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu wisely said that ‘In the midst of chaos there is also opportunity’ and what better examples than Chandigarh itself as also the Government Museum and Art Gallery. Before the Partition in 1947, an impressive collection of art objects was housed in the Central Museum, Lahore. After the Partition, the collection was divided and 40% percent consisting mainly of Gandharan sculptures and Indian miniature paintings came to India. Received in 1949, this collection was shifted from Amritsar to Shimla, then Patiala and finally to Chandigarh. Over a period of time, Dr M S Randhawa painstakingly added Pahari miniature paintings, modern and Indian contemporary art; so that by the time the collection was displayed in the current building, it was at par with leading museums of India. Besides these, we now have a collection of Indian gold, silver and copper coins, some good examples of Indian textiles, rare terracotta figurines, jewellery, pottery and some fine examples of contemporary Indian sculptures, paintings and graphics made by renowned artists of the respective fields. The museum has a history as intriguing as its exhibits. When the need was felt to finally house the wandering Lahore collection in Chandigarh, a proposal for a new museum building was included in the third five year plan of Chandigarh capital project scheme. Apart from the buildings at Capitol Complex, Le Corbusier has only designed the buildings of the cultural zone - the art college, and the museum and art gallery. His plan was approved by the Museum Advisory Committee in 1961 but unfortunately in 1962 India was attacked by China and emergency was announced, forcing the Punjab government to defer the construction of the museum. Dr Randhawa persuaded the then Chief Minister that Chandigarh without a museum would be incomplete as apart from being a major tourist attraction it would be linked with the educational setup of the state and people would get a background of the history of northern India in a visual form. Also, since the construction of the building had already been started, the firm of contractors filed a suit against the Punjab government. The combined power of Dr Randhawa and legalities led to the revival of the construction. Simultaneously, the collection from Patiala was brought to Chandigarh and housed in the newly completed arts college adjoining the museum building. The project hit another roadblock with Corbusier’s sudden demise in August 1965 with Pierre Jeanneret too leaving for Geneva soon after. Credit goes to the Indian team of architects – especially S D Sharma, who worked devotedly to maintain Corbusier’s spirit, taking utmost care to see that every detail made was in keeping with the original philosophy and design. Corbusier was working on the idea of a museum building that could be expanded as its collection grew - the museum of unlimited growth. There are only three versions of this type of ‘Corbusian’ museum in the world and Dr Randhawa credited himself for the Chandigarh museum being the best of the trilogy as he suggested many modifications in the design and detailing which Corbusier surprisingly agreed to! The building addressed two critical requirements - adequate lighting for the museum collections as well as climatic control for hot humid conditions. The three levels of the museum are connected by a generous ramp with interior spaces of varying volumes and heights flowing into one another, allowing a certain transparency in the austere concrete interiors. No wonder it is considered a fine example of museums as architectural masterpieces where the building itself is a work of art. The museum was finally inaugurated with much fanfare in May 1968. Dr Randhawa was right that Chandigarh without the museum would be a city without soul and that people without exposing their hearts and minds to works of art cannot be elevated to the higher creative planes’. Dr B N Goswamy summed up the holistic value of the museum brilliantly “When one becomes aware of what the museum has in its collection, one begins to see the great building of Le Corbusier in a new light, one sees it as an oyster that safely houses a priceless pearl.” The writer is director, Le Corbusier Centre||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/govt-art-museum-the-story-of-an-oyster-and-its-pearls/articleshow/83698492.cms||---

In its latest public notice, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has said that such vehicles would be seized if the owners failed to take necessary action. “It has come to our notice that two-wheelers, three-wheelers and even four-wheelers are left unattended in different parts of the city. Such vehicles cause public nuisance, including disruption of vehicular movement and hinder daily cleaning activities of the sanitation staff,” the AMC said. Notably, the drive against such automobiles is planned ahead of the official teams’ scheduled visit for the annual Swachh survey. Significantly, the Bombay high court, in March 2019, had asked for levying of Rs 50/hour fine on vehicles abandoned on the roadside. The court had referred to the section 201 of the Motor Vehicles (MV) Act, 1988, which stipulates such penalty against whoever keeps a disabled vehicle in any public place, in such a manner, so as to cause impediment to the free flow of traffic. Welcoming the proposed drive, a section of citizens said the AMC should help them in getting rid of abandoned vehicles. “The junk vehicles occupy space that can be otherwise utilised by the locals. Despite many humble requests, owners often do not remove such vehicles. Even our locality had witnessed clashes over such vehicles,” said Pramod Shelke, a resident of the N-3 area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/amc-warns-of-crackdown-on-junk-vehicles/articleshow/83694865.cms||---

It is just Rs 7,500 per month, that is Rs 250 per day. This is not even half of a daily wager’s pay. A labourer gets paid Rs 600 to Rs 800 for eight hours while intern doctors get paid Rs 250 for a 12-hour shift in which they are risking their lives amid the pandemic,” said a medical intern at Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) who took part in a recent candle march at the college. On Sunday, there was another large demonstration outside the GDMC's administrative building. Demanding a salary equivalent to what central medical colleges pay to their interns which is Rs 23,500 per month, medical interns said that they will soon intensify their protest and also floated a Twitter hashtag #onenationonestipend to get more traction for their demand. Soon after Sunday's protest, the interns of all government medical colleges - GDMC, Srinagar Medical College and Haldwani Medical College - decided that only half of them will work in medical colleges in shifts. “We are in Covid duty and cannot leave our work. But, we have given four days' time to the medical college authorities to increase our stipend. If they don't, we will quit the work,” said another intern from Sushila Tiwari Medical College in Haldwani.  GDMC principal Dr Ashutosh Sayana told TOI the medical college was working with the first batch of medical interns who were admitted in the college in 2016 and passed this year. “We have already approached the state with a suggestion of an increase in stipend for these interns,” Sayana said, adding that in Himachal Pradesh, medical interns get Rs 17,000 while in Uttar Pradesh it is around Rs 12,000 and in Delhi, it is Rs 23,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/medical-interns-protest-say-they-earn-less-than-a-daily-wage-labourer-in-ukhand/articleshow/83694934.cms||Ishita Mishra

Besides, a large number of fruits have been infected by pests or pecked by birds, they added. Speaking to TOI, Rahul Singh, a farmer from Ramgarh, said that over 90% of the apples in his orchard are ruined. “The condition is so bad that we can’t even give them away, let alone selling them in the market. The district has been receiving rainfall since April but in the last few days, the intensity of precipitation has increased, ruining our produce further,” he said. Singh added that not only apples but even peaches and plums have suffered massive damage. “When the fruits were at an early stage in April and May, there were hailstorms and massive rainfall. Almost every farmer in the region depends on fruit farming but the condition this year is worse than ever before,” he said. Mahesh Galliya, another farmer from the region, said that the fruits need decent sunlight for growth but because of overcast conditions, they are developing brownish spots at the nodes. “This is the fruiting season and the rain spells and the lack of sunlight over the last three days are now starting to affect the fruits. Many of these have started developing brownish spots near the nodes. The entire crop may get ruined if it doesn't get proper sunlight in the next few days,” he said. The district officials however maintained that they are assessing the situation and will take the necessary steps once the extent of the damage is known. “Every help will be provided to the farmers,” an official from the horticulture department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumaon-farmers-say-almost-50-of-apple-peach-and-other-crops-damaged-due-to-incessant-rainfall/articleshow/83694953.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Pune||PCMC analysis shows 43% deaths in non-comorbid patients||PUNE: A Covid death analysis by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation from April 1 to May 31 showed that 627 (43%) deaths occurred against the 1,482 analysed of the total 1,727 reported in four government and private hospitals in the area were among non-comorbid people. Over 400 deaths (65%) were below 60 years of age, which according to the report, is new and alarming. Municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said the study indicates that persons who do not have co-morbidities are at risk and they must mind Covid appropriate behaviour. They must not be under the false impression that lack of co-morbidity puts them at lesser risk of disease, he added. The report added that 53% of the total deaths in the study period had occurred in persons below 60 years, striking off the common presumption, that deaths occur more in older-age groups. Patil told TOI, “We have to focus more on awareness to avoid loss of lives in any future Covid wave. We are doing so. A lockdown is not the solution to stop the virus nor it is sustainable. Hence, we have started fever clinics and testing centres across wards for early detection of the infection.” They have vigilance committees for each ward to identify hotspots and initiate containment measures early. “The ward Covid centres are also being identified and they too will be functional. They will give positive patients an option to pick from institutional quarantine at ward-level,” he said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospitals Board of India, said such an analysis is necessary for information for the medical experts and the administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-analysis-shows-43-deaths-in-non-comorbid-patients/articleshow/83698591.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The traders’ association of Satyanarayan Park AC market in Burrabazar organised a vaccination camp last week and it became one of the first markets in the city to vaccinate every trader, their employees and the support staff. Traders’ association at Bagri Market has vaccinated almost 350 people till Saturday in a government facility. Traders’ associations in Posta, Mehta Building, ChandniMarket, Lohapatti and New market are either working closely with the government to get their members vaccinated or organising inoculation drives on their own. “Last week we inoculated everybody working in the 300 shops of the market at a two-day vaccination drive,” said Rajiv Changoiwala, executive member of the Satyanarayan Park AC Market Shopkeepers’ Welfare Association. The restrictions imposed by the government on markets were eased last week but the market committees were asked to speed up the vaccination process. “The government is helping us vaccinate thousands of labourers, drivers and helpers in Posta. We aim to vaccinate everybody as early as possible,” said Chandan Chakraborty, president of the traders’ association in Posta. Bagri Market on Canning Street started the vaccination drive at a government facility on June 7. Till Saturday, 254 people were vaccinated. “We are aiming to get all the shop owners, their staff and others, engaged in the renovation of the market, vaccinated,” said Asutosh Singh, president of the Bagri Market Central Kolkata Traders’ Welfare Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mkt-committees-hold-vax-camps-for-traders/articleshow/83698605.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Mumbai||Makeover for Mumbai's only hospital for railway cops, Rs 60 lakh set aside for facility||MUMBAI: The only hospital for railway police personnel at Ghatkopar is undergoing a transformation. The hospital, which has been in a state of disrepair, has been allocated Rs 60 lakh by a private bank for an upgrade. Once renovated, it will have specialists offering consultations for patients, a pathology lab and a pharmacy among other services. Located in the middle of a railway police colony, about 800 families from the vicinity can use the facility. The hospital will serve the railway police whose 3,200 personnel and 2,000 home guards working with railways. Work has begun on the structure which has a 2,400-sq-ft ground floor and a 1,000 sq-ft mezzanine. “The hospital was functioning out of old barracks and did not have adequate infrastructure so far. We had a visiting doctor and a few nurses. But the upgrade should be completed by the end of the year,” said deputy commissioner of Government Railway Police, Pradeep Chavan. It’s a ‘day hospital’ — meaning no patients are admitted. “We plan to rope in specialists for consultation for a few hours daily. X-ray, sonography and ECG machines will be set up,” Chavan added. The railway police are also trying to arrange to rope in a dentist at the hospital. Commissioner Quaiser Khalid’s intention is to offer all medical services under one roof for railway police personnel. men, at discounted rates. Work is on to construct rooms to stock medicines and other equipment. A pharmacy and a dedicated ambulance service for the facility are also on the cards, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/makeover-for-mumbai-city-only-hospital-for-railway-cops-rs-60l-set-aside-for-facility/articleshow/83702463.cms||Nitasha Natu

The city received over 1 lakh doses of the vaccine on Sunday which could give a push to the drive. BMC’s additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said BMC has changed the routine as it was pointed out that there cannot be only walk-in or online days. “Those wanting to take the first Covishield dose can take an online appointment or walk-in,” he said. The city has received 1.11 lakh doses of Covishield. Kakani said the doses allotted to centres have been tripled since vaccine stocks arrived. BMC is mulling over prioritizing vaccination for sections of the population. “...We may prioritize people [between 18-29] who come in contact with many others like vendors, drivers, after deliberation,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-50-of-covid-vax-via-e-appointment/articleshow/83700767.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Chandigarh||Careless Chandigarh gifting Covid third life||CHANDIGARH: Dire warnings of an impending third wave of Covid-19 are not spooking people thronging markets, huddling together in groups and even visiting hospitals without facemasks. On Saturday, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria had said it out loud and clear: a third wave is inevitable and could hit the country earlier than expected. “It usually takes 4-5 months for a subsequent wave to peak. But given the way people are crowding in the markets and malls without following any Covid-appropriate behaviour, I feel a third wave may hit earlier, possibly in 12 to 16 weeks,” Guleria had warned. And, residents — by their carelessness — are making sure the city is not spared from the deadly virus time too. Be it shopping hubs like sectors 17, 18, 19 and 22, or the sectors 17 and 43 bus stands, finding a person with a mask fitted properly is not easy. Many, including traders, are wearing masks in a manner that leave their noses exposed. Social distancing is almost non-existent. “Last time, there was laxity and we faced the consequences. This time if the same carelessness is shown, we will have the surge soon,” said Prof PVM Lakshmi, department of community medicine and school for public health, PGI. The city had started opening up around a week back, with restrictions being lifted. While the easing of the limits has brought smiles on the faces of shopkeepers, the authorities have put up their hands in making people abide by Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Police and the other authorities cannot do anything without the support of the common public. Everybody can’t be put behind jails,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida. Knowing that probably and tired of being cooped up in their homes for weeks, people are stepping out freely, meeting friends, holding get-togethers and shopping while ignoring precautions and those dire warnings that could land them and their families in trouble.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/careless-city-gifting-covid-third-life/articleshow/83698572.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 34% of RAT results false negatives, reveals study||MUMBAI: An analysis of negative rapid antigen tests (RAT) that came positive when retested with RT-PCR has proved that RAT missed up to 33.7% cases. The finding assumes significance since RAT accounts for more than 60% of the daily Covid-19 tests in the state, being preferred for its ease of use and shorter turnaround time. The study was based on field data from tests conducted at ICMR-National Institute of Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) between July 7 and August 7, 2020. The institute studied its own database of 412 antigen negative reports that were retested with RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), the gold standard test to detect coronavirus. It found that the repeat RT-PCR could pick up 139 positives (33.7%) that were missed by antigen. Of the 139 positives, 91 (65%) were symptomatic, while 48 (27%) were asymptomatic. The asymptomatic cases included people who were subjected to a Covid test as they were high-risk contacts of confirmed cases, people in police custody, pregnant women, newborns and patients who were to undergo a surgery. The highest positivity of 45% was found in high-risk contacts, followed by 33.3% in individuals hospitalised for pre-operative or other medical conditions, 22.2% in pregnant women and 12.2% among police custody individuals. “Confirmation of antigen negative tested individuals by RT-PCR, especially for asymptomatic or high-risk groups, is critical for prompt isolation and clinical management,” the paper that was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology stated. Lead author Kiran Munne underlined that the RAT for Covid-19 showed lower sensitivity than RT-PCR test both for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. According to Dr Smita Mahale, co-author and former director of ICMR-NIRRH, the findings are significant since the extent of ‘false negatives’ is proved from data from real world settings. “People need to be educated that an antigen negative test is not a stamp of being infection-free. If the person has symptoms or is a high-risk contact, he/she must be sensitised about the need to get tested again, or that the symptoms could be lurking,” she said. The researcher added that the RT-PCR test must be the weapon of choice to break the chain of transmission. The state is carrying out an average of 2.4 lakh tests of which around 1.3 lakh are antigen tests and the rest are RT-PCR tests. In a TOI report last week, Dr Pradeep Awate, the state surveillance expert, had said RAT has been increased to cover hotspots in rural areas, where the reach of laboratories was limited. In districts such as Amravati, up to 84% tests are done using antigen method, while it’s as high as 91% in Bhandara and 87% in Gadchiroli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/34-of-rat-results-false-negatives-reveals-study/articleshow/83702481.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The daily cases in Cidco division, which reported 280 cases per day on an average in May, has now reduced to 22 new cases per day between June 14 and 20. Similarly, Panchavati division, which reported 258 cases per day on an average in May, has reduced to 20 cases per day during the last week.Nashik Road now records 16 cases per day on average whereas, in May, the division added 240 cases per day. Of the 2.25 lakh Covid cases reported so far in the city, around 1.09 lakh cases were from Cidco and Panchavati divisions alone, while 52,000 cases were from Nashik Road division. The rest of 64,000 cases were reported from the remaining three divisions - Nashik East, Nashik West and Satpur divisions. According to Charudatta Jagtap, the medical officer of NMC, the positivity rate has drastically reduced during the last few days even though the number of Covid test being conducted is the same. “People crowding at the market places, especially on weekends, have stopped due to government restrictions. Usually, there are greater chances of Covid spread on weekends as people tend to go out with their families on weekends,” he said. “We have also increased testing of people to detect Covid patients. Moreover, residents also come forward to get themselves tested, ”he said. Awareness about maintaining Covid appropriate behaviour has also increased among the residents, which also led to the drop in cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cidco-panchavati-divisions-report-further-drop-in-cases/articleshow/83694999.cms||Tushar Pawar

Lasalgaon APMC has conducted over 2,250 rapid antigen tests of farmers and traders during the last four weeks, and all samples have tested negative for Covid. Around 20,000 quintal of onions are auctioned every day at Lasalgaon. According to Narendra Wadhawane, secretary of Lasalgaon APMC, around 90% of the farmers coming to the APMC had already got tested for Covid-19 due to which rapid tests were conducted on 10% of the remaining farmers. “We are taking all safety measures including screening of farmers coming to the APMCs. Moreover, APMC premises are sanitized on a daily basis as part of precautionary measures,” he said. Meanwhile, Nashik APMC has conducted over 2,000 antigen tests and 10 of them were tested positive. Shalom Saiyyad, medical officer of Nashik APMC, said, “We are regularly conducting rapid antigen tests of farmers, and only few farmers have been tested positive during the last four weeks. “Only those farmers, who are asymptomatic, are coming to sell their vegetables at the Nashik APMC. Awareness about Covid-19 has increased among the farmers. Those farmers having symptoms like fever or cold are avoiding coming to the APMC to sell their produce,” she said. “Most of the farmers coming to APMC have already tested themselves for Covid. This is also the reason why only few farmers have tested Covid positive,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-apmcs-continue-with-covid-preventive-measures/articleshow/83694988.cms||Tushar Pawar

The number of Covid patients under home isolation has reduced from 1,934 patients on May 31 to 464 patients on June 20. Of the total 1,326 active patients in the city, 862 patients are undergoing treatment in civic and private hospitals, while the rest are in home isolation. According to the officials of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), there has been a huge drop in the number of fresh cases in the last three to four weeks. Hence, the number of patients in home isolation has also reduced. Those asymptomatic patients, who have facilities or additional rooms, are allowed to home isolate. The city recorded the first Covid patient on April 6, 2020, then the cases started to increase. Only 5% of the total active patients were home isolated by June last year, but the trend increased with the relaxation by the government.  In August, last year, 25% of the active patients were in home isolation. But the trend increased further and 50% of the total active patients took treatment from their homes. Charudatta Jagtap, a medical officer of NMC, said the Covid situation has improved. “The number of daily cases have dropped significantly during the last one-and-a-half month. Moreover, the number of patients in home isolation has also reduced due to the rise in the recovery rate and drop in positivity rate,” he said. “Asymptomatic patients, who have facilities to be quarantined at home, are in home isolation. But the number of patients under home isolation has drastically reduced due to a drop in new cases,” said Jagtap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/76-drop-in-home-isolated-covid-patients-in-nashik-city/articleshow/83695039.cms||Tushar Pawar

Police identified him as Anand Sharma, 49, of Mogappair East in Chennai. He had befriended the 48-year-old survivor, who is mother of three children, on a dating app. She had separated from her second husband. He introduced himself as a divorced single-parent working for the Chennai firm and promised to help the woman start a business. He promised to marry her and also help her get a divorce from her second husband. “On September 19, 2020, Sharma invited the woman to a luxury hotel in Coimbatore on the pretext of discussing business and raped her. In March 2021, the woman came to know that Sharma was not a divorcee and had also cheated other women. When she tried to meet Sharma, his elder brother Prabhat Sharma threatened her with dire consequences if she told anyone about the incident,” a police officer said. Based on her complaint, inspector Badrunnisa Begum registered a case against Sharma under Section 376 (1) (punishment for rape) and 417 (punishment for cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.

---||Goa||Goa: Salvaged last year, coconut trees along Guirim highway near dead||PANAJI: Last year, the coming together of citizen groups to salvage the coconut trees along the Guirim highway was a a success. However, today these trees are near-dead, showing little chance of survival. Green activists blame the lack of initiative from local authorities to water the individual trees through the summer months. “After citizens and the Goa Green Brigade got together to save the trees last year, they were supposed to adopt one tree each and water their respective tree every day during the summer. This was not done. There are 40 trees along the stretch, of which, only three have survived,” said botanist Miguel Braganca. The other trees are infected with whitefly and black headed caterpillar. Lined along the highway at the Guirim underpass, starting from St Anthony ward to Monte de Guirim, the trees were saved from being cut to facilitate the expansion of the highway after various protests. While the highway was expanded, construction debris was dumped around the barks, choking the roots and intake of soil nutrients. In a voluntary effort by people from different parts of Goa, including the locals of Guirim, the Goa Green Brigade had taken the initiative to revive the trees by re-rooting them in September last year. Environmental activist Avertino Miranda, who was part of the initiative, said their efforts have gone in vain. “We didn’t have the resources to organise fresh water. We will now have to replace these trees with new coconut saplings. We are still hopeful that the rainwater from this monsoon will help give out sprouts. Then they might have a chance for survival,” he said. MLA Rohan Khaunte said that the highway contractor, MVR, should’ve taken responsibility. “When the concrete road was being built, we were clear that no tree should be cut, and they must be managed. The contractor who was supposed to be doing the highway is not concerned about what is happening,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/salvaged-last-year-coconut-trees-along-guirim-highway-near-dead/articleshow/83700810.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Goa||GOA EXPRESS||On November 30, 1985, when Goa made their debut in the Ranji Trophy cricket tournament, there was nervousness in the air. Goa were playing at home in Vasco and didn’t know what to expect against visiting Kerala. The start of the three-day encounter wasn’t encouraging. Goa lost their first six wickets for a mere 81 runs on the board, bringing Sharad Pednekar to the crease. Born in Bombay, now Mumbai, Pednekar had carved a reputation for himself as a top-notch fast bowler who rubbed shoulders with many of the greats. But here, as Suresh Mahadevan watched from the other end, he had to put his batting skills to use and save Goa the embarrassment. Pednekar ended up scoring 40 runs, the highest for Goa in their first innings score of 188 (Namdev Phadte scored 72 of the 153 runs in the second). He also grabbed three wickets in the first innings to emerge as the most successful player on the state’s debut. For someone who generated so much speed and showed so much promise when he was still in his early twenties, it’s surprising that Pednekar played just 15 first class games. He quit quite unexpectedly with 38 wickets –best of 4 for 51 against Karnataka -- at an average of 28.78 after just three years. “Maybe I should have continued playing,” says Pednekar, now 60 and leading a retired life in the city. “At the time, there was hardly any incentive for playing cricket. We got paid almost nothing. In fact we had to pay from our pockets. I also thought it was better to make way for youngsters.” Cricket in the eighties, as Pednekar reminds us, wasn’t really a well-paying sport. Players got paid Rs 140 for a three-day game and Rs 20 as pocket allowance. It’s a different world now with Rs 1.4 lakh on offer for each game in the Ranji Trophy. No wonder nobody thinks like Pednekar and steps aside at the height of their game. That Pednekar had real talent was never in doubt. Having represented Podder College in Mumbai, which has produced the likes of Dilip Vengsarkar, Ravi Shastri and Sanjay Manjrekar, he was among the known faces. But the city was teeming with so much talent that it would take only something special to make it to the top. Around the same time, Goa were pencilled to make their debut in the Ranji Trophy and he chose to return home. “Goa were in the south zone, which was clearly the strongest in the country. We had to play against Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, all teeming with top-notch players. It was very challenging,” says Pednekar. Whenever he bowled, he put his heart into it. He was marked as the dangerman by most opponents with former India captain Kris Srikkanth once telling his teammates at the Panjim Gymkhana ground, “don't take any chances against Pednekar.” Interestingly, Srikkanth himself took a chance with the first ball which he drove back to the bowler, but Pednekar dropped the catch. “I wasn’t expecting it,” he says. When opportunities were there for the taking against big names, Pednekar, however, grabbed it with both hands. His wickets include, amongst other greats, Gundappa Viswanath, Brijesh Patel, Sadanand Viswanath, Sandeep Patil, Sanjay Manjrekar, Eknath Solkar and his all-time favourite Mohammed Azharuddin. “Azhar was a treat to bowl. He was a different kind of a batsman, not your regular player. He was artistic. If you bowl an out-swinger, he could still flick you to the midwicket boundary. You had to use your brains to get him out. You had to innovate. Azhar’s wicket was always priceless,” says Pednekar, who has been the state’s chief selector in the past. Pednekar came up with consistent performances at the national level but never managed to catch the eye of selectors. “We didn’t have officials who could make a case for us,” he says. “If Goa had some representation, like say a Chetan Desai or Vinod Phadke (both influential Goa Cricket Association officials), it would have been a different story.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-express/articleshow/83729200.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

He added that after being informed, the DMRC staff acted swiftly and the train was evacuated at the next station. He urged the passengers to refrain from encouraging, feeding or indulging in any activity that might endanger them in such a situation. Dayal said, in the past, DMRC had roped in services where a person could scare away the monkeys on being spotted at vulnerable stations. “DMRC, in consultation with the forest department, plans to work out a standard operating procedure to deal with such unexpected situations for passengers’ safety,” he added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dmrc-to-chart-out-plan-to-tackle-simians/articleshow/83731438.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The day also saw 1,277 patients getting discharged from various hospitals and Covid care centres, bringing the active cases down to 10,802. The number of recovered patients in the district now stands at 1,99,803. The Covid-19 toll soared to 1,888, with the state listing 17 more fatalities that occurred in the district in the media bulletin. Two of the deceased were aged below 40 years – a 31-year-old woman without any comorbidities who died in the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital on Friday, a day after admission, and a 36-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus who was admitted to CMCH on Monday and died of pneumonia on Friday. A senior health department official said the test positivity rate in the district had dipped below 10%. “Presently, the number of patients diagnosed with the infection is lesser than the number of patients discharged from the hospitals and Covid care centres. This is a positive sign. Because of this, more than 70% beds is vacant in Covid care centres. CMCH too has more than 50% beds vacant.” He said they had decided to keep the Covid care centres open without cutting down on the number of beds, despite several requests from private hospitals, which have been seeing poor occupancy, to shut them down. “When the government relaxes the lockdown norms, we are likely to face more challenges. Hence, we have decided to follow a focused strategy in testing and vaccinating the people. We are planning to test industrial workers and other vulnerable groups at regular intervals, apart from inoculating them on a priority basis,” the officer said. The health department, which organized a special vaccination camp for the disabled people and their parents/guardians in Valparai on the outskirts of the city on the day, is planning to conduct a similar camp for teachers on Monday. The neighbouring Tirupur district, meanwhile, recorded 477 fresh cases of Covid-19 on the day, pushing the tally up to 78,724, of which 4,461 are active cases. The district has seen 73,567 people recovering from the virus attack so far. The Covid-19 toll rose to 696, with eight patients succumbing to the virus in Tirupur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/covid-19-cases-dip-below-1000-mark/articleshow/83698645.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Pune||Pune: Maval, Junnar tehsils have highest hotspot villages||PUNE: As the district administration ramps up efforts to move rural Pune from Level 3 to Level 2 under the state’s unlock guidelines, the areas under Junnar, Maval, Ambegaon, Haveli and Khed tehsils remain a cause for concern. More than half the 84 hotspot villages in the rural belt are in these five tehsils. A village with 10 or more active cases is declared a hotspot village. Rural Pune’s weekly positivity rate improved from 9.7% on June 4 to 8.5% on June 16, while the oxygen bed occupancy went down from 19.7% on June 4 to 13.9% on June 16. To be classified as Level 2, rural Pune needs to have a positivity rate of under 5%. Pune zilla parishad’s chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said they would also keep an eye out for emerging hotspot villages. “We would continue our strategy of aggressive testing, contact-tracing and early treatment, and strictly enforce social distancing norms across rural Pune in coordination with police and revenue department officials,” Prasad said. He said there has been a significant improvement in rural Pune’s recovery rate. “Our recovery rate now stands at 96.2%, which is an all-time high. We are more worried about the weekly positivity rate, which, at 8.5%, is higher than both Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations,” Prasad said. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the state government on Covid-19, said the situation in rural Pune was worrisome. “We advised deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to continue with the prevailing curbs. We might see another spike in cases if people do not follow social distancing norms,” Salunkhe said. “Right now, many people are gathering and socialising in large numbers; they don’t wear masks.

This follows the decision to give vaccines free-of-cost to inoculate all categories from June 21. Since 65 lakh doses will be enough only to administer two lakh vaccinations daily, the state government said that it would affect scaling up the drive. Consequently, it has written to the Centre to raise the number of doses allocated for the state. Out of the 65 lakh doses in July, 15 lakh doses have been allocated to the private sector. The next lot of vaccines is scheduled to arrive on June 24. For the next four days, the state has just seven lakh doses. “If we administer 3.5 lakh doses daily, this will be sufficient for two days. For scaling up vaccination, we require more vaccines. We have written to the Centre requesting them to increase the allocation for July,” said a senior health department official. Though only seven lakh doses are available, the government has devised a strategy to vaccinate transporters, vegetable sellers, shopkeepers, factory workers, journalists, cart vendors, workers at hotels and restaurants, members of resident welfare association, pensioners as well as beggars. For the purpose, worksite vaccination centres will be created across the state and tokens will be distributed. In rural areas, onsite registration will be available, said a senior health department official. In anticipation of the third wave striking in September-October, the state government is making efforts to vaccinate as many people as possible. Till June 19, the state government has received 1,91,08,960 doses from the Centre for the above 45 years population. For the 18 to 44 years age group, the state had procured 30,53,720 doses. A total of 2,21,62,680 doses have been received by the state till June 19 from the start of the drive in January. According to the health department official, they received 3,45,370 doses of Covishield on Sunday. For giving a push to the vaccination drive, the state government has roped in associations related to industries, transportation and involved the public. Over 90% of the above 60 years category in the state have received first doses, and more than 80% of the above 45 years population too have received their first doses. 4 die, 144 more test positive for Covid: Four persons died and 144 others tested positive for Covid-19 in the state on Sunday, taking the state’s toll to 8,895 and overall tally to 9,51,105.

While there are 2.6 lakh vaccine doses available for the 18-44 age group, including one day’s stock of Covaxin and 13 Days stock of Covishield, there are no plans to start walk-in vaccination for this age group from Monday, as announced by the Centre. “We have received communication from Government of India only this evening about walk-in vaccination for 18+, further plans for the same will now be made,” a Delhi government spokesperson said. Sources said that there have been no written communication and suddenly starting walk-in vaccination without arrangements would lead to rush at centres. “Currently, the vaccination speed in Delhi has increased tremendously due to the availability of vaccine stocks. We have administered 65,14,825 doses, out of which 49,38,050 were first dose while 15,76,775 people have received both the doses in Delhi as of June 20,” the Kalkaji MLA said in a vaccination bulletin she released on Sunday. Atishi said that on June 19, more than 85,000 people were vaccinated in Delhi, out of which 50,000 were from the 18-44 year category. She said that currently, 8.2 lakh vaccine doses are available in Delhi for 45 years and above category, out of which five days of Covaxin and 57 Days stock of Covishield are available. She said that out of the 85,000 doses administered on Saturday, 50,000 doses were administered to the youth of Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/65l-vaccinated-in-delhi-16l-of-them-have-got-both-doses/articleshow/83698691.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Gloom descends on industries as Tamil Nadu government extends lockdown||COIMBATORE: Industrialists are disappointed with the government’s decision not to relax the lockdown norms further in 11 districts, including Coimbatore, citing higher Covid-19 cases. The government order said the districts with higher caseload would continue to function with the existing relaxations till June 28. C Sivakumar, president, Coimbatore, Tirupur district Micro & Cottage Entrepreneurs Association, said they were expecting the government to allow them to operate from this week. “We are really disappointed with the government’s move. Most of the industrial units haven’t operated for the past 50 days and the livelihood of the unit owners and workers are at stake. A few days ago, we had requested the district collector to take necessary steps to grant permission to operate at least the units functioning with one or two workers.” As far as the micro industries are concerned, he said, the district has incurred about Rs 3 crore to Rs 5 crore loss per day since the lockdown had been imposed. “Most of them have exhausted their savings and are struggling.” Explaining that the impact of the ongoing lockdown was worse than that of the previous year, Sivakumar said the lack of uniformity in unlocking the restrictions was likely to cost the industrial units in the district dear, as chances of orders going out of their hands were high. J James, district president, Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, said it would be difficult for the industries to revive without the government’s assistance after the lockdown. “We have requested the government to provide us additional time to pay the electricity charges and repay the loans, waive off interest and extend a separate loan up to Rs 1 lakh with a minimum interest for micro industries. But we have not received any response from both the Union and the state governments.” Pointing out that many industrial units were functioning out of rental buildings and struggling to pay the rents, he said most of the industrialists were paying wages to the workers from their pockets to prevent them from leaving the district, despite the poor financial situation. “When the government allows us to resume operations, we have to worry about factors like availability of raw materials and labours as well.” M V Ramesh Babu, president, Coimbatore District Small Industries Association, said the production loss of the industries had gone up to 70% in the past two months because of the lockdown. “It would have been better had the government allowed us to operate with minimal workforce by adhering to Covid-19 guidelines. We hope the government will allow us to resume operations from next week at least. It will take a minimum of seven to 10 days for us to function in a full-fledged manner.” He said the guest workers were ready to return to work. “We are also receiving inquiries from other districts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/gloom-descends-on-industries-as-tn-govt-extends-lockdown/articleshow/83698656.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The residents of Parksyde Homes conducted the two-day vaccination camp on the weekend at their club house where beneficiaries were administered in batches of 20 each. “During the vaccination drive we ensured residents followed all Covid appropriate behaviour. As part of ‘My Family My Responsibility’ we conducted the vaccination drive for the residents. In the last two days we have vaccinated 424 people in our residential society. All beneficiaries are healthy and none reported any health issues after vaccination,” Girish Hoshing, an office-bearer of the society, said. The society members discussed and finalized the vaccination programme after which a request was made to the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) to allow the permission by generating required code for the mass vaccination with the help of a private hospital. “After the formalities were completed and the vaccination code was generated, we tied up with Sahyadri Hospital for the campaign. Their team carried out the process on our premises,” Hoshing said. The organisers ensured the citizens were divided in the batches of 20 each. “After vaccination the residents were kept under observation for 30 minutes before being allowed to return home,” he added. Ajita Salunke, the NMC coordinator for vaccination, said this was the first residiential complex where vaccination was carried out with the help of private hospital. Salunke said, “The residents are coming forward to carry out vaccination drive in their housing societies with the help of private hospitals.

SOG officials arrested the accused, identified as Niraj Suri, from his office located in Mussoorie. According to DIG (SOG) Sharat Kaviraj, the FIR was registered back in 2017, but the SOG teams were following up leads on suspects. “It is an old case but we kept investigating it and sifted through information. We finally zeroed in on the accused and arrested him,” he said.The matter came to light in 2017, when the victim, a resident of Sawai Madhopur district, alleged that she was duped of Rs 2.5 crore by a woman based abroad, who had introduced herself as Rebecca Christine on a social media website. Christine claimed she was a wealthy woman living alone after her husband died recently. A few days later, Christine messaged the victim on Facebook that she was suffering from cancer and wanted to give her property worth $3.9 million. The victim agreed to become the inheritor of Christine’s property. But what followed next was a well-plotted scheme under which multiple 'processing fees', 'customs duty', etc., were charged from the victim. For several weeks, Suri acting as Christine, duped Rs 2.5 crore from her on the pretext of different ‘regulations’, until the victim decided to file a complaint. SOG officials said that Suri led a gang that included some foreign nationals too. He had set up multiple fake social media accounts. He allegedly sent friend requests to several people online to dupe them by offering expensive gifts. He had set up five offices at different locations in the past six years in order to evade the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cyber-crook-who-duped-raj-woman-of-rs-2-5-crore-held/articleshow/83700807.cms||---

The active cases in the district have dropped from 2,740 on June 10 to 1,375 on June 20. But the active cases in Sinnar town have reduced from around 650 to only 500 whereas other hotspot taluka — like Nashik and Niphad — have witnessed a drop from about 400 to less than 100. “The floating population visiting Sinnar town for several reasons is a cause of worry as most of the cases are found in the town. So we are now trying out various ways to tackle the situation and that includes testing workers and small-time traders, who come into contact with a large number of people,” said taluka health officer (THO) Dr Mohan Bachchhav. The health officials have asked the shopkeepers, traders and small cafe owners to get themselves and their workers tested with either rapid antigen testing or RTPCR.  Sinnar THO has decided to organise camps on four days in different areas to facilitate testing of the workers. “We have asked these people to undergo tests after cases have been found where workers working in establishments or citizens that have visited particular shops have contracted Covid. While their visit to a particular shop does not mean that somebody from that establishment has Covid, but to be on the safer side, we are now asking people to get themselves tested,” he said. He said the retailers and the shopkeeper will have to display their Covid test report at the shop and will be considered valid for the next 15 days, after which, they will again have to undergo the tests. As Sinnar is connected to Mumbai, Shirdi, Nashik and Pune and the town has many industries, there is a movement of people on large scale from neighbouring villages. So the labour contractors have been asked to conduct Covid test of workers, he said. “We have a testing facility in the MIDC area and the contract workers will be asked to undergo the tests and submit the reports to the health department,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/in-sinnar-health-officials-to-test-workers-small-traders/articleshow/83695109.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Delhi||Forest guards to undergo training on climate change||New Delhi: In a first, over 50 forest and wildlife guards of the forest and wildlife department will undergo five-day training on impact of climate change on wildlife conservation. Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Combating Climate Change and Wildlife Trust of India have been roped in for the programme, which will also have sessions on wildlife crime. “Climate change has an effect on wildlife. For instance, wild animals come out of their habitat and go to human settlements due to their habitat destruction, which is linked to climate change. The training will help the staff in mitigating measures and steps to be taken in such circumstances,” said a senior forest official. Vipul Pandey, director of the institute, said, “Training will provide an exposure to wildlife staff about emerging challenges of climate change on wildlife management and to deal with them in a proper manner.” As the wildlife guards are involved in collecting intelligence, surveillance, conducting raids, seizures, arresting the accused and prosecuting the offenders by filing complaints in court, the programme will focus on various aspects of wildlife crime. “There will be separate sessions on different acts related to wildlife crime, including Wildlife Protection Act, 1972; sections of CrPC and Evidence Act. Delhi has reported many cases in the past years on smuggling of prohibited items of wildlife, the experts will also educate on investigation of such crimes,” said an official. The training, which scheduled to begin from next week, had been postponed due to Van Mahotsav. The new date is yet to be decided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/forest-guards-to-undergo-training-on-climate-change/articleshow/83731527.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Delhi||Delhi: Restaurants raise a toast to further relaxation of curbs||NEW DELHI: Though restaurants were allowed to reopen last week, Minakshi Singh couldn’t open her bar Sidecar as she was neither allowed to serve alcohol nor stay open till late. With Delhi government now permitting outlets to serve alcohol and stay open till 10pm, Singh has started preparing to reopen immediately. “We’ve been waiting to reopen. The costs, including rent and salaries, have been hitting us hard along with excise duties and other taxes. Hopefully when we reopen, we would be able to cover some bit of it,” Singh said. After a muted response since reopening last week, restaurants and bars hope these relaxations will result in better sales. Since restaurants will be able to offer their guests a “complete” experience, restaurateur Sahil Gupta is enthused to reopen his Mexican grill and tequila bar, Miss Margarita by Arriba, while Akshay Anand will also restart his outlet Ophelia this week. Dinesh Arora of Unplugged Courtyard feels the move will infuse some life back into the struggling industry. Vikrant Batra of Cafe Delhi Heights, too, hopes being allowed to offer their complete menu for a longer duration will mean better customer experience and revenue, while Zorawar Kalra of Swan, Farzi Cafe and Bo Tai asserts these relaxations will encourage more outlets to reopen as there would be no question mark over viability. With Covid cases going down daily and most of service staff and many diners vaccinated, restaurateurs hope the worst is behind them. The decision is also being seen as a welcome step for hotels. Rajesh Namby, general manager of The Lodhi, calls it a “much needed” relief for the food and beverage businesses and hopes this will allow him to welcome more patrons. Most outlet owners though request removal of all restrictions while Covid protocols are strictly followed. Some owners also point out some confusions in the order. “While timings for restaurants and bars is till 10pm, the same for malls, markets and standalone and neighbourhood shops is still 8pm. This has prompted many owners to wait till timings are uniform as this uncertainty could lead to harassment by local offcials,” said a restaurateur, who prefers to have his place closed rather than begging for rent waivers and duty adjustments. A bar owner alleges since many outlets did not reopen due to financial stress and uncertainty due to a fear of a third wave, this move is a mere ploy by the government to entice more outlets to pay excise fees for licences, which are due for renewal by June end. Ideally the government should have extended licences for the next quarter without demanding additional fees to help the struggling industry, he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/restaurants-raise-a-toast-to-further-relaxation-of-curbs/articleshow/83698729.cms||Amin Ali
---||Ahmedabad||You’re fine or fined: Lockdown action patchy||AHMEDABAD: More than a year after Kanta Parmar (40) was booked for violation of the commissioner’s notification and under the Epidemic Diseases Act, when she was caught wandering on the main road in Behrampura during the lockdown, a metropolitan court recently junked the criminal case against her. The metropolitan court has been trashing numerous chargesheets filed by the city police for lockdown violations on the grounds that the FIRs are not maintainable at all. Shantilal Solanki, who was booked under Section 188 of the IPC and Section 51B of the Disaster Management (DM) Act in May 2020 for taking out a religious procession during the lockdown, also got a reprieve with the court taking the view that the police could not have filed the FIR. However, all those booked for similar offences are no so lucky. Mohammed Aijaz Shaikh was booked for stepping out during lockdown restrictions and was booked by Khadia police under the IPC and Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases (ED) Act. He had to tender an apology for his offence, seek leniency and the metropolitan court let him go after a reprimand, but not before recording his conviction on admitting his guilt. Harsh Patel, a student who is planning to go abroad for further studies, was made to pay a fine of Rs 100 for a night curfew violation. He was booked under IPC provisions and the Disaster Management Act by Satellite police in June 2020 when his car was stopped at a police point. He admitted his guilt upon the court’s summons and sought leniency so that he did not have to face a hurdle in going abroad for further studies. Different outcomes of similar lockdown violations have also been witnessed in courts at the Mirzapur rural court campus. ‘A couple living in Bodakdev, Dennis and Janki Dave, also had to pay Rs 1,200 in fines for three different charges slapped against them – for Secition 188 of the IPC, the DM Act and the ED Act. They were booked in May last year when they were on an evening walk. Similarly, Nisarg and Ravina Patel also paid Rs 1,200 fines after admitting their guilt in violating lockdown rules, when they tried to travel from their residence in Usmanpura to Vastrapur to shop in May last year. However, there are lockdown violation cases in Mirzapur courts where police chargesheets have been junked as not maintainable. Mokesh Dhorajiya is one such lockdown violator who got discharged. As the courts have been rejecting hundreds of chargesheets, court orders reveal that the courts have refused to accept FIRs under Section 188 of the IPC citing the bar of Section 195 of CrPC. Similarly, charges under Section 51B of the DM Act have not been accepted in the form of FIRs and chargesheets citing the bar in Section 60 of the DM Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/youre-fine-or-fined-lockdown-action-patchy/articleshow/83698721.cms||---

The plantation the elephant raided belong to S Venkatesh of Sujilkarai hamlet. The farmer, who had lost crop worth more than one Rs 1 lakh, sought compensation from the forest department. Venkatesh had cultivated banana trees on three acres. “I was sleeping in my house when the elephant raided the standing trees around 3am,” he said. The destroyed standing banana trees were ready for harvest in a couple of days. Forest officials visited the land and inspected the destroyed banana trees. “We will submit our report to the government and based on the report the government would issue compensation,” a forest official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/elephant-destroys-banana-trees/articleshow/83698724.cms||---

Commissioned at the combined graduation parade at the Air Force Academy in Dundigal near Hyderabad after basic training on Saturday, Sudan will now undergo rigorous fighter training for over a year before she can become 'fully operational' as a fighter pilot and handle the intricacies of combat flying. Flight Lieutenants Avani Chaturvedi, Bhawana Kanth and Mohana Singh were the first women to be commissioned as flying officers into the fighter stream after basic training in June 2016. Now flying jets like MiG-21s, they broke the glass ceiling of the long-standing combat-exclusion policy for women in the Indian armed forces. IAF currently has 11 women fighter pilots, who have undergone the arduous training to fly supersonic jets. It takes around Rs 15 crore to train a single fighter pilot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jks-mawya-12th-woman-to-get-into-iafs-fighter-stream/articleshow/83703599.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Half-cooked water policy put on back-burner||AHMEDABAD: A few months ago, the World Bank was assured that a water metering and tariff policy for Ahmedabad will soon be in place when a Rs 3,000 crore loan was sought for strengthening Ahmedabad’s water and drainage network. Now the newly constituted standing committee of the municipal corporation, the policy-making body, has put the policy under abeyance till the upcoming Gujarat assembly elections next year. The policy states that there will be no additional water charge if the family consumes within the 22.5K litres a month. If the water usage exceeds this limit then a charge of Rs 10 per 1,000 litres will be charged from consumers in residential areas. “Water charges will increase as per usage. For instance if the water usage is between 22.5K to 30K litres a month then an additional Rs 75 per month and any extra 10K litres consumed will invite an extra Rs 275, Rs 575 and Rs 975 per month if consumption goes up to 1 lakh litres a month or above,” says a senior standing committee member. “One of the commitments we have made to the World Bank is to make water usage accountable by metering and charging citizens. Right now we collect blanket water usage charges which comes to around Rs 183 crore for the entire city. Of this, Rs 153 crore water tax is collected from large institutions, schools, colleges, universities, commercial properties and government offices,” the official added. The water tariff policy has been revised four times since 2012 and has been put in abeyance by the elected standing committee of the AMC. “We are at present legalizing illegal water connection by charging a blanket Rs 500 per connection, but we do not have any data on water usage of the city till date. The World Bank will now require us to meter the water supply. There are little chances of postponing water charges this time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/half-cooked-water-policy-put-on-back-burner/articleshow/83698796.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Why maintaining order will not be a walk in the park||NEW DELHI: With Delhi Disaster Management Authority permitting reopening of parks, the civic bodies have started disinfecting commonly touched surfaces and open gyms. While the unlocking order holds the authorities along with residents’ welfare associations, yoga instructors, etc responsible for maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviour in these green spaces, several RWAs said they were not legally empowered to enforce any rule and could only play advisory roles. Some RWAs pointed out that local parks were also used by people from other residential areas. The municipal corporations have started assigning nodal officers to check violations. East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said sanitisation and pruning of grass/trees had started and nodal officers would ensure social distancing and mask norms. A gardener will be responsible in each major park to talk to people if they are violating norms, said an EDMC official.  “Disinfection of entry points, benches, gym equipment is being done. Besides local supervisors, a group of 15-20 parks has been allotted to a chaudhary of the gardeners. However, challaning powers are restricted to officials above the section-officer rank.” EDMC has 2,098 parks with a cumulative green area of 290 hectares. The three municipal corporations together oversee 15,064 parks in the city with South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) alone managing the maximum number at 6,812. The city has more than 18,000 parks and gardens spread over about 8,000 ha. An SDMC official said the disinfection of open gyms had started and nodal officers were also being appointed. “All the provisions like social distancing, online ticket bookings etc will be ensured,” the official said. SDMC also runs Waste to Wonder and Nandan Van parks. With a sedentary lifestyle during the lockdown and increased health concerns, there had been an increasing demand from Delhites for opening of city parks. People argue that open, well-ventilated spaces like parks pose lesser risk of catching infection. B M Bakshi of New Friends Colony RWA said they would send an advisory letter to all residents and messages in the groups. “We can only raise awareness. We don’t have any power to issue challans. Ideally, the authorities should cap the maximum number of visitors based on the area of a park and regulate it at the entry point, using guards or gardeners,” he said. Chetan Sharma, general secretary of Confederation of NCR RWAs, said parks might be located in a residential area but were open to all. “How can RWAs manage people from outside their area? The authorities will have to figure out how police can help in case any violator is adamant,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-maintaining-order-will-not-be-a-walk-in-the-park/articleshow/83698750.cms||Paras Singh

---||Pune||Pune: Weekend picnickers keep cops on their toes||PUNE: For the second consecutive day, the police deployed a major bandobast effort at tourist areas around the Khadakwasla dam and near Sinhagad Fort. No visitor was allowed to go to these spots for an outing. The police fined as many as 177 persons for moving on roads leading to these two destinations without any valid purpose. In total, the police collected fines worth Rs66,300 from these persons. Inspector Sadashiv Shelar of the Haveli police station told TOI, “We kept a good bandobast at the Khadakwasla dam site but, despite repeated requests by the police, people kept thronging the site. People, who refused to budge or did not follow the orders of the policemen, were fined.” Shelar added, “We had closed the roads as well as the trekking path leading to Sinhagad Fort on Saturday. The same exercise continued on Sunday. No one was allowed to head towards the fort.” The police manned the Khadakwasla lake’s chowpatty area but people still managed to go towards the dam’s wall from the bridge on the Mutha river. Traffic jam in Lonavla on Sunday evening The traffic in Lonavla town went out of gear as a large number of revelers from Mumbai and Pune had managed to reach the popular hill station on Sunday evening. Senior inspector Dilip Pawar of Lonavla city police station said, “People had travelled to Lonavla in large numbers on Sunday. However, we did not allow the vehicles to reach the tourist spots. Since there were so many vehicles in the area, the traffic in Lonavla had gone out gear. We had to deploy additional force to clear the traffic.” Ahaan Gadgil, a resident of Bavdhan said, “There was long queue of vehicles on the Mumbai-bound lane of the Pune-Mumbai expressway. People had halted on the expressway and were busy taking photographs. Even in the Khandala Ghat section, we saw that people had stopped similarly just to take photographs.” Meanwhile, over the last two days, the Pune rural police have taken action against more than 500 people, who were trying to go to the different picnic spots located in its jurisdiction. “We did not allow the people to go these spots,” inspector TY Mujawar of Lonavla rural police station said. Similarly, the team from the Paud police station also kept a strict check on vehicles heading towards Mulshi dam, Tamhini Ghat, and also towards Lavasa. “We fined 100 motorists, who had come to these areas for outings, on Sunday. They wanted to go towards Mulshi dam or Tamhini Ghat but we did not allow them to travel ahead,” said inspector Ashok Dhumal of Paud police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/weekend-picnickers-keep-cops-on-their-toes/articleshow/83698770.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Mumbai||Alliance with Congress & NCP is weakening party, writes Sena MLA in letter to Maharashtra CM||MUMBAI: Urging CM and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to join hands with the BJP ahead of the civic polls in Mumbai, Thane and eight other cities, party MLA and spokesperson Pratap Sarnaik alleged that MVA partners, Congress and NCP, were poaching Sena cadres and weakening the party. “Although we are in power in the state, I do not get support from government agencies or any leader within the party. My family and I have been fighting a legal battle for the last 7 months,” he wrote in a letter to the CM. Sarnaik said joining hands with Prime Minister Narendra Modi would also be beneficial for leaders like him who are “facing harassment due to cases being foisted on them by central agencies”. Incidentally, Sarnaik’s son is married to BJP MLA Ranjeet Patil’s daughter. There is speculation that sections in the BJP may have put pressure on Sarnaik to write the letter to the CM. Former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya lashed out at Sarnaik, saying “he is afraid of going to jail” because of his involvement in corruption. “All ‘ghotalebaj’, Sarnaik, Parab, Waikar.. will have to be guests in jail,” said Somaiya. The BJP leader also lodged a complaint at Thane’s Vartak Nagar police station about Sarnaik missing for the last 100 days. Significantly, the letter was sent to the CM on June 9, the same day the Sena MLA and his sons Vihang and Purvesh filed a petition in the Bombay HC seeking protection from arrest and an order to restrain the ED from investigating them in the National Spot Exchange Limited money laundering case. Shiv Sena leader and MP Sanjay Raut said this was a non-issue. “The only important point raised in the letter was about ‘being unnecessarily harassed’. If a letter is written over harassment, then the focus should be on what was the unnecessary harassment, and who, why and to whom the harassment is being meted out to,” Raut said. Reacting to Sarnaik’s letter, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said his party will consider a tie-up if Uddhav makes a statement similar to Sarnaik’s. “After all, BJP was not for breaking the alliance with Sena,” Patil said. State Congress chief Nana Patole, who had said that the national party would contest the next assembly polls alone, chose not to react to Sarnaik’s letter, saying it was the Sena’s internal matter. On Saturday, the CM had criticised Patole’s “election-to-election” mindset, saying it’s not the time to indulge in electoral politics considering the challenges posed by the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-alliance-with-cong-ncp-is-weakening-party-writes-sena-mla-in-letter-to-cm/articleshow/83702583.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Mumbai||Probe into Rs 100cr Karnala ‘land grab’ by ex-MP’s family||Navi Mumbai: The chief conservator of forests (Thane territorial) has ordered an inquiry into an alleged land grab of over 47 acres near Karnala Bird Sanctuary by BJP leader and former MP Ramseth Thakur and his family, including his wife, son Prashant (an MLA) and grandson. Documents with TOI show that the probe was initiated after two activists separately complained to the governor and the principal secretary, forests, accusing the Thakur family of land grab in Barapada village by changing occupancy without obtaining any NOC from the central government. The land is estimated to be worth over Rs 100 crore. The opposition PWP MLC from Panvel said the issue will be raised in the upcoming legislative session. “As per our records, it is mentioned that Ram Thakur holds 20 acres, his wife Shakuntala 13 acres, son 6 acres, and grandson Amogh (son of Prashant) 8 acres in Barapada village,” said a Panvel tehsil official when documents in possession of TOI were cross-checked. “The allotted forest land sale was made for non-forest use without prior consent of the Union government under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and Supreme Court directives. It violates various forest laws and constitutional provisions. This is an organised criminal act, with breach of trust, besides contravention of other legal provisions. Hence, I had complained to the governor seeking appropriate action against all those involved,” said Hemant Chhajed, former member, State Forest Lands Committee. “Karnala forest area land was divested to form Barapada village around 1982. Change of rights and occupancy was done illegally to favour Thakur and his family members under political influence. Forest land was first divided into small plots to facilitate future illegal sale instead of giving back to the government as per provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. Hence, illegal land transactions should be cancelled by the forest department,” said Anarjit Chauhan, an RTI activist. “We have legally purchased the land and there is no violation. No activist has approached us about any violations,” Ramseth Thakur told TOI. “An inquiry has been ordered into the alleged forest land transactions as per the complaints received,” said S V Ramarao, chief conservator of forests (territorial), Thane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/probe-into-rs-100cr-karnala-land-grab-by-ex-mps-family/articleshow/83702568.cms||Umesh K Parida
---||Delhi||Delhi traders suggest ways to tackle crowding||NEW DELHI: Days after a concerned Delhi high court took suo motu cognisance of violations of Covid-19 protocols in various markets, cautioning that such a breach will only “hasten” the third wave, the capital’s key market associations and traders’ bodies met for a “mahapanchayat” on Sunday to work out a plan to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour. Traders argued that of the 950 major markets in the city, the problem of crowding was limited to around 50 and, thus, localised solutions needed to be found, instead of targeting everyone. This, they said, should be done in consultation with market associations and district authorities. Most traders pitched for staggered timings for retail and wholesale markets and deployment of volunteers to maintain social distancing. They also suggested prior bookings and online payments to reduce crowding as well as an urgent removal of illegal hawkers and encroachments. Another suggestion put forward was to open more Delhi Metro station gates that led directly to the markets. Brijesh Goyal, chairman of Chamber of Trade and Industries that organised the meet, said over 200 associations and organisations participated in the “mahapanchayat” and a draft of the compiled solutions would be sent to the chief minister, the Delhi police commissioner and district officials. CTI general secretary Vishnu Bhargava said they had taken the Delhi high court’s observations seriously. “We have paid a huge price in the second wave. We don’t know if there is any household that has not suffered in the second wave, closely or remotely,” the court had said, asking the Centre and the Delhi government to take strict measures. The bench had taken note of certain photographs sent to one of the judges of the high court by an AIIMS doctor showing scant regard for Covid protocols by street vendors in markets. Vinay Narang, president of the Kashmere Gate Market Association, said he had recommended promotion of digital payment to ensure minimal contact between traders and customers. Traders from Connaught Place and Chandni Chowk raised the issue of illegal hawkers and encroachments. Atul Bhargava, president of the New Delhi Traders’ Association, said illegal hawkers were largely responsible for crowding in the markets. He found support from Sanjay Bhargava, who heads the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, with the latter demanding that the district officials and the police take strict action in this regard. Bhargava said this being a lean season, traders should take all the precautions, including odd-even operations and staggered timings, if needed. “If the third wave starts, the damage will be much severe as we will lose another three months of key trading period around Diwali and the marriage season,” he said. Sanjeev Mehra, who heads the traders’ association of the upscale Khan Market, said the same yardstick couldn’t be used for all locations. “We’ve made appropriate arrangements for ensuring mask compliance and set up sanitisation points. In crowded markets, administration should work with the local association to ensure that the guidelines are followed,” he said. “Markets should try to self-regulate too. We can’t run to the government for every thing. Local problems need local solutions,” Mehra added. The idea of staggered timings also founded favour among the participants. Rajesh Ahuja from Karol Bagh market said crowding could largely be avoided if the wholesale and retail markets were opened at different times. Bhagwan Bansal, vice-president of the Hindustan Mercantile Association, and Dalip Bindal from Chawri Bazar raised the issue of only one Metro gate being opened, which was leading to serpentine queues in the marketplaces. Traders from Sarojini Nagar market said they were taking measures to sensitise shopkeepers and have deputed one volunteer for every 10 shops to ensure compliance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-violations-the-norm-traders-suggest-ways-to-tackle-crowding/articleshow/83698778.cms||Paras Singh
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Liquor worth Rs 14 lakh seized from ready mix concrete machine||VADODARA: Busting another novel attempt in ferrying liquor surreptitiously in the city, cops caught a notorious bootlegger who hid his IMFL stock in a ready mix concrete machine, late on Saturday night. The police also arrested two men from Waghodia Road. Based on a tip off about a few men splitting liquor bottles among local bootleggers to be sold to customers, cops reached the spot and were stumped to see liquor bottles literally pouring out of the huge ready mix concrete machine container. “It has a huge container that can accommodate thousands of liquor bottles,” cops said. The cops took the concrete mixer machine to the police station and then within a few hours could fish out every single bottle of IMFL. The cops seized over 9,228 bottles and pouches of IMFL worth Rs about 14 lakh that included whiskey, beer, rum and vodka.

The drug can trigger nephrotoxicity if used without adequate monitoring. Salt loading involves administering saline solution (salt water) into the patient's vein through drip before, during, or after infusion of conventional Amphotericin B. "Studies in humans have clearly demonstrated that salt loading can prevent or alleviate an amphotericin B-induced rise in serum creatinine (nephrotoxicity) as compared to water loading in patients receiving conventional amphotericin B," said infectious disease expert Sanjay Pujari, member of the national task force. Experts have been pushing for conventional amphotericin against Covid-associated mucormycosis as it is much cheaper than the drug's liposomal variety, which is 100 times more expensive and beyond the reach of many. Guidelines issued by the Centre have also stated that the conventional form is equally efficacious in the treatment of CAM. The liposomal form of Amphotericin B can cost a patient Rs 35,000 every day. The conventional form of the drug costs just Rs 350 per day, but needs to be given carefully with a blood creatinine test conducted every alternate day to rule out drug toxicity in the kidneys. Conventional amphotericin causes a 50% increase in serum creatinine in about a third of patients. Higher doses for a longer duration can increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. "Therefore, the Union government's joint task force has advised using 500ml of normal saline before, during, or after amphotericin B infusion," Pujari said. The task force's advisory brings massive relief to patients nationwide. Most doctors treating mucormycosis have been apprehensive about using conventional amphotericin (deoxycholate), citing its impact on kidneys by triggering nephrotoxicity. Instead, they have been using the extremely expensive (liposomal) formulation of the drug. But a minimum 21-day course of the liposomal form can cost anywhere between Rs 7.5 lakh to Rs 17 lakh, depending on a patient's body weight. Treatment course with conventional amphotericin (deoxycholate) for the same period only costs between Rs 8,000 and Rs 16,000. "Prompt excretion of a drug by the kidneys is essential to prevent kidney toxicity. Normal saline hydration before amphotericin, and 5% dextrose mixed with amphotericin, should be the policy to prevent or reduce nephrotoxicity," said ENT surgeon Samir Joshi. Joshi, head of the ENT department at the state-run BJ Medical College and Sassoon General hospital, has treated about 201 patients with Covid-linked mucormycosis. "More than 85% of these patients recovered after monitored use of conventional amphotericin and carefully planned debridement (dead/infected tissue removal) surgeries," Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/salt-loading-can-help-docs-use-cheaper-anti-mucor-drug/articleshow/83698831.cms||Umesh Isalkar

As per government directives, the number of vaccination centres are being increased for providing vaccination to citizens in the 30-44 age group even as regular vaccination for people of above the age of 45 years is being carried out as usual. “At this point in time the government has decided to vaccinate people only in the said age group. A trial was conducted on Saturday and from Monday it is going to be a regular feature till further orders,” deputy collector Ganesh Misal, who is the incident commander for the vaccination programme for the district, said. As of now there are no instructions for vaccination to people in the age between 18 and 29 years as they can get paid vaccines at private hospitals. From Monday, the district health office has asked all the primary health centres, as many as 108, to vaccinate the people from the 30-44 age-group. “While all PHCs have been asked to conduct the programme we have received confirmation from about 85 centres and the exact number will be realized on Monday morning,” Ravindra Chaudhary, additional district health officer (immunization) of Nashik zilla parishad, said. In Nashik city, however, the vaccination will be carried out only at five centres on Monday before increasing the number in the next couple of days. Dr Ajita Salunke, coordinator for NMC, said, “We will have five centres -- Ramwadi, Gangapur, Red Cross, Kamatwade and JDC Bytco -- where the vaccination drive for the said age group will be carried out.” At vaccination centres 150 doses will be provided to those who register online and 50 doses would be provided for walk-in registration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/93-vaccine-sites-to-administer-jabs-to-30-44-group-in-nashik/articleshow/83695186.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Hyderabad||Plans to enhance godown space set to cost Rs 4k crore||Hyderabad: The state government which has decided to sell its lands to raise revenues during the pandemic, requires nearly Rs 4,000 crore for construction of 40-lakh metric tonnes storage capacity godowns alone in Telangana. The marketing department has prepared detailed project reports to enhance the storage capacity of agriculture produce in the state by another 40 lakh metric tonnes. Telangana needs more storage capacity as the cultivation area and agriculture production has increased tremendously due to availability of water from various irrigation projects, round the clock power supply and input subsidy to the farmers in the form of Rythu Bandhu sop. Presently, the overall storage capacity of godowns in Telangana is 65.4 lakh metric tonnes including central and state government departments and private agencies. Last year, the state government faced shortage of storage capacity and had to store paddy and other agriculture produce in schools and marriage halls. “Normally, the state government will not need to store agriculture produce in schools as farmers sell their agriculture produce in open market. But last year, the state government had purchased entire paddy, maize, sunflower and other pulses from the farmers as ryots did not have market facilities due to lockdowns,” an official said. It was then that the CM directed officials to make an assessment of how many more warehouses are required so that there is no problem even when government procures multiple agriculture products from farmers. At a review meeting few days back, the chief minister said the government will soon take up construction of new godowns. However, keeping in view the impact of pandemic on revenues, it is yet to be decided if government will borrow loans or hand it over to private parties to execute the project. Officials said construction of warehouses requires huge parcels of lands in every district. For construction of 10,000 metric tonnes capacity godown, at least five acre land is needed. So, the government requires nearly 2,000 acres of land, in all to enhance warehousing capacity by another 40 metric tonnes. Last time, government had given the task of enhancing godown capacity to marketing department. It constructed godowns with a capacity of over 18.5 lakh metric tonnes at a cost of Rs 1024 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/plans-to-enhance-godown-space-set-to-cost-rs-4k-crore/articleshow/83700611.cms||Roushan Ali

According to an analysis by Patheya budget centre, “The budget expenditure on drinking water has declined from 13% in 2015-16 to 9.24% in 2020-21. AMC’s annual budget document for 2020-21 had claimed that per capita water supply is 140 to 150 litres a day.” But in reality the per day capita water consumption of an individual in posh areas like Thaltej, Bodakdev, Gota, Ghatlodia and Chandlodia is 309 litres a day, the highest in the city. Then comes areas like Navrangpura, Paldi, Nava Wadaj, Sabarmati areas, each individual consumes an average 270 litres a day. But individuals in Sardarnagar, Nobelnagar, Bapunagar, Saijpur Bogha, consume 213 litres a day, that’s the least an individual consumes in the city. Quite interestingly, areas like Jodhpur, Vejalpur, Sarkhej and Maktampura consumes 217 litres of water a day. “In the posh west zones, what is worrying most households use high capacity pumps which ultimately leads to large municipal water consumption.,” says an AMC official .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-spends-10-of-budget-on-drinking-water/articleshow/83698837.cms||---

The capital also recorded seven Covid-19 fatalities for the second day in a row. The number of Covid-19 patients who recovered or got discharged in the last 24 hours is 398, more than three times the number of fresh cases. As a result, the number of active cases has gone down to 2,091, which compared with the 40,214 active cases on May 20 is a dip of almost 95%. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, however, warned that the dip doesn’t mean the pandemic has ended and the capital can escape the third wave only if people wear masks and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. He added that directions have been issued to district magistrates and Delhi Police to take strict action against those violating Covid norms. Since Unlock 3 came into effect on Monday, stringent enforcement by district authorities have also resulted in the number of fines going up. The last seven days saw 36,909 total fines being issued across the 11 revenue districts of Delhi, with an average of 5,273 a day, with the highest – 5,583 – issued on Sunday. The average daily fines issued the week prior to this was 4,192 and 3,870 in the week after Unlock 1. The month of May, in comparison, was 2,507 fines being issued every day on an average. Jain also said on Sunday that all deaths that occur in Delhi are entered in the ‘death register’ and no one can tinker with the number of deaths in Delhi, including those occurring due to Covid-19. “No one can increase or decrease the number of deaths in Delhi,” he told reporters in the context of some states reporting ‘backlog deaths’. The death toll on Sunday stood at 24,914, with a case fatality rate of 1.74%. In the last 24 hours, 72,670 tests were carried out, including 52,790 RT-PCR tests and 19,880 Rapid Antigen Tests. The number of patients recuperating in home isolation in the city as on Sunday is 600, while 1,281 are admitted in hospitals. Out of the total 23,638 hospital beds, 22,357 are vacant. There are a total of 6,630 Covid ICU beds in Delhi and 5,909 were vacant at 10pm on Sunday, according to the Delhi government’s online Corona dashboard, including 1,997 vacant ICU beds with ventilators out of 2,503 ones. The last week recorded 13 fatalities on average every day, which is less than half of the 33.1 average fatalities recorded every day the week before.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/active-cases-dip-95-in-a-month-but-risk-remains/articleshow/83698807.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The four agencies are M/s Rohit Nursery, Delhi, M/s DD MEP Engineers, Gurgaon, RP Entrepreneurs and Green Morning Horticulture Pvt. Ltd, Hyderabad. Environment minister Gopal Rai said, to carry out transplantation from any project site in Delhi, the applicant would be required to select an agency from among the empanelled ones only. Under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi government brought the ambitious tree transplantation policy last year. The policy mandates that trees will not be removed unnecessarily in development projects/work and the existing trees at the project site shall be properly preserved through careful planning, design, implementation and post-construction maintenance. However, transplantation does not do away with the present norm of compensatory afforestation in the component of 10 times, and compensatory plantation has to be carried out for each felled and transplanted tree.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-approves-4-agencies-for-transplantation-of-trees-in-city/articleshow/83731604.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Opt for dry direct seeding, urges CM K Chandrasekhar Rao||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday appealed to the farmers to opt for dry direct seeding of paddy instead of the traditional method of paddy transplantation. Citing his personal experience, KCR said the paddy yield in his farm was 42 quintals per acre after he adopted the dry seeding method. This method also reduces the investment on each acre by Rs 10,000 besides minimising the need to hire labour. Even the crop period comes down by 10 days, he said. The chief minister directed the ministers and officers concerned to hold regular meetings in all the Rythu Vedikas to sensitise the farmers to take up paddy cultivation in dry seeding mode from this year onwards. The CM also appealed to the farmers to take up cultivation of diverse crops that were in demand in the market and suggested that cotton, red gram, and oil palm are likely to fetch remunerative prices to them. Cotton produced in Telangana has a great demand in the country. He called upon aspiring entrepreneurs and industrialists to set up ginning and rice mills. “Telangana has become number one in paddy production in the country with 3 crore metric tonnes produced in one year compared to 2.2 crore metric tonnes in Punjab. But we do not have enough rice mills to mill the paddy into rice. We cannot sell paddy as the market demands rice,” he said. Stating that Dharani portal was launched after three years of in-depth exercise which simplified the entire land registration process to end the woes of farmers, he said rythu bandhu and rythu bima are two schemes being implemented to provide a sense of security among the families of farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/opt-for-dry-direct-seeding-urges-cm/articleshow/83700322.cms||Roushan Ali

Take pen-paper exam||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) on Sunday announced that students who are not satisfied with the results of Class 12 to be declared in July, will get a chance to take the board exams in pen and paper format. For this, the regular students of science and the general stream will have to return their mark sheets to the state education board’s office within 15 days of the declaration of results. The board had earlier this month, after cancelling the Class 12 board exams, said it will use students’ performances in Class 12, Class 11, and Class 10 exams to evaluate their Class 12 results. “The date for conducting exams for students unhappy with the methodology adopted for evaluating their performance or for any other reason, will be announced later on,” said sources in GSHSEB. For science stream students, the results will be announced in the second week of July. In the case of Class 12 general stream students, the results are expected to be declared online in the third week of July. The certificates will be handed out to the students in the last week of July. After cancelling the exams, GSHSEB on Thursday said it will use students’ performances in Class 12, Class 11, and Class 10 exams in a 25:25:50 ratio to evaluate their Class 12 results. While Class 10 board results will be given 50% weightage, Class 11 first and second internal examinations will carry 25% weightage. In the case of Class 12 performance, students will be evaluated based on their marks for the first unit test and the internal examination held in 2020-21. Schools have also been instructed by the board to upload the marks of students online. The mark sheet and certificate will be issued by the board to regular students of Class 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/not-satisfied-with-xii-results-take-pen-paper-exam/articleshow/83707699.cms||---

There are a total of 50 buses to be delivered under phase two of the FAME India scheme. Of the 50 buses that were to be handed to Goa from a Hyderabad-based manufacturer, 30 have arrived in the state and are being recharged at the Margao charging station. The transformer through which the charging station is powered has been installed at Margao for the charging station about 15 days ago, KTC managing director, Derek Pereira Neto told TOI. “Presently, we only have the sole charging station at Margao. We require funding from the state and central governments for the setting up of charging stations in other areas,” he said. The 30 EVs are currently being charged at the Margao-based charging station. Of these, only 10 had been operating as of now due to poor footfalls during the Covid curfew. “It is not viable for us to operate all our buses with 50% capacity. We are currently facing a loss of Rs 2 lakh per day due to this,” he said. In addition to this, a tender floated to procure 100 electric mini buses is expected to be opened after 15 days. “We had extended the tender dates for the procurement of 100 EVs due to rising Covid-19 cases, and poor response. Within 15 days it will be opened. Once it’s opened up, simultaneously the work of more charging stations will also be taken up.” he said. These mini EVs will be run on operational cost method and are different from the bigger electric buses that were launched under the FAME India scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktcs-electric-buses-get-charging-station-at-margao/articleshow/83700924.cms||---

But they seem to have missed the fact that there’s no exemption ons cycling during curfew hours. The city police personnel held special drives at regular intervals where they focused late night cyclists. On June 16 night, cops of Vastrapur police held a special drive in Bodakdev, Vastrapur and on SG Road where they caught at least 15 persons for going out late in the night for bicycling. A police officer said, “We have received various messages from control room about people going out during night on their bicycles. So, we held a special drive and nabbed them. These people usually give the excuse that they were not harming anyone and were cycling to keep themselves fit. But this cannot be allowed in the current Covid situation.” Apart from the cyclists, cops also held three persons who went out for a walk during the curfew hours. An officer of Vastrapur police said that if those persons are so aware about their fitness, then they should go for cycling or walking before the curfew hours. Earlier, a notification by the city police commissioner mentioned that cops have to shown a humanitarian approach in dealing with Covid violation cases. “We still allow people to go if they give reason of someone’s bad health after verifying the details. But merely going out for cycling or walking during curfew hours cannot be considered a valid reason by police,” said a cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cyclists-booked-in-bodakdev-vastrapur/articleshow/83698883.cms||---

The trial for Zycov-D for the 12–18 years category will start at the Institute of Child Health where 100 children have been enrolled, of whom Audrija Dutta and Ahan Roy are a part. They have written to their principals about the enrolment. Stressing that unless children volunteer for clinical trial, the vaccine cannot be introduced for them, principals of the students are happy to see the two kids show a spirit of fearless service. Medicines and vaccines for children have required such trials. In case of Covid, parents here had been largely unwilling, making it difficult for Zycov-D trial to be completed. The trial for adults had started in February and TOI had reported this. Zycov-D has three doses to be administered on the first, 28th and 56th day. It is a needle-free vaccine that will be given by using “pharmajet” to push it under the skin and not in the muscle. The two children, both in class XI of their respective schools, have requested their principals to allow them to write exams on alternative dates, if these clash with the dates on which they are called for the trial or observations. Principals have happily agreed. Audrija, a student of IB board of Modern High School had done projects related to the LGBTQ and sex workers and was always encouraged by her pharmacist father Arghya Dutta and school teacher mother, Sanchita. “I am overjoyed at being able to be a Covid crusader,” Audrija said. “Unless the trial is applied on us, we will not be able to protect children if a third wave comes. I am happy that my family and school are supporting me,” said Ahan. Devi Kar, director of Modern High School said that she has immense respect for the girl who has shown courage to volunteer for the trial. “We need more such brave children,” she said. John Bagul, principal of South City International School echoed this. “We will certainly make alternative exam arrangements for Ahan,” he said. Director of ICH, Apurba Ghosh said, “Not only these two, I have been getting calls from enthusiastic parents who want their children to enroll for the trial. Parents have overcome their fear realising that the vaccine needs to come in for children and without trials this is not possible. Much has changed since last year and Covid has taught us the value of camaraderie.” CliniMed, the trial facilitating agency for Zycov-D was unable to get children below 18 for the trial that was initiated in February. “We are relieved that ICH has found child volunteers and now the trial can be completed,” said Snehendu Konar, a spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-for-children-2-class-xi-students-enroll-for-trial/articleshow/83698882.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The claim coincides with a notice that the police sent Twitter India MD Manish Maheshwari last week, asking him to get his statement recorded in connection with its investigation into videos of assault on a 72-year-old man in Loni. According to data shared by the cops, 255 mails were sent to Facebook during the period and it replied to 177 of them. While Instagram responded to 41 out of 62 mails, WhatsApp wrote back on 28 of 58 queries. A senior police officer also claimed that the response time was another issue with the social media platforms. "While Facebook and Instagram responded once in 45-60 days, WhatsApp took around 90 days to send a reply," he added. Abhay Mishra, the circle officer of Kavi Nagar and nodal officer of the cyber cell, said they needed to get in touch with social media platforms for crimes such as profile hacking, photo morphing, shopping and dating scams and cyber bullying. "In Ghaziabad, around 50% of the cybercrime cases are related to people getting cheated with offers of jobs, insurance and so on. In many cases, fraudsters create a fake ID of some IAS or IPS officer and cheat people by seeking financial help. In such cases, we ask social media sites for details," Mishra added. Around 25% to 30% of the cybercrimes reported in the district are against women, the officer said. In such cases, the accused hacks the social media account of the victim and morphs photos and videos that she has posted. More than half of the victims deactivate their accounts and stay away from filing a complaint, Mishra said. In connection with the assault on the elderly man in Loni, Twitter has given the police another e-mail ID to send their queries. Mishra said they had on Saturday sent mails on the new ID, but Twitter is yet to respond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/26-queries-mailed-to-twitter-in-a-year-no-response-yet-cops/articleshow/83700983.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||Kolkata||Despite Covid stigma, private MBA students get better job offers||KOLKATA: As the 2020-2021 batch of students grapples with the stigma of graduating during the Covid-19 pandemic, the placement season in several private institutes offering MBA programmes have brought good news to the campuses. The highest salary has soared and most of the students have found their desirable positions during the recruitment process. At the International Management Institute, director Mohua Banerjee said that in the 160-strong batch of students who graduated in 2020-2021, average salary reached Rs 8.5 lakhs which was at Rs 8.1 last year. The highest top ten percent of students bagged an average of Rs 13.6 lakh remuneration, which stood at Rs 10.2 lakh in 2019-2020. “Only 25 students opted out of the placement process as they were not keen to move out of their hometown,” said Banerjee. “Highest number of students were recruited in the BFSI and consulting sector. EduTech companies also recruited almost 8 per cent of students this year,” she said. At the Heritage Business School, the total number of students who were recruited by companies is 75 and another 15 students have opted out of the placement process. Among the specialization-wise placement, marketing saw the highest takers followed by finance, HR and systems. “The highest salary for the 2020-2021 is Rs 10 lakh while the average is Rs 4.7 lakh. The salary in comparison with last year is similar and the pandemic has not been able to deter recruiters from offering roles,” said P.K. Agarwal, CEO of the Heritage Group of Institutions. He added some FMCG and logistics companies that are hiring less due to the pandemic have skipped the placement season. In the Institute of Engineering and Management (IEM), the highest package offered to the MBA grads have seen a massive jump to Rs 72 lakh from Rs 10 lakh per year in 2019-2020. The number of companies recruiting has also gone up to 74 from 57 last year. “None of the regular recruiters have skipped the placement this year. However, due to the pandemic, the entire placement process including group discussions and interviews was held virtually. Only four companies opted for a campus visit,” said Satyajit Chakrabarti, director of IEM and chancellor of UEM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/despite-cov-stigma-pvt-mba-students-get-better-job-offers/articleshow/83698948.cms||Somdatta Basu

Infectious disease experts caution that since Covid-19 and influenza have a similar disease presentation, doctors should think of H1N1 if a person doesn’t respond to treatment for coronavirus. Infectious disease expert Dr Vasant Nagvekar recently treated two patients who presented with cold, fever and headache. What raised the red flag was that one of the patients, in his 30s, had recently recovered from Covid-19. And literature shows that Covid re-infection cases are rare and typically not seen within 90 days. Dr Nagvekar, who consults with Lilavati and Global hospitals, said they sent the patient’s samples for the H1N1 test and it returned a positive result. He has so far seen two cases of H1N1 and a third one of H3N2, also a subtype of influenza A. “The message here is there are other viruses in circulation and doctors should keep them in mind, especially when a patient is not responding to Covid treatment,” he said. There have been two confirmed cases of H1N1 reported to the BMC this year, said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. The city had reported 44 cases last year when the pandemic started. There were 451 cases and five deaths due to H1N1 in 2019. Both Covid and H1N1 are respiratory diseases, hence right diagnosis is important, says Dr Om Srivastava, infectious disease expert and a taskforce member. “There are similarities, but important differences too between the two viruses, their incubation and how they spread,” he said. Dr Srivastava has till now seen about a dozen cases where the patients have tested positive for both Covid and H1N1. “In a majority, they turned out to be false positives for H1N1. But a positive report for H1N1 shouldn’t be disregarded since it can also cause severe disease and death,” he said, adding in most H1N1 cases, symptoms resolve by the fifth or seventh day. Trends suggest the occurrence of H1N1 is cyclic, where a big jump is seen only in alternate years. After 2,287 cases and 246 deaths in 2019, Maharashtra reported 121 cases and three deaths last year. Data for this year couldn’t be obtained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-not-covid-check-for-h1n1-say-docs/articleshow/83701059.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Ahmedabad||Tribal Gujarat pays blood money in EMIs as Covid hits incomes||AMIRGADH (BANASKANTHA): Corpses dangle from trees as dramatic reminders that the aggrieved want justice. Blood money is paid by the offenders called out by this age-old tradition of ‘Chadotaru’ (roughly translated, ‘hanging’) followed by the tribal people of northeastern Gujarat. But Covid and the resultant hit on incomes have necessitated a concession — tribal elders have authorized the collection of blood money in easy monthly installments. The ‘panch’ (committee of elders) decided that allowing EMIs was a prudent move since it is impossible amid the pandemic and financial crisis to recover large sums from the offenders in one go. These sums can go up to Rs 8 lakh in cases of suspicious deaths. The Chadotaru amount is distributed among the family members of the victims. About five years ago, Chadotaru involved revenge. When someone was murdered, their family members marched to the house of the suspect. According to community elders in Amirgadh, bloodbaths were common when vengeance rather than compensation was central to the idea of justice. “To end the violence, we introduced the provision by which the culprits could give monetary help to the victims’ families,” said Khimji Dungaisa, a panch member of the tribal community and the sarpanch of seven villages in Amirgadh. “The compensation is between Rs 6 lakh and Rs 8 lakh if the victim is a newly married woman or a young man who died during a visit to his in-laws’ house,” Dungaisa said. Dungaisa said that the EMI option has been adopted mainly by the Dungari-Garasia tribal people in the northeastern part of Banaskantha. “We have come across many cases in which people were unable to pay huge amounts due to the pandemic and the subsequent restrictions that hurt earnings,” said Dungaisa. “As for the EMIs, not only does the prime suspect pay but also his relatives.” Keshaji Rathod, a resident of Upla Khapa village, said that his brother was made to pay blood money after a woman riding pillion on his motorcycle died from a fall. “We were told to pay Rs 6 lakh as it was a case of accidental death. But we were unable to pay so much,” said Rathod. “So our panchayat directed us to pay an EMI of Rs 15,000.” A social activist working in the district said that the tribal people do not have faith in the state police and law enforcement agencies. That distrust sustains the tradition, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/blood-money-now-taken-in-emis/articleshow/83698939.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man shows interest to buy phone online, dupes owner||MUMBAI: A 26-year-old man was arrested by the Andheri police for duping an owner of a high-end mobile phone worth Rs 71,000 following an advertisement on an online classifieds portal. The victim, Mohammad Yunus Picturwala, 25, a Jogeshwari resident was keen to sell his phone and uploaded an advertisement on the online portal on June 6. Two days later, he checked the portal to see if there was any response to his advertisement. A prospective buyer named Rajeev had shown interest in making the purchase. The two men exchanged phone numbers and scheduled a meeting. “The accused asked to see the phone when he came face-to-face with Picturewala. He told Picturewala that his brother would arrive shortly and make the full payment. He then walked away with the phone. When nobody arrived to pay up, Picturewala realised he had been duped and lodged a police complaint,” said an officer. Using technical surveillance methods, the police tracked down the accused to Virar. He was identified as Nikhil Suman. The phone was seized from the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-shows-interest-to-buy-phone-online-dupes-owner/articleshow/83702594.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu: No showpiece for poll campaigns, would rather work independently||Patiala: While he has been using social media to launch attacks on his own party’s government in Punjab, Navjot Singh Sidhu has avoided long interactions with media since his resignation from the state cabinet over a change of portfolio in July 2019. Finally breaking his silence, the Congress MLA answers questions on speculations that he is aspiring to be the deputy CM or the Punjab Congress president. He insists that he is not after any position and has full faith in the Congress high command. You say you’ve been reflecting over the past few months. How do you see the current situation in the state? The system has been governed by two powerful families, who have controlled it, through officers, belittling the legislature. For what? For business interests. The people of Punjab elected MLAs. They did not choose any officers. But when you make a system accountable to the officers, where is the power of the people? I joined in after Prashant Kishor came and met me almost 60 times. I told him that I have an agenda – the power of the people should not be restricted to a select few for their selfish interests. For me, politics is a mission, not a profession. I went to the system about sacrilege. It is like someone hitting our souls. I begged for justice in the assembly, and released CCTV footage of the firing incident. I started and ended the 2019 Lok Sabha campaign with the sacrilege issue. The system wanted to take action on this top priority issue in the past six months. When there is a threat to your position, only then you take note. Were you sleeping for over four years? Why nothing happened on power purchase agreements (PPA). Where is the White Paper? You quit as minister for local government in 2019. What had transpired? There is no independence. One person controls it all. It’s alright if you are with them. Otherwise they stall their (ministers’) works. I had a proposal of five bridges for Amritsar that I put forth before (former CM) Parkash Singh Badal. I revived that proposal (during the present regime). The system said, “no”. I followed my pro-people agenda from the very first cabinet meeting. I gave a proposal to change the liquor policy. It is not Rs 300 crore or 500 crore but about Rs 30,000 crore. Citing the example of Tamil Naidu, I said, “Let’s change this policy, sir”. The proposed corporation would have given employment to people, generating money to be spent for the ETT teachers. Why implement pay commission recommendations in the last six months (of the government)? I went to the system with a mining policy. Punjab has three rivers, but the last government generated only Rs 40 crore. I went to Telangana: Rs 10 crore to Rs 2,500 crore from one river in five years. I said fix the rates. I went to the system for a law against the cable mafia. I talked about Justice Kuldeep Singh Report’s report on land grabbing in Mohali and elsewhere. I sought a change in the way private buses are given permits. My portfolio was changed because of my speech demanding justice for sacrilege, in Bathinda. The system put the ‘Minister of Power and Renewable Energy’ plate outside my office. I said, “no”. I said I will reject the system that has rejected all of my proposals... I went back home, meditated and contemplated during these months. People said, ‘Sidhu is silent’. But I brainstormed each day. Punjab doesn’t need a Gujarat or Delhi model, but a Punjab model inspired by Guru Nanak. The state’s exchequer has gone to individual pockets, loans taken to return loans. People of Punjab think the loan is on the state government, but it will be recovered from them. After this, the system invited me for tea and then lunch and said, “take this ministry”. But I said no. The system said: “All of us want him (Sidhu) in the cabinet, he’s so dear.” What changed suddenly? Or is it that you want to use me in the election campaign and then put the showpiece back into the closet? I say: You fulfil the agenda; I will support you without a post. You may even appoint me in the zila parishad. But if you do not fulfil people’s aspirations, no post will matter to me. Why would I work under such a system? I would rather work independently, wherever the high command wants me to. Am I a ‘darshani ghoda’ or a showpiece? What exactly was offered to you at these meetings? It does not matter. Positions do not matter to me – is it for an office or a car. They could have offered anything. If they implement the real agenda of the people, I will follow them. When you say ‘the system’, are you referring to the CM, the cabinet or the bureaucracy? I categorically said at the start – two powerful families and their selfish and business interests that have mortgaged Punjab. That is the ruin that has happened. For over one year you were not at the centrestage. Were you politically disillusioned? Not at all. I was contemplating, meditating, working hard. Everything is on paper with me. I will take the agenda to the people. If you implement it, I will work 24X7 with you, without asking for anything in return. Otherwise, I will do it… Today you are reminded of giving positions to Sidhu. What’s your reaction to the latest row over jobs to Congress MLAs’ sons? Is there any merit in it? It is contrary to the spirit of Indian Constitution. I have set an example. My son gave up assistant advocate general post and my wife didn’t accept the position of the Warehousing Corporation chairperson. Should the power of the people go to the poorest of the poor or richest of the rich. If sympathy is the criterion, who should benefit? Have you been in touch with the party high command all this while? I was in touch with them, appraising them about the whole situation. They are supreme and wonderful people. I have full faith in them… One man here has taken the party for the ride. Who takes decisions as the home minister and then shifts the blame? I held him accountable. There is nothing personal, I have no animosity with anyone. I say fulfil the aspirations of people. ‘ Has the party high command thought of any roadmap for you? When I have never asked for anything then why would I clamour for all this. My only agenda is to resurrect Punjab, focussing on the solutions. There are attempts to digress from the main issues. Do you think you can contribute better as the deputy CM or as the state party president? How? When he doesn’t allow you to work. I told you all the ‘nos’ that I got (for my proposals). You met the AICC’s Kharge panel. What did you tell them? I shared the same thoughts with the panel too. This agenda is the only goal of my life. Would you react to the CM's interview that you aspire to be the deputy CM or the party president? See, I have said they are liars. I said, prove it. I have never asked for any position from anyone in my life. I have rejected so many offers all these years. I fight for the people of Punjab and they trust my character. The CM recently said that his doors are closed for you. Who is he to close the doors? Is the CM the Congress? The Congress is the worker, it’s the high command… Have I ever attacked him personally? I only want to remind him of his responsibilities. And are you saying the bureaucracy is in collusion? It’s not about that. The people elected MLAs, not officers. The officers are being used by him. They are good people but accountable to the chief ministers, who can give them a posting or remove them. You’ve made a system accountable to the officers. I always say the bureaucracy is functioning with him. The issue is belittling the legislature and slaving the ministries. In the end, can you clarify about your stay in Patiala? My stay in Patiala is in a house that my father built at exactly my age. Is it a crime if I am spending time here to fight an illness? I do not want to trouble people about my personal problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/navjot-sidhu-no-showpiece-for-poll-campaigns-would-rather-work-independently/articleshow/83703002.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: SP to DGP, Anil Pratham’s 12 years as CID cop||AHMEDABAD: On June 1, Anil Pratham, ADGP (women’s cell) of Gujarat Police’s CID (crime & railways), was promoted to the rank of DGP along with his 1989 batch mate Ajay Tomar, the Surat police commissioner. With that promotion, Pratham set a record of sorts — during his career spanning 31 years, he has worked at CID (crime & railways) for 12 years, about 40% of his service as an IPS officer! Pratham still has two years before retirement as one of the top cops. Talking to TOI, Pratham said it’s by chance that he had served as one of the two superintendents of police of CID (C&R) when the setup was not very extensive, at the beginning of his career. Later, he served as DIGP, IGP, ADGP, and now DGP, in various capacities at CID (crime). He headed the economic offences wing (EOW) of the department for a short period before assuming charge of the women and children’s cell at CID. Pratham was also the principal of the police training college at Junagadh and had a stint with the CISF on deputation. Pratham said that his is probably the longest stint of a police officer in the same department. “In my memory, the other longest stint was that of (SS) Khandwawala sir who was posted with police training units for eight years,” said Pratham. Khandwawala is a former DGP of Gujarat who was recently appointed as the head of the BCCI’s anti-corruption unit. A native of Delhi, Pratham holds MCom and LLM degrees. Before joining the civil service, he worked with public sector banks and insurance firms. Associated actively with Buddhist organizations, he is also the national commissioner of Hindustan Scouts & Guides. Pratham said that his postings are a state government decision. “I see it as a continuation of several initiatives,” he said. “Spending an exhaustive period here (at CID) has allowed me to know several officers and personnel closely and implement policies effectively.” During his stint, the state government had launched a major drive to find missing children and schemes to address crimes related to women. “We have also launched a scheme for senior citizens’ security for which data collection is on,” he said. Pratham was in the news in 2019 for his post on rapes in India. “I read three newspapers in the morning. All over India we have news of rape,” Pratham wrote in his Facebook post while listing the remedies available to women. “Gujarat reported three rapes in the last 48 hours. I am shocked and thought it’s my moral and constitutional duty to share my unhappiness over the subject of women empowerment as I have been holding charge of additional director general of police (women cell) since 2012.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sp-to-dgp-prathams-12-years-as-cid-cop/articleshow/83698974.cms||Parth Shastri

The association’s vice-president Chirag Sethi said that the boycott is a mark of their protest against the order by DDMA, which he said pushes more and more gyms towards closure.“The DDMA order dated June 20 has put the gym owners in a difficult position. Almost all the activities in the capital are open, but there is still no clarity on gyms,” Sethi said. “The owners are now buried under debts. Thousands of gym owners are now forced to down shutters due to pressure from landlords, staff salaries, fixed charges for water and electricity,” he said, adding that the closure of gyms in city will lead to large-scale unemployment and thousands of people losing their livelihood.“In Delhi, we have over 5,500 gyms and at least one lakh people work in the fitness industry. Now we are forced under extreme financial stress with absolutely no help from the government,” he said.“Gyms have opened in the neighbouring states and no case of surge is seen in the city. When we are losing our livelihood, how can we celebrate Yoga Day?” Sethi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gym-association-to-boycott-yoga-day-in-protest/articleshow/83698987.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, two more crematoria planned in Jwala Nagar and Seemapuri may not come up at all.An East Delhi Municipal Corporation official said that tenders were floated, but no company came forward to accept the work. Ghazipur and Karkardoom Shamshan Bhumi ones are the two new crematoria operational with two furnaces each.CNG furnaces ensure faster, low-cost funerals with less environmental pollution. Before the novel coronavirus pandemic, CNG furnaces were available only in Nigambodh Ghat and Punjabi Bagh Shamshan Bhumi. Not only has the number of furnaces been increased at Nigambodh, new furnaces have been installed in the crematoria at Green Park and Subhash Nagar, Karkardooma and Ghazipur. Officials say that one full cremation takes around 1.5 to 2 hours in a CNG unit and the same can be used for 8-10 cremations in a day. A traditional wood-based cremation site gets occupied for entire day for a single funeral, so less number of bodies can be cremated.Delhi has seen need for cremation infrastructure upgradation during the pandemic, especially during the second wave.

---||Chandigarh||Jobs to 2 MLAs’ sons: Nine ministers and 4 Congress MPs back Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh's decision||CHANDIGARH: Coming in defence of CM Captain Amarinder Singh-led Punjab government, under fire for giving government jobs to sons of two sitting legislators of the Congress party, senior party leaders backed the decision and slammed critics for failing to appreciate a state policy that had been in force for many years now. They termed the collective decision of the cabinet to give government jobs to sons of sitting MLAs as “correct and in line with appointments done in the past”. The leaders stated that when other similarly placed persons were being regularly given benefits under the state policy it would be “unfair to discriminate” against the children of MLAs simply because their fathers are holding such positions. The Punjab cabinet on June 19 had approved jobs to sons of Fatehjung Singh Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey, kicking off a political storm. The move was opposed by cabinet ministers Charanjeet Singh Channi, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhbir Singh Sarkaria, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Razia Sultana, besides PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar, and MLAs Kuljit Singh Nagra and Amarinder Singh Raja Warring. In a joint statement issued by ministers Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi, Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, Vijay Inder Singla, Aruna Chaudhary, Sunder Sham Arora, Gurpreet Singh Kangar, Balbir Singh Sidhu, O P Soni and Bharat Bhushan Ashu, and MPs Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Ravneet Singh Bittu, Jasbir Singh Dimpa and Mohammad Sadiq, it was pointed out that Punjab had always been a welfare state and it had been giving jobs to various classes of persons keeping in view the hardship faced by them as a result of unforeseen and tragic circumstances. Apart from terrorist-affected families, jobs and/or financial assistance had been given to handicapped persons, rape victims and the families of 1984 riot victims, defence personnel killed in action, and government employees who die in harness, to name a few. Lal Singh, chairman of Punjab Mandi Board, also came out strongly in support of the decision and advised all political leaders of the Congress to refrain from making any statement that could potentially weaken the party. Giving details of appointments given in the past to families of terrorist-affected victims, the leaders pointed out that there were at present at least five such officers in the IAS cadre of Punjab who had originally been appointed to the Punjab Civil Service (executive) on these grounds. They quoted cases of the department of excise and taxation where 108 jobs, including two ETOs, had been given to the victims on these grounds. Similarly, six terrorist victims had been appointed as naib tehsildar and many other victims had been given significant appointments in other departments and continue to serve on senior positions in the state. Petrol pumps, ration depots and other self-employment avenues have also been provided on priority to such families. The victims of the 1984 Sikh riots have also been given similar benefits in addition to financial aid, they said. They said in the last four years, 72 next of kin of defence and paramilitary personnel who died in line of duty, had been given jobs, including PCS (executive) allied services like tehsildar, ETO, assistant registrar cooperative societies, etc. Another 10 persons are being called for interviews shortly, while nine families have reserved the jobs for their minor children. Financial assistance of Rs 50 lakh is also being given as a mark of respect and gratitude to these families. Even in recent farmers agitation against the central farm laws, the state government has assured a job to each of the families of the farmers who have died during the agitation, and the process of providing these is already underway, they said. Financial assistance is also being extended to all such families. The leaders said people critical of the move had lost sight of the fact that a job of DSP was given to the grandson of Beant Singh, former chief minister, who was assassinated by terrorists while a job of naib tehsildar was given to the wife of late MLA Baldev Singh. Citing additional examples, they said after assassination of DIG A S Atwal in 1983, his wife was appointed to the PCS (executive). Subsequently, his son was given a job of inspector in the Punjab Police. In the present case, Fatehjung Singh Bajwa was a minor when the tragic incident occurred, in which he lost his father, while Rakesh Pandey was incapacitated by an accident which did not allow him to take up employment under the state government. “It is perfectly justified that their children should be offered these jobs,” they said. The leaders stated the Congress government had accorded top priority to Ghar Ghar Rozgar Te Karobar Mission, which had facilitated employment for about 17.6 lakh youth, of which 62,743 persons had been provided government jobs, 9.97 lakh persons had been assisted in self-employment and 7,01,804 private sector jobs had been facilitated. The government has already initiated the process for filling up an additional 1 lakh government jobs, they said. The CM also defended the decision of the cabinet by observing that one could not allow sacrifices to go waste while reiterating that the Punjab government would continue to recognise each such contribution to the state’s peace and harmony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jobs-to-2-mlas-sons-9-ministers-and-4-cong-mps-back-capt-govts-decision/articleshow/83703004.cms||---

Financially hit by the pandemic, many parents are preferring government schools for their wards, making government schools in urban areas must sought after. However, the trend is limited to urban areas. In the last one week, S Baskaran, a teacher from the panchayat union middle school in Avanathankottai west in Pudukottai district, has been making door-to-door visits campaigning for admission by hiring an auto rickshaw. 17 students have joined the school in the last two weeks. While most of them are shifting from private schools, he says there are many villages where people are unaware of admissions and academic activity. He has been approaching the parents to sensitize such parents to get students admitted to his school. “Unlike private schools where online classes are being conducted, we are also engaging students through WhatsApp classes. In addition to the Kalvi Tholaikatchi classes, we are trying to keep students engaged in academic activity,” he said. Unaiyur government high school headmaster S Sarkunan said that he was able to admit 21 students by making door-to-door visits in nearby villages. “While the population of children is less in neighbouring villages, we have no option but to keep track of children to approach them when they attain school going age. As the livelihood of parents are hit, we travel the extra mile to get the children admitted,” he said. Though Karur district continues to remain among 11 districts where relaxation has not been announced, government schools teachers have been unofficially asked to visit villages to get children admitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/govt-teachers-in-rural-areas-still-walk-extra-mile-to-enrol-students/articleshow/83697088.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Goa||In absence of bettors, court acquits two of gambling charges||PANAJI: In two separate gambling cases, two courts acquitted two accused as the prosecution failed to arrest or charge any persons offering the bets. In the case of a 37-year-old accused caught with Rs 530, carrying out gambling activities by way of betting on digits of numerical figures, near the wholesale vegetable shop at Honda, the court has held, “In order to prove gambling there has to be an acceptor and bettor. In the present case, the prosecution has chargesheeted only the accused and the bettor is missing.” “Thus, there is absolutely no iota of evidence to show that the accused was accepting matka bets and that the articles attached under the panchanama are the articles used for gambling,” stated JMFC Sattari at Valpoi, Girija Govind Gaonkar. In the second case where a 25-year-old accused was caught near the Panaji KTC bus stand with Rs 4,495, accepting bets in the form of numerical figures in 2019 , the court held that for gambling activity there must be two parties—one who offers the bets and the other who accepts the bets. “In the present case, not a single person offering the bets has been arrested or charged by the police. There should be somebody to offer the bets before the other, who accepts them. In the absence of any person who offered the bets, it is difficult to accept that the accused accepted the bets,” JMFC Panaji, Sabino A Braganza, stated. To the prosecution’s contention that the accused was accepting bets in an open public place, the court held that “the non-examination of any independent witness is fatal to the prosecution’s case”. “Even assuming that the case and the articles were seized from the accused, it cannot be directly concluded that the accused was gambling in the public place. There is no evidence that the cash was derived from any gambling activity,” the court held. Both the accused were acquitted under Section 11(2) a of the Goa, Daman & Diu Public Gambling Act, 1976.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-absence-of-bettors-court-acquits-two-of-gambling-charges/articleshow/83701141.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Ludhiana||No end to rift: Amounts to horse trading, says Pargat Singh||JALANDHAR: Questioning appointment of sons of two Congress MLAs in police and revenue departments, the incumbent party’s Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh has said these appointments created wrong perception about the party and the government and should thus be rescinded. The episode actually amounted to “horse trading”, he said, adding that the appointment of Congress MP Ravneet Bittu’s brother as DSP in Punjab Police was also wrong. “We could not give jobs to scores of others who really needed jobs to sustain themselves but our government has used parameters for these two appointments which nobody can understand. I pity the MLAs also who got these jobs for their wards,” Pargat said while addressing a press conference here on Sunday. Punjab cabinet on Friday had approved appointment of MLA Fateh Jang Singh Bajwa’s son Arjun Partap Singh Bajwa as inspector (Group B) in Punjab police, while MLA Rakesh Pandey’s son Bhisham Pandey has been appointed as naib tehsildar. “Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has proved that how he can deliver things if really wills to do something as he pushed these through despite opposition from his cabinet ministers. His firmness for these two appointments shows that if he intends he could deliver on other issues too and the only issue is of political will,” Pargat argued. Already Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar has opposed these appointments. “This clearly reflects what type of perception is being created for the party and the government,” he said, while appreciating the stand taken by five minsters who opposed these appointments. Responding to a question that similar parameters were used for appointment of Congress MP Ravneet Bittu’s brother as DSP, Pargat responded, “The appointment in that case was also wrong. No political person should get such appointment for his kin on such parameters.” He said over 400 farmers have lost lives on borders of Delhi and their families need compassion. “The state government could have provided some quota for their families, who would have to pass through tests also, to recruit their kin in Punjab Police when new recruitments have been opened,” he said. Pargat also argued that differences within the Congress are on issue and not of any factions. “However, a perception has been created as if fight is between Captain Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu. The contention is around issues,” he said. Nawanshahr Congress MLA Angad Singh has also asked the state government to review its decision. He urged MLAs Bajwa and Pandey to reconsider before accepting offer of the government for these jobs. Angad posted about his dissent with Punjab’s decision on his Facebook page.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/no-end-to-rift-amounts-to-horse-trading-says-pargat/articleshow/83703009.cms||---

His letter came to light sparked a row a day after the CM slammed the state Congress chief Nana Patole’s remark that “MVA is not a permanent affair and is supposed to last only 5 years”. Amidst the controversy, city Congress chief Bhai Jagtap reiterated that his party would contest BMC polls alone. He said there is discontent among Sena MLAs as Congress-NCP MLAs get development work sanctioned quickly, but not them. He also expressed disappointment over not receiving support from his own partymen. Alliance with Cong & NCP is weakening party, writes Sena MLA in letter to CMUrging CM and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to join hands with the BJP ahead of the civic polls in Mumbai, Thane and eight other cities, party MLA and spokesperson Pratap Sarnaik alleged that MVA partners, Congress and NCP, were poaching Sena cadres and weakening the party. “Although we are in power in the state, I do not get support from government agencies or any leader within the party. My family and I have been fighting a legal battle for the last 7 months,” he wrote in a letter to the CM. Sarnaik said joining hands with Prime Minister Narendra Modi would also be beneficial for leaders like him who are “facing harassment due to cases being foisted on them by central agencies”. Incidentally, Sarnaik’s son is married to BJP MLA Ranjeet Patil’s daughter. There is speculation that sections in the BJP may have put pressure on Sarnaik to write the letter to the CM. Former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya lashed out at Sarnaik, saying “he is afraid of going to jail” because of his involvement in corruption. “All ‘ghotalebaj’, Sarnaik, Parab, Waikar.. will have to be guests in jail,” said Somaiya. The BJP leader also lodged a complaint at Thane’s Vartak Nagar police station about Sarnaik missing for the last100 days. Significantly, the letter was sent to the CM on June 9, the same day the Sena MLA and his sons Vihang and Purvesh filed a petition in the Bombay HC seeking protection from arrest and an order to restrain the ED from investigating them in the National Spot Exchange Limited money laundering case. Shiv Sena leader and MP Sanjay Raut said this was a non-issue. “The only important point raised in the letter was about ‘being unnecessarily harassed’. If a letter is written over harassment, then the focus should be on what was the unnecessary harassment, and who, why and to whom the harassment is being meted out to,” Raut said. Reacting to Sarnaik’s letter, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said his party will consider a tie-up if Uddhav makes a statement similar to Sarnaik’s. “After all, BJP was not for breaking the alliance with Sena,” Patil said. State Congress chief Nana Patole, who had said that the national party would contest the next assembly polls alone, chose not to react to Sarnaik’s letter, saying it was the Sena’s internal matter. On Saturday, the CM had criticised Patole’s “election-to-election” mindset, saying it’s not the time to indulge in electoral politics considering the challenges posed by the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sena-mla-to-cm-bjp-tie-up-will-help-those-under-central-probe/articleshow/83709403.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

It violates various forest laws and constitutional provisions. This is an organised criminal act, with breach of trust, besides contravention of other legal provisions. Hence, I had complained to the governor seeking appropriate action against all those involved,” said Hemant Chhajed, former member, State Forest Lands Committee. “Karnala forest area land was divested to form Barapada village around 1982. Change of rights and occupancy was done illegally to favour Thakur and his family members under political influence,” said Anarjit Chauhan, an RTI activist. He added, “Forest land was first divided into small plots to facilitate future illegal sale instead of giving back to the government as per provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. Hence, illegal land transactions should be cancelled by the forest department,” “We have legally purchased the land and there is no violation. No activist has approached us about any violations,” Ramseth Thakur told TOI. “An inquiry has been ordered into the alleged forest land transactions as per the complaints received,” said S V Ramarao, chief conservator of forests (territorial), Thane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-activists-decry-karnala-land-grab-ex-mp-denies-violation/articleshow/83702728.cms||Umesh K Parida

Set up under the ‘Garima Greh’ scheme of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, the objective of setting up such a shelter home is to integrate transgender people into the mainstream. The three-storey building would provide infrastructural support to 25 transgender persons at a time and make them self-sufficient by empowering with skill training programmes which may open a range of professions they can choose for their livelihoods. A separate skill training block has been built to provide soft skills. Dostana Safar, a social organisation working for the welfare of transgender, is running this shelter home, being monitored by the district administration. The centre has been named as ‘Garima Griha’. Reshma Prasad, the convener of the organisation, said 11 trangenders, including nine trans-women, have been identified and five of them have already shifted there. “It is open for those transgender people who do not have any means of income and are abandoned by the family. We will make them self-reliant to earn their livelihood instead of begging,” she said on Sunday. The trainers are imparting skills such as make-up, dance and yoga. “We will also introduce computer literacy programme, language courses and entrepreneurship skills. Besides, we will start coaching to prepare transgender people for the recruitment in police services under the proposed separate police battalion for them,” Prasad said and added: “Some educational institutions, including Notre Dame Academy and Patna Women’s College, have also extended help to train them.” The inmates were delighted to find a place to learn something and become independent. An 18-year-old Naina (name changed) from Phulwarisharif, who is preparing for the government job, said the shelter home is a boon for thecommunity. “We start out day with yoga. After breakfast, we do online classes of different subjects. I also watch television in my free time,” she said. Kusum (name changed), 24, from Muzaffarpur said she wants to join the police service. “The shelter home is the best platform for me to achieve my dream. I had to leave my home because of social stigma. Now, I want to make my family proud of me,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/states-first-transgender-shelter-home-set-up-in-patna/articleshow/83697108.cms||Faryal Rumi

On Sunday, most roads in the hill towns were brimming with people. For the first time in the last two and half months, Naini Lake could be seen dotted with boats. “We were all waiting for the tourists. The boatmen, local shopkeepers, hawkers and even the people selling momos and noodles are finally making a profit in months,” said Ajay Ram, a local shopkeeper. Many of the tourists – both in Nainital and Mussoorie – could be seen disregarding the physical distancing norms in place due to the pandemic. “It seems people have forgotten what happened a month ago. They have again started moving around without masks and without social distancing. These people are putting at risk the lives of not only themselves, but also of others,” a worried resident said in Mussoorie. Meanwhile, as the government released new Covid-19 lockdown guidelines on Sunday, shopkeepers, who had announced a stir if shops were not allowed to open, expressed disappointment. “Why are shops allowed to open only till 5 pm, while restaurants and bars can remain open till 10pm? In the tourist places such as Mussoorie and Nainital, maximum tourist footfall is seen on weekends, when the shops have been told to stay shut. I do not understand the logic behind these decisions,” said Rajat Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Traders Association. Station officer of Mussoorie, Rajeev Rauthan, told TOI that regular challans were being issued to those not wearing masks and a police force was deployed across the town to manage traffic. “For weekends, we have additional force to manage the traffic while mobile teams are also patrolling the eateries on Mussoorie-Dehradun road and ensuring all norms are being followed,” Rauthan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mussoorie-nainital-come-alive-to-tourists-shops-do-brisk-biz-but-covid-norms-go-for-a-toss/articleshow/83697109.cms||Anmol Jain

The former District Youth Congress (Rural) president took eight to 10 bullets, cops have said. Police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar has said on the basis of preliminary enquiries that Sukhmeet was on way to a birthday party when attacked. He died on the spot. Having almost served his sentence, he was released to decongest the prison during the Covid-19 pandemic. Bhullar said court had sentenced Sukhmeet and five others for kidnapping a realtor’s son in January 2008 for a ransom of Rs 1 crore. Developer Subhash Mahindru of Mota Singh Nagar was a friend of Sukbmeet. After he got his son back, Subhash tried to hide the matter but the media got the whiff. Police swung into action and saved the boy. The family gathered from police, later, that Sukhmeet had a hand in the crime. Sukhmeet had become a councillor in 2007.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/former-cong-councillor-shot-dead-in-jalandhar/articleshow/83703024.cms||---

It effectively meant two cases every 15 minutes. To put the figure in perspective, just a fortnight ago, the state was adding 10 cases every 15 minutes. The state recorded a steady drop in daily cases from its peak on April 30 when 14,605 daily cases were recorded. In 50 days, Gujarat’s daily tally got dropped by about 80 times, as the Covid mortality got reduced 43 times. The drop in cases was almost similar for the districts — areas outside eight municipal corporations — and major cities. The drop for districts was 81% in the past fortnight. In comparison, Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Rajkot recorded a drop of 80%. Only Surat city recorded a slightly lower drop at 68%. In overall share, the eight municipal corporations accounted for 65% of the daily cases on April 30. In June, the average share of the eight cities remained at 48%. The mortality rate, however, increased slightly for the state with the drop in positive cases, but slightly lower drop for the deaths. In the past fortnight, Gujarat recorded 111 deaths from 6,948 positive cases, giving mortality rate of 1.6%. In the preceding fortnight, the state had mortality rate of 1.3% — 452 deaths from 34,915 cases. Is the state past the second wave? Experts agree that it’s a downward movement in cyclic nature of the pandemic. “The estimates for the next peak vary wildly from a few weeks to a few months. When would it come? I would say that the citizens can answer it – at several public places, we have stopped wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. With such behaviour, we would surely invite the third wave faster,” said a city-based epidemiologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/at-185-state-records-lowest-new-cases-in-14-months/articleshow/83699225.cms||Parth Shastri

A complaint was lodged in the Keeranur police station by Ramachandran from Trichy, following which police are conducting an inquiry. The temple belonging to Kulothunga Chola - III in Keelananchur village is under the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR and CE) Department. While a priest is appointed for the temple to carry daily rituals, the temple sees devotees from across the state until it was closed two months ago due to covid -19. Three days ago, one of the villages found the Nandi sculpture and the entrance of the temple damaged. The Nandi sculpture was beheaded, and a few other stone sculptures were also found to be damaged. The temple has a stone sculpture of a king assumed to be that of the Kulothunga Chola – III. The temple also has sculptures of Vinayaga, Krishna and Amman. Most of the sculptures inside the temple were not damaged.“Since the temple was closed during the lockdown, there was hardly any movement around and the vandalism went unnoticed,” said S Krishnan from Keelananchur village.

The move is expected to restore flights between Dubai and Trichy to pre-second wave times two months ago. The supreme committee of crisis and disaster management of Dubai has announced new protocol for passengers which will come into effect from June 23. The move will benefit people from Tamil Nadu and Kerala the most who had returned during the second wave and were awaiting flights operations to resume to get back. The urban primary health centre (UPHC) at Periya Milaguparai, close to the bus stand, has been designated exclusively to vaccinate people intending to make international travel. They will be vaccinated with Covishield and can get their second dose after 28 days at the UPHC. For others, the second dose is administered only after 84 days. After losing his job in Dubai during the second wave, S Kadarshah Mustafa, 50, from Lalgudi returned in April. “Considering my experience, my employer offered me employment visa a couple of weeks back, but I was unable to join because of travel restrictions,” he said. Passengers travelling to Dubai should get rapid PCR test four hours prior to their departure. They will also have to undergo another PCR test on arrival in Dubai. On arrival, passengers from India should undergo institutional quarantine until they receive their PCR test result, which is expected within 24 hours. Trichy international airport director S Dharmaraj said he will check with the airlines on the conditions laid down by Dubai as no airport has been doing rapid test in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/as-uae-eases-travel-curbs-trichy-dubai-flights-may-resume/articleshow/83697117.cms||---

Civic officials said these were the year’s first monsoon revelry deaths in Thane. Rescue teams comprising jawaans from the Thane Disaster Rescue Force used hi-tech cameras that are used for underwater rescue operations to track the bodies of both victims, found wedged between rocks at the bottom of the pond. In the first incident, the 16-year-old son of a police constable drowned along the Patonapada stretch of Yeoor. He has arrived with his friends for a picnic in the morning. Assistant commissioner of police Pankaj Shirsat said the teens, all residents of Uthalsar, decided to go for a swim at the pond around 7am. Santosh Kadam, chief at the regional disaster management cell, said the boy dived in, joining his friends, unaware of rocks just below the surface of the water and hurt himself. “He hit his head on a rock and cried for help. His friends rescued him and brought him to the edge of the pond. He complained of a headache, lost consciousness and slipped back into the waters. He got pulled in deep by currents,” said Kadam. In the second incident, a group of six boys from Rabodi went to Patonapada on Sunday afternoon, when two of them started drowning. Only one of them could be saved by his friends. The body of the other was fished out late in the evening. A case of accidental death will be registered with the Vartak Nagar police station, informed officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-boys-drown-in-same-pond-in-yeoor-jungle/articleshow/83701208.cms||Manoj Badgeri

The chances of survival were so slim that the gynaecologist asked us to inform her if the baby girl survives,” said Dr Shakil Vadaliwala, a city-based paediatrician, adding that they used all their might to secure a paediatric ventilator for her. But after 72 days in NICU, the child was discharged from the hospital with weight of 1.3kg. “She was kept in ventilatory care for five days, received blood transfusion four times and also got treated for apnoea. But the child survived against all odds,” he said, adding that the happiness in the eyes of the parents while taking the baby home was worth the journey for the entire team. It was second instance for the team – during the pandemic, they had also handled a child born at just 29 weeks with 900 grams of birth weight. “The child had severe intestinal disease, identified as necrotizing enterocolitis, for which he needed prolonged treatment. He was also supported by the hospital. Such cases were more challenging during the pandemic,” said Dr Vadaliwala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/720g-baby-lifted-out-of-danger/articleshow/83699223.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi Metro Phase-IV deadline on shaky ground||NEW DELHI: Even before construction work of Delhi Metro’s much-delayed Phase-IV project could gather pace after the kick-off at 2019-end, the Covid-19 outbreak brought it to a halt. The second wave and the evolving Covid scenario are now likely to make the project miss its 2025 completion target. Despite the massive challenges posed by Covid-19, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) continued with the construction work, including in the lockdown imposed on April 19 after the exponential growth in Covid-19 cases. There were more than 4,000 workers at DMRC’s sites before the lockdown was imposed, but many workers later decided to leave for their native places. “In addition, many workers who had left earlier for Holi did not return either. This led to a gradual decrease in the workforce to about 2,500 people,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. Dayal said that DMRC not only took care of the workers who stayed back with medical care, accommodation, etc, but also achieved some important landmarks in its Phase-IV construction work. “After the lifting of Covid restrictions, now there is a gradual increase in the manpower available,” he said. He said that with improvement in the Covid scenario in the country, it is expected that construction work will gain further pace, he said, adding that multiple vaccination camps have been organised at the sites for the workers and awareness campaign about the benefits of vaccination among workers has also been conducted. “DMRC is currently engaged in construction of 65 kilometres of new lines across three priority corridors as part of its Phase-IV expansion. These corridors are expected to be completed by 2025,” he said. “However, given the fact that the Covid scenario is still evolving, the completion targets shall be reviewed accordingly,” he said. He said that despite the several constraints induced by the second Covid wave, DMRC continued with the construction work of the Phase IV project and achieved a few important construction landmarks as well. DMRC has completed tunnelling of 500 metres of one of the 2.8-kilometre-long twin tunnels of the Janakpuri West – RK Ashram Marg corridor. “Delhi Metro has also completed casting of over 50% of tunnel segments in the casting yard. The first of the twin tunnels on this stretch is expected to be completed by September later this year,” Dayal said. He said that despite manpower constraints, work on the Majlis Park–Maujpur corridor, which will complete the Pink Line and make it a ‘ring corridor’ is also going on, including work on the fifth bridge over the river Yamuna, which part of this corridor and located near the Signature Bridge. “In April and May, 2021, four major civil tenders of DMRC Phase-IV’s underground sections were also floated. These are all being funded by the loan received through JICA,” Dayal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-ph-iv-deadline-on-shaky-ground/articleshow/83699193.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Chandigarh||Congress played fraud on employees in Punjab: Shiromani Akali Dal||CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday alleged the Congress government in Punjab had played a fraud on its employees by merely announcing implementation of the 6th Pay Commission but leaving its actual delivery “to the next SAD-BSP alliance government”. It said the announcement, which was made on the 11th hour on the eve of the assembly elections in Punjab, contained many anti-employee measures, including stoppage of various allowances. SAD spokesperson N K Sharma said it was shocking that the Congress government was taking credit for the supposed implementation of the pay commission which was due since 2017. Even after the four-year delay, the Congress government had staggered the release of benefits to employees till 2025, he added. “This is a cruel joke on the employees, who have been waiting for years for the release of their dues. Staggering the release of dues till 2025 does not make any sense as the next pay commission will be due in 2026,” Sharma said, while demanding that the total dues of Rs 13,800 crore be released to employees immediately. The Akali functionary said clerical staff and police personnel were most affected. He claimed benefits extended to employees during SAD government tenure in 2011 had been taken back. “Employees who are in the scale of Rs 10,300+34,800+3,200 grade pay will be the worst hit as they will get an increase of only Rs 1,000 to 1,200 per month,” he claimed. Similarly, house rent allowance (HRA) of all categories had been cut, he said. The allowance had been slashed from 30% to 24% for Class A category, from 20% to 16% for Class B, from 12.5% to 1% for Class C, and from 10% to 8% for Class D employees. Additional house rent being paid to employees had been abolished. Similarly, he said, rural area allowance has been decreased from 6% to 5% and non-practising allowance of doctors has been slashed from 25% to 20%. “Conveyance allowance has also been abolished,” he added. The government had now created two categories of employees in the state by enforcing central pay commission regulations for all new recruits, he said. “We cannot have two persons working on different salaries on the same post,” he said, demanding all employees be paid Punjab salary grades.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-played-fraud-on-employees-sad/articleshow/83703027.cms||---

---||Trichy||Covid-19: Trichy to vaccinate prenatal moms||TICHY: With maternal mortality increasing three fold in the district during the Covid-19 second wave compared to the pre-pandemic period, health officials have prioritised vaccination drive for postnatal mothers. Whereas for pregnant women awaiting childbirth, sensitisation drive through public and private health centres has been planned. The district normally records less than seven maternal deaths during April and June (till June 18) every year. But this time, it reported 23 deaths during the corresponding period of which 15 were due to complications from Covid-19. While there were only five antenatal deaths, 18 postnatal mothers have died in the past two-and-a-half months, thus prompting the authorities to focus on mothers who delivered babies since December. The progression of infection and symptoms of Covid-19 among the postnatal mothers were found to be rapid, resulting in mortalities. Rural Trichy seems to have recorded the maximum maternal deaths with at least 10 of the 14 total blocks in the district recording at least one maternal death since April. To prevent deaths among lactating mothers, Trichy corporation has organised special vaccination camps in all the 18 UPHCs exclusively for the mothers. In the rural areas, all government hospitals and block PHCs vaccinated postnatal mothers mobilised by village health nurses. Trichy has around 15,375 postnatal mothers who have had childbirth in the past seven months. “We will be allocating a section of every vaccine stock for postnatal mothers. Private hospitals were also told to inform their patients who were discharged recently to get the jab at PHCs,” a senior health official added. More than 30 centres will vaccinate postnatal mothers exclusively in the district. Similarly, pregnant mothers displaying Covid symptoms were told to be treated and monitored until the swab results arrive. As the immune system of the postnatal mothers will be weak compared to the normal person, sensitisation is planned on a large scale involving private nursing homes. Doctors have urged the families to refrain from conducting baby shower events that attract a huge crowd. “For antenatal mothers, vaccination is not permitted. Self-isolation is the solution we have for now,” the official added. Around 409 urban and village health nurses are to be involved in the vaccination programme for postnatal mothers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-to-vaccinate-prenatal-moms/articleshow/83697149.cms||Deepak Karthik

One need not register on CoWIN but now citizens can register on the spot at the vaccination centres. These claims are being made in the backdrop of the vaccination centres being increased from 282 to close to 400 booths and that nearly 26,000 to 31,000 youngsters in the 18 to 44 age group were registering themselves every day on CoWIN. A major challenge, however, will be regulating the crowd which will throng urban health centres (UHCs) and community centres of the AMC. “We receive stock of more than 1 lakh doses a day for Ahmedabad city. Today, there are more than 50 lakh individuals in the 18 to 44 age group and of these there are 24 lakh individuals who are yet to be vaccinated. We plan to at least provide first dose to these individuals on priority,” says a senior AMC official. The second action plan is to mobilise people right from chawls to residential societies in the age group. From Monday onwards municipal zonal teams will be visiting residential societies to enquire as to how many in the 18 to 44 age group are yet to be vaccinated. Municipal councillors are being requested to scan through voters lists to gather information on unvaccinated individuals. The AMC aims at vaccinating 2,800 vendors and shopkeepers everyday in the city at 14 community and urban health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/on-the-spot-registration-and-vaccination-in-abad-from-today/articleshow/83699220.cms||---

---||Delhi||Expect hot, dry days ahead as city’s wait for monsoon continues||New Delhi: Parts of Delhi recorded a spell of light rain and drizzle, providing a temporary cooling effect on Sunday with the maximum temperature staying four degrees below normal at 34.2 degrees Celsius. Delhi is, however, expected to see hot and dry weather return over the next four days. Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, recorded 0.4mm of morning rainfall till 8.30am on Sunday, with the minimum settling at 25.2 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal. Met officials say while isolated parts may still receive an occasional spell of rain, conditions are currently unfavourable for rain and the onset of monsoon. “We can expect partly cloudy skies and high humidity to dominate the next four days. Some parts may receive an occasional short spell of rain as temperature and humidity are high, but the outlook for rain overall is low,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD). While the southwest monsoon has touched western Uttar Pradesh, further advancement into Delhi has been halted and may take a few more days, Srivastava said. “It has reached Agra and Meerut, but has not moved further forward. The outlook for the next three-four days shows rain is unlikely,” he added. IMD, however, forecasts a chance of thundery development on June 25 and a possibility of very light rain on June 26. Humidity remained high on Sunday, oscillating between 56% and 90%. “Trace” rainfall was recorded in the morning at Palam and Lodhi Road stations. Parts of Noida received 0.5mm of rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm. For Monday, IMD forecasts chances of thundery development in some places, with the maximum settling at 37 degrees Celsius. Delhi’s air remained in the lower half of the ‘satisfactory’ category, with an air quality index (AQI) of 62 on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/expect-hot-dry-days-ahead-as-citys-wait-for-monsoon-continues/articleshow/83699265.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Women with PCOS prone to diabetes, says Hyderabad researchers||HYDERABAD: City researchers have found that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are prone to diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance. They also noticed that there is a strong alliance of PCOS with insulin resistance in Telangana. It is the first study in Telangana to evaluate the link between PCOS and diabetes. “Our study suggested a strong association of PCOS with hyperinsulinemia (higher levels of insulin in blood) and impaired glucose tolerance in Telangana. Glucose intolerance and insulin resistance are usual among women with PCOS. It is associated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (type II diabetes) in the general population. There should be prompt and early lifestyle modifications for those who have a known family history,” said corresponding author Dr Roya Rozati, head of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology, Shadan Institute of Medical Sciences. The study, published in the recent issue of the medical journal, Gynaecology and Women’s Health Research, revealed overall abnormalities of glucose intolerance in 35% of patients studied and 10% in controls. This shows a significant difference. Insulin resistance has a very significant role in the pathophysiology of both type 2 diabetes mellitus and PCOS. “Although numerous women with PCOS are at a high risk of insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and pancreatic beta- cell dysfunction, the exact cause of an increase in insulin levels is not yet known but could be due to elevated phosphorylation of the insulin receptors which reduces the activity of protein (tyrosine kinase) resulting in insulin secretion abnormality,” Dr Roya, who is also a member-secretary of Maternal Health and Research Trust (MHRT), told TOI. Dr Roya said the study was conducted on the population that is relatively young suffering from PCOS and mostly having low body mass index (BMI). The mean age of the subjects was 24.08 years old. The study revealed significant results for fasting glucose, fasting insulin, presence of around eight sub-capsular follicular cysts, when probable PCOS were compared to healthy controls. Prevalence of hyperinsulinemia was 31% in probable PCOS and 8.3% among controls whereas the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance was 35% in probable PCOS and 10% in controls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/women-with-pcos-prone-to-diabetes-say-researchers/articleshow/83699274.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Delhi||How algae growth is partly to blame for your water woes||New Delhi: While increase in ammonia, silt and industrial pollutants in the Yamuna had frequently affected operations of Delhi’s water treatment plants, a combination of factors has now led to unprecedented algal growth disrupting water supply. A Delhi Jal Board (DJB) official said this was the first time in recent years that algae had disrupted operations to this scale. “Both weather conditions and the nutrient load have led to this situation. The water from the Yamuna is stored in the Wazirabad pond. The organic load, nutrients and phosphate from detergent-like particles were high and the temperature has not reached the normal high of above 40 degrees Celsius. There have been regular rains. These have led to an ideal situation for an algal bloom in storage areas,” the official explained. On June 12, the first water supply disruption due to algae was announced by DJB, which was followed by another advisory on June 19. DJB runs nine treatment plants, of which operations at the Chandrawal and Wazirabad facilities have reduced by 25%. Out of the total 935 million gallons per day (MGD) potable water production in Delhi, Chandrawal produces 93MGD and Wazirabad 134MGD. Both are fed by the Yamuna. Usually chlorine is used to treat pollutants but in case of algae, this chemical solution doesn’t work as the resultant water is laden with colour and odour and algae also blocks filters, clarified an official overseeing the operations to tide over the crisis. “The ammonia levels are still below the maximum 0.9ppm mark and can be treated, and for algae, we are using activated charcoal,” he said. Granular activated charcoal is utilised to reduce the pollution. “In future, when ozonation plants are installed, we will be better equipped to tackle this kind of pollution. Last year, we had faced many unprecedented situations with record high ammonia levels,” the official added. The official DJB reports from quality control labs state there are two dominant types of algae in this mix — oscillatoria and mougeotia — while the levels on Saturday night were reported as “uncountable”. Another DJB functionary said flushing had been carried out to discharge harmful algae choking filters. “Algae is still there but the situation is better,” the official added. While battling Covid-19, Delhi has faced frequent water supply disruptions in the past few months due to increased levels of ammonia, industrial pollutants, low raw water supply and increase in silt and mud levels. In April, TOI had reported that during the preceding two months, the ammonia levels in the Yamuna had remained at maximum treatable limit of 0.9ppm or above for 35 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-algae-growth-is-partly-to-blame-for-your-water-woes/articleshow/83699325.cms||Paras Singh

A comprehensive analysis of total figures of detention of violators suggests that on an average eight Amdavadis were caught by police every hour for breaching Covid protocols since the lockdown was imposed in 2020. This does not include cases for not wearing masks. As on June 19, as many as 73,867 cases of violation of Covid norms were reported in which 82,696 persons were caught in those offences, state figures of the city police. This means, on an average, around 182 persons were caught every day while breaking the Covid norms. The city has reported 2.30 lakh Covid cases as on June 19 which means it has reported around 21 Covid cases every hour since the first case was reported on March 19 last year. A senior police officer of the city said that the people were usually caught violating curfew norms during the night and caught for not giving a substantial reason.  Apart from roaming out in night, people do not follow social distancing and especially traders, small shopkeepers and vendors were booked for violating of Covid norms as they did not ensure social distancing among customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/eight-caught-every-hour-breaking-covid-protocol/articleshow/83699326.cms||---

The draft has been recently put in the public domain inviting suggestions and objections. Kapoor has claimed that MPD 41 that speaks of redevelopment of the Walled City is causing panic about the future of trade in the area. He has requested Puri to call a meeting of prominent traders’ associations in the area to understand their perspectives. Every master plan since 1962 has acknowledged Walled City as the trading hub of Delhi but still continuously speaks of its redevelopment of Walled City, he wrote. Traders, he added, have vastly contributed to the development of Delhi but they feel sad that planners, instead of understanding their needs, threaten them with redevelopment, which civic officials portray as shifting out. Dozens of different trades are housed in the Walled City, Asia’s largest wholesale trading hub, and most are interconnected, he pointed out.

The six-member police party from the Shivajinagar police headquarters had escorted the convict, Ved Prakash Singh, from the Yerawada Central Jail to Golwara on a week-long parole, so that he could attend his daughter’s wedding. After the wedding, he managed to give the slip to the accompanying police party. Later, an inquiry was ordered into the incident, following which the sub-inspector and the five constables were suspended. “Ved Prakash was serving a life imprisonment sentence for his conviction in a murder case,” Supekar, who heads the administration department in Pune police, told TOI on Sunday. The police continue to look for him. “Singh’s daughter’s wedding was scheduled for May 14 and he had applied for leave with the prison authorities. The jail officials granted him parole for seven days,” he said. “The escort party took him to his village in Sultanpur district. Singh attended the wedding ceremony. On the same night, all the escort party members slept after having dinner at his home. Singh then ran away in the early hours,” he added. The police party then searched his house and nearby areas. They also informed the local police about the missing convict. They too searched for Singh, but failed to locate him. The police party then reported the incident to the city police. “We conducted an inquiry into the matter and it was revealed that the police party was lax in their approach. Thus, we have suspended them,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/6-cops-suspended-for-convicts-escape/articleshow/83697348.cms||---
---||India||Sedition case: Lakshadweep police question Aisha Sultana||KOCHI: On Sunday, Lakshadweep police questioned activist, filmmaker Aisha Sultana in connection with the sedition case registered against her for a comment that a ‘bio-weapon’ was used against Lakshadweep during a TV channel debate. Aisha appeared before the investigation team by 4 pm and her interrogation continued till 7.15 pm. Later, Aisha told TOI that the investigators were cordial and she was asked to stay back for four more days. “The questioning was mostly centred on the word bio-weapon. They asked me in what circumstances I used the word, why and whether I meant the Centre by it. Most questions were like that,” she added. Aisha said she was able to give clear answers though the questions were tough. “I reiterated my stand that I meant the policies of administrator Praful Patel through my comment. They told me to clearly state that and I said it with clarity. Many questions were asked on the issue,” said Aisha, adding that senior officers were present at the questioning which took place at Kavaratti police headquarters. “They have asked me to stay back here and I think I will have to remain for four more days. They have told me that there wouldn’t be an arrest,” said Aisha. Lakshadweep police sources refused to divulge details of her questioning and said the investigation was progressing. On Thursday, the high court had granted interim anticipatory bail to Aisha in the sedition case. The court, while directing her to appear before the investigating officer, had ordered that if she is to be arrested after interrogation, she should be released on interim anticipatory bail for a week upon executing a bond with sureties. Lakshadweep administration, in response to Aisha’s plea in HC, had said that her alleged statement in a news channel discussion, that Centre relaxed quarantine restrictions for visitors to Lakshadweep so as to use Covid as a bioweapon against the islanders, is sufficient to arouse hatred or contempt among the people of Lakshadweep towards the Government of India. It can be prima facie considered as an attempt to excite disaffection among the people towards GoI, the statement had said. Before leaving for Lakshadweep on Saturday, Aisha had said that she would cooperate with the investigation and that she hasn’t done anything against the nation. She added that she would continue to oppose anti-people activities of the administration and fight for justice. ‘No proposal to shift legal jurisdiction’ Lakshadweep administration, on Saturday, had issued a statement saying that the news reports about shifting jurisdiction of the high court from Kerala to Karnataka was baseless. There is no proposal from Lakshadweep administration to shift its legal jurisdiction from the high court of Kerala to the high court of Karnataka. The news about shifting jurisdiction of the high court from Kerala to Karnataka is untrue, said secretary of information and public relations & collector of Lakshadweep S Asker Ali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/aisha-questioned-by-cops-told-to-stay-back-for-4-days/articleshow/83697406.cms||---

With the Centre approving additional procurement of e-buses under the faster adaption and manufacturing of e-buses in India (FAME-2) scheme for nine cities including Pune, the PMPML chairman and managing director Rajendra Jagtap told TOI that the modifications in the subsidy under the scheme had given them the opportunity to go for more number of e-buses. “Now there is a scope for more number of electric-run buses for the city. At present, the PMPML has a fleet of 150 such buses and orders to procure 150 more under the FAME-1 scheme and 350 more via the municipal corporations has already been given,” the CMD said. The FAME-2 modifications, which were announced by the Centre earlier this month, call for aggregation of e-buses and electric three-wheelers. The Centre decided the aggregation would be via energy efficiency services limited (EESL) agency. “In the last six months, we have had four meetings with different authorities including the MahaMetro regarding the integration of PMPML and the Metro. A total of 450 additional e-buses would be joining the fleet by the end of this year. For the feeder facilities, the buses expected to join the fleet would be 8 to 9 metre-long. Of the 450 buses, the feeder service would need a maximum of 300 buses and the remaining 150 would be used for PMPML’s ATAL bus service,” the CMD said. When asked whether the Metro stations would have adequate parking facilities for the feeder service, the CMD said that the Metro stations had earmarked parking for the buses in their design. “The buses under the feeder service would be small. Hence, a huge parking space would not be needed. Besides, the Metro stations have the parking feature in their design,” Jagtap said. The ATAL bus service was launched last year. It comprises midi buses meant for travelling short distances of around 5km at a Rs5 fare. These small buses connect the commuters to buses running on longer routes. At present, over 150 buses under the service were active. “Considering the increase in the number of commuters using the buses, we started 10 new rural routes from Sunday. The bus stops have been identified and the buses will be available at 30-minute intervals. Some of these routes include Hadapsar-Warwand, Pirangut-Hinjewadi, Bhosari-Manchar, Deccan-Mutha, among others,” the senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-will-allot-300-electric-buses-to-metro-feeder-service/articleshow/83697345.cms||Joy Sengupta

The condition is due to an infection caused in the urinary tract by bacteria, fungi and/or viruses. The infection commonly occurs in the lower urinary tract (bladder and the urethra). Urologist Suraj Lunawat at Apollo Spectra Hospital, Pune, said, “Hot weather also causes dehydration which in turn leads to infrequent urination. Holding in urine for longer periods of time and lack of access to a clean bathroom may also contribute to UTIs. Poor genital hygiene and excessive sweating in the perineal region during sunny days can facilitate bacterial transfer from the rectum to the urethra (especially in females).” Women are at a greater risk of developing a UTI than men. According to statistics accumulated by an Indian company that sells personal hygiene products, this infection affects over 50% women at least once in their lifetime, with a relapse rate of 30-40%. About 75-90% of all common bladder infections affect sexually active women below the age of 40. Gynaecologist Sujata Joshi said, “It is vital to seek medical help if symptoms such as itchiness, pain or burning sensation while urinating, discomfort in abdomen, blood in urine and fever are aggravated. Left unchecked, a UTI can be serious and even fatal in some cases.” Gynaecologist Manju Gupta said, “If a UTI keeps reoccurring or does not respond to treatment, it has turned into a chronic condition.” There have been recent reports of cases in Karnataka where doctors are treating 10-12 Covid patients on monthly, within the age group of 20-60 years, who also contracted a UTI during the second wave. However, Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Hospital said, “In Pune, we have not noticed any co-relation between UTIs and Covid-19.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dehydration-causes-spike-in-uti-cases-experts/articleshow/83697355.cms||---

The ghat had remained shut to vehicular traffic to assist road repairs. The road had been heavily damaged due to landslides last monsoon. The repairs have been carried out at about five crucial spots. The work started in March and now the road has been reopened. The Public Works Department (PWD) has said that it will conduct timely checks at spots, where works have been carried out. Following the repairs, Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has started bus operations towards Mahad, Raigad and other destinations in Konkan through the ghat section this week. The link is among the shortest routes to reach Mahad and Raigad Fort but it has sharp turns and a steep gradient. A PWD official said, “The road was largely damaged in the last monsoon after which it was closed immediately, except for a short period. The state government sanctioned the work in November last year, while the tendering process was completed in March. The work started immediately. Major damage was caused due to landslides and boulders.” The works were carried out in stretches ranging between 30 meters and up to 70 meters. The task was challenging owing to the difficult terrain and narrow space. Meanwhile, the PWD officials said that the work of strengthening of the stretch between Bhor and Varandha ghat has been proposed and work will begin after monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/varandha-ghat-section-reopens-for-vehicles-after-road-repairs/articleshow/83697377.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Congress distances itself from netas’ ‘going solo’ remark||MUMBAI: In a setback for state Congress president Nana Patole and his Mumbai counterpart Bhai Jagtap, the Congress high command on Sunday distanced itself from their statements on going solo in the 2024 Lok Sabha and assembly elections. On the 55th foundation day of the Shiv Sena, CM Uddhav Thackeray had responded to their comments saying that his party too was prepared to contest polls on its own, but this was not a time to discuss electoral politics given the pandemic situation. AICC secretary H K Patil, in-charge of Maharashtra, said it would be too premature to comment on the 2024 LS and assembly polls. “There is no proposal before the Congress on LS elections, neither is there any discussion on such a subject,” Patil told TOI. Patil said all is well with the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. “Since there is absolutely no dispute, I am sure the MVA government will complete its five-year term; it will be smooth sailing for the government,” he said, adding that the entire discussion on going solo for the LS elections appears to be premature. NCP minister Nawab Malik endorsed the views of Patil and Thackeray, saying, the LS election are four years away, so why talk of polls now. “The Congress high command has not announced that it is keen to contest the polls on its own. The statements appear to be the views of individual Congress leaders,” he told TOI. NCP chief Sharad Pawar was the first to announce that the MVA will contest the 2024 elections together to keep BJP out of power. Reacting to the controversy, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said it appears that the MVA government is turmoil in view of contradictory statements made by its leaders. “All parties have their own agenda...MVA is united only for profits and personal gains, we will not topple it since it will be thrown out of power in 2024 general elections. However, if before that it collapses, it will be a by-product for the BJP,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/congress-distances-itself-from-netas-going-solo-remark/articleshow/83702818.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Chairman Manoj Kumar and treasurer Deepak Kumar, both natives of Meerut, illegally took a scholarship amount to the tune of Rs 3.29 crore from the social welfare department against fake admission of SC/ST students in the college, alleged SIT officials. The investigation revealed that the accused had promised students free admission in the college, taken their academic documents and said admission details would be sent to them on the phone. However, none of the students received any call and the documents were used illegally to receive the scholarship amount from the department of social welfare. The duo was absconding for a long time before they were finally arrested by police. Manoj Kumar was arrested from Sahaspur in Dehradun and Deepak Kumar from Meerut district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/chairman-treasurer-of-pvt-college-arrested-by-sit-in-sc/st-scholarship-scam/articleshow/83695602.cms||---

A video created by Roshan Joseph, a pet-lover and resident of this apartment complex, against banning of pets in residential complexes went viral recently. JK Fernandez, secretary of the association said , the association’s bylaws, like that of numerous residential associations in Ernakulam, contain only a clause: “Residents are requested not to keep any pets in the complex in the common interests of the residents, including the elderly and children”. In his video, Roshan had said that while he was taking his dog for a walk, a fellow resident attacked him and kicked his dog. He said he even threatened to poison his pet . Roshan had said that he has been facing harassment from his association over keeping the dog ever since he adopted him. The association, however, said the harassment claims were baseless and that when its members enquired into the matter, both of them accused each other of physical assault and verbal abuse. “In a complaint given to us on June 13, there was no mention of the dog getting hit. The pet dog was never a subject of dispute and there was no allegation that the dog was kicked by the resident or harmed in any other way. No one has heard anyone telling him that they would poison his dog,” said Fernandez adding that the association has raised its concerns with police about threatening and defamatory messages that they have been receiving ever since the video went viral. Also, an FIR was registered based on Roshan’s complaint on June 12 against a person under Sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 294 (b) (uttering obscene words) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. “The accused, with the intention to hurt the complainant and his pet dog, waylaid the complainant …and threatened that he would kill him and the dog. He also hit him and caused an injury to the left eye of the complainant…,” said the FIR. Ernakulam circle inspector Pradeep Kumar said: “In the video, we could only see the man getting hit. So, the FIR was only registered under those Sections as we couldn’t see the dog getting hit,” adding that police have received a counter complaint from the other resident in question and an FIR would be lodged. Roshan, meanwhile, said he stands by his statements, including that his dog was kicked and that he has received e-mails from the association which clearly told him to ‘refrain from maintaining pets’ as per the association bylaws agreed upon by all members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-hatred-towards-pets-apartment-owners-body/articleshow/83697483.cms||---

In reply, ‘Sherni’ makers Abundantia Enterainment Pvt Ltd denied claims and allegations of Asghar and his father. Asghar, in the notice, said, “Film ‘Sherni’ could further aggravate the issue or may add fuel to the fire, which will not only hamper the ongoing investigation but will also prejudice the rights besides causing severe damage to their reputation. My father and I were portrayed in poor light as if we (are) trigger happy persons.” Shafath Ali Khan said, “The story, though they are claiming it as fiction, is of T1 tigress. They distorted the facts and are trying to influence ongoing PIL. Asghar saved people by shooting T1 in self-defence at four metres distance when it charged.” “T1, straying into human-dominated landscape, killed 14 people. The second aspect is the heroine of the film, based on a forest officer who led 13 failed attempts at tranquillizing. My son Asghar and I went there with the invitation of the government. Courts also refused to stay the shooting orders. This film is made at the behest of animal right activists to defame us,” he added. Responding to the notice, Abundantia Enterainment said: “Sherni is a creative work of fiction containing elements that are fictionalised. The film doesn’t depict Asghar and his father Shafat Ali Khan in any manner. They haven’t produced any evidence to prove that film has resemblances with Asghar and his father.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/avni-killer-asghar-serves-notice-on-sherni-filmmakers/articleshow/83699395.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Pune||Zilla Parishad teacher goes beyond duty to enrol nomadic kids||PUNE: Bringing children who sell illicit liquor and victims of child marriage from Kanjarbhat community to school, persuading villagers from sending the girls out of their houses during menstruation, enrolling hundreds of students from the migratory community in nearby schools and providing them with textbooks and midday meals is a slice of the volume of work done by 43-year-old Zilla Parishad school teacher Sunita Katam in the last seven years. Halting Child Marriages “When I joined the ZP primary school in Dubewadi, I was shocked to know that students in Stds III and V were already ‘married’. There was a boy in Std V who was ‘divorced’. I found out they belong to the Kanjarbhat community where child marriages were a norm. I tried counselling their parents, but wa told to not interfere in their customs. I then tried to counsel the children,” Katam said. Many parents were in the illicit liquor business and the children. The 10-year-old ‘daughter-in-law’ would finish the household chores and then sell liquor, she said. Police raids did not help. “The children would run away to the fields when they saw me coming,” Katam added. Katam realised that she may not be able to change the parents, but educating the current generation and hoping that they won’t carry on with their custom with their children, may help. For that, she needed the girls to be in school. “There was hardly any innocence in these children because of the realities they faced. One day, I told one of the girls to come with me to the village. Generally, people trust teachers in rural areas and her ‘parents-in-law’ allowed her to accompany me,” Katam said. The visit, says Katam, changed the girl’s perspective. “She was used to being taunted and looked at with contempt by the villagers. But she saw people welcoming me and according me with respect. She realised that my education was why they were nice to me. I dropped her off at her house and told her to finish her work at home and come to school when she wanted. She started and was soon followed by other children from her community,” Katam added. Fighting superstitions Katam’s work was not done. She saw that many students remain absent or come late and when she visited their homes, she realised that whenever the girls or their mothers were menstruating they were to stay in a makeshift room outside the house or in a room within the house. Cooking fell to the father and the children. “I told them that I have been celebrating Ganeshotsav every year in my house, but I won’t that year. When nothing bad happened to me the villagers relented. Now, they doesn’t discriminate against women when they are menstruating. They also use sanitary napkins,” Katam added. She also started imparting menstrual hygiene training for women. When she was transferred to a new school in Vadgaon Bande, 30km away from her home in 2018, talking about menstrual hygiene, keeping a sanitary napkin box in the school, and menstruation discussion was among the first things she accomplished. When Covid-19 restricted her movements, she started training online. Swati Bande, a widow from the village who has three daughters and a son, said, “When Katam teacher kept on counselling us and after the Ganapati festival incident, all the women decided not to follow those customs.” Schooling for all This year, Katam along with other teachers from her school, conducted a survey at two sugar factories and found that there were 176 children in one worker’s camp and 250 in another. “We were able to enrol 102 out of the 176 children in a nearby school while another 150 from the second factory were enrolled in another school. “At one school, we could help with midday meal provisions. We arranged for textbooks and other study material for most of them. We have also made the head of the camp and some other people download the Diksha app and allow children to use the cellphons to learn. We are concentrating on basic reading, writing and mathematics for now. The children will soon go back to their home villages. Hopefully, they will enrol in nearby schools there,” Katam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-teacher-goes-beyond-duty-to-enrol-nomadic-kids/articleshow/83697393.cms||Ardhra Nair

It is an exploration of indigenous knowledge systems to do with healing and well-being with regard to India and Africa. The objective is to explore how these indigenous knowledge systems help with existing modern global health hazards like Covid-19, diabetes and other lifestyle diseases, as well as social problems such as crime, mental trauma, addiction, and so on,” said Anuja Chakravarty, regional director (Offg), ICCR, Pune. Indigenous knowledge systems refer to education embedded in cultural traditions of regional/local communities. While India’s indigenous knowledge system has given birth to practices such as Ayurveda and Yoga, Africa’s indigenous knowledge system encourages the practice of traditional herbal medicine. The panel of speakers include ICCR president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, Minister of AYUSH Kiren Rijiju, and health ministers of some African nations as well as from some states of the African Union. The panelists will deliberate on the commonalities between Indian and African traditions. Participants can join the free online programme on ICCR’s website, Facebook, Instagram or YouTube channel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/on-yoga-day-experts-look-to-tie-in-africa-india/articleshow/83697410.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Second FIR in vaccination scam; vials fake, bought from outside Mumbai?||MUMBAI: A second FIR has been registered in connection with the fraudulent vaccination drives that a group, headed by a school dropout, had carried out at nine locations in Mumbai even as a BMC’s probe report stated that the doses administered to residents of Kandivli’s Hiranandani Heritage Society were neither allotted nor delivered to any city hospital. Additional municipal commissioner (health) Suresh Kakani said the vaccines may have been bought from outside Mumbai or could be fake altogether. At least 1,100 people were given shots at five of the nine locations—film production houses Tips Industries and Matchbox Pictures, Aditya College, Hiranandani Heritage Housing Society and Kwan Talent. On Saturday, Versova police booked the organiser, Sanjay Gupta, and former Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital (KDAH) employee Rajesh Pandey for the unauthorised vaccination camp at Matchbox Pictures. The duo, mastermind Mahendra Sin-gh and three others were earlier booked by Kandivli police for a similar unauthorised drive at the housing society. “Pandey is yet to be arrested. He has applied for anticipatory bail,” an officer said. The BMC has written to Covishield manufacturer, Serum Institute of India (SII), mentioning the batch numbers of vials used at the vaccination camps, seeking details. “Finding out the source of the vaccines is important to verify if they were fake or genuine. There is also a possibility that they may have been procured from outside the state,” said Kakani, who received the probe report from deputy municipal commissioner Vishwas Shankarwar. Investigators are looking for a suburban doctor who is suspected to have sourced the vaccines. They have learnt that fraudulent vaccination camps were also carried out in Thane and Borivli. In a letter, dated June 16, to KDAH management and CEO, Pandey had admitted to his involvement in the vaccination camps at Matchbox Pictures, Tips Industries, Aditya College and Kwan Talent. He also apologised for besmirching the name of the hospital. “I confess that I was involved along with Singh and Gupta in this activity... I was lured by them,” Pandey wrote. He added that vaccines and other supplies for the drive were organised through a Charkop hospital. The KDAH management said they have already given their official statement to the police after conducting a probe. Pandey had taken the lead for the vaccination camp at Matchbox Pictures on May 29 as he was acquainted with a producer from the company. Around 150 people, including the crew and local residents, were given shots for Rs 1,260 each. But most of them did not get their vaccination certificates. “Ten people got their certificates, but the date was incorrect (June 13) and so was the vaccinator (Nanavati Hospital),” said Versova senior inspector Siraj Inamdar. “We will take Gupta’s custody from Kandivli police after their inquiry is over.” (Inputs: Sumitra Deb Roy)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2nd-fir-in-vax-scam-vials-fake-bought-from-outside-the-mumbai-city/articleshow/83701388.cms||Nitasha Natu

On April 30, the BMC served a notice to buildings and bungalows requesting them to allow a civic-appointed surveyor to demarcate their plot boundary to ascertain the road line, said Shrikant Basrur, who has been living in the gaothan since 1974. “All these years, there has never been any development in the area. Now suddenly, they want to widen the road which will eat into our building compound space and affect several decade-old trees,” said Basrur, adding that a century-old Kailashpati tree on their premises will be lost. Another local, Marilyn Fe-rnandes, said they suspect the road is being widened to favor a building which will get redevelopment nod if the road leading to it is of a certain width. Jacqueline Mundkur, whose grandmother’s bungalow would be affected, said, “Any increase in road width will lead to more parking... All communication in this regard to traffic police and local police have fallen on deaf ears.” Civic officials said the road needs to be widened for ea-sy movement of emergency vehicles like ambulances. “The locals had approached the wa-rd office twice and were informed that the road needs to be widened to provide stormwater and sewer lines,” said an official from K-East ward. “Four open, built-up structures will be affected.

Private hospitals said many of these patients are testing negative for Covid but remain suspect cases of swine flu. Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said over 80% of these suspected swine flu cases are recovering on OPD treatment basis while only a few are needing hospitalization if they have pneumonia and other respiratory illness. Doctors said the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has made only Covid test mandatory and hence, not all patients are getting tested for H1N1. Officially, the NMC so far has no case of swine flu. For the last two years the city didn’t report any H1N1 case. Consultant pulmonologist Dr Vikram Rathi has been seeing more post-Covid patients with respiratory issues than ILI patients. Dr Rathi said if ILI is detected then swine flu and Covid test is usually done. Pediatrician Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala said the usual scenario for patients with cold, cough and fever has been observed but they are recovering in two to three days. “Covid-apt behaviour and use of mask has helped reduce ILI and SARI patients in the last one year. We used to see lots of kids with pneumonia which has gone down. There is a dip of 50 to 60% in asthma patients too. As the monsoon has just begun, we may see influenza patients in the next 15 days,” he said. Pediatric intensivist Dr Vivek Charade said though ILI has been seen in kids, he is yet to get a swine flu patient. “Right now we are not prescribing swine flu test as patients are not serious. Acutely ill, breathing difficulty and coughing cases are only sent for a test. Cases of swine flu and other communicable diseases have gone down because of the lockdown,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/spurt-in-ili-cases-patients-test-covid-ve-but-h1n1-suspected/articleshow/83699479.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The accused introduced himself as Vijay Anand, an Indian origin doctor from Italy. Vijay showed interest in marrying in the victim. “Vijay told the victim that he had decided to come to India and settle with her. He also told her that he had closed his practice there and sent all valuable personal belongings, including some medical equipment, to India through air cargo. About 10 days ago, the victim received a phone call from fraudster’s associate posing as a Delhi-based customs official, informing about Vijay’s cargo being held in customs,” cybercrime ACP KVM Prasad said. The fraudster, posing as a customs official, told her to pay Rs 38,000 as duty. After the victim paid the money, the fraudster again called saying that 20,000 euros were found in one of the parcels and legal action could be initiated against her for trying to smuggle in foreign currency.

Traffic police personnel said that they had been continuously patrolling the highway to ensure that motorists do not stop over and crowd along the highway to take in the sights, and therefore create traffic snarls. Assistant police inspector Amol Valzade said they were focusing more on the highway section in Kasara Ghat area as many had halted vehicles there to watch the streams. “Our patrolling teams are continuously stationed in the ghat section to clear the highway of vehicles. Most people tell the police that they have been confined in their homes for very long and need just a breather. However, our personnel are convincing motorists to not halt in the ghat section as there are chances of landslides,” said Valzade. “If people argue, then they are penalised.” The highway police said every year, during the monsoon, they have to pay attention to the ghat section.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-rush-of-visitors-amid-monsoon-keeps-cops-at-igatpuri-busy/articleshow/83701508.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Delhi||Delhi: Early peek into how revamped Rajpath will look||NEW DELHI: The government on Sunday released the first photographs of a 45-metre redeveloped portion of Rajpath lawns to show how the entire area will get a new look with more facilities for visitors and walkers. Sources said a stretch of at least 100-150 metres will be ready in August and people would be allowed to use this stretch to experience the change. The entire Central Vista Avenue or Rajpath and its lawns, extending from the gates of Rashtrapati Bhavan up to India Gate, covering approximately 4 sq km, will be ready by December. According to CPWD, around 35,000 people visited the area daily before the pandemic and this was likely to increase to 50,000 after the project gets completed. Nearly 40% of visitors are women. It is projected that the number of visitors will increase to 1.18 lakh on Republic Days compared to the earlier average of 1.05 lakh. On June 12, TOI had reported how the housing and urban affairs ministry planned to release photographs of redeveloped portions with all the features, including lush green grass, trees, lights, canal, small bridge and walkways in its bid to dispel misinformation of how the project will damage pristine trees and eat up open public space. A ministry official said by refurbishing the landscaping and lawns, the green cover was being increased from 3.5 lakh sqm to about 3.9 lakh sqm. Proper irrigation system is also being provided. “Canals are being refurbished with proper lining and aerators are being provided to keep the water clean. The photographs released today only reassure this,” an official said. The plan includes providing public amenities such as toilets and vending areas at 10 locations for visitors and tourists. Around 15 km of walkways is being created along Rajpath, canals and lawns. There will be adequate parking space for cars, two-wheelers and buses. There will be CCTV cameras, signage and lighting all along the stretch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/early-peek-into-how-revamped-rajpath-will-look/articleshow/83699654.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Jaipur||Patients begin to reach hospitals for follow up treatments as relaxations are eased||JAIPUR: Prakash Chand Sani (54), a resident of Walled City here, gathered courage to reach a private hospital as the second wave of Covid has now slowed down. He had a gallstone and doctors suggested that it might cause cancer if he did not get it operated immediately. But due to Covid fear, he postponed the surgery. Like him, a 40-year-old was to undergo a bone correction surgery but he postponed it. A lot of cancer patients are now coming for follow-up treatments as Covid cases have dipped. Since the second wave has slowed down, patients who were avoiding a visit to hospital, are now turning up for continuing treatment after a break. Out-patient departments in hospitals have started functioning like in normal days, but with lot of safety measures. “My father did not get a scheduled chemotherapy on time due to fear of Covid. Now, I fear as he has a higher risk of relapse of the disease.We have come from Alwar for follow up treatment, which was discontinued for some time,” said farmer Rajveer Singh. Because of fear of the pandemic and the strict lockdown imposed by states, many cancer patients did not turn up for their treatment, regular check-ups and follow up, which may have led to disease progression in some cases. “This was despite that fact that we at our hospital have been working with full Covid precautions throughout the first as well as the second waves. However, fortunately, now with the 2nd wave declining, patient footfalls have started to increase and is close to ‘business as usual’. At our hospital, even though we are busy again, we are continuing to follow full Covid precautions in our waiting spaces and during interactions with the treating consultant,” said Dr Hemant Malhotra, director of cancer centre at a private hospital.He said for patients requiring hospitalisation for surgery or chemotherapy, they are still insisting that patient undergo a negative throat swab for Covid.Keeping in mind the 3rd wave predictions by experts and learning for the experiences of the two waves, the doctors intend to continue all precautions for at least 2 or 3 more months. “Patients are coming to hospitals in increasing numbers now. Our OPDs never closed during pandemic. But, the number of patients have increased in few days as Covid graph has gone down. We appeal to them to take proper safety measures such as wearing masks and follow social distancing to avoid any risk during pandemic times,” said Dr Rajesh Sharma, superintendent, SMS Hospital. With increase in footfall at hospitals, doctors are also taking proper safety measures. “A cancer patient’s Covid test is done before surgery. At the time when the second wave of Covid infection was at its peak, 30 per cent of the patients who came for surgery had to cancel it due to positive results,” said Dr Sanjeev Patni, director and HOD surgical oncology at a private hospital. He added that during Covid, people were afraid of surgery, but after consultation with doctors, the patients get ready. Now even cancer patients have understood that treatment cannot be stopped due to fear of Covid. In such a situation, patients are coming to OPD at the scheduled time like before.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/patients-begin-to-reach-hospitals-for-follow-up-treatments-as-relaxations-are-eased/articleshow/83699510.cms||---

During pandemic, there has been a rise in the demand for yoga instructors. Many online classes have increased with people from all over the country taking part. In Rajasthan, Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Rajasthan Sanskrit University (JRRSU), Jaipur and Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Rajasthan Ayurveda University, Jodhpur have courses on yoga. Mahaveer Prasad, alumni of Ayurveda University, Jodhpur after doing one-year diploma in yoga and naturopathy takes his classes and gives personal training. “There was always good scope in yoga and with pandemic people have drawn towards this. Breathing exercise for lungs are in demand. This course is really helpful for livelihood,” said Prasad. Another student of Rajendra Kumar, alumni of JRSSU, has been earning around Rs 50,000 per month with personal and online classes. He said, “In pandemic, there has been a rise in demand for yoga instructors. As we cannot take big batches of students, personal training is preferred for which the rates differ between Rs 4,000 to Rs 8,000 per month. If a person is able to make good contacts, he/she can earn better.” Most of these students say that earlier, yoga was just looked for the prospect of religion and spirituality but with time it has been seen with good career prospect. Most of the seats in the universities in yoga are full. Recently, UGC has included yoga in NET for becoming professor. In states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, there are vacancies in government schools for yoga instructors. Abhimanyu Kumar, vice-chancellor of the Ayurveda University, said, “With the establishment of AYUSH ministry in the Centre lot of focus has been given to yoga and naturopathy courses. Unlike other courses, we teach students yoga to be used in medicinal purposes. There are different ‘aasans’ that can be helpful for different diseases. With a certified course, it become easier for any institute to hire you or to get any private job.” In JRRSU as well, diploma, graduation and post-graduation courses are available and most seats filled. Shastri Kosalendra Das, a professor in the university said, “I believe earlier, people used to associate it with religion but now with public demand, many avenues have opened up for yoga graduate. In Jaipur itself, many private schools have hired yoga instructors. In pandemic especially, the desire to improve the immunity system in people has also given a push to this art. In coming years, we can expect more courses in Yoga.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/yoga-booming-as-a-lucrative-career-option/articleshow/83699542.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Bar hotels to remain shut in Kerala from Monday||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Bar hotels in state have decided to down shutters from Monday citing that the increased profit margin granted to beverages corporation (Bevco) by the government on the liquor sold by it to the bar hotels would push them to heavy losses. Bar hotels cited that since they are allowed to sell only at maximum retail price (MRP) when they sell liquor as takeaway parcels, they will end up with losses, unlike the case when they are allowed to serve liquor on their premises. When liquor is allowed to be served in the premises of bar hotels, the bottles are not sold at MRPs, but using peg measures at higher rates than MRP. As per bar hotels association sources, bars roughly make Rs 150 as profit per Rs 1,000. From this, Rs 100 is paid to the government as turnover tax. Once the profit margin of Bevco has been increased from 8% to 25%, the profit of the bar hotels would come down to less than Rs 100, from which they will have to pay the turnover tax of Rs 100, effectively netting a loss. Government had revised the profit margin of Bevco on the basis of a request from the corporation to improve its financial position. As per the order issued by the taxes department on Wednesday, the profit margin of Bevco in its supplies to Consumerfed has been increased by 20%, while the margin in supplies to bar hotels have been increased by 25%. There are 639 bar hotels and 300 Bevco and Consumerfed outlets in state. Bevco has roughly estimated revenue loss at Rs 1,800 crore for sales lost when the outlets were shut. The corporation is expecting to make up for this loss through increased profit margin and sales in the coming days. The very first day of sale after 51 days of shutdown had fetched it Rs 51.25 crore, which is the highest single-day sales ever for the corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bar-hotels-to-remain-shut-from-monday/articleshow/83697602.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Busy jewellery exports zone seeks vaccination||JAIPUR: With markets in the US and Europe having opened for business, gem and jewellery exports are in a better shape. Capacity utilisation at manufacturing units in the Sitapura Exports Promotion Industrial Park and the special economic zone are now closer to pre-Covid levels. But the industry is worried that if the 25,000 workers in the 200 odd units are not vaccinated, uninterrupted production could take a hit. “The vaccination camps started on June 9, but only 1,239 workers have been taken jabs. Camps were organised for three days till today. Although the units are following all the SOPs, the employees need to be vaccinated to avert any closure of units albeit for a limited period. We have written to the chief minister and the secretary industries to ensure continuous vaccination of the workers,” said Rajiv Arora, president of Federation of Rajasthan Exporters. There is a fear of losing overseas clients in the event of a delay in production and dispatch of the goods for exports. Arora said that clients in overseas markets are very sensitive to timely delivery of goods. “If production suffers, the manufacturers will not only suffer the business on the existing orders, but future business will be hard to come by. Foreign buyers does not hesitate to switch suppliers if the existing company fails to deliver on time,” added Arora. The employees are also reluctant to work without vaccination and may leave for their native places if the third wave hits. “If they are not vaccinated, they will not report to work in the event of another outbreak of the pandemic. That will impact the production process,” said Arora. Even as the domestic demand is yet to pick up significantly due to lockdowns in various states, the exports are growing. The government had allowed the units to operate even during the lockdown given the nature of their business where failure to export on time could result in the units paying a heavy price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/busy-jewellery-exports-zone-seeks-vaccination-of-workers/articleshow/83699568.cms||---

The announcement came during his address in a virtual conference on ‘Increasing the Participation and Awareness on Vaccination’ with MPs, MLAs, social activists and religious leaders on Sunday. “The changes would be made in the eligible works under the MLA Lad funds guidelines so that it can be used for advancing the healthcare centres like sub-centres PHCs, CHCs and other health facilities. Next year you (MLAs) can spend the money in the manner you like. I will talk more on this later,” said Gehlot. The state government has increased the MLA LAD fund from Rs 2 crore to Rs 5 crore from this financial year. Of the total, Rs 3 crore was allocated for CM Relief Fund by each of the 200 MLAs for the vaccination drive in the 18-44 years age group. “Since the Union government is giving money for vaccination of all age groups, we will return the funds to the MLAs collected for vaccination,” said Gehlot. The move came a day after deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Singh Rathore shot a letter to Gehlot seeking the return of allocated money under the MLA Lad fund. Hinting those rural areas which will perform better in vaccination would be rewarded, Gehlot said they are working to announce the reward programmes like the additional grant of Rs 50 lakh to motivate people for vaccination. “Nobody has any right to put the lives of anybody in danger by not vaccinating. If people have any hesitancy, all stakeholders have to work together to dispel myths around vaccinations,” said Gehlot Stressing on the need of having better coordination between the state and the Centre, Gehlot said highlighting the problems and issues with the Centre is part of the democracy. “Constructive criticism is always welcome, but it should be based on facts and evidence,” said Gehlot, referring to the wastage of vaccines issue raised by BJP. Rathore had expressed his concern over the slow pace of vaccination in the state and expressed his disappointment on health minister Raghu Sharma for not sharing the vaccine strategy in the light of the free vaccines for all schemes from Monday. “I expected the health minister to have shared a detailed road map on vaccination drive but you have gone into telling vaccination saga. Our rank in vaccinating per lakh population is among the bottom states,” said Rathore. Among the religious leaders, Mahant Kailesh Sharma of Moti Doongri Temple had assured full support to the state in encouraging devotees to go for vaccination. He said, “If the religious places would be allowed to open, it will easier for the religious leaders to communicate with the devotees on the subject.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mla-lad-funds-to-be-used-on-health-sector-this-year-says-gehlot/articleshow/83699559.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mansukh Hiran murder: DNA samples of Pradeep Sharma & 4 others taken||MUMBAI: A forensic team on Sunday collected the DNA samples of arrested former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma and four others in custody for planting explosives in a vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s bungalow, and the subsequent murder of vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran. The forensic team will match it with the DNA found in the Tavera in which Hiran is believed to have been smothered to death allegedly by the accused. Sources said the Central Forensic Science Laboratory team collected the DNA samples of Sharma, Satish Tirupati Mothkuri alias Tanni alias Vicky Baba (40), Manish Vasant Soni, Santosh Shellar and Anand Jadhav. The NIA has already found traces of Mansukh’s DNA from the Tavera car they seized last month. NIA is also sending Sharma’s two mobile phones to retrieve the mirror images of its contents which may help nail him. The NIA is trying to figure out whether Sharma or another senior police officer is the brain behind the plot. Two senior police officers are also likely to be summoned by the NIA this week. Besides, the NIA is calling two doctors of the Thane civil hospital who conducted postmortem on Mansukh’s body. The diatom report had suggested that Hiran was alive when he fell in water, but the four accused told NIA that they had smothered him to death before dumping him in a creek in Mumbra. The NIA is now awaiting the final diatom report from Madhubhan lab in Haryana. Last Thursday, while seeking Sharma’s custody, public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves had told the court that Sharma had misled the investigator. He was earlier questioned by the NIA on two occasions but was finally arrested after police caught his two confidantes — Santosh Shellar and Anand Jadhav. Sharma is accused of attending two conspiracy meetings with Waze — one held at police commissioner’s office two days before Mansukh’s murder and another at his JB Nagar office in Andheri. Investigations carried out so far have suggested that Mansukh was killed in the Tavera car belonging to Anand Jadhav. The NIA has now recovered March 4 CCTV footage outside Hotel Hill view at Ghodbunder road in Thane where API Sachin Waze and Sunil Mane were seen handing over Mansukh to the four accused waiting in the Tavera car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hiran-murder-dna-samples-of-sharma-4-others-taken-in-mumbai/articleshow/83701620.cms||Ahmed Ali

He said Vijayan had never reacted so extensively to any political issues. Even when it was alleged that the chief minister’s office was involved in the gold smuggling case, his reaction was muted and all he said was he did not know about it. “If he has reacted so emotionally to a decade-old incident that happened during college days, one cannot help but wonder why he did so,” Sudhakaran said. It has to be believed that he is not ready to recollect the events that led to the incident that has sparked a row now, said the KPCC president. “No PR agency can save him. The real picture will come out. There are many things to be revealed,” said Sudhakaran. When justice K Sukumaran had alleged that he has mafia links, Vijayan first sent a legal notice to him, but the judge made it clear that he will still stick to his allegations and that he can prove it. Vijayan was put on the backfoot and had to withdraw the notice, said Sudhakaran. There are several people who have fallen victims to the atrocities perpetrated by Vijayan. Even those in the Marxist party, including V S Achuthanandan, M A Baby and K K Shailaja have been on the receiving end, he said, adding, “there was only one leader who had shown the courage to openly criticize Vijayan and that was T P Chandrashekaran.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/will-continue-to-personally-target-pinarayi-sudhakaran/articleshow/83697787.cms||---

The accused, 24-year-old Sekhar and his brother, 20-year old Sarvesh, are electricians from Azad Chandrasekhar Nagar in Tukaramgate. On June 16, one of their relatives got married. “In the wedding card, names of family elders were printed but Sekhar’s parents names were missing. An argument broke out between the siblings and their relative, Yadgiri, when the former blamed Yadgiri’s wife to be responsible for omitting the names of their parents,” Tukaramgate inspector R Yellappa said. As Sekhar and Sarvesh used abusive language while referring to his wife, Yadgiri, along with his family members, Praveen, Parashuram and Pratap came to the sibling’s house in Azad Chandrasekhar Nagar at 7 am on Sunday to sort out their differences. “An argument broke out between the two groups and Sekhar attacked the other group with a knife while Sarvesh assisted him.

To be built at an estimated cost of Rs 15-16 crore, the facility will provide simulator training in actual fire scenarios like apartment, oil refinery blaze, basement and highrise blazes. Fire officials said that personnel will receive training on how to douse a blaze amid thick smoke and heat in personal protective equipment suits. The Mumbai Fire Brigade receives more than 5,000 fire calls a year. Officials said currently firefighters, on completion of their theoretical studies, learn about tackling a blaze onsite itself. “Therefore, we have proposed setting up a training facility wherein different blaze scenarios will be recreated for the personnel,” said a senior fire officer. “We plan to make use of propane gas, which is considered much cleaner, to reduce the environmental damage caused by burning scenarios. At present, there are over 45 blaze scenarios, including those in an apartment, a car, building basement, highrise and commercial establishment.” The facility is expected to be ready within two years considering that works on setting up the fire station at Kandivli, which will house a fire station, an administrative building and an officers quarters, began two months ago. “There is a 30-month time period for the works, however we have been assured that the facility should be ready within 24 months,” said another fire officer. At present, firefighters train at the breathing apparatus gallery at the regional command centre in Wadala wherein a virtual atmosphere of smoke, flames, spark and heat has been created. The training includes how to use the breathing apparatus set in adverse situations like intense heat, smoke for rescue and search operations. There are also simulators and ladders for climbing practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/simulated-firefighting-training-centre-to-come-up-in-kandivli-in-mumbai/articleshow/83701721.cms||Richa Pinto

Ramagundam police seized Rs 13.7 lakh worth property from their possession. Acting on specific information, police along with agriculture department officials conducted searches at Rangapur village outskirts in Peddapalli district and arrested three persons in possession of spurious chilli seeds.

---||Nagpur||No Covid death in Nagpur district after 348 days, experts hint at herd immunity||NAGPUR: With number of Covid-19 positive cases declining to a great extent, the district recorded zero deaths after 348 days, on Sunday. Experts said cases plummeted probably due to herd immunity, and current climate not being suitable for viral infections. There were no deaths in the city for the third consecutive day, and in rural for eighth consecutive day. The district had recorded one death each on last two days and the deceased were residents of other districts, who tested positive and succumbed to the disease while undergoing treatment in hospitals in the district. On Sunday, there were no deaths in the district of patients from other districts or states too. The last time this happened was on July 6, 2020, which was before the peak of first wave. The district had faced peak of first wave in August and September last year. This means zero deaths in the district were reported for the first time after peak of first wave. At that time, total cases were 1,794 and active cases were 369. On Sunday, cumulative cases stood at 4,76,761 and active cases were 907. Active cases dropped below 1,000 in the district after a long span. The district witnessed second wave from third week of February. The district went on to record highest fatalities of 113 on April 19. The cases started to decline from beginning of May. On Sunday, 39 persons tested positive from 8,857 tests while 134 patients recovered. Recoveries have been more than new cases for the last 52 consecutive days. The city and rural witnessed cases in single digit (8 and 7, respectively) a day ago. There were 16 cases in the district on Sunday, which was lowest in a day after 361 days. The cases have fallen fast after peak of second wave compared to first wave. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI, “People in large numbers were infected in second wave. Also, over 10 lakh people from the district got vaccinated in the last couple of months. Therefore, there is possibility of some herd immunity in many localities. Immune people prevent formation of chain or cluster of cases. Though commercial activities opened in phased manner from June 1, movement and mixing of people is not high till now along with migration. Virus will become strong in case of mutation or formation of chains or clusters of cases among susceptible persons. Also, current climate is not suitable for viral infections.” Dr Shinde added, “Also, next wave takes almost 4-5 months. It is likely when immunity of close contacts wears off and in case of emergence of another variant with immune escape. Climatic conditions also play a role in waves,” he said. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said cases have dropped to a great extent in other parts of the state and country too. “Therefore, scenario in the city is not so different compared to others.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-covid-death-in-district-after-348-days-experts-hint-at-herd-immunity/articleshow/83699809.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: ‘Single-screen theatres will need at least five years to achieve financial stability’||NAGPUR: The financial downside of Covid-19 has dealt a brutal blow to single-screen movie theatres across the country, but in Maharashtra, they face some unique problems. Right from the way property tax is calculated for their business to red tapism over conversion of land use, theatre owners say the existing rules in the state are making their business unviable. In an interview to TOI, Sanjay Surana, whose family owns six movie theatres and who exhibits films in 25 other cinema halls across Maharashtra, says the lockdown may have been the proverbial last nail in the coffin. Excerpts: Q. The process of unlocking has already started across Maharashtra and theatres are being allowed to open. So, won’t the financial threat be over soon? A. Not at all, because there are two aspects to the financial problems which single-screen theatres are facing. First is that for the last five years at least the audience numbers have been steadily going down. The days of 500 to 700 people coming to watch a movie are gone, now single-screen theatres hardly get 250 to 300 people. The Covid-induced lockdown has led to zero income but the expenses are still continuing in the form of rent, taxes etc. The second issue is that there are no new releases to exhibit. So even if I open my ‘shop’, there are no products to sell. Q. This problem must be prevailing pan-India. How bad is the situation in Maharashtra? A. We have about 400 single-screen theatres in the state of which 20% have collapsed financially. They won’t be reopening their doors again. The rest of us have in the meanwhile piled up huge debts for which repayment has stopped due to zero income. Till date, the state government has not given us any concession on fixed electricty charges, property taxes or waivers of loan EMIs. Had it been any other state, the issue would have been resolved quickly. Q. In Maharashtra, are there bureaucratic hurdles which prevent resolution of theatre owners’ problems? A. We are the only state in India where some very peculiar problems specific to movie theatres exist. First is the calculation of property tax, which is usually done on the basis of the plot/construction area. But in Maharashtra, it’s calculated on a theatre’s seating capacity. An application to reduce the capacity gets stuck for years in bureaucratic maze because all decisions are taken at Mumbai. I have one movie theatre where tax is still being paid for 800 seats but in reality the capacity has already been reduced to around 500. Many theatres have reduced capacity by default because the physical size of chairs has also increased. This in turn has reduced the overall seating capacity by 30%. There’s a small theatre in Jalgaon district that got a tax demand of around Rs 1.2 lakh whereas his income during the Covid-19 era (whenever it was allowed to open) was hardly Rs 15,000 per month. The food cart owners outside his theatre were doing better business. Q. If business is so unviable financially, then why not start something new on the property because movie theatres are basically prime commercial estates? A. This is again a very unique problem for our state. Permission to change land use needs to be taken from Mumbai and I’m aware of applications that have been pending for years. In states like Chhattisgarh, such decisions are taken at the district level and are disposed off within a few months. Back home, even to get the property owner’s name changed is complicated. Since most of these properties are on long term leases, there are multiple generations and dozens of owners on record which further complicates the matter. There’s one theatre in Maharashtra whose land ownership now lies with 130 people spanning three generations. So even if one person objects, the already complicated land transfer issue, further hits a road block. Q. But there must be some association through which you are trying to resolve these issues with the government. A. There are three active associations in Maharashtra because the territorial jurisdiction of movie distribution and broadcast rights is different. So Vidarbha and Khandesh are covered by an association which also takes care of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, while Marathwade is covered by a Hyderabad-based association whereas Mumbai and western Maharashtra is covered by a third entity. Regardless, all three associations have worked together and during the Devendra Fadnavis-led government, we had almost agreed on a final solution to resolve this issue. But then in 2019, the government changed and now, the entire issue is back in the cold storage. Q. What kind of a future do you foresee for single screen theatres? A. It’s going to be very tough because of our pending financial problems and perception about Covid-19. I don’t know why people believe that theatres spread the virus because we were closed during these last few months, and yet the second wave came. So for things to pick up, we need really good content to put on the screen plus the confidence of the audience to flock back to theatres. And if everything goes right from now on, it will take at least five years for single-screen theatres to achieve some level of financial stability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/single-screen-theatres-will-need-at-least-five-years-to-achieve-financial-stability/articleshow/83699685.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||India||Finances overstretched, can’t pay Rs 4 lakh ex gratia for Covid deaths: Govt||NEW DELHI: With India recording over 3.86 lakh Covid deaths, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Sunday that the central government and states, whose finances are over-stretched in fighting the pandemic on health, economic and social welfare fronts, could not afford to pay Rs 4 lakh compensation to the families of each Covid-19 victim as per the Disaster Management Act. The Centre's affidavit was filed in the SC in response to its May 24 order directing additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati to submit a response to writ petitions filed by advocates Gaurav Bansal and Reepak Kansal seeking Rs 4 lakh compensation to the families of each Covid-19 victim as per Section 12 of the DM Act and as per the April 8, 2015, letter of the home ministry fixing the amount of compensation for those succumbing to events classified as disaster under the law. The Centre said ex-gratia amounts are to be provided from State Disaster Relief Funds (SDRF), which were cumulatively allocated Rs 22,184 crore for 2021-22. "If an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh is given for every person who loses life due to Covid-19, the entire amount of SDRF may possibly be spent on this item alone, and indeed the total expenditure may go up further," it said in its 51-page affidavit accompanied by another 130 pages covering many welfare schemes and financial packages announced to provide succour to people and the stressed economic sector. As things stand, with India recording 3,86,713 deaths due to Covid-19 as on Sunday evening, the compensation bill will add up to a little under Rs 16,000 crore. Officials said typically the payments under the DM Act were one-time compensations and not continuous payments. They also pointed to complications in cataloguing deaths post-recovery where the cause may or may not be related to the disease. In its affidavit, the Centre said, "If the entire SDRF funds get consumed on ex-gratia for Covid-19 victims, states may not have sufficient funds for organising Covid-19 response, for provision of various essential medical and other supplies, or to take care of other disasters like cyclones, floods etc. Hence, the petitioners' prayer for payment of ex-gratia to all deceased persons due to Covid-19 is beyond the fiscal affordability of the state governments." “Already, finances of states and the Centre are under severe strain due to the reduction in tax revenues and increase in health expenses on account of the pandemic,” it said. “It is an unfortunate, but important fact that the resources of the governments have limits and any additional burden through ex gratia will reduce the funds available for other health and welfare schemes,” it said and requested the SC to leave it to the discretion of the Centre to determine, if at all, what should be the ex gratia amount to be paid. The Centre said the DM Act also needed to be interpreted based upon the peculiar and unprecedented situation that the nation was faced with.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/finances-overstretched-cant-pay-rs-4-lakh-ex-gratia-for-covid-deaths-govt/articleshow/83703703.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The chief minister was speaking after inaugurating Centre for Meditation and Yoga Sciences near Mehrauli-Badarpur Road in south Delhi along with deputy CM Manish Sisodia on the eve of International Day of Yoga. The centre, which has been set up by Delhi government in collaboration with Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University, will offer a one-year diploma course for yoga instructors. “Yoga helps in cultivating high immunity and keeping people mentally and physically healthy. Not only to prevent oneself from Covid-19, yoga also plays an important role in dealing with post-Covid complications for those who face an adverse infection,” Kejriwal said. “The psychological and emotional needs aggravate quite a lot post-Covid. Hence, exercise and meditation are key to fighting Covid infection. Covid affects our lungs the most, and in post-Covid, if we teach pranayama to people, they will benefit,” he added. On October 2, Delhiites will be able to approach the centre if they wish to hold yoga sessions in their surroundings/societies, the chief minister said. “Delhi government will provide them the instructors for free,” he announced, adding that with this centre, yoga would reach every house of Delhi and prove that it could indeed be a “jan andolan”. “Tomorrow is International Day of Yoga, and I believe that there could not have been a better way to celebrate this prestigious day,” Kejriwal said, adding that it had been a dream for both him and the deputy chief minister to make yoga reach every house of Delhi. This dream, he said, had led the government to allot a specific budget for the initiative under which if a group of more than 20 people wish to learn yoga, the government will provide them an instructor for free. Sisodia congratulated the team at the centre for designing and planning the initiative within a span of two months, despite the second wave of the Covid-19 infection. He said the centre was announced in this year’s budget and its vision was laid down by the chief minister. “Now we have started with the training of around 450 yoga and meditation instructors. We will have aggressive training for three months in the first phase. It is a unique course of one year where yoga and meditation, the two schools, have been included,” Sisodia said. These instructors will be able to go to different regions and teach people yoga and meditation and continue this one-year diploma as well, the deputy chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tips-on-staying-healthy-as-cm-opens-yoga-centre/articleshow/83699722.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The epicentre of the earthquake was found to be Punjabi Bagh, with the earthquake occurring at a depth of 7 kilometres below the earth’s surface, officials said. No damage to any property or loss of life was reported. J L Gautam from the National Centre for Seismology (NCS) said the earthquake struck Delhi at 12:02 pm, at a latitude of 28.67 N and longitude of 77.14 E. “It measured 2.1 on the Richter scale and the epicentre was found to be Punjabi Bagh in West Delhi. The earthquake was mild,” said Gautam. While it is not common to see earthquakes across the capital, the frequency of these mild earthquakes has increased in the region since last year. From April 12, 2020, a number of mild earthquakes were recorded last year, with their epicentre in Delhi or parts of the NCR. Since the start of the year, a total of nine earthquakes have been recorded in the Delhi region, with their magnitude ranging between 1.8 and 2.9 and were mostly located in west Delhi, south-west Delhi, Rohtak, Sonipat, Baghpat, Bahadurgarh and Ghaziabad. Earlier this year, NCS also announced that it had deployed additional earthquake recording instruments in the region in order to closely monitor seismic activity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mild-tremors-in-city-epicentre-in-punjabi-bagh-no-damage-reported/articleshow/83699760.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Even if I am unable to pay it back on time, I would always pay back whenever I can. I paid back the money that I borrowed from (ex) MLA Sasiettan. I may borrow it again from him or someone else. He had arranged the money through a bank loan as he did not have the money. I paid it back also through the bank. What world is this, can’t I borrow some money from someone?” Janu said. She said she borrowed Rs 3 lakh and had paid back Rs 1.5 lakh when she sold her car. “I couldn’t pay back the rest and recently, I paid him back the remaining amount. It is not bribe money as alleged, but money I made through hard work,” said Janu. MSF state president P K Navas had earlier told police that Janu handed over the bribe money she received from BJP state president K Surendran to Saseendran’s wife. Soon after this, Saseendran clarified it was borrowed money that Janu returned to him. He had said that Janu had sought Rs Rs 3 lakh from him in October 2019 and it was given through a bank account. In 2020, she returned Rs 1.5 lakh through the bank itself. He had said that the remaining Rs 1.5 lakh was given in March 2021 and that all transactions were through the bank. He had said that the amount was given as a personal financial help and the money given through the bank was returned through the bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/only-repaid-borrowed-money-says-ck-janu/articleshow/83697924.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: CPM panel gave clean chit to P Jayarajan, say sources||KOZHIKODE: CPM seems to have given a clean chit to P Jayarajan in the row over promoting a personality cult as an enquiry commission reportedly found that he had no role in the attempts to promote himself over the party. The report, sources said, was discussed in detail by Kannur district committee of the party. The party had formed a three-member committee with AN Shamseer, N Chandran and TA Madhusoodanan to probe the matter. A Facebook group glorifying Jayarajan, named PJ Army, and flex boards at various locations in Kannur in support of the leader had resulted in the allegation that there was an attempt to glorify him above the party. Jayarajan had recently issued a public statement on Facebook dissociating himself from the social media campaigns carried out mostly on the FB page ‘PJ Army’ saying that he has no connection with it. Following news reports of seat denial to Jayarajan in assembly elections, CPM supporters had protested on ‘PJ Army’ Facebook page and party WhatsApp groups. Several supporters had vented their protests on social media in the form of comments under the newly-uploaded images of Jayarajan saying that the party will have to pay a heavy price for denying him a seat. Jayarajan, in his Facebook post, had warned of legal action against those who used his photo to organize campaigns against the interests of CPM. Earlier, Jayarajan was in the dock after his fan base glorified him through a musical album that gave rise to criticism at the state committee meeting in November 2017. It was said that the album went against the party’s principles of not promoting a ‘personality cult’. Apart from the six-minute music album extolling Jayarajan, a video documentary about his life also added fuel to the personality cult row. The album brought out by Purachery Grameena Kala Samiti had praised Jayarajan as the ‘star of Kannur’ and extolled him as the ‘protector of red bastion’s honour and upholder of the truth of the red flag’. There were allegations that these were attempts by Jayarajan to ‘grow above the party’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cpm-panel-gave-clean-chit-to-p-jayarajan-say-sources/articleshow/83697995.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Jumbo kills Jamtara couple, angry locals hold forest officer ‘hostage’||DUMKA: A middle-aged couple was trampled to death by an elephant in Maldiha village in Jamtara district on Sunday when they were out to attend nature’s call. The incident occurred under Fatehpur police station. The deceased were identified as Jiyalal Pawariya (52) and his wife Sonamani Tudu. The incident sparked protests by local villagers who gheraoed lady range officer Pratima Kumari for several hours in the morning. Later, district authorities pacified the mob with an assurance to drive away the elephant to a safer place. Sources said that it was the same elephant which got separated from its herd few months ago and is roaming across different districts of Santhal Pargana, killing at least 11 persons in the recent times. A month ago, the same elephant had wreaked havoc in adjoining Dumka town. Ironically, forest officials continue to blame human misadventures, including pelting stones and taking selfies, to be the reasons for casualties without taking concrete measures to keep jumbos away from human population. “The dependants of the deceased couple were given an interim relief of Rs 10,000 and will be duly compensated by the forest department after completion of the due formalities,” block development officer of Fatehpur Mukesh Kumar Bouri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jumbo-kills-jamtara-couple-angry-locals-hold-forest-officer-hostage/articleshow/83699470.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Now, Rapid Antigen test mandatory at airport, rail stations in Jharkhand||RANCHI: In a move to prevent a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Jharkhand government has made it compulsory for all people coming from other states to undergo mandatory Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) at all train stations across the state and the airport here. In an order on June 11, state health secretary Arun Kumar Singh said RAT will be compulsory for all incoming passengers from Sunday. Currently, inter and intra-state bus movement is not allowed. On Sunday, all passengers arriving at the Birsa Munda International Airport here were tested by a team of health workers. Around 22 flights are operating from Ranchi airport at present. Other health teams were also posted at Ranchi and Hatia railway stations round-the-clock in eigh-hour shifts to test all passengers. “Till 6 pm on Sunday, we have conducted antigen tests on approximately 400 passengers and collected swabs for RT-PCR tests of seven passengers. The address and phone numbers of all passengers have been documented and they have been directed to remain in home quarantine,” an on-duty magistrate level official at the airport said. “On Sunday, three teams of health workers were deputed at the airport. Since there is a rush of passengers, two more health teams will be deputed from tomorrow onwards,” the official said. Although mandatory Covid testing for all incoming passengers at the Ranchi airport has been in place since April this year, passengers were free to skip it if they produced a negative RT-PCR report upon arrival. Pradeep Kumar, a serving defence official who arrived from Delhi on Sunday, said, “I am already carrying a negative RT-PCR report and the test was conducted 72 hours before I boarded the flight and it cost me Rs 1,200. If I was to be tested upon arrival, what was the need for taking the test before flying?” Meanwhile, Ranchi DC Chhavi Ranjan directed the district health officials to ramp up testing at the Ranchi and Hatia railway stations. Speaking on the issue, Ranchi civil surgeon Dr Vinod Kumar said, “Four teams of health workers will be deputed at both the stations from Monday onwards and all passengers arriving at these stations will be tested using RAT kits. Those found positive will be taken to isolation centres.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/now-rat-mandatory-at-airport-rail-stns-in-jharkhand/articleshow/83699511.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Latehar villager killed in cold blood: BJP||Ranchi: A BJP probe panel constituted by the party’s Scheduled Tribe wing on Sunday said a villager was killed in cold blood during the “encounter” with Naxalites, as claimed by the security forces in Latehar, and demanded Rs 20 lakh compensation, a government job for the kin of the deceased and bringing those responsible to book. The 10-member BJP team comprised the national president of the party’s ST wing, Sameer Oraon and state president of the wing, Shiv Shankar Oraon, among others. They met family members of slain Brahmadev Singh Khairwar, who was killed reportedly in the encounter on June 12, at their home in Piri village under Garu block. The party has also decided to write to the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes and the National Human Rights Commission for an impartial probe into the incident and action against the erring security personnel. Shiv Shankar Oraon said Brahmadev Singh and five other villagers were attacked by the security forces when they were leaving for the forest for the ceremonial hunting on the occasion of Sarhul. “We spoke to Ginenath Singh Khairwar, who received a bullet wound on his hand but was saved somehow and also to Basanti Devi, sister of the slain villager, who was an eyewitness to most of the events of that incident,” he said. Demanding a compensation of Rs 20 lakh for the family members and a government’s job to the victim’s widow identified as Jeeramani Devi, Oraon said the entire family has been affected by Brahmadev’s death. “He is survived by a one-year-old child and his wife who is an intermediate pass. So she should be given a job,” Oraon said. Elaborating on the findings of the team, Oraon said six villagers — Brahmadev, Ginenath, Rajeshwar, Raghunath, Sukuldev and Govindar (all from the Khairwar tribal community) had set out for the forest on June 12 morning when they came under fire from a distance. “They were going for hunting and once they heard the gunshots, they raised their arms in surrender besides shouting that they were just villagers,” Oraon said, quoting Basanti Devi. He further said despite their surrender call, the security forces continued to fire and Ginenath was shot in the hand while Brahmadev was hit by the bullet in his leg. “Ginenath ran away along with the other four but Brahmadev was stuck there and he was shot again when he tried to get up,” Oraon said. Quoting the wife and the mother of the victim, Oraon said the security personnel came to their house to collect the Aadhaar card and dragged a severely injured Brahmadev to the forest again. “Basanti said they could hear three gunshots from the forest later and when they saw the body, all bullets hit his forehead,” Oraon said. The probe team also noticed that the clothes Brahmadev was wearing while setting out for the forest were changed by the security men. Oraon also said, “We were told by the villagers that the security men were from the state police and the Jharkhand Jaguar (JJ).” Asked if there were security men from the central forces as well, he added, “Going by the villagers’ version, they were state police and JJ personnel and may not be able to distinguish between central and state forces.” It may be noted that the CRPF had sent out a press release on June 12 saying a joint operation comprising two troops of 203 CoBRA Battalion, two assault groups of Jharkhand Jaguar and one company of 214 Battalion of the CRPF was going on in the forests of Latehar where the encounter took place around 8.30 am. DIG (Palamu range) R K Lakra had also said they were looking into the incident to identify the claims of the villagers and the security forcers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/latehar-villager-killed-in-cold-blood-bjp/articleshow/83699553.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||In a first, Jharkhand BJP leaders booked under Epidemic Act||RANCHI: Jharkhand Police on Sunday said it has slapped an FIR against state BJP president and Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash, Kanke MLA Samri Lal and over 70 unnamed others under the Epidemic Act for staging a protest in violation of the lockdown rules on Friday. This is perhaps the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year when members of political parties were booked under the Epidemic Act. The saffron party termed the move as political vendetta by the Hemant Soren government and said going by the same yardstick, Congress leaders should also be charged under the same provisions for violating the lockdown rules. Police sources said separate FIRs were also filed at the Kotwali police station against members of the Left parties for lockdown violation when they were protesting against the fuel price hike on the same day. Criticizing the government’s move, BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said the JMM-Congress-RJD government is rattled by BJP’s successive expose of “wrongdoings” by the ruling parties. Shahdeo also questioned why a similar yardstick is not followed by police (government) and slap cases against Congress, which is part of the ruling alliance in the state, as it had carried out protests in the past. Talking to reporters, Shahdeo said, “The Hemant Soren government fears our state president because he has been constantly speaking against the wrong policies of the ruling regime. Last year, the government slapped a sedition case against Prakash but was later quashed by the court. Again, he is booked in a false case to intimidate him and our party workers for speaking in favour of the farmers. BJP will not get bogged down by such vendetta politics.” Notably, Prakash along with BJP’s Kanke MLA Samri Lal and others staged a three-hour protest at Sukurhuttu on Ranchi outskirts against the alleged non-payment of money to scores of farmers for paddy procurement by government and farm loan waivers among other agriculture-related issues. Similar protests were staged across the state. Kanke police, however, filed a named FIR against Prakash, Lal and others on Saturday for lockdown violation. Partial lockdown is currently in force in Jharkhand in the wake of Covid-19 as part of which any kind of religious and political gathering is banned. Talking to TOI, Rishi Sinha, the sub-inspector at Kanke police station, said the FIR was filed for violation of Covid appropriate norms. “Two BJP leaders (Deepak and Samri) are named and over 70 are unnamed for staging the protest, not maintaining social distancing and other safety norms,” he said. Accusing the government of misusing police, Shahdeo said, “Why was no action taken when Congress staged protests against fuel price hikes last week? A Congress delegation even staged a protest outside the Raj Bhavan, where Section 144 of the CrPC is enforced round the year. Why did the police remain a mute spectator? It exposes their double standards.” Meanwhile, Congress hit back at BJP for misrepresenting facts saying, under the current regime, police are always free to act as per the rule of law unlike during their stint between 2014 and 2019. The party’s co-working president, Rajesh Thakur, said, “Why is BJP nervous about the FIR? Police have the mandate to act whenever rules are broken. BJP workers aren’t above the law. Even, members of the Ranchi Mahanagar Congress unit, too, faced FIRs recently on charges of violation of lockdown during fuel hike protest on the Main Road. We didn’t make any hue and cry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/in-a-first-state-bjp-leaders-booked-under-epidemic-act/articleshow/83699404.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Even as the 69th annual convocation ceremony was organized on April 17, the university has not been able to distribute hard copies of degree certificates to the graduating students all this months. Usually, students who seek degree certificates in presentia receive the degree certificates within couple of days after the convocation ceremony gets over.  The convocation had got delayed for months as the administration first remained indecisive regarding the chief guest for the ceremony and later because of second wave of Covid-19.  The university has emailed soft copies of the degree certificates to all the students who had applied for certificates in presentia. Darshan Maru, deputy registrar (examination) at MSU said it cannot organize any system through which the degree certificates are distributed to thousands of students en masse like in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/no-distribution-of-degree-certificates-at-msu-this-year/articleshow/83696320.cms||---
---||Surat||Vapi man arrested for forcing woman to convert||SURAT: State’s second offence under the amended Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act, which deals with forcible or fraudulent religious conversion by marriage, was registered in Valsad district on Saturday. A 23-year-old married man named Imran Ansari, who lives in Vapi town, was nabbed from Indore and the 19-year-old girl whom he had allegedly forced to marry was also rescued. Ansari, who owns a mobile phone shop in Daman, and the woman knew each other since childhood as they were brought up in the same locality. Police said that initially on June 10, the girl’s mother had lodged a missing person complaint. But when police checked the CCTV footages, it was found that Ansari had abducted and compelled her to marry him. Later, using technical sources like Ansari’s mobile phone’s location, cops traced his location to Indore. Ansari and the woman were brought back to Vapi. On returning to Vapi, the girl told police that Ansari, despite being married, lured her into a relationship and was pressurizing her for marriage. She also said that he used to threaten to kill her brother if she did not agree to the wedding. “Answari took the girl to Ajmer where he tried to forcefully get married, but since the dargah there was closed due to lockdown, his plan failed. He then took her to Indore where he was able to find a house in a chawl with the help of an auto-rickshaw driver,” said inspector B J Sarvaiya of Vapi Town police station. In Indore too, he could not succeed in converting the girl’s religion and marry her, but she has alleged that he raped her. Alon with the sections of amended anti-conversion law, Ansari has also been booked for rape, abduction and criminal intimidation. Police officials said that they have been probing based on Ansari’s statement, but they expect more details to unearth during his remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vapi-man-arrested-for-forcing-woman-to-convert/articleshow/83696553.cms||---

The AP State Energy Conservation Mission, the state designated agency of BEE, has come forward to support the efforts of BEE in its endeavour to have clean economic development by reducing emissions as per the international conventions like Paris Agreement. The BEE has urged state governments to aggressively promote energy efficiency and conservation to achieve comprehensive development. As part of this, the BEE held a stakeholders’ consultation meeting through a webinar to discuss on enhancing energy efficiency in key sectors, including industry, MSMEs, buildings, electric appliances, transport, etc. BEE Director General, Abhay Bakre, said that high economic growth would be possible only with low per capita emissions for which the Union ministry of power wants to enhance energy efficiency and promote clean energy. “The Union government will lay a balanced emphasis on economic development and the environment. It is adopting a climate-friendly, cleaner path to achieve cleaner economic development,” said Bakre. The BEE estimated that its activities related to energy efficiency and conservation would result in a reduction of 557 million tonnes of Co2 per annum by 2030. It also estimated that the energy-saving investment potential of the country would be around Rs 10.02 lakh crore by 2031 under the moderate scenario, and Rs 13.20 lakh crore under the ambitious scenario. Andhra Pradesh is the only state in the country to issue an order, giving directions to all government departments to set up energy conservation cells in all government offices within a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/bee-to-prepare-action-plan-to-meet-commitments-in-paris-agreement/articleshow/83695994.cms||---
---||Goa||With 6 months to go, poll action heats up in Sanguem||Margao: Politics in Sanguem constituency is on the cusp of a major change, contours of which are yet to become clear. Nearly six months ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, independent MLA Prasad Gaonkar is now cosying up to the Congress party, while former BJP MLA Subhash Phal Dessai is working overtime to touch base with his voters in remote rural areas of the constituency, even as Savitri, spouse of deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar, is eyeing the BJP ticket from this constituency. AICC general secretary in-charge of Goa desk Dinesh Gundu Rao held meetings with Gaonkar late last week and is learnt to have held aloft an olive branch to him. Gaonkar, however, said, he is yet to make up his mind and that the “final decision” would rest on his supporters. “I have a vision for the development of Sanguem, and five years is too short a time to achieve this. I am confident of winning the 2022 elections, irrespective of whether I contest as an independent or on a party ticket,” Gaonkar said. Gaonkar had defeated both Phaldesai (BJP) and Savtri Kavlekar (Congress) in the 2017 assembly polls. Post-elections, Gaonkar had extended support to the BJP-led government but withdrew it mid-way following differences with chief minister Pramod Sawant over the issue of revival of the Sanjivani co-operative sugar factory. Phal Dessai has used the current pandemic situation to reach out to voters – organising Covid vaccination camps, arranging for transport to ferry them across to vaccination centers, and helping patients in need of testing and hospitalisation. “This is the right time we should be of help to these people,” Phal Dessai told TOI. Phal Dessai said that he took the initiative of organising vaccination camps in Cavrem, Maina, Pirla, Kajur and Mangal areas of Cavrem Pirla panchayat to ensure that no villager had to travel more than 3km to reach the vaccination centre. He also helped organize camps along the Netravali to Verlem belt and personally monitored the response. Significantly, Savitri has also concentrated on the remote areas, distributing essential commodities to Covid-affected people, particularly to those in home isolation in Netravali, Vadem-Curdi and Rivona panchayat areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-6-months-to-go-poll-action-heats-up-in-sanguem/articleshow/83699904.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Have provisional certificates despite 2 doses? Merge them on Co-Win to get final one||NAGPUR: It’s a genuine concern for many people who have registered with two different IDs/unlinked Aadhaar number and PAN or two different mobile numbers for Covid-19 vaccination. Even if such citizens have received both the doses, they are getting two different provisional certificates for the first dose only. Due to this, they are not eligible to get the final certificate for being fully vaccinated. Now, the government has introduced Merge Multiple Dose #1 Provisional Certificate feature on the Co-Win portal to clear this issue. RS Sharma, chairman of the Empowered Group on Covid Vaccine Administration, told TOI that the two certificates for the first dose can be merged based on the ID credentials of those who have registered for vaccination using different phone numbers. “In case you have multiple provisional certificates for dose 1 generated through different accounts, you can merge them here to generate your final vaccination certificate. Certificates are merged by matching beneficiary name, age and gender,” said Sharma. Interestingly, preliminary assessment by Maharashtra public health department has revealed that over one lakh records in the state on Co-WiN portal are duplicate entries of those who are fully vaccinated but still appear to be due for the second shot. This means the duplicate records are of beneficiaries who registered twice on Co-Win with different phone numbers and got their second shot. Such beneficiaries are also unable to get their final vaccination certificate as both their accounts reflect inoculation with dose 1. The rectification process on Co-Win platform is simple but the user must carry both the certificates of first dose. The beneficiary reference ID which is mentioned on the certificate must be entered. This will help many people to get final vaccination certificate which will be a very useful document in future.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur police not to involve in recovery of dues or vacating premises: CP||Nagpur: City police chief Amitesh Kumar has made it clear to the police station in-charges and other supervisory level officers that cops will not henceforth involve in recovery of dues or vacating premises to resolve disputes. The statement was made at an open complaint redressal camp last week. It is likely the first time any CP has publicly made such an announcement. While dealing with similar cases raised by citizens at the camp, the top cop issued instructions to cops to steer clear of civil disputes of controversial nature. He asked police stations in-charges to register FIR only if there is a crime component in disputes and leave the rest to be referred to the civil court. In the backdrop of allegations of corruption and misuse of law, Kumar said stern action will be initiated against any personnel found violating the order. The CP said in a dispute between the landlord and tenant police have no role to play but the grievance have to be resolved through civil court or rent tribunal. “If there is a forceful eviction or muscle power used for that purpose presuming it would be an easy way out, then such a mischief would be dealt with an iron hand,” said Kumar. He also said police are no recovering agent or an institution for arbitration. “Unless there is a criminal angle to it, police will not intervene in such situations. At times, there is a thin line between criminality and civil dispute but it has to be dealt in a transparent and legal manner,” said the top cop. “Police would be provided for assistance in civil matters only when there is a court order or a bailiff appointed and in similar situations,” said Kumar. Kumar also said that the framework within which a cop is expected to work has been laid down and explained. “Any action has to be transparent. Even if an intervention has to be made due to some emergency issue, then the parties should be summoned and the grievances must be dealt in each other’s presence after referring to their documents and other testimonials,” said Kumar. Police station officers were asked to ensure cases are disposed of within 90-day framework and pendency of complaints should be cleared. Around 3,000 complaints have been disposed of by police in around one-and-half months’ time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-police-not-to-involve-in-recovery-of-dues-or-vacating-premises-cp/articleshow/83717758.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||Goa: NSA imposed to restrict crowds at CZMP hearings, says Dinesh Gundu Rao||MARGAO: AICC secretary and in-charge for Goa desk Dinesh Gundu Rao on Sunday said the reason for imposing National Security Act (NSA) in South Goa was to restrict the participation of people in public hearings on the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) scheduled to be held on July 8. “The BJP government in Goa is frightened with the growing opposition and rising discontent among people. Chief minister Pramod Sawant is now adopting high-handedness tactics to suppress the voice of the people. Those who are trying to help the people during the pandemic are suppressed by the government. NSA has been imposed to curtail the voice of people. This is totally undemocratic,” Rao said at a function organised to distribute groceries to the needy. He, however, evaded questions over the change in party leadership issue. “I have taken a lot of feedback. I will discuss all these issues with the Delhi leaders. There are many issues, not just one,” Rao told reporters. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said, “I am confident Congress will form the government in 2022 and will help the marginalised sector like motorcycle pilots, rickshaw operators, mechanics, barbers, cobblers, khajekars, fulkars, kankonkars, bakers, toddy tappers and others who make their living on daily earning.” GPCC president Girish Chodankar said Rao’s visit has helped in rejuvenating and galvanising the party cadre. “The overall response during the constituency visits is proof that people are looking forward to Congress forming the government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rao-nsa-imposed-to-restrict-crowds-at-czmp-hearings/articleshow/83700123.cms||---

The task force has also issued a 12-point Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to hospitals regarding various infection control procedures. The survey also showed that in 31 Covid facilities no microbiological surveillance was done in the wards or the Intensive Care Units (ICU) to eliminate harmful organisms, which is a mandatory safety and hygiene guideline for the hospital and health care industry. The high court, hearing a suo motu Public Interest Litigation (PIL), had issued an order on June 2 directing the authorities to expand the scope of the task force to include all types of fungal infections. The court had also directed authorities to make manpower and other facilities available to conduct surveys of all hospitals in city and furnish a report before it. Senior counsel Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed amicus curiae in the PIL. Out of 161 hospitals, 119 were surveyed during the exercise. While zonal medical officers of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) surveyed 113 private Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) and six NMC hospitals, an expert team of the task force conducted the surveys at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Mayo, AIIMS, Shalinitai Meghe hospital, and Lata Mangeshkar hospital. The team comprised infectious disease specialists like Dr Milind Bhrusundi, Dr Nitin Shinde, and Dr Ashwini Tayade, microbiologists Dr Dinesh Agrawal, Dr Meena Mishra (AIIMS), intensivist Dr Kamal Bhutada, maxillofacial surgeon Dr Ramakrishna, otolaryngologist Dr Prashant Nikhade and others. As per the affidavit filed before the court, 84 hospitals had infection prevention committees. Around 88 hospitals had been conducting microbiological surveillance while 85 had infection control nurses. District collector Ravindra Thakare, through an affidavit, also informed the court that microbiological surveillance was conducted at the three government medical colleges (GMCH, Mayo and AIIMS) but not regularly done at two private medical colleges, Shalinitai Meghe Hospital, and Lata Mangeshkar Hospital, both at Hingna. The affidavit also underlined the fact that infection prevention committee meetings were not conducted on regular basis. As per the affidavit, notices have been served to the defaulting hospitals by the task force member and medical officer, health, Nagpur Municipal corporation (NMC) Dr Sanjay Chilkar. Similarly, private medical colleges were issued notice by secretary of the task force Dr Deepak Selokar, who is also District Heath Officer (DHO). The authorities have asked the hospitals without infection control committee and microbiological surveillance to comply with the mandatory guidelines and revert. The court was also give the list of hospitals where such committees and surveillance were not in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-infection-prevention-panel-at-35-covid-hosps-hc-told/articleshow/83700055.cms||Soumitra Bose

On Sunday, their leaders decided to intimate the strike plan to the factories management on June 23. Mukesh Singh, general secretary of BPMS, said there will be no strike till June 24 as the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) is applicable till then. There are plans to go on a strike from July 19, a formal notice will be given to the government a fortnight before that. The Union cabinet last week had cleared the proposal to convert the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) into seven different public corporations. Even last year, when government had come up with the proposal, unions had served a strike notice, which was followed by negotiations. A joint press release issued by the unions said corporatization will have serious impact on job security, wages and terminal benefits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/of-unions-plan-indefinite-strike-again/articleshow/83700162.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Many schools firm on no RTE admissions||NAGPUR: Even though state government is alloting seats to students under free Right To Education (RTE) Act quota, many schools say they won’t be completing the admission formalities due to pending fee reimbursements. Under the current system, state government handles the RTE admission lottery draw, which is conducted online. The selected student is allotted a school and the parent/guardian has to physically go there to complete the formalities. While no fees are charged for the RTE seat, the paperwork formalities include submission of documents like birth certificate etc. Independent English Schools Association (IESA), a pan-Maharashtra group, has decided to completely halt the admission process. Rajendra Dayma, the association’s president, said, “There is no way we will accept RTE admissions because the government has not held its side of the bargain. For so many years, we have been requesting the government to clear our dues but they have not relented. So we had taken a decision long back that whenever the 2021-22 RTE admission process starts, we won’t be going ahead with the paperwork.” He added that IESA members across the state have been in touch with their respective district education officers for seeking clearing of financial dues. “If the pending dues were not enough of an issue, the problem has been aggravated further by the state’s decision to slash reimbursements. Now, every school will be paid hardly Rs8,000 per year, per child under RTE. Earlier, we used to get more than double this amount,” said Dayma. At the same time, there are some schools which will go ahead with RTE admissions, but under protest. Sachin Kalbande, a school trustee and president of RTE Foundation, said, “Within 10 days we will approach the high court against the state education department’s delay in reimbursing RTE fee. In the meantime, we shall process admission paperwork because denying admission will lead to violation of law,” said Kalbande.

Alleging discrimination, convenor of United Front of Quepem, Altone D’Costa, criticised the civic body for not commencing the work of pre-monsoon drainage cleaning in these four wards, even though the monsoon has already set in. “Clearing of the drains and bushes in the nine wards represented by BJP councillors has been completed. However, the council has refused to carry out works in just the four opposition wards. The council should stop this discriminatory approach,” D’Costa said. When contacted, QMC chairperson Suchita Shirvoikar told TOI that she would soon commence the work of clearing up the drainage systems in the four opposition wards. Shirvoikar also admitted that except in these four wards, work in the wards represented by sBJP members has been completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/4-qmc-councillors-threaten-to-protest/articleshow/83700300.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Clean air key to thwart 3rd wave and fungal menace: Experts||NAGPUR: Experts feel air quality control may play a key role in keeping the anticipated Covid third wave and fungal menace at bay in the coming days. Rare fungal infection mucormycosis has had a devastating effect on several Covid-recovered patients in the second wave. Be it hospitals and clinics or schools, malls and other public places, medical practitioners feel adequate measures must be undertaken in this unlocking phase to ensure the air is clear of pathogen-load triggering infectious and air-borne diseases in the vulnerable time ahead. Associate professor of microbiology at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital, Dr Ravindra Khadse said wards and rooms should be well-ventilated or have cross-ventilation. “If the air flow of any place is sound then the chances of its level of contamination would be low,” he said. “In the moving air, the percentage of pathogens is diluted and hence the chances of contamination get reduced,” added prof Khadse, who is also a member of the extended mucormycosis district task force. He also said that wearing mask is still one of the best means to protect oneself from respiratory infection. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde highlighted the practice in Ireland where schools and government offices were provided portable carbon dioxide monitors to measure its level in air. “We should now focus on ventilation, among other measures. Install carbon dioxide monitors in indoor places like offices, malls, schools and so on. If the level of carbon dioxide increases, it means the ventilation is poor,” he said. “Gathering should be at open spaces. If gatherings take place at closed spaces, one should monitor the air quality and ventilation with gadgets like carbon dioxide monitors,” said Dr Shinde. “Indoor air quality must be good as transmission (of diseases) in closed spaces is common and most likely,” the infectious disease specialist added. Critical care consultant Dr Nirmal Jaiswal underlined the efficacy of the latest ultraviolet (UV) and ozone filters which come with a time-bound technology. “As over-exposure to UV and ozone is not advisable, one may go for those technologies which operate the machines for a limited period only but with maximum effect of clearing the atmosphere,” said Dr Jaiswal. He, too, said that aerated spaces must be preferred over closed ones for gatherings. Dr Jaiswal also suggested that schools should consider organizing classes in the open in the traditional ‘gurukul’ pattern, rather than in a closed room. “There should be mechanisms of good air circulation and ventilation in malls and cinema halls too,” he said, adding that high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are also effective. Dr Dinesh Agrawal, president of Vidarbha association of medical microbiologists, said any air quality ambience should be free of organisms, especially at the places where patients are admitted and operated in hospitals, including the corridors and passages. He, too, endorsed the efficacy of HEPA filters at hospital premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/clean-air-key-to-thwart-3rd-wave-and-fungal-menace-experts/articleshow/83700232.cms||Soumitra Bose

The Balasaheb Thackeray Gorewada International Zoo will open for visitors from Tuesday. Safari will be allowed in closed buses from 8.30am till 4.30pm. The Indian Safari will remain closed every Monday. Bookings can also be made online on mahaecotourism.gov.in. From Tuesday to Friday, per person entry will be Rs 240 and on weekends it will be Rs 320. “When everything has been unlocked in the city, Maharajbagh Zoo will also take a decision in a day or two to open for the public. We have no orders from Central Zoo Authority (CZA) to keep the zoo closed,” says Dr Sunil Bawaskar, zoo officer in charge. “The decision, although welcome, is surprising. Wildlife lovers wanting to visit Tadoba and Pench are irked by the fact that while a zoo triggered the closure of parks, ironically the zoo safari is opening but not tiger reserves. Closure of parks has caused huge loss of employment for locals,” said wildlife lover Nikhil Abhyankar. After relaxation in Covid-19 norms in June, when Tadoba was set to reopen, NTCA deputy general secretary of forests Rajendra G Garawad on June 7 issued an advisory to all chief wildlife wardens to keep tiger reserves and sanctuaries closed citing the death of a lioness at Vandalur zoo in Chennai due to suspected Covid, and other lions also being infected. Barring tiger reserves in MP, all wildlife parks in the country are closed since then. Naturalist Himanshu Bagde says, “We have absolutely no problem in the opening of zoo safari but why are tiger reserves still closed. It is illogical to claim that wildlife safari will affect wild animals. Zoo animals are vulnerable to Covid as they come in contact with humans while this is not true in the case of jungle safari. In MP Pench, not a single case of Covid has been reported after safari started from June 1, with all precautions.” Gorewada officials said, “There is no Covid threat to animals from humans as safari will be operated in closed buses. Secondly, as zoos are monitored by CZA, the NTCA order is not applicable to us. Tiger reserves get grants from the NTCA.” “Logically speaking, it is true that if zoos have triggered Covid then these should not be opened for the public. But as most zoos run on gate receipts, they will not be able to sustain for long and hence should be allowed to open,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gorewada-safari-allowed-why-wildlife-parks-remain-closed/articleshow/83700331.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Goa||Low-level jet system influences a good monsoon||Panaji: The romance of the southwest monsoon as an intricate weather system that brings life-giving rainfall to the Indian subcontinent is linked to some remote influences. One of them is low level jet (LLJ), which triggers convergence of moisture, producing steady and copious rainfall. “This is a least studied and explored system among lesser known ones, which play an important role in monsoon dynamics,” retired chief scientist, National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Dona Paula, M R Ramesh Kumar said. The meteorologist has co-authored a paper titled ‘Remote influences on the Indian monsoon low-level jet intraseasonal variations’ with M S Swathi and three others. In the paper published in the international journal, Climate Dynamics, the scientists have sought to examine the role of intraseasonal availability of LLJ. The jet stream linked to the Indian monsoon was first identified by Andew F Bunker (1965) off Somalia during the International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE) between 1962 and 1966. It originates near Madagascar, moves inland over Kenya and Somalia, enters the Arabian Sea and flows across India’s coasts and central parts. Indian scientists, P V Joseph and P L Raman (1966) detected its existence over India during the month of July with a 40-60 knot core speed above 1.5km above sea level. J Findlater (1969, 1971) later confirmed its major role in India’s monsoon activity. The multinational expedition in world ocean with 20 nations, over 40 ships and many researchers had led to the setting up of NIO on January 1, 1966. “Active periods of rainfall are characterised by stronger low level flow from the stream directed to India, which transports more moisture between latitudes 5°N to 15°N of the continent,” the meteorologist said. But when strong convection forming over Bay of Bengal shift to east equatorial Indian Ocean beyond Sri Lanka, then LLJ gets diverted, resulting in break in monsoon conditions. La Nina, another system that also forms near the Peru coast, is known for its beneficial effect, produces a cooling effect on the subcontinent , yielding normal to excess rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/low-level-jet-system-influences-a-good-monsoon/articleshow/83700472.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Nagpur||CBSE schools in Nagpur face ‘audit’; trustees call it a ‘witch hunt’||NAGPUR: CBSE schools in the district are once again under the education department’s radar with directives being sent to officers to conduct ‘audit’. Sources in the department told TOI that the exercise involves collecting a set of data which has been printed out in a template form and handed over to the officials in every taluka. The source added that the data to be collected includes all basic information including fee and infrastructure. An employee in the education department, who did not wish to be named, said, “We received the orders from the education officer. Within a week, the school visits and inspections have to be completed and collected data has to be submitted back to the education officer.” This exercise comes after a meeting of education officials with minister of state for education Bacchu Kadu. TOI tried speaking to some CBSE school trustees, but they did not wish to say anything on record, as the inspections had not started yet. Trustee of a well known school said, “I checked with my principal and so far nobody from the education department has contacted them. But even if they come next week, I wonder what they will gain out of this. Similar exercise was conducted a few months ago and based on that notices for fee recovery were sent to the schools.” “To the best of my knowledge, each of these schools approached the courts and got a stay. Anyone with basic knowledge of the law and rules governing school fees in Maharashtra knows that such activities won’t stand in the court of law.” Another trustee, who is part of the association that had approached the high court over a similar issue, said the entire exercise seems like a ‘witch hunt’. “It seems that politicians and education department is looking for a scapegoat because of pressure from parents. So they are doing multiple things just to placate them. The government has set up divisional fee regulatory committee too, which is where these issues must be taken up, not through these haphazard inspections,” said the trustee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbse-schools-face-audit-trustees-call-it-a-witch-hunt/articleshow/83700402.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: No record on multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, some deaths attributed to congenital anomalies||NAGPUR: The district and civic administrations are yet to maintain a registry on multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MISC), a post Covid complication, though the government and private hospitals have seen many cases in the last three weeks. Some doctors feel it should be made a notifiable disease to keep track of its prevalence and ensure all arrangements are in place. At GMCH, some kids having MISC passed away, but doctors have attributed the deaths to congenital anomalies and not post-Covid complications. Unlike Covid and mucormycosis, MISC cases seem to have gone unreported. Like in the treatment of other two diseases, MISC too involves the use of a costly medicine — intravenous immunoglobulin. As all MISC cases need ICU care, the role of this drug is crucial in recovery. The district pediatric task force has recommended the local administration to have surplus stock of immunoglobulin to avoid the crisis seen with amphotericin B and Remdesivir. So far, no development has taken place regarding some of the recommendations, officials said. “Only critical patients are admitted. The fatalities were not because of Covid but congenital anomalies. We have been compiling data for our college and submitting it with the DMER,” said GMCH doctors. Depending on the body weight, doses of immunoglobulin can cost between Rs 30,000 and Rs 80,000. A member of the task force said identified centres for MISC are yet to be set up. “We have proposed that NMC convert its Isolation Hospital into a post-Covid hospital so that different specialist can cater to patients under one roof. This will also free up beds at Covid hospitals. People will also know where to go for post-Covid treatment,” the member said. Regarding notifying MISC, the member said a proforma will have to be made which will be cumbersome. “The task force has discussed this,” the member said. Dr Uday Bodhankar, who is also member of the task force, said it shouldn’t increase the workload of private practioners. “Hopefully, the state won’t have shortage of equipment, oxygen and medicines for MISC patients,” he said. Top administrative and health officials didn’t respond to TOI queires regarding MISC .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-record-on-misc-some-deaths-attributed-to-congenital-anomalies/articleshow/83700558.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Gurgaon||Offices in Gurugram can now function with full attendance||GURUGRAM: As Covid cases continue to decline, the Haryana government has eased lockdown restrictions further and allowed corporate offices to function with full capacity. Until now, offices had been permitted to open with only 50% attendance. Similarly, the cap on the number of guests has been increased from 21 to 50 at weddings, funerals and cremations. However, wedd-ing processions would not be allowed. At places of worship, no more than 50 devotees would be allowed and they have to follow strict Covid behaviour like maintaining social distance and regular sanitisation. Although the government eased the curbs significantly, it extended the lockdown by another week till June 28. Corporate leaders backed the government decision to reopen offices with full attendance. This is a crucial step for Gurugram, which is home to a number of multinationals and IT companies.  "We appreciate this relaxation as for some industries, it is pretty much important to resume economic activity. For those of us working in software industries, it is not that crucial to meet somebody in person. We will observe the situation before calling people to office. We are definitely not going back to full normal for the next few months. We don’t want to be caught on the wrong foot during the third wave," said Manas Fuloria, the CEO of Nagarro. On May 3, the state government had enforced the lockdown as cases increased by leaps and bounds. Since then, the government has been extending it every week. However, it started announcing relaxations in phases from May 24. Shops have been allowed to open from 9am to 8pm and malls from 10am to 8pm. Similarly, restaurants and bars can function from 10am to 10pm with 50% capacity. The timings are similar for eateries and club houses in golf courses too. Sports complexes can also stay open, but no spectators are allowed. These apart, all production units, establishments and industries have been allowed to operate. However, swimming pools and spas will continue to remain shut. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said, "It is a gradual process to ease curbs and our teams are continuously monitoring the situation. We have been ensuring strict enforcement of mask discipline and social distancing measures are being followed at public places. We are also appealing to people for their cooperation in following Covid norms."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/offices-can-now-function-with-full-attendance/articleshow/83700677.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Nagpur||Real ‘Sherni’: Focus on challenges on field, but several facts fictionalized||NAGPUR: Sherni, a Hindi movie based on the controversial killing of Pandharkawda tigress Avni aka T1, has attempted to highlight the gamut of challenges faced by a woman IFS officer while working on the field. However, it has taken some liberty with facts, diluting several aspects. Talking to TOI two days after the film’s release, the then Pandharkawda deputy conservator of forest (DyCF) KM Abharna, whose role as forest officer Vidya Vincent has been played by actress Vidya Balan, says, “The film talks about the landscape management and problems faced by the department, but it lacks originality. There is too much dilution when it comes to killing T1 (T12 in the movie).” “Some facts as used as they were. It portrays T1 started killing humans after I joined. But when I joined in August 2017, the tigress had already mauled 5 villagers. It was after August that proper identification and systematic monitoring started,” said Abharna. “There is a lot of fictionalization. But it is also true that it may be perhaps the first film to highlight the ground problems of foresters and the landscape management issues,” she says. Abharna, who is currently posted as director, Bamboo Research Training & Centre (BRTC), Chandrapur, had a hearty laugh when her IFS hubby is shown as working in a potato chips factory in the film. Abharna denied that the filmmakers or lead actress Vidya Balan spoke to her about the role she played as DyCF of Pandharkawda while handling the human-animal conflict situation before the making of the movie. “The director Amit Masurkar has filmed Sherni in Madhya Pradesh showing a different landscape. Had the filming been done in T1 habitat in Pandharkawda, it would have made a different impact as viewers would have come to know how tigers live with cubs in such a fragmented habitat,” Abharna feels. “Though it is evident how political pressure worked, and how Hyderabad-based private shooter Shafath Ali Khan holds sway over forest officials, the film fails to reveal that his son Asghar Ali Khan shot T1 concocting self-defense theory, that too in the night. It also fails to speak of the NTCA and state committee reports indicting Asghar,” says Dr Jerryl Banait, one of the petitioners in the Avni PIL. Dr Banait had also issued a legal notice to the filmmakers stating that matter is subjudice and the characters the film is portraying are part of the case, but they replied the film was fiction. The film also did not highlight the fierce legal battle to save Avni and her cubs. Dr Banait says though the movie depicts the sequence of events that led to Avni killing, it failed to highlight shabby treatment meted out to Abharna by her own seniors and how she was asked to visit Khan to apologize, apparently to please the minister who banked on the shooter. “Besides, the film doesn’t highlight how veterinary experts were given secondary treatment over the private shooter. The role of three wildlife veterinarians Dr Prayag HS, Dr Sunil Bawaskar, and Dr Ravi Khobragade, who brought to fore the fact that the tigress had cubs, have also been ignored. They also suggested the use of tiger urine and Calvin Klein perfume to lure T1,” said Dr Banait.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/real-sherni-focus-on-challenges-on-field-but-several-facts-fictionalized/articleshow/83700644.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Responding to petitions alleging that governments were not certifying Covid-caused deaths honestly to avoid liability for payment of ex gratia under the Disaster Management Act, the Centre said in an affidavit, "All deaths with a diagnosis of Covid-19, irrespective of co-morbidities, are to be classified as deaths due to Covid-19. The only exception could be where there is an alternative cause of death, that can't be attributed to Covid (eg accidental trauma, poisoning, acute myocardial infarction etc), where Covid-19 is an incidental finding." It said 'death certification' is required to be done for recording deaths in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Registrar General of India. The primary goal of certification of cause of death (death certificate) is to identify and correctly classify all deaths due to a medical condition (eg Covid-19) and to eliminate any discrepancy in coding so as to obtain true estimates of the burden of Covid deaths, it said. 'Death audit', on the other hand, was an exercise to identify gaps that contribute to deaths of patients, the Centre said. The aim was to improve quality of healthcare services by corrective measures to prevent/minimise future deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/comorbid-victims-to-be-certified-covid-dead-too/articleshow/83703813.cms||---

Most of them are either dumped or sold to the local ‘pastiwala’ even as somebody in your neighbourhood ends up spending a handsome amount to purchase new ones for his or her child. The Vadodara Parents Association (VPA) is acting as a bridge between such parents by organizing textbook fairs where parents can deposit used textbooks and get them exchanged for the ones of next standard as per the requirement of their wards. “We started this initiative on June 13 to lessen the burden on parents as well as help save the environment by organizing the textbook fair. We got a tremendous response as around 368 parents participated in the first fair. Following requests from many parents, we repeated the book fair this Sunday,” said VPA spokesperson advocate Kishore Pillai, adding that around 243 parents benefitted from the second book fair.

Top government sources told TOI that the UP government would be giving a presentation about the progress of projects which have been undertaken in Ayodhya. Sources said that the officials from the Prime Minister Office (PMO) will also connect in the virtual meeting which is seen as a significant attempt of the ruling BJP to expedite development in Ayodhya in the run-up to crucial UP assembly elections due next year. UP government officials said that the officials of the Ayodhya district administration and Ayodhya Development Authority (ADA) will also connect in the meeting with PM. PM Modi is expected to review the progress of the Greenfield city project worth Rs 10,000 crore, besides the much awaited international airport in Ayodhya, which is proposed to be constructed at an estimated cost of around Rs 5,000 crore. The state government is also expected to give a presentation on development of Saryu bank spanning over a length of 13 Km. The PM is also expected to review the progress of construction of roads linked to the upcoming Ram Temple. It was only a week ago that the state cabinet green flagged two key infrastructural projects – a bus station and widening the road connecting Ayodhya-Sultanpur Road with the upcoming airport. Proposed at a cost of Rs 400 crore, the bus station, which will be set up near the upcoming cultural centre, is expected to provide bus services to Varanasi, Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Azamgarh, Ballia and Shravasti. The two projects are seen as crucial considering the huge inflow of tourists once construction of Ram Temple gets completed. PM Modi is also expected to review the progress of construction of the 65 Kms long ring road proposed to be constructed at a cost of over Rs 2,500 crore. Likewise, the projects like the Panchkosi Parikrama Marg and tourism centre are also expected to be put forth before the PM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-modi-to-discuss-ayodhya-devprojects-with-yogi-top-up-officials/articleshow/83701034.cms||Pankaj Shah

Its caseload has reduced considerably since then and, as of Sunday, it has 111 active cases. During the peak of the second wave, the PHC recorded 130 cases a day. With proper management and timely treatment, the average number of daily infections has now dropped below 15. Health officer Dr Roshan Nazareth, along with a team of doctors and nurses, said their burden was eased as village panchayats took it upon themselves to monitor patients in home isolation. Candolim PHC manages eight villages – Calangute, Candolim, Arpora and Nagoa, Saligao, Sangolda, Pilerne, Reis Magos and Nerul. “It was teamwork. Panch members did a fantastic job of reaching out to those who needed to be watched. It would have been difficult to manage the show had they not chipped in when cases soared last month. Even doctors on the team who tested positive, continued to do a follow-up of patients while they themselves were in isolation,” said Nazareth. He too tested positive in the first week of May but he did not let that slow him down. “It could not be helped. I was attending about 100 calls a day while in home isolation,” he said. A study conducted in mid-April by Goa Medical College’s (GMC) department of preventive and social medicine had shown that North Goa’s coastal belt had emerged as the state’s main Covid-19 hotspot. Baga and Calangute had been classified as “very high risk areas”. There were instances last month when Candolim’s active caseload crossed 2,000, beating Margao urban centre which had the highest cases. Since March 2020, Candolim PHC has logged 8,123 Covid cases and 117 deaths. “We created WhatsApp groups and strategies were planned. Teamwork continued in the second wave as well and we worked in tandem. The panchayat members did not question us and did what we wanted them to do,” Nazareth said.

The state has seen Coronavirus deaths in single digits four consecutive days. New daily infections at 207 were also low over the weekend and the lowest recorded since March 31. Three of the deaths took place at Goa Medical College (GMC), two at the South Goa district hospital and one at a North Goa private hospital. A 49-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, ischemic heart disease and peripheral vascular disease died within 24 hours of admission at GMC on Saturday. He had complained of symptoms four days prior and was tested for Covid only after admission. The other deceased were between the ages of 71-86 and were hospitalised for three to 22 days. Most of them had comorbidities except for one 83-year-old, who died of bilateral Covid pneumonia with metabolic encephalopathy. Twenty seven new hospitalisations were reported and another 180 were put on home isolation. Forty five persons were discharged from hospital and 406 recovered. The recovery rate stands at 96.19%. Active cases are at 3,268, similar to the number of active cases seen in the first week of April. Ponda’s active cases are the highest in the state at 296 followed by Panaji with 195, Margao with 181, Chimbel with 176, Sakhali with 167, Cortalim with 143 and Canacona and Porvorim with 122 each, Candolim with 111, Corlim with 106, Shiroda with 103 and Quepem with 101.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/for-fourth-day-in-row-covid-deaths-in-single-digits/articleshow/83699062.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa government steps up preparation to meet paediatric bed target||PANAJI: As experts warn that a possible third wave of Covid-19 may strike quicker than expected, concern over the state’s preparedness has risen in the state, as many fear that it may hit a larger portion of the paediatric population, even though others won’t be spared either. “In the second wave, besides those above 45, people in the 18-44 age group were also affected in big numbers,” said a senior doctor who is member of the state’s expert committee. While children did contract Covid-19 during both the waves, it was a small number — in the first wave, 7-8% of those testing positive were kids, while in the second, that rose to 12%. The government is preparing on the assumption that a little more than 12% of the positive cases will be children when the third wave strikes. As it stands, those under 18 are the only category not eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine. During the past two meetings of the task force committee held under the chairmanship of chief minister Pramod Sawant, the estimates of neonatal and paediatric ICU beds have been finalised. A deficit of P-ICU beds, they said, was marginal, and is proposed to be met by adjusting existing adult ICU beds. “Assuming that more children will be affected, there will be fewer adult cases. So, a provision has been made that 20% of the ventilators meant for adults can be adjusted for paediatric patients with new props and settings changed,” he said. The state has adopted the guidelines of the Indian academy of paediatrics (IPA) for minimum standards of PICUs. Also, the guidelines issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare in June for evidence-based management of children have been adopted. “The committee has decided that these guidelines will be applied everywhere, and the task force has given its nod,” he said. An integrated voice response system (IVRS) introduced by a company called ‘Step One’ for home management of cases is being considered. “Expert committee members have attended a presentation made by the company, and gave suggestions on how to improve it,” he said. One of the important suggestions by the expert committee was that children under five be monitored exclusively by paediatricians. Children above five years of age will be monitored by general doctors including paediatricians through IVRS. “The overall picture worldwide is that even though children may get Covid-19, less than 1% of them get multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The majority will be asymptomatic or mild infection, and will recover with minimum medication.” The worldwide picture, he said, showed that 98% of children hospitalised for Covid-19 recover and go home.He said that paediatricians in private practice have volunteered to undergo training in ventilation management of children at GMC and district hospitals. Still more have agreed to do telemonitoring of home-isolated children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-steps-up-preparation-to-meet-paediatric-bed-target/articleshow/83699099.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Goa||‘Goa only state where teachers taught throughout pandemic’||Panaji: Over the last three years, Adhyayan Foundation has been working in collaboration with the Goa government to improve the teaching-learning processes in government primary schools across the state. During the pandemic, Adhyayan Foundation also helped the directorate of education train close to 10,000 teachers in use of softwares for online teaching. Having worked with government schools in multiple states, and currently engaged with state schools in Goa, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh, the co-founder of Adhyayan Foundation, Kavita Anand, said that Goa is the only state where online teaching is taking place pan-state throughout the period of the pandemic. She said that in most other states the efforts can be described as sporadic at best, yet teachers in Goa have not received enough appreciation for their sustained efforts. “No other state has been able to do it. Some have done it sporadically, some are still doing trials with technologies or just telecasting TV programmes. But teachers in no other state have ensured that they have reached out to each child,” Anand said. Anand said that many primary teachers in Goa were engaging with students even during vacations. “In India, it is a major crisis, where children have not been in school for 15 months now and 90% children are only getting a WhatsApp message. In that circumstance, schools in Goa have been working right through the year in secondary and higher secondary schools. These are the best teachers in India today for the commitment they have shown,” Anand said. She said that at an individual level teachers are presently going through a struggle on multiple levels. “It is very difficult as your whole family can hear you teaching, you have to manage learning of your own child at home, you have to manage your house work and your family’s ill-health. Many are also new to the teaching softwares,” said Anand. Goa was also the only state which held its Class X and XII state board exams during the pandemic in 2020 with the help of teachers. “Everywhere in the country students have been left to their own devices. In these circumstances, we are proud of the teachers in Goa and Goans need to be proud of them. But we see that the expectations from teachers in Goa are abnormally high and all the teachers get is criticism. If they are only put down despite their tremendous efforts, it will be highly demotivating for the teachers. They need our appreciation,” said Anand, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-only-state-where-teachers-taught-throughout-pandemic/articleshow/83699152.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The UHC office had recently shifted to this place following the Mormugao Municipal Council building being taken up for renovation. “The basic role of the health officer is to maintain cleanliness and hygiene both inside the premises and its surrounding. There are many people residing near this UHC, who also suffer due to the unhygienic state of the UHC. The directorate of health has failed to set an example for the people of Mormugao and Goa overall. We believe that if no action is taken against this unhygienic state, this place can become a breeding ground for a lot of vector borne diseases during this monsoon,” the Goa First stated in its letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unhygienic-conditions-outside-baina-uhc-raise-health-concerns/articleshow/83699179.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh to vaccinate 6 lakh people every day from today||LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday said it would step up the pace of vaccination to administer at least 6 lakh doses per day from Monday. This comes in the backdrop of the Centre’s announcement to take over the task from states and provide free vaccination to adults from June 21. From July 1, the UP government will mould its vaccination campaign around the ‘cluster model’ that entails administering 10-12 lakh doses per day, said additional chief secretary, Amit Mohan Prasad. The move comes amid chief minister Yogi Adityanath setting a target of immunising 10 crore people in next three months. “The trial run will kick-start from Monday and the procedure will be conducted in one-third of the developmental divisions of every district,” he said. State health department teams would fan out in villages to set up vaccination booths at panchayat bhawans or government schools, facilitating easy access to residents, he said. The villages will be clubbed into clusters and teams would move from one cluster to another. In last 24 hours, the state government administered 4.45 lakh vaccine doses and till date 2.12crore people have been administered the first dose and 40.3 lakh fully vaccinated. This way more than 2.55 crore vaccine doses have been administered till date. The overall positivity rate of Corona cases in 75 districts remained less than 1% during June, a sign of flattening of the pandemic curve in the state. The positivity rate across the state was recorded at 0.1% on Sunday. As per the state health bulletin, 251 fresh cases of Covid were reported from the state in last 24 hours. At the same time, 561 people recovered from the infection, enabling a recovery rate of 98.4%. The state reported 4,569 active infection cases on Sunday. However, at least 46 people succumbed to the infection in the last 24 hours. The state government carried out 2.64 lakh tests, taking the total number of samples tested till date to 5.6crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-vaccinate-6l-citizens-from-today-cluster-jabs-from-july-1/articleshow/83701068.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Nagpur||Surgeries in sickle cell patients need special care: Doc||Nagpur: Persons with sickle cell disease (SCD) are more likely to undergo surgeries than general population during their lifetime. For example, cholecystectomy as a consequence of gallstones is more frequent in persons with SCD. Hip arthroplasty as a result of avascular necrosis of the femoral head is also common. The final remedy on sickle cell is bone marrow transplant which also involves a major surgery. As surgery exposes patients to many of the factors that are known to precipitate red blood cell sickling, persons with SCD undergoing surgery require meticulous clinical care to prevent perioperative sickle cell-related complications, said prof Dr Siddharth P Dubhashi, professor and head of department of surgery at AIIMS Nagpur. “Surgical procedures in sickle cell patients have been associated with relatively increased risks of peri-operative mortality, vaso-occlusive (painful) crisis, acute chest syndrome, post-operative infections, and congestive heart failure. The condition warrants careful pre-operative assessment and judicious peri-operative management strategy,” he said. Surgeries in sickle cell is a team work of surgeon, haematologist, physicians, anesthetist and nursing staff. “Peri-operative management includes assessment of sickle cell genotype, date of patient’s last crisis and its frequency, baseline opioid use, length of hospital stay during crisis episodes, triggers for crisis, history of blood transfusions, and history of cardiac or pulmonary disease,” said Dr Dubhashi. Doctors generally conduct investigations like reticulocyte count, WBC count, echocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis, renal function tests, and electrolytes. While sharing tips for patients and their parents, Dr Dubhashi said children with SCD attending daycare, preschool, or school should be known to his or her teacher. “Parents should ensure that teachers are aware of the symptoms and know the triggers alarming signals,” he added. How to manage post-operative concernsPain: By non-pharmacologic measures, including music, relaxation, heat or ice packs Deep Vein Thrombosis: By using low molecular weight heparin Fever: Fever after 48 hours to be considered as of infectious origin Acute chest syndrome: Implementation of tailored fluid management protocols||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/surgeries-in-sickle-cell-patients-need-special-care-doc/articleshow/83717475.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The state government has also put a system in place for getting minor minerals from outside the state. As per the Goa Minor Mineral Concession (Amendment) Rules, 2021, if the state government does not approve the quarrying plan within a stipulated time, it would be considered as deemed approved.  The mines department said that where the quarrying plan is approved or the quarrying operation is to be commenced, it shall be executed within four months from the date of the order granting such approval or the date of such entitlement to commence quarrying operation as the case may be. If no such lease is executed within the aforesaid period, the permission shall be deemed to be revoked and the quarrying operation, if started, shall be stopped forthwith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/quarrying-permission-process-streamlined/articleshow/83699327.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Only 70 of 3,000 private hospitals in Telangana register for vax drive||HYDERABAD: Telangana is likely to miss out on its vaccination target planned through private hospitals due to a lukewarm response, even as health experts call for a massive drive to vaccinate all beneficiaries before a possible third wave. Only around 70 private hospitals of 3,000 Aarogyasri network across the state have sent their vaccine vial requirement to the state government. The new central guidelines say that 25% of total vaccination in any state must happen in the private sector and state governments should facilitate this mechanism. About 10 days ago, the Telangana health department asked private hospitals to enlist and manufacturers are also insisting that the mid-sized hospitals’ route it through the government. “Around 70 hospitals have sent their proposals till now, the state government has sent the guidelines for conducting the vaccination drive for the hospitals, the state government is also coming up with new guidelines on vial distribution and conducting drive again,” Telangana Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (THANA) president Dr Kishan Rao said. Vial requirements of around 10-100 days were sent till now by those who came forward. At present, around 80 big private hospitals in the state, mostly in Hyderabad, Medchal-Malkajgiri and Ranga Reddy districts are conducting vaccination drive by procuring vaccines directly from manufacturers. “If 25% of the vaccine drive must happen in private hospitals, at least 250 private centres have to be operational,” said a top official. ‘Confusion over guidelines’There is confusion regarding guidelines, and anticipating a huge vaccine shortage is the reason for many private hospitals not coming forward for the vaccination drive,” the official said. “Some hospitals may be looking at profit angles but most hospitals are ready to carry out the drive, but if the first dose drive has to pick up pace, there is need for a push in vaccination drive,” a private hospital owner from Khammam said. Another said the whole process eats into their business hours and has its own problems, which private hospitals want to avoid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/only-70-of-3000-private-hospitals-in-telangana-register-for-vax-drive/articleshow/83703878.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Speaking at two back-toback meetings that saw swelling crowds attending during his whirlwind tour after many weeks, KCR said both the opposition parties are trying to scuttle all his flagship schemes that include 24x7 power supply, Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bima, Dharani, Mission Bhagiratha and Mission Kakatiya among others. “Don’t you want these welfare schemes to continue?” and the crowd responded with a big “yes”. “As long as KCR is alive, neither Rythu Bandhu nor Rythu Bima among other welfare schemes would be stopped,” he said. Analysts said KCR’s tour of the districts and his line of speech, and explaining to the people that every poor family is being benefited with at least one welfare scheme of the TRS government, are all clear signs that he is preparing ground for the big battle of 2023- assembly polls. CM: We are spending money on welfareIf there is a good, sincere and committed government, everything can be achieved,” the CM said and vowed that his journey of administrative reforms and development will not stop until Bangaru Telangana (Golden Telangana) is achieved, notwithstanding the opposition onslaught against the government. He was addressing people after inaugurating new collectorates, police commissionerate and other buildings in Siddipet and Kama Reddy districts. “The opposition parties are asking where the money of a surplus state is going. "We are spending money on welfare schemes, building irrigation, infrastructure, and other projects,” he added. Without naming Eatala Rajender, who has been accusing KCR and his family of unleashing a family rule, KCR said: “For whose sake the government has burnt the proverbial midnight oil and came out with these welfare schemes and projects. I request the people to think about it and give a fitting reply to the negative forces obstructing development.” In his two-hour speech in Siddipet, another one-and-ahalf-hour address in Kama Reddy, CM became emotional while recalling the past, reiterated that his journey would not stop until he achieves his goal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-cm-k-chandrasekhar-rao-sounds-poll-bugle-attacks-bjp-and-congress-over-welfare-schemes/articleshow/83703910.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Goa||Goa Waste Management Corporation to handle disposal of condemned assets in govt depts||PANAJI: The Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC) has decided to take up disposal of condemned vehicles and unserviceable items, among others, lying in various government departments. The GWMC will undertake the work of condemnation to ensure timely disposal of the items. It will also create an inventory of all items across various government departments, corporations and autonomous bodies. A senior officer said that it has been noticed that a lot of disposable items are kept in various government departments in the state. The senior officer said that condemned vehicles are lying outside government buildings across the state. “Certain items, capital goods such as electrical equipment, spare parts and furniture cannot be used or serviced over a period of time due to its long usage or since there is a need to change due to other requirements and hence disposal of such items is necessary on a periodic basis,” the senior officer said Goods to be disposed of are public resources and even if redundant or depreciated, may still have financial value for the department. “Consequently, disposing of items should be structurally planned and conducted in a way that it obtains revenue for the department,” the senior officer said GWMC managing director Levinson Martins told TOI that the proposal will be sent to the cabinet for approval. He said that meanwhile the GWMC has asked Info Tech Corporation Limited to invite bidders to develop software which will be shared with government departments to upload the items that need to be disposed of. The senior officer said that the current procedure for condemnation of vehicles/unserviceable items is tedious and is very time consuming. “An Asset Management Information System shall be a useful tool to facilitate easy and faster condemnation of assets like vehicles and unserviceable items in a time bound manner. This tool intends to provide single window clearance to carry out condemnation,” the senior officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/waste-mgmt-corp-to-handle-disposal-of-condemned-assets-in-govt-depts/articleshow/83699585.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Bars and public parks to reopen, eatery timings extended to 14 hours||NEW DELHI: After more than two months, bars in Delhi will once again open from Monday noon with 50% seating capacity. On International Yoga Day, Delhiites will also be able to once again visit public parks, gardens and golf clubs, and do exercises outdoors. As part of the gradual unlock process, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) further relaxed Covid-19 restrictions in the city. While bars have been allowed to open at half capacity and between noon and 10pm, timings for restaurants have also been extended from 10am to 8pm to now 8am to 10pm. Even though liquor shops were opened earlier, along with other shops, there was confusion over reopening of bars even as restaurants were opened from last Monday. The Delhi government had to later issue a separate order to clarify that bars were not allowed to open. Owners of restaurants and bars have been directed to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour at their premises, such as wearing of masks, maintaining social distancing, regular handwashing, and use of sanitisers. In case of violations, owners would face strict penal action. While reopening public parks and golf clubs, DDMA said presiding authorities such as municipal corporations and Delhi Development Authority, golf club directors and yoga instructors shall be responsible for ensuring compliance of Covid appropriate behaviour. All other existing restrictions remain. Educational institutions, any kind of social, political, religious gathering etc, swimming pools, stadia and sports complexes, cinemas and theatres, amusement parks, water parks, banquet halls, auditoriums, spas, gyms, yoga institutes and business-to-business exhibitions remain prohibited. Over 5k challans a day for Covid norm violationsLast week had seen all shops, markets and malls being allowed to open between 10am and 8pm without any oddeven restrictions, and restaurants allowed to open their doors with 50% seating capacity. The number of fresh Covid-19 cases and the positivity rate in Delhi have been constantly dipping. Active cases have dipped by 95% in the last one month and the capital recorded seven Covid-19 fatalities on Sunday, the second day in a row that the number of deaths was in single digits since April1. However, experts such as AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria have warned that the way people have been crowding markets and malls, a third wave of Covid-19 cases is likely to hit earlier than expected. As the unlock process has gradually come into effect in the capital, the number of people on streets and public places have gone up, and so has the number of violations. During the month of May, when Delhi was under lockdown, about 2,507 challans were issued by district authorities on average every day. With Unlock 1 from May 31, the first week of June saw 3,870 challans a day on average, which went up to 4,192 challans a day in the second week and this week saw more than 5,000 challans issued every day, with nearly 5,600 people booked on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-bars-and-public-parks-to-reopen-eatery-timings-extended-to-14-hours/articleshow/83703894.cms||Sidharatha Roy

"The concern that the rules may be misused deliberately to make a large number of complaints so as to overwhelm the grievance redressal mechanisms created by social media platforms is misplaced, exaggerated and disingenuous and shows lack of willingness to address grievances of the users of these media platforms while using their data to earn revenues," India's permanent mission to the UN said in a letter. Emphasising that the Indian government respected the right to privacy, the letter said, "The concerns alleging potential implications for freedom of expression that the new IT rules will entail is highly misplaced. India's democratic credentials are well recognised. The right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed under the Indian Constitution. The independent judiciary and a robust media are part of India's democratic structure." "The rules are designed to empower ordinary users of social media. The victims of abuse on social media platforms shall have a forum for redressal of their grievances," the government said. A letter sent by the UN rapporteurs to the Indian government on June 11 had said. "We worry that the new rules may provide authorities with the power to censor journalists who expose information of public interest and individuals who report on human rights violations in an effort to hold the government accountable." Responding to the letter, India said, "ministries concerned undertook broad consultations in 2018 with various stakeholders, including individuals, civil society, industry association and organisations and invited public comments to prepare the draft rules. Thereafter, an inter-ministerial meeting had discussed the comments received in detail and, accordingly, the rules were finalised." The new IT rules, or the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, were notified by the central government on February 25. The government said, "Only when a message already in public circulation is giving rise to violence, impinging on the unity and integrity of India, depicting a woman in bad light, or sexual abuse of a child and when no other intrusive options are working, only then the social media intermediary will be required to disclose as to who started the message."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-it-rules-india-rejects-un-officials-remarks-as-exaggerated/articleshow/83703924.cms||---

Newly-appointed media cell chairman Amarnath Panjikar said Congress knows the “way ahead” for the 2022 assembly elections and that internal election strategies are not to be divulged to BJP. “BJP spokesperson Urfan Mulla should ask his own party president Sadanand Shet Tanawade whether BJP will not approach MLA Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavlikar to have an alliance with MGP as suggested by their own Union minister Shripad Naik. Mulla must ask his organisational secretary Satish Dhond whether the 10 imported MLAs will be given tickets by the BJP and allowed to contest on lotus symbol,” Panjikar. said Mulla said that the purpose of Rao’s visit to Goa was nothing but to criticise chief minister Pramod Sawant. Mulla who was a bitter critic of BJP for years, quit Congress to join BJP last year. “He didn’t say what Congress did for Goa’s development or what the party did to help Goans during the pandemic. He only criticised the chief minister which every Opposition party does,” he said. The BJP spokesperson also questioned Rao’s silence over the proposal of alliance when leader of opposition Digambar Kamat has already spoken in its favour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/clear-stand-on-mgp-ties-turncoats-cong/articleshow/83699688.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority draft master plan eyes transit-oriented development||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) draft master plan-2041 projected that the public transit-led urban structure through the metro, bus rapid transit system, and bus corridors will thread the urban development axis and satellite urban centres in the region. It has recommended the metro network, which is conceived between Bhogapuram international airport and Anakapalli in three phases, is further extended up to the APIIC special economic zone in Atchutapuram. This would support the emerging urban axis between the airport, existing central business district of Visakhapatnam, and the industrial clusters. The BRTS network can be expanded to provide last mile connectivity with respect to the metro network. The north-south urban axis between Bhogapuram Aerocity and mega industrial cluster at Atchutapuram will be structured hence form the image of transit-oriented development approach. According to estimates, the corridor can accommodate close to 2 million people with an average density of 200-300 pph (persons per hectare) in the built-up areas. Transit-oriented development is proposed in 1-5 km corridors on both sides of the metro. The last mile connectivity is to be provided by non-motorised transport (NMT) mode up to 1 km and further by BRTS routes on both sides of the corridor. As part of the carbon neutral mobility plan for Visakhapatnam, NMT network is proposed and will be integrated under the preferred strategy. It is proposed to have an additional NMT network within one km on both sides of the metro network to promote walking and other cleaner forms of paratransit. Improved connectivity to ports has been further reinforced in the draft master plan. Existing and proposed locations for truck terminals and warehousing would be integrated through an improved road network. A regional road network has been proposed in the draft master plan. The radial roads will connect the mother city with the satellite and regional urban centres. Major state highways have been identified for widening to the towns of Rajam, Cheepurupalli, Gajapathinagaram, Srungavarapukota and Parawada. Twelve radial corridors have been identified for improving public transit within the VMRDA region in the east-west direction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vmrda-draft-master-plan-eyes-transit-oriented-development/articleshow/83695952.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Delhi||Delhi: Two doctors held for making, selling fake mucormycosis drug||NEW DELHI: The crime branch of Delhi Police has arrested two doctors, a director of a private company and seven others for manufacturing and selling in black Liposomal Amphotericin-B injections, used to treat mucormycosis or black fungus. The kingpin is Dr Altamash Hussain who was arrested by Ghaziabad police in a similar case in April and subsequently released. A whopping 3,293 vials of fake injections, that also includes phoney remdesivir, have been found from his house. The complete racket — from the manufacturer to selling agents — has been busted. The other doctor under arrest is one Dr Aamir who completed his MBBS in 2016 from Aligarh Muslim University. He worked in four hospitals in Meerut and Delhi before starting his own company, Mediiz Health Connect, police said. Another accused, Faizan, pursued his B. Tech from RD Engineering College, Modinagar. He is the director of Aamir’s company. The racket was busted after police initiated an investigation on receiving information from the drug control department that a person, Mayank Taluja, was selling Liposomal Amphotericin-B injections at exorbitant prices. Accordingly, a team was formed and a trap laid at Delhi’s Jamia Metro Station. How this gang labeled and sold fake black fungus drugsA man named Waseem Khan was apprehended. During questioning, he revealed he came there to deliver the injection at the behest of Taluja. He also revealed the role of Faizal Yaseen, who worked as a salesman at medico. Thereafter, a raid was conducted at the medicos and 10 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B injections were recovered from there, and sent for test/ analysis by the inspector of the drug department. The owner of the medico, Shoib Khan, and his two salesmen Faizal Yaseen and Afzal, who were involved in the deal, were also apprehended along with Taluja. During interrogation, Shoaib revealed that one Shivam Bhatia was the source of these vials after which he was also apprehended. The accused led to the further arrest of one Aftab who revealed he was the younger brother of Hussain, and the injections were manufactured at the residence of his brother. Further, 3,283 vials of life-saving injections (including 858 vials of Amphotericin-B injections, 206 vials in Remdesivir injections and other injections) used in the treatment of Covid-19 and Black-fungus diseases, were recovered from the residence of Hussain at Nizamuddin West. Apart from above recovered items, one laptop having images of printing material of above injections, two high quality printing machines and raw material use for printing of labels were also recovered from the premises. During investigation, from the WhatsApp chats recovered from the mobile phones of accused persons, Aamir and Faizan were arrested. Thereafter, the movement of Hussainwas tracked and a police team was sent to UP’s Deoria and he was tracked down. Hussain completed MBBS in year 2012 from KGM College, Lucknow and then pursued Diploma in Neurology in 2013 from the AIIMS. At present, he was working as the National CEO in Hyatt Health Insurance and Pharmacy since February 2020. It came to fore that Hussain was arrested by the Ghaziabad crime branch in April 2021 for black marketing of Remdesivir injections and was in jail from 29 April 2021 to May 8, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-two-doctors-held-for-making-selling-fake-mucormycosis-drug/articleshow/83703958.cms||---
---||Kolkata||50% oral cancer patients die within a year: Tata study||KOLKATA: A first-of-its-kind study on the ‘cost of illness analysis of oral cancer’, conducted by Tata Memorial Centre in Mumbai, reveals that half of oral cancer patients in India die within a year of diagnosis and are aged between 30-50 years, leading to a huge productivity loss for the country. Conducted on 100 consecutive oral cancer patients who sought treatment at the hospital between October 2019 and March 2020, the study points out that most of those who receive some form of treatment are left unemployed and become an economic burden on their families. A majority of those who succumb are lone earning members, leaving their families in dire straits, the study observed. The annual cost of treatment on oral cancer patients comes to more than Rs 200 crore. “This is just the hospital expense. Add to this the amount thousands of oral cancer patients spend on travelling and accommodation while seeking treatment at Tata Memorial or other hospitals across India. Also, since most oral cancer victims belong to the working population, there is also a big productivity loss happening every year,” said Pankaj Chaturvedi, surgeon, department of head and neck surgery at Tata Memorial Centre who led a team of experts for the study. The study says that even patients with health insurance and/or government aid, typically seen as immune to the cost of healthcare, face serious challenges as most schemes do not provide the actual amount needed for treatment. This eventually increases their out-of-pocket expenses, pushing a significant proportion of patients and their families into a cycle of debt. About 60-80% of oral cancer patents visit their specialist oncologists at advanced stages. Multiplying the cost per unit of early and advanced cancer as per the study’s results, India spent approximately Rs 2,386 crores in 2020 on oral cancer treatment, paid for by insurance schemes, government and private sector spending, out-of-pocket payments and charitable donations or a combination of these. This is a significant portion of the healthcare budget allocation the government made in 2019-20 towards a single disease, says the study. Without any inflation in costs, this will result in an economic burden on the country of Rs 23,724 crores over the next 10 years, it projects. “This straining economic impact of treating oral cancer treatment, strongly suggests that prevention must be one of the key mitigation strategies. Almost all oral cancers are caused by some form of tobacco and areca nut use, either direct or as a second-hand intake. It is very important to take measures to curb this menace and mitigate the economic burden caused by just one of the hundreds of diseases caused by tobacco consumption,” said Chaturvedi. Early detection strategies leading to just 20% reduction in advanced stage disease could save almost Rs 250 crores annually, the study claimed. Physicians, dentists and all healthcare workers are the first-line of detection where screening of high-risk individuals such as tobacco and areca nut users can be performed, the study suggests. “Institutions also play a key role by following up screened patients, actioning tobacco de-addiction strategies and providing timely care and support. At the administration and government level, stronger reforms can strengthen the existing policies around the prohibition of cancer causing substances, building infrastructure and access for patients, and providing evidence based insurances and reimbursements for those in need,” the study adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/50-oral-cancer-patients-die-within-a-yr-tata-study/articleshow/83700030.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Asif Mohammad, during his interrogation on Saturday, revealed the names of two of his friends, Sabir Ali and Md Mahfuj. Raiding their hideouts late at night, police recovered the arms. It is learnt that they had kept the arms at Asif’s behest. Both Sabir and Mahfuj were arrested and a separate case under the Arms Act was lodged against the trio. Asif had drugged and drowned his father, mother, sister and grandmother following a property dispute and buried their bodies in the basement of their home. His elder brother Arif, who was also drugged, had a lucky escape. Malda additional superintendent of police Aneesh Sarkar said: “We had come to know that Asif had procured arms and about seven days back and he gave it to two of his friends. Apparently there is no connection between these arms and the murders. We have registered a separate case under the Arms Act against the trio.” Police are yet to find out why Asif had procured arms costing nearly Rs 20 lakh. His connection with any big racket or the dark web was also being probed. All three were produced in court on Sunday and Asif was taken in police custody for 12 days under sections 302, 201 and 307 IPC while Mahfuj and Sabir were taken in police custody for 5 days. “There was certainly an issue of money as Asif demanded huge sums from his father. We have recovered Rs 2.20 lakh from his custody. He also had a knack for crypto-currency, although we have not found any transaction yet,” Sarkar said. Arif is also under the scanner for hiding the murders for so long.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/malda-murders-two-more-held-arms-worth-rs-20l-recovered/articleshow/83699910.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: FIR filed against two cops in Chatra for implicating former minister||RANCHI: Chatra police filed an FIR against erstwhile investigating officers — Inspector Gauri Shankar Tiwari and Inspector Satyendra Kumar Singh of Tandwa police station — for tampering with the case diary and falsely implicating former minister Yogendra Sao. The fresh case against the inspecting officers has now been registered as case no 81/2021 at the same police station where case no. 90/15 and 91/15 were registered against Sao accusing him of inciting violence by villagers against the administration, acquiring land for CCL’s Amrapali coal project in Tandwa block of Chatra district. Sao, a Congressman, who is incarcerated in jail in various cases, had been repeatedly demanding a CID investigation alleging that he was falsely implicated by the Raghubar Das-led BJP government. The current dispensation under JMM’s leadership agreed to hand over five out of the several cases lodged against Sao to the CID. According to sources, CID has found foul play in all five cases but has ordered action in two of them that were lodged with the Tandwa police station. Sao’s daughter and sitting Barkagaon MLA, Amba Prasad, expressed gratitude to the CID for impartially investigating the cases and demanded that all cases pending against her father must be reviewed. “A series of cases was lodged against my father and mother –Nirmala Sao, the then Barkagaon MLA, and if the CID has found foul play in five cases, the government must consider the other cases as well,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/fir-filed-against-2-cops-for-implicating-former-min/articleshow/83697562.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Dissent in Alipurduar BJP after MP calls for statehood||JALPAIGURI: BJP’s Alipurduar unit on Sunday was gripped by rumblings of dissent, a day after local party MP John Barla spoke in favour of a separate state for north Bengal districts. In the recently-concluded Bengal polls, Alipurduar, apart from Darjeeling, was the only district in which BJP won all five assembly segments, reversing a statewide trend. While the state BJP attempted to pull out all stops to prevent many district unit leaders from switching over to Trinamool Congress, the latter party’s leaders, echoing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah before polls, claimed BJP “will soon cease to exist in Bengal”. Until reports last came in, BJP’s Alipurduar president Ganga Prasad Sharma was leading the dissenters, who include Birendra Bara Oraon, the party’s district general secretary. It is largely believed they are with four more party karyakartas. While some reports suggested that they may defect on Monday, no formal confirmation was available. Sharma could not be reached on the phone. Senior Trinamool leader Saurav Chakraborty said: “Any decision to this effect will only be taken by the party leadership.” He added that “at this pace, BJP will cease to exist in Bengal”. Trinamool, meanwhile, lodged a complaint at Dinhata police station on Sunday against Barla for trying to create unrest in north Bengal. Trinamool’s district president Bablu Kar went a little further and said “Ganga Prasad and others are against division of Bengal and hence are not ready to continue with a party that eyes at segregating north Bengal. Many more BJP leaders have contacted us”. BJP’s Alipurduar MLA Suman Kanjilal, however, claimed Ganga Prasad’s reasons to “possibly defect” were “personal and not political”. “His term as district president is about to end around Pujas and hence he may have decided to switch over. He thought that maybe TMC will give him a position.” Kanjilal added “he (Sharma) was unhappy after being denied MLA ticket from Alipurduar” and claimed all five district MLAs were “with BJP”. But sensing the unease in the district units, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said: “People in north Bengal have always been neglected. BJP does not believe in divisive politics and wants development of the entire state. But the neglect over decades has brought frustration in the people of north Bengal. That has prompted some to speak like that.” He added: “We are, however, not bogged down by that frustration. Divisive politicians such as Bimal Gurung are still with Trinamool. We will convince people of the region to keep the state undivided and fight for the rights of the people.” Barla had on Saturday again floated the demand for making north Bengal a separate state or a Union Territory, drawing flak from political parties such as Trinamool and Congress. The political opposition prompted the Bengal BJP president to distance himself from the MP’s remark, saying it was not BJP’s “official” view.

---||Kolkata||Villages go under water as rain continues to lash West Bengal||MIDNAPORE/HOWRAH/BURDWAN: Heavy rain in several parts of South Bengal continued for the fourth consecutive day amid apprehensions of a flood situation, as DVC continued to release water. A young couple was killed by lightning at Jagardanga in West Midnapore’s Goaltore area on Saturday afternoon. Sukumar Murmu (28) and his wife Yashoda Murmu (23) were working in a field when it started raining. They took shelter under a tree and were struck by lightning. The couple left behind a 3-year-old son. In Hooghly, DVC water submerged some parts of Pursurah and Khanakul. Villagers in Hooghly were worried that increased release of water would destroy their crops. The Shilabati river has completely inundated Ghatal municipality. Shops and ground-floor houses are under water and boats are being used to ply the waist-deep water on roads. Locals raised concerns that all the goods inside shops would be damaged. They said this was a problem they faced every year but no permanent solution had been provided. Ghatal MP Dev had submitted a master plan to prevent flooding in the basin, but it was not cleared by the Centre. In Udaynarayanpur of Howrah, several villages were flooded as DVC water entered through breaches in embankments. The irrigation department is trying to repair these. Three wooden bridges have been damaged. There were weddings in the area on Saturday and invitees had to be brought in on boats. Locals demanded a permanent bridge be built because accessing the hospital had now become extremely difficult. Amta MLA Sukanta Pal said that work on a permanent bridge would start soon. The water levels of the Rupanarayan and Mundaswari rivers rose, badly hitting villages in Bhatora, Kulia and Mirgram areas. People in West Burdwan and East Burdwan are living in fear as there are apprehensions that the DVC will release more water soon. The areas are already expecting high tide on June 26. The state government has started taking steps to ensure that the rivers do not overflow. East Burdwan DM Priyanka Singla visited areas of Mangolkot and Ausgram II where erosion was spotted and held meetings with irrigation department officials. Restoration work on a 40-ft breach in Mangolkot started on Sunday. The body of Manoj Kumar Das of Kulti, who had been swept away by the river near Ramnagar bridge on Friday, was found in West Burdwan. An old water tank collapsed at Dangal in Andal on Sunday evening. This has created a water crisis as the tank held 2.2 lakh gallons. An adjoining water filter plant was also damaged in the collapse. Locals claimed some areas had caved in because coal pits had not been properly filled with sand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/villages-go-under-water-as-rain-continues-to-lash-bengal/articleshow/83699926.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Kolkata||Third wave preparation: West Bengal government to train health workers on kids’ care||KOLKATA: Apprehending that a large number of children could be affected during the pandemic’s third wave, which is expected to strike later this year, the Bengal government has drawn up an elaborate programme — named Training of Trainers (TOT) — for paediatricians who, in turn, will be passing on the skills to medical officers and nursing staff across state hospitals who would be handling such cases. Since most of the latter group are not trained for the specific purpose, the guidance will help them provide effective and life-saving treatment to children, according to the state health department. The department has decided to establish 1,300 PICU (paediatric intensive care unit) and 350 NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) beds at its existing Covid facilities, where the trained personnel will be posted. In addition, 10,000 beds where mothers can be treated along with their children are also being earmarked across state-run hospitals. The training will be held both offline and online in two phases. In the first phase, scheduled to begin on Monday, paediatricians will be trained; in the second, they will be passing on their training to medical officers and nurses across districts, including Kolkata. Four major areas will be covered: severe pneumonia and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome); shock; central nervous system (CNS) and renal failure; and miscellaneous other treatment. Stress will be given on providing oxygen therapy, devising a ventilation strategy, neonatal CPAP in Covid and general care and monitoring of ventilated patients suffering from severe pneumonia. To deal with children in shock, the training will focus on assessment of paediatric haemodynamic status, cardiogenic shock, apart from management of fluids and electrolytes, among other issues, said sources. The module on CNS and renal failure will provide training on neuroprotective strategy, blood transfusion in sick children and management of epilepticus. Management of acute kidney injury will also be taught and a list of dos and don’ts for the care-giver will be distributed. Dibyendu Roy Chowdhury, assistant professor of paediatrics at Medical College Hospital and a member of the expert committee formed to devise and conduct the training modules, warned that children may be affected in large numbers in the coming wave. “We need to spruce up the infrastructure with enough space to accommodate an increased number of beds, equipment like pulse oximeters, ventilators and oxygen delivery devices. The government is in the process of doing this on an emergency basis. Most important is clinical monitoring, taking decisions on that and the skill to take care of children. So, there is a need for all healthcare workers — doctors, nursing staff, technicians and others to have knowledge of critical care service,” he said. The training is an extremely good step and will help save lives, said IPGMER professor Diptendra Sarkar. “Paediatric care, especially Covid management, is entirely different from that of adults. From the drugs and their dosage to methods of intubation, everything is specialized and needs trained personnel. Since it’s not possible to have so many paediatricians, this is the best possible move,” he told TOI. Under the miscellaneous training module, healthcare workers will receive training on cardiopulmonary resuscitation, electrolytes, paediatric drug dosage, use of early warning score in emergency and wards, and the skill of communicating with parents. A distinguished panel of senior teachers from across government hospitals will conduct the training. They will be joined by Jayashree Muralidharan and Arun Bansal from PGIMER, Chandigarh. RG Kar Medical College head of paediatrics Tapas Sabui, Kalpana Datta of the department of paediatrics, Medical College, with Mihir Sarkar, the PICU in-charge at Medical College Hospital, Uttam Mondal, assistant professor of neonatology, IPGMER, Kolkata and Sumantra Raut of the department of nephrology at North Bengal Medical College and Mihir Sarkar are among the 11 doctors who will act as trainers in the state faculty. The training modules, according to a health department notification, will be short, ranging from 15 minutes to 30 minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3rd-wave-prep-state-to-train-health-workers-on-kids-care/articleshow/83701249.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Recall or modify NHRC probe order: West Bengal government in HC||KOLKATA: The West Bengal government has moved the Calcutta High Court urging it to recall or modify its June 18 order directing the NHRC chairperson to form a committee to probe post-poll violence complaints and report back to the court, with details including that of offenders and officers who didn’t act. The state has also pleaded in court for remarks made against it to be “expunged” from the order. The matter is likely to be heard by a five-judge bench on Monday. The petition by Bengal home secretary B P Gopalika says the state government should be given a chance to probe and report on the list of 3,423 complaints provided to HC by West Bengal Legal Services Authority (WBLSA) on June 10. The government further said that allegations that police superintendents didn’t act on many such complaints needed to be verified. In its petition, the state says it “did not get any opportunity to peruse the report and or to look into the complaints mentioned in the report of the West Bengal Legal Services Authority and verify the allegations made in the complaints as referred to in such report and assist this Hon’ble Court.” It adds that SP and police stations “have also not been given an opportunity to respond as to whether it had received the complaints and whether steps have been taken on such complaints”. It futher said “before referring the matter” to NHRC, the state should have been provided a copy of the WBLSA report and its response taken. The HC had on June 18 made some remarks against the state and its order even said the “state from the very beginning had been denying everything”. The court had further said the state would be “duty bound” to help the NHRC committee and ensure that the committee was not obstructed from working as this would be “viewed seriously” and might lead to contempt of court action. The HC made certain other remarks such as the “State cannot be allowed to proceed in the manner it likes” and that “action is missing” by the state on complaints. In the state’s affidavit, the home secretary said the government has “taken all steps to stop any violence after declaration of the results and have also taken steps as and when complaints were received in this regard and also suo motu as and when information reached the competent officers”. The Bengal government further said that since it had “taken appropriate steps in the matter”, it should be heard before “passing any further order” on the complaints reported by WBLSA. The state also said “the applicants state that the order dated 18th June, 2021 may be recalled and/or modified in the view of the fact that the same has been passed without giving an opportunity to the State to file its response in connection with the report filed by the Member Secretary, West Bengal State Legal Services Authority before this Hon’ble Court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-urges-hc-to-recall-or-modify-nhrc-probe-order/articleshow/83700007.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||Must get stronger before forming alliance: CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury||KOLKATA: CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said on Sunday that the continuing erosion in the party’s mass support was the main reason behind the assembly poll debacle in Bengal where the Left couldn’t win a single seat. Yechury emphasized improving the party’s independent strength as the foremost task before going into an alliance with other parties when a section of CPM seniors was trying to find fault with the party’s poll strategy. “The party had identified its weaknesses and shortcomings in earlier meetings. But we could not overcome them. We could not present the Sanjukta Morcha as a viable alternative to people. We need to realize our shortcomings, without which we are going to make another blunder,” Yechury said at the CPM state committee meeting held in virtual mode. A total of 52 state committee members participated. To begin with, CPM will launch a campaign against spiralling fuel prices and prices of primary commodities from June 24 to July 2 as part of Left’s all-India campaign. The CPM general secretary pointed out that the party’s main aim was to defeat BJP. At the same time, Yechury referred to the growing resentment against Trinamool. But TMC emerged as the main anti-BJP force while BJP took advantage of anti-incumbency in some places, leaving little room for Sanjukta Morcha in the bipolar political scheme in which BJP’s Hindutva politics and Trinamool’s Bengali sub-nationalism dominated people’s minds. The CPM state committee also took note of the surge in identity politics and efforts by political parties and social groups to take advantage of such sentiments by floating demands of a separate state in north Bengal and Jangalmahal. CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra reiterated the need to recognize the democratic elements in emergent identity politics and forge unity of the working people. CPM is going to observe “Hool Divas” on June 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cpm-must-get-stronger-before-forming-alliance/articleshow/83700111.cms||---

TMC on Sunday embarked on its own campaign “Bengal Stands United.” Lok Sabha MP Saugata Roy said, “Now BJP’s John Barla is speaking to carve north Bengal out of Bengal and form a separate UT. So what BJP has to say in their attempt to split WB and how can they observe ‘Paschimbanga Diwas’? This is untenable for the people of WB. They are creating confusion among people.” Roy added: “It is true that Syama Prasad Mookerjee had articulated the voice of Bengalis for forming West Bengal, but it was decided by Nehru and Gandhi, so the entire credit for WB cannot be of SP Mookerjee. He surely deserves a place, but why is the BJP is trying to do politics with the issue?” TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said, “Absolutely shocked at how Bengal BJP leaders are repeatedly hunting for opportunities to create chaos in the state. They are simply unable to accept the mandate given by the people of Bengal. Dividing us is impossible.” TMC MLA and director Raj Chakrabarty said, “The problem with BJP leaders is that they simply fail to comprehend human relations beyond caste, class, religion or community.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-hits-out-at-bjps-tainted-version-of-history/articleshow/83700147.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 2010 Jnaneswari victim turns up at CBI office||KOLKATA: It was an instance of a dead man walking at CBI’s Nizam Palace office on Sunday when Amritava Chowdhury, the man said to have died in the Jnaneswari train accident of 2010, entered the agency’s office in the afternoon. Chowdhury and his father, both accused in a case of forgery, were questioned till late night. The case started after the railway ministry received a complaint last year that claimed Chowdhury was alive and documents submitted to the ministry were fake. South Eastern Railway began an internal probe and decided to hand it over to CBI last August. During preliminary investigation, CBI found that Chowdhury was one of the persons who was declared dead in the May 28, 2010 accident. His “body” was handed over to the family after “DNA profiling match”. His family was given Rs 4 lakh compensation and his sister Mahua Pathak was given a job in the railways on compensatory grounds. “The man was found alive and he was shown dead in the eyes of the government by matching DNA in a dishonest way,” a CBI officer said. Pathak, who works in the railways’ signalling department, also allegedly produced forged documents to avail the job on compensatory grounds. The agency’s officials have reasons to believe Chowdhury, in connivance with some government officials, forged the reports and documents. In a twist, Chowdhury’s father Mihir Kumar Chowdhury told investigators that his son went missing after the train accident and returned in 2017.  “I am being framed and I have not done anything wrong,” Chowdhury said outside Nizam Palace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2010-jnaneswari-victim-turns-up-at-cbi-office/articleshow/83700002.cms||---
---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand to receive 25 lakh vaccine doses from Centre in July for free drive||RANCHI: Jharkhand will receive nearly 25 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines in July for the Centre’s universal free vaccination programme for all adults, due to begin from Monday. The state, which has an adult population of over two crore, is likely to administer the doses to its eligible beneficiaries from the vaccine stocks which are currently available with it. Till Saturday evening, Jharkhand had 4.68 lakh doses for the beneficiaries aged above 45 years (which was provided by the Centre) and 2.7 lakh doses for beneficiaries aged between 18-44 years (which were purchased by the state directly from the manufacturers from May onwards). “In addition to the 24.85 lakh vaccines being provided to the state government, Jharkhand’s private hospitals have been allotted 8.28 lakh doses if they are willing to take up paid vaccination of beneficiaries,” Siddharth Tripathy, the nodal officer for the health department’s IEC wing, said. While on the spot registrations have been allowed across all age groups, beneficiaries can also produce their photograph bearing ration cards as identity proof. So far, Aadhaar cards, voter cards, driving licenses, PAN cards, passports, pension documents (with photographs), divyang identity cards and National Population Register smart cards were considered for registrations both offline and on the spot registrations at vaccination sites. “Ration cards have been included to facilitate the families who are living in rural areas to find the registrations hassle free,” Tripathy said. As per the state health department’s dashboard around 47.5 lakh people had received their first doses till June 19 while 8.95 lakh people had taken both their doses. Covid-19 vaccination began in Jharkhand on January 16 this year. “The vaccines have been allotted to Jharkhand based on its population ratio. Currently, we are inoculating close to one lakh people during the weekend drives and anywhere between 60-65,000 people during the weekdays,” Tripathy said. There are over 3,300 state-run vaccination sites across Jharkhand at present. The health department said it will aid private hospitals who are willing to begin paid vaccination drives at their respective facilities. On June 14, the Jharkhand chapter of the Association of Healthcare Providers of India (AHPI) sought assistance in procurement of Covishield and Covaxin doses from the Centre. AHPI Jharkhand president Jogesh Gambhir said private hospitals of the state are apprehensive of a lukewarm response to the vaccination in private facilities from June 21 onwards after the Centre provides free Covid-19 jabs to all age groups owing to high price and easy availability at the state-run inoculation centres. “Hospitals therefore are now hesitant to invest hefty amounts to procure vaccines. For instance, one must pay Rs 19 lakh in advance to procure 3,000 doses of Covishield,” Gambhir wrote in his letter. “Therefore, it will be a good idea if the state procures on behalf of private hospitals and distributes it on a cost and daily advance payment basis. Some private hospitals are ready to be a part of the free government vaccination programme and offer their sites for free vaccination,” Gambhir said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/state-to-receive-25-lakh-vaccine-doses-from-centre-in-july-for-free-drive/articleshow/83709088.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Till Saturday evening, Jharkhand had 4.68 lakh doses for the beneficiaries aged above 45 years (which was provided by the Centre) and 2.7 lakh doses for beneficiaries aged between 18-44 years (which were purchased by the state directly from the manufacturers from May onwards). “In addition to the 24.85 lakh vaccines being provided to the state government, Jharkhand’s private hospitals have been allotted 8.28 lakh doses if they are willing to take up paid vaccination of beneficiaries,” Siddharth Tripathy, the nodal officer for the health department’s IEC wing, said. While on the spot registrations have been allowed across all age groups, beneficiaries can also produce their photograph bearing ration cards as identity proof. So far, Aadhaar cards, voter cards, driving licenses, PAN cards, passports, pension documents (with photographs), divyang identity cards and National Population Register smart cards were considered for registrations both offline and on the spot registrations at vaccination sites. “Ration cards have been included to facilitate the families who are living in rural areas to find the registrations hassle free,” Tripathy said. As per the state health department’s dashboard around 47.5 lakh people had received their first doses till June 19 while 8.95 lakh people had taken both their doses. Covid-19 vaccination began in Jharkhand on January 16 this year. “The vaccines have been allotted to Jharkhand based on its population ratio. Currently, we are inoculating close to one lakh people during the weekend drives and anywhere between 60-65,000 people during the weekdays,” Tripathy said. There are over 3,300 state-run vaccination sites across Jharkhand at present. The health department said it will aid private hospitals who are willing to begin paid vaccination drives at their respective facilities. On June 14, the Jharkhand chapter of the Association of Healthcare Providers of India (AHPI) sought assistance in procurement of Covishield and Covaxin doses from the Centre. AHPI Jharkhand president Jogesh Gambhir said private hospitals of the state are apprehensive of a lukewarm response to the vaccination in private facilities from June 21 onwards after the Centre provides free Covid-19 jabs to all age groups owing to high price and easy availability at the state-run inoculation centres. “Hospitals therefore are now hesitant to invest hefty amounts to procure vaccines. For instance, one must pay Rs 19 lakh in advance to procure 3,000 doses of Covishield,” Gambhir wrote in his letter. “Therefore, it will be a good idea if the state procures on behalf of private hospitals and distributes it on a cost and daily advance payment basis. Some private hospitals are ready to be a part of the free government vaccination programme and offer their sites for free vaccination,” Gambhir said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-to-receive-25-lakh-vaccine-doses-from-centre-in-july-for-free-drive/articleshow/83697505.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The move comes after reports surfaced recently that many villagers are hesitant to take the jab and are even attacking the vaccination team. XISS, in association with Unicef, has appointed district project coordinators (DPCs) for Social and Behavioural Change Communication (SBCC) strategy. After several rounds of screening, 21 candidates, including 15 from the rural management department and six from XISS, have been assigned a few districts — barring Ranchi, Garhwa and West Singhbhum where the state has already engaged other agencies for outreach and communication campaigns — where they will visit from time-to-time to carry out awareness drives. The state project head and associate professor of rural management at XISS Anant Kumar said, “As experts of social science, they are better equipped to deal with the masses and communicate the rules and practices laid down by the state health department and the Unicef to the villagers in an effective manner.” As part of their training, the recruits were addressed by deputy commissioners of Godda and Deoghar and during the training-cum-interactive session held online on Thursday, the DPCs were informed of the realities that the healthcare teams have faced in the past. Godda DC Bhor Singh Yadav said “The DPCs have a huge responsibility in coordinating with different stakeholders in the district and they must not restrict their field of expertise to just these Covid-related issues. They must also encourage the villagers to maintain hygiene and a proper diet.” Deoghar DC Manjunath Bhajantri discussed the work done by the district Covid-19 task force and said that this collaboration has come at the right time since awareness is required for increasing the vaccination coverage. Unicef’s communication development specialist Danish Khan shared his on-field working experience and encouraged the DPCs to work with a positive mindset.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-ropes-in-xiss-unicef-to-raise-vax-awareness-in-rural-areas/articleshow/83697409.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

BJP leaders spoke against divisive voices, claiming that Mookerjee helped Bengal stay united while guarding the state from “onslaughts” of the Muslim League in 1947. BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta said that Bengal must not forget the “philosophy” that shaped the decision of the “Hindus” opposing the move of the Mulsim League. “June 20 is West Bengal Day, the day in 1947 Bengali Hindus took the momentous decision to carve out a separate province in India to thwart the Muslim League’s bid to secure the whole of Bengal for Pakistan,” he wrote on his Twitter handle.

Imagine the plight of Hindu Bengalis had that not been the case,” he wrote. Mookerjee, Malviya wrote, “convinced the British delegation that while Bengal had 56% Muslims, West Bengal was largely Hindu majority and should be partitioned like Punjab.” Leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari paid tribute to Mookerjee at the party headquarters at Murlidhar Sen Lane and said, “Had he not fought for West Bengal and made it a part of India as had it been in Pakistan then this state would have been Islamabad or Dhaka.

With a Dominican court ordering him to be put in a prison, he may soon be sent to a cell that is nothing short of a living hell. The prisons in the Caribbean are notorious for their appalling conditions – without a proper washroom, sanitation- stench would be coming from the corners and the cell itself would be occupied by inmates triple its capacity. One of Choksi’s Dominican lawyers raised a stink recently on the way the absconding Indian businessman is being treated in the island nation. “You have arrested someone (Choksi) on suspicion. If toilet in the joint cell is not working, then you have that smell whole day. The inmates use the areas in corners to defecate and urinate or for any other thing they want to expel from their body,” he said terming the Choksi affair as anti-Dom-Indi fiasco. Recently the Dominican court ordered that the Indian businessman, known to live in uber rich mansions, be sent to the prison. His lawyers have argued that he is unwell and managed to keep him in a hospital. “Formally, yes,” agreed Choksi’s Antigua lawyer Justin Simon that his client has been ordered to be sent to prison. “Due to his medical condition, he was returned to the hospital. “Given his medical condition, staying in prison will be a challenge; that would not be justice served,” Simon remarked and threw some light on the state of prisons in the Caribbean. “As a place of rehabilitation, they are trash. To my mind they create an atmosphere which encourages further criminal behaviour due to influences and bad conditions.” Lennox Lewis, the Dominica opposition leader, wondered how long Choksi can manage to stay out of the prison. “He is not in the prison at this time and has not yet experienced the conditions at the state prison. Since spending four days in a cell at Police Headquarters, he has been in hospital under police guard,” the Dominican leader said. So pathetic are the prisons in the region that Britain refused to deport an Englishman accused of rape in Antigua last year. He was eventually extradited, but only on the condition that he would not be put in awful Antiguan prison. “I can point to a case here in Antigua that involved a British cop who was accused of rape here in an island,” Algernon Watts, a social and political commentator and a radio talk show host for 20 years on the island, told TOI. “He went back to England. When we wanted to have him extradited to Antigua, Briton refused saying that the prison here is inhuman. We had to sign a contract with England that he will not be housed in the prison. Even though he is convicted of rape, he is being held in a facility that was used by the US naval base. He was convicted last year. He is in the old US Navy base. That is how bad the prisons in the Caribbean are.” The Antiguan prison was built in 1735, and it has five times the capacity of inmates housed there. In some instances, 8-10 prisoners are kept in one cell, just as in the jails in Dominica. “There is no bathroom facility inside the cell, they have to use one bucket of water to use all their daily chores. It is there for the whole day. Next morning, the prisoners take it out, wash it. It is horrible and deplorable, full of stench. Just the other day one inmate caught Covid and he infected it to the entire prison,” Watts revealed. A media professional from Antigua and Barbuda has felt Choksi, who resided in the most affluent locality in Antigua, could be in for a real shock when he is sent to the jail. “Antigua or Dominica, the prisons are horrible. Actually, horrible is an understatement,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mehul-choksi-may-have-to-do-time-in-living-hell-caribbean-prison/articleshow/83703988.cms||Vijay Tagore

Meet Subash Chandrabose, a 77-year-old siddha practitioner, and his wife Seethalakshmi,66, of Kuchapatti, a hamlet in Tiruchuzhli panchayat union in Madurai, whose nearest neighbour is at least 4km away in another village. The impoverished elderly couple, who say their zamindari family ruled the region long ago, are now living alone in the village in Virudhunagar district for the past 10 years, undaunted by its arid conditions that forced the others to migrate and determined to fight it out till their last breath. “We were a very affluent family, but some curse befell us and today there is nothing to show of it,’’ Chandrabose said. Villages with few inhabitants are not new to droughtprone Virudhunagar, but a couple living entirely on their own for years with no one around is emblematic of the poverty that torments some rural folk in ‘prosperous’ Tamil Nadu. Chandrabose says he is a siddha practitioner and treats ailments including snake bites. About 10 people visit him per week for various treatments, he said. Collector J Meganatha Reddy who came to know about their plight through social media posts, visited them on Saturday and handed over an order for ₹2.47 lakh green house which will be constructed on their patta land in four months. Nearest village is 4km awayThe couple have three children, a son and two daughters, who lead their independent lives and are not in touch with them. The septuagenarian travels to the neighbouring villages on his two-wheeler to buy groceries. Kuchapatti is 7-8km away from the nearest town Tiruchuzhi, and about 4km away from the nearest villages of Kuchampatti Pudur and Udayanendhal. People from other villages would also come during local temple festival but leave immediately. Otherwise, the couple are left to the company of ghostly houses and pitch darkness at night. Their damaged house, however, has electricity and he has a mobile phone to reach out for help. The collector said it was on chief minister M K Stalin’s direction, that the welfare of all sections of the society should be given attention, that the house is being constructed under the solar powered green house scheme. The couple showed the collector their rare medicines, including ‘navabashana’ tablets. They expressed gratitude at the gesture as they had been worrying about the condition of their house. Meganatha Reddy told TOI that he had asked officials to do the ground work on coming to know about the couple. “I visited them and asked them why they had not left the village like the other people, but they told me that they wanted to live here till their last,” he said. The collector told them that he will participate in the house warming ceremony in four months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/couple-who-lived-alone-in-tamil-nadu-ghost-village-for-10-years-to-get-a-new-home/articleshow/83704048.cms||Padmini Sivarajah

An actor from Malaysia had filed a police complaint with the Chennai police accusing Manikandan of rape and of going back on his promise to marry her. The actress said she met Manikandan in 2017 when he was minister and got close to him after he promised to join her in business ventures in Malaysia. She accompanied him to several places during his official tours. She alleged that she was tortured and forced to abort after becoming pregnant by him. Police booked him under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including rape, causing miscarriage and cheating. Manikandam went missing about 10 days ago after the Madras high court refused to give him anticipatory bail in the case. Early on Sunday, the Tamil Nadu police zeroed in on his friend’s villa in Thammanayakanahalli village near Anekal town,following a tip-off and arrested Manikandan. He was brought to Chennai and produced before the 17th metropolitan magistrate court in Saidapet and remanded in judicial custody. Adyar all-women police had registered a case against the former Ramanathapuram MLA and his friend Barani, after the actor submitted a petition at the city police Commissionerate. Police sources said that with the help of a quarry owner in Tirunelveli, Manikandan was staying in the villa near Bengaluru for eight days. “He made calls only using WhatsApp to avoid detection,” said a police officer.

In a message to the people on the eve of the start of mega vaccination drive in the state, Chouhan said “we should adopt the slogan Tika Bhi, Jeene Ka Salika Bhi for the protection of Jaan and Jehan both.” Chouhan said that vaccination is his top priority now so that lives of people are protected and the state doesn't face the chaos it has been witness to during the second wave of Covid-19 and subsequent lockdown, which affected the poor sections of the society more than anyone else. Let life and livelihood both go hand in hand and vaccination is the only solution for the purpose, he said. He further said that there is no doubt that vaccines are the most effective tool to contain the pandemic and those who are spreading canards about vaccines are enemies of the society. Don't have any doubts, get both the dose of vaccines and get the protective ring against Corona infection, he said. Chouhan said that the mega vaccination campaign would commence at 10.00. am on Monday and there is a target to vaccinate 10,000 people on the first day itself at 7000 vaccination centres set up across the state. A total of 50 lakh people will be vaccinated in the month of June and by the end of this year, everyone will have the protection of vaccines. There is nothing more important than vaccination of people at this stage. He appealed to intelligentsia, workers of political parties, ministers, MPs, MLAs, other peoples' representatives, public servants, social workers, NGOs and religious leaders to motivate people for vaccination and also use the social media for the purpose. CM: Aiming to vaccinate max people by OctThey should visit the vaccination centres to motivate people to get the vaccine, youths, women and members of self-help groups should bring people to vaccination centres, social groups should arrange for water, tea and refreshments at the centres, he said. CM said that second wave is almost over in the state with the positivity rate plunging to 1.5% and recovery rate jumping to 99% but virus is still there, there is still danger of its comeback, markets are now open, life is becoming normal; third wave is being predicted in October, our endeavour would be to get the maximum people vaccinated by then, he said. He further said that if everyone gets vaccinated and we all conform to Covid appropriate behaviour, the third wave can be averted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/participate-and-motivate-people-for-vaccination-madhya-pradesh-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan/articleshow/83704090.cms||---

These students, spread across 31 districts and 360 villages in Tamil Nadu, have a common goal — there should be no more cases of the virus. “Enough lives were affected, many were lost during the second wave. We need to ensure that our people are responsible and safe, especially during the third wave,” said R Vijay, a final year BCom student from Cuddalore. For the last two weeks, Vijay has been going to every public place in Odaiyur village in Kattumannarkoil taluk and explaining the importance of staying indoors and the seriousness of the pandemic. Vijay has also created an Instagram page —Kattumannarkudi Nanbargal— which has over 2,700 followers and keeps posting trivia on how people can reach out to doctors, find hospital beds, ambulances, and other amenities. Like him, A Jayarosy, a final year engineering student, has made a team to make a list of people with comorbidities and senior citizens living in Alathur village in Thanjavur. “The elderly complain of boredom, so we have video calls with them to clear their doubts,” said Jayarosy. These students also work with local PHCs, helping them arrange oxygen concentrators, food, safety kits, and other amenities. “This has made them more responsible and improved their bond with the community,” said S. Selvakumar, founder of Anandam Youth Foundation. When Selvakumar and his team were deciding on ways to help people afflicted by the lockdown, they all signed up instantly. “They know their neighbourhood more than many. So we decided on this idea, had online sessions with experts, listed out safety norms for them to follow, and also provided them safety kits.” Sevlakumar lauded their dedication.“We hope more join us so we can reach out to a larger audience,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-students-take-charge-of-villages-to-ensure-no-more-virus-cases/articleshow/83704163.cms||Aditi R
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Farmer trains 3 daughters on farms & railway tracks in Bina||BHOPAL: Coach, running mate, competitor, mentor… Father. In a real-life Dangal story in Madhya Pradesh, a farm labourer is training his three athlete daughters in his agricultural fields and on tracks — railway tracks — in Bina district as sports facilities in the state are shut in lockdown. Vinod Rajak, 40, runs 15-20km a day with his daughters Kajal (15), Astha (17) and Pooja (19), and pushes himself through the same grueling routine that he put them into. Sprinting through farms and on dirt tracks and train tracks, the foursome is a familiar sight every morning in Karonda village, a village of 2,000 about 30km from Bina town and 174km from Bhopal. All three girls have been national school athletes and have bigger dreams. While Kajal and Pooja are cross-country runners, Astha has competed in the 800m and 3,000m categories. The elder sisters are in college. Vinod, who couldn’t study beyond class10, owns an acre of land but it’s not enough to sustain his family, so he works on others’ farms to ensure his three daughters’ education isn’t hampered. Want my girls to win medals in nationals, says Vinod RajakI did not know anything about athletics before my daughters showed an interest in it five years ago. Our village is very small and we can’t even dream of stadium facilities here. Through TV and other ways, I learned a few things about athletics and decided to prepare my daughters to be strong to face any competition. Call me their coach, father or motivator, my sole objective is to see my girls winning medals in nationals,” said Vinod. “I am a farm labourer. I know I am seeing big dreams with open eyes but I will keep supporting my daughters to the hilt,” he said. The sisters are equally motivated. “Our father’s dream is to see us win medals in the open nationals. We are working hard but lack of facilities in our village worries us. We wish we could get modern training facilities like other athletes,” said Astha. Their day starts at 5am and the first grueling session is 3-4-hours long. “I train my daughters in running, long jump and high jump. I make them run with a tyre tied around their waist. They run15-20 km daily,” said Vinod. Asked why he did not send their daughters to sports academies in Bhopal, which have a history of picking up raw talent from villages and small towns, Vinod said, “We live in a remote village where such information reaches late. I wanted to get them admitted there but our hopes were dashed when Covid hit the country. So they train at home, on open farms. If my girls can win medals (in state championships) by training on their own, just think what they can do if they get proper coaching in academies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-farmer-trains-3-daughters-on-farms-railway-tracks-in-bina/articleshow/83704122.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Shot in arm for inoculation drive||BHOPAL: Stage is set for the mega vaccination drive beginning Monday — the World Yoga Day. The drive being carried out with the slogan ‘Jo Bachon Se Karte Pyar, Woh Vaccine Se Kaise Kare Inkar’ (Those who love their children can’t say no to vaccines) aims to vaccinate a total of 1.5 lakh people on the first day of vaccination drive. District collector, Avinash Lavania, said that it is imperative for those in the age group of 18+ to vaccinate themselves so that they don’t get infected by Covid-19 and bring Coronavirus home. The district administration, health department and Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) have set up 800 vaccination centres across the city to vaccinate people. The BMC has set up 255 vaccination centres — three in each of the 85 wards in the city. The BMC zonal officers of 19 zones will be nodal officers on behalf of the local body for the vaccination drive. BMC commissioner, K V S Kolsani said that in addition to online registration, people may walk into 800 vaccination centres and get themselves registered by showing their Aadhaar card. Minister for medical education, Vishwas Sarang, who is also minister in-charge on Corona control for Bhopal, local MLAs, district collector, DIG police, Bhopal and BMC commissioner have made a fervent appeal to people to get themselves vaccinated during the drive for protection against the deadly virus. CMHO, Dr Prabhakar Tiwari, said that except for pregnant women, all other people beyond 18 years of age, can get vaccinated. They can simply walk into a vaccination centre with their Adhar card to get themselves registered for vaccination then and there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-shot-in-arm-for-inoculation-drive/articleshow/83704198.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

As per police sources, the CID on Saturday issued the notice to Suhas, presently IGP (internal security division) in Bengaluru. Suhas told TOI: “It is natural for the probe agency to call police officials who were involved in the preliminary inquiry. I had ordered a departmental probe in the case after Tilak Poojary filed a complaint. Like me, many other police officials will be called by the CID.” On June 7, the CID sleuths had arrested businessman Kiran Veeranagoudar based on two FIRs lodged at Sankeshwar and Hirebagewadi police stations. While the first FIR at Sankeshwar booked Kiran and other government officials under relevant sections of Prevention of Corruption Act on allegations of bribery, the other filed at Hirebagewadi accused Kiran of impersonation and forgery. The case refers to a car which was carrying gold, and was flagged down by Yamakanamardi police at Hattargi toll plaza on the intervening night of January 9-10 based on a directive from IGP Suhas. While the gold went missing, the car was seized under Section 96 of Karnataka Police Act (suspicious circumstances between sunset and sunrise). With the car being seized, the owner of the gold Tilak Poojary filed a complaint with the IGP on April 17 seeking a probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/cid-notice-to-igp-raghavendra-suhas-in-missing-gold-case/articleshow/83704181.cms||Shreyas HS
---||Bengaluru||‘50% of formal learning has already been lost’||BENGALURU: The loss of formal learning brought on by the pandemic is almost 50% among school children and much higher in disadvantaged and marginalised children, a high-level committee set up to suggest preparations for a possible third wave of infections has said. Members of the committee, headed by cardiac surgeon Dr Devi Shetty, also consulted Indian Academy of Paediatrics, which said closure of schools had resulted in stress, anxiety, and depression among children and their families.“The catastrophe of the Covid-19 pandemic has jeopardised the lives of children in general and their mental health, nutrition, education and joyful childhood in the last 14 months,” the report states. 10% increase in admissionThe committee has strongly recommended reopening of schools. The report states that all government and state-aided schools must prepare to accept at least a 10% increase in admissions as many children may transfer from private to government schools due to economic constraints. The committee has suggested that the education department prepare a roadmap to accommodate these children with necessary support systems. The report presumes most government schools have no space constraints in following standard operating protocols like social distancing, mask, sanitisation (SMS) and ventilation requirements. If school development monitoring committees (SDMC) face hurdles in reopening schools, the issue needs to be addressed and solved by district authorities quickly, it added. Parents’ consentAs per the report, if private schools in bigger towns have space constraints, the decision to reopen must be taken by school authorities in consultation with parents’ associations. The final approval will rest with district authorities. Incidentally, the report states consultation with parents, who are primary stakeholders, is mandatory only as far as private schools are concerned. It does not dwell on parental consent when it comes to government schools. In case schools and the district administration decide not to reopen schools fully due to difficulties in following SMS protocols arising from space constraints, a hybrid approach of learning can be entertained i.e. amalgamation of both physical and digital learning, the interim report states. “In the process, all students need to participate on a rotation basis in physical schooling and remote learning. The technical and gadgetry procurement shall be the responsibility of the school,” it reads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/50-of-formal-learning-has-already-been-lost/articleshow/83704241.cms||Sunitha Rao R

This is the highest-ever single-day vaccination total not only for Andhra Pradesh, but for any state in the country, since the roll out of the mass inoculation drive for the healthcare workers in the first phase on January 16. The previous one-day highest was 6.28 lakh doses on the last day of four-day Tika Utsav on April 14. By doing so, the state has accomplished another feat of administering at least one dose to more than one crore people. Andhra Pradesh contributed to a record 48% of the total doses (28.34 lakh) given in the country as of 8 pm on Sunday. Apart from the 45+ age group, special focus has been laid on vaccinating mothers having kids aged below five years on Sunday. The Covid-19 Paediatric Task Force has earlier recommended preferential vaccination to mothers as they may have to accompany the Covid-19 positive kids during their hospitalisation. Mega vax drive conducted in 2,240 centres across APThe mega vaccination drive on Sunday was conducted at about 2,240 centres across the state. The health department has leveraged its huge field-level machinery, including 40,000 Asha workers, 19,000 ANMs and 2.66 lakh ward/village volunteers for the drive. The state has deployed one senior state official to each district to monitor the special drive from the ground. In all, the state has administered about 1.38 crore vaccine doses as of 8 pm on Sunday, including the 27.3 lakh second dose recipients. The state health department is planning to conclude the ongoing drive for the existing priority groups by the first half of July before rolling out the inoculation drive for the youth. Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Anil Kumar Singhal, said that the Covid-19 vaccination coverage would all depend on the supplies from the Union government. “Sunday’s phenomenal vaccination coverage is a testimony to the state’s daily vaccination capacity. Andhra Pradesh has a robust field-level mechanism to administer as many vaccines as it wants,” said Singhal. The disease epicentre East Godavari gave the jabs to about 1.55 lakh people on Sunday, followed by West Godavari (1.54 lakh), Krishna (1.38 lakh), Visakhapatnam (1.11 lakh) and Guntur (1.05 lakh).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/andhra-pradesh-sets-national-record-by-giving-13-2-lakh-covid-19-vaccines/articleshow/83704268.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: 25000-year-old rock paintings found in Buxwah||BHOPAL: Covered in dirt and surrounded by thick forests are rock paintings as old as 25,000 years in Buxwah — the town that has been in news for the proposed felling of about 2.5 lakh trees for the diamond project. The rock paintings, that are similar to those in Bhimbetka are said to be older than the world heritage site near Bhopal, and will be destroyed once the diamond mining starts. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) learnt about it “two days ago and is going to send a team soon,” said the Superintendent archaeologist Dr Sujeet Nayan while talking to TOI. At first sight, the rock paintings may look similar to Bhimbetaka rock shelters but they are actually different. Though they are believed to be about 25,000 to 30,000 years old, no one in the state has tried to explore the site because of the diamond deposits beneath the area, district sources in the administration of Chattarpur claimed. Dr SK Chari, an archaeologist by heart and professor of Fine Arts at the Government Chatrasal Maharaja College in the district said, “I first discovered it in 2007 and worked till 2016. My research was published in the Research Journal of Bunelkhand in October 2016.” Chari said, “This is much older than the rock paintings found in Bhimbetaka. In Bhimbetaka, one can differentiate between a man and woman in the figures carved out on stones. Besides, they are more colourful.” But in Buxwah, one cannot differentiate between the sexes of the images painted only in red on the stones, he explained. In the last many years, he said, he had informed almost all the government agencies about the paintings, he said. The ASI superintendent said, “I have seen a small clip of the paintings. They are amazing. We will send a team of archaeologists and will myself visit the site for documentation to prepare a report.” The activists raising the issue of the tree felling in Buxwah are also raising the issue of the archaeological treasure buried in the jungle and threatened by the diamond project, said Amit Bhatnagar, one of the activists. The trees are likely to be felled for the diamond project in Buxwah, the Bunder Mining Project, now facing stiff opposition. A PIL was also filed in the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the project which had been secured by Essel Mining & Industries Limited (EMIL), an Aditya Birla Group Company, in 2019. The Bunder project was first owned by Rio Tinto, the Anglo-Australian MNC, but was grabbed by the EMIL two years ago through bidding. The government is tightlipped over the controversy. Before leaving the project in 2016, Rio Tinto was associated with the project for12 years. It too faced issues related to the environmental clearances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-25000-year-old-rock-paintings-found-in-buxwah/articleshow/83704261.cms||Deshdeep Saxena
---||Bengaluru||Reopen schools, expert panel on 3rd wave tells Karnataka govt||BENGALURU: An expert committee set up to suggest measures to tackle the anticipated third Covid wave, headed by cardiac surgeon Dr Devi Shetty, has strongly recommended reopening of schools along with health insurance of Rs 2 lakh for each child attending the offline classes. The ‘High Level Expert Committee for Prevention and Management of Covid Wave-3’ submitted its interim report to the state government on Saturday. It covers special requirements and various aspects of healthcare delivery. “We have recommended a health cover of Rs 2 lakh to every child going to school to be sponsored by the state. This is not life insurance cover. The same has been tried in some countries. This way, we can build confidence among parents to send their wards to schools,” a panel member said. The possibility of schools becoming infection hubs has not been proved anywhere in the world, the report says. “There is an urgent need to offer scientific and definitive guidance for school reopening as any delay in achieving near normalisation of schooling will be more detrimental than Covid-19 itself,” it says. Digital learning achieved less than expected: ReportThe panel has recommended that all government, aided and unaided schools — in rural areas, smaller towns, and bigger towns — be reopened. According to the committee’s projections, moderate by its admission, 3.4 lakh of Karnataka’s 2.3 crore children in the 0-18 age group (just about 1.5%) may get infected during the third wave. Among those infected, 23,804 children might require hospitalisation, 6,801 ICU, and 43,358 would require Covid care centres while the rest (over 2.6 lakh) can be looked after at home, the report says. It estimates that 85% of the infected children will be asymptomatic. Doctors who worked on the report said schools can be reopened with adequate precautions once the case positivity rate in most districts during the second wave falls below 5% for two weeks. Digital learning has achieved less than expected and also created large gaps in learning and educational inequality, the report says, arguing for optimising learning, physical health, mental health, and nutritional aspects of children. “Any further delay in school reopening may push children into malnutrition, child labour, child marriage, child trafficking, and begging, worsening their condition,” the report says. “Awareness drives on physical distancing, mask, sanitisation and good ventilation of the premises should be ongoing and effective in all schools. The day-to-day troubleshooting needs to happen locally, taking clues from broader state guidelines,” the report added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/reopen-schools-expert-panel-on-3rd-wave-tells-karnataka-govt/articleshow/83708983.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Vijayawada||Long distance bus services to start from today in Andhra Pradesh||VIJAYAWADA: After a long gap of 45 days the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) is gearing up to relaunch long distance bus services from Monday. The decision wass taken following the curfew relaxation guidelines issued by the state government. In a bid to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the state government imposed curfew and restricted the movement of people. The APSRTC had cancelled the majority of services and operated short distance services of less than 100 kilometres during curfew relaxation hours. Despite huge losses the APSRTC took the decision to contain the rapid spread of Covid-19 virus in May by suspending its long distance services. The APSRTC, which incurred around Rs 2603 crore loss in 2020 due to Covid-19 restrictions had to face similar situation this year too. The occupancy rate came down to 20 percent during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19. Many services were cancelled to contain the loss. This has hit hard the migrant labour and people who travel long distances on business work. “We are a group of 20 migrant labourers working under a contractor at Kankipadu. The contract work was stalled a month ago thanks to Covid-19. Our contractor asked us to leave for our home town. There are no bus services to Srikakulam and we took shelter in a choultry. Now that long distance services are reintroduced, we will leave for our town on Monday,” said M Satti Raju, a mason from Srikakulam. Officials announced the schedule for the long distance services and decided to operate with 70 percent occupancy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/long-distance-bus-services-to-start-from-today-in-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/83704300.cms||Venu Lanka

Advocate Sudhir Puranik pointed out that the leakage seemed to be due to civil work being stopped as the contractor had not been paid despite administrative approval. He added that the contractor had already spent up to Rs1 crore of his own resources for the work. The bench headed by justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor noted, “We, therefore, request the state authorities to consider urgent infrastructural and financial needs of this court and make adequate provisions and also release the funds immediately so that the opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any litigant. After all, a leaking court hall, lack of adequate space in courts, absence of court buildings etc are some of the physical obstacles in dispensing as well as securing justice. It is the constitutional duty of the state to remove them without any delay.” Advocate Ketki Joshi, in-charge government pleader, and advocate DM Kakani appeared for the respondents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/court-takes-cognizance-of-rainwater-leakage-in-hc-building/articleshow/83717532.cms||---

According to Tadepalli police, a couple, who are about to get married, was sitting on the sand dunes of Krishna river at Seethanagaram late on Saturday night when the incident took place. The woman works as a nurse at a private hospital in Vijayawada and man is a private employee. Police said the couple was threatened by some unknown persons. Later, they attacked the couple. They tied their hands with ropes. They beat up the man severely. Later, they sexually assaulted the woman and escaped from the area in a boat anchored on the river bank. The incident came to light after the mother of the woman lodged a complaint with the police on Sunday. The police shifted the victims to Guntur government hospital for treatment. Police suspect that members of the notorious “blade batch” were behind the assault. Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh Women’s C chairperson Vasireddy Padma responded to the incident and spoke to the police. “There is no place for antisocial elements in society. I seriously condemn the attack on the nurse. The family members suspect that blade batch members were involved. Police should take strict action against the culprits to prevent such incidents. I request DGP D Gautam Sawang to increase security at Pushkar Ghats and other public places,” Padma told TOI.

But, there’s a significant change that has come in. Most of the couples and their immediate families have got themselves vaccinated and while sending out invites, they are requesting guests to get vaccinated. Many have designed digital cards to include this request while some are even printing cards with the “statutory line” on vaccination saying that they are doing their bit to fight Covid. The earlier system of pre-nuptial get-togethers for mehendi and engagements have now been replaced by pre-wedding vaccination camps that wedding planners are organising for the invitees of the two families. Jeweller Ranabir Paul and his fiancée Ankita Chanda will finally tie the knot on July 1, though the scale is much reduced now compared to their original plans. While sending out the invites they have requested invitees to get vaccinated. “It will be a low-key affair. We have already requested the invitees to get themselves vaccinated,” Ranabir said. Rohit Gupta and Richa Bagrodia were supposed to get married in May but since Covid had peaked at that time, they postponed it. The wedding has finally been scheduled on July 2. “The family is requesting everyone to be vaccinated before attending the event. All drivers and even team of photographers will be vaccinated,” said Ritu Agarwal, the wedding planner. The Wedding Company, one of the biggest wedding planners in the city, also said that many families have asked them to design invites keeping the vaccination clause intact, said Raj Jaria, a partner in the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wedding-invites-with-vax-request/articleshow/83697754.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Farmers have been protesting at the Delhi borders and the roads leading to the three main protest sites — Singhu, Tikri and Ghaziabad — have been heavily barricaded to fortify the national capital. These villagers are demanding that the barricades be removed and at least one side of the road leading to the Singhu border be opened. Ramphal Saroha, who presided over the mahapanchayat, said the issue was discussed in the meeting and it was decided that a delegation would meet the central and the state governments to present their demand of clearing one side of the road at the Singhu border. “If governments don’t take a decision regarding the demands of the villagers within 10 days, then we will hold another mahapanchayat, bigger than this, in Delhi,” he said. “We demand that the governments ensure free movement on one side of the road so that residents face no difficulty with day-to-day activities. A delegation would soon meet the Union home minister and state chief minister in this regard,” he added. However, he clarified that they did not have any grudge against the protesting farmers and the issue was more to do with their livelihood. “Due to the blockade at Singhu border, we have lost Delhi connectivity and it has cost us dearly. Also, the presence of a large number of people from outside has made it difficult for women to move around,” he said. Saroha explained that they had taken up the issue with the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) earlier, but to no avail. Even the SKM has been claiming immense support from the locals. It has also alleged malicious propaganda in the June 17 incident of suicide at the Tikri border and demanded a fair probe. ‘SKM backing Chhattisgarh adivasis’It has decided to continue peaceful protests against BJP-JJP leaders in Haryana and oppose their entry into 1,100 villages on June 21, when the government plans to observe International Yoga Day. It has also decided to organise a race dedicated to the late Milkha Singh at the Tikri border. The farm outfit has extended its full support to the adivasis of Selegaar village on the border of Sukma and Bijapur districts in Chhattisgarh, who are fighting against the government decision to set up a CRPF camp in the area. The SKM has stated that this land, which comes under Schedule V of the Constitution, is being taken over without any referral/decision of the gram sabhas.

Doctors at SMS Hospital worked round-the-clock and conducted surgeries on 403 patients and discharged 43 people so far. Among the 412 patients brought to the hospital,167 presented with orbital symptoms, five could not see with both the eyes and 80 patients could not see with an eye. Hospital claimed that they had saved vision of 80 patients by conducting endoscopic debridement surgeries. Only 14 orbital exenteration surgeries were done and eyes of the rest of the patients were saved. “We have found that around 95% black fungus cases were not vaccinated for Covid. Hence, we must encourage mass vaccination. Black fungus mortality is SMS is just above 3%, which is much lower than the national average. All this has been possible because of integrated approach of mucormycosis board comprising specialists of 14 different departments who would jointly see each and every patient at SMS Hospital,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. SMS Hospital conducted surgeries in three operation theatres running 16 to 20 hours daily and made optimum use of Amphotericin B drug, an anti-fungus medicine. Majority of the mucormycosis cases were males in the age group of 40 to 60 years without vaccination. “A substantial number of cases were not admitted to any hospital nor did not require any specific treatment for their Covid infection. It is further substantiated with the data that around 50% didn’t have oxygen support, though more than 90% had hyperglycaemia,” said Dr Bhandari. SMS Medical College claimed that despite the state reporting the third highest number of cases of mucormycosis in the country, the mortality rate remained lowest. With128 deaths out of 2,976 cases of mucormycosis, the state reported 4.3% mortality rate. Punjab reported highest mortality rate at 17.6%, Bihar 13.7% and Haryana reported 9.5% mortality rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/death-rate-of-mucormycosis-patients-at-sms-hospital-is-3-against-4-3-in-rajasthan/articleshow/83704515.cms||---

Punjab has been one of the worst-hit states in the country, recording a higher number of cases and deaths in the first wave (July to December) as well as the second (starting mid-February). As many as 1,60,954 people got the infection and 5,197 succumbed to the virus in the first wave while 3,91,311 tested positive between February 14 and May 31 and 8,853 died. The percentage of infection rate and deaths have recorded a small increase in 31-40, 41-50, 61-70 and above 70 age groups while deaths dropped slightly in 0-30 and 51-60 age groups. Delta variant in 90% samplesThe age comparison of Covid-19 cases shows that the percentage dropped from 2.1 in the first wave to 2 in 0-11 years in the second wave. The drop has also been recorded in the 21-30 age group in which the proportion of cases slipped from 22.4% to 19.9%, 16% to 14.9% in 51-60 year age group. There has been a small increase from 6.8% to 8.1% in 11-20 years, 21.7% to 22.1% in 31-40 years, 17.3% to 17.4% in 41-50 years and 4.7% to 5.4 in above 71 age group. Against 0.3% deaths in the 0-10 age group in the first wave, the percentage of deaths fell to 0.1% in 0-11 years, 0.9% to 0.2% in 11-20 years, 2.6% to 2.1% in 21-30 years and 28.6% to 29% in 61-70 years. With projections of a more severe third wave of Covid-19 in the coming months, health experts have been voicing their concern and suggesting preventive steps required to be taken. Strategic Institute for Public Health Education and Research (Sipher) president Dr Rakesh Kumar Gupta maintained that the data shows that all age groups are equally susceptible to the virus and there is a need for utmost precaution in preparation for the third wave, if it happens. He said the government should ensure that all gaps found during the second wave are sealed to tackle the possibility of the next wave more efficiently. With highly contagious Delta (B.1.6.17) variant of Covid becoming the most dominating concern in Punjab, the state government has its work cut out. Adding to the worries of the health authorities, there has been a rise in samples tested positive for another highly infectious Gamma variant of the virus. The Delta variant accounts for about 90% of the samples found positive for variants of concern in May while the share of earlier dominant Alpha strain dropped to about 2%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/deaths-infection-rate-almost-same-in-2-covid-waves-in-punjab/articleshow/83704487.cms||Vinod Kumar

---||Ghaziabad||Covid-19: Ghaziabad lab may get machine to boost testing by 50%||GHAZIABAD: The RT-PCR laboratory at MMG District Hospital is likely to soon get a machine that will increase its testing capacity by almost 50%. Officials said multiple letters had been sent to the state government, seeking an RNA extractor for the laboratory. If the machine is installed, the testing capacity will go up from 900-1,000 at present to 1,500. The laboratory, set up in August 2020, has tested over 1.5 lakh samples so far. The demand for the RNA extractor — priced around Rs 30 lakh — has been raised with the government time and again, but the hospital is yet to get the machine. However, Ghaziabad officials are hopeful of getting the extractor soon in view of the third wave. “The machine has been given to many other laboratories in the state, including those in smaller districts. Ghaziabad, which has one of the largest laboratories in a government hospital set up, should have got this way earlier. Letters have been sent and we have been assured that it would be provided to us very soon,” a senior health department official said. Staff posted at the Ghaziabad lab said that with the help of the RNA extractor, the work of two shifts could be done in one. “With more RNAs available, more testing can be done. About 2,000 samples are collected for RT-PCR tests daily. Half of them have to be sent to a Noida lab for testing. At present, the situation is under control. But when the second wave was at its peak, the working was quite stretched and it led to delay in issuing reports. Manual work during sampling takes a lot of time,” a lab worker said. There are now 15 technicians and assistants at the lab, apart from two microbiologists and one data operator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/gzb-lab-may-get-machine-to-boost-testing-by-50/articleshow/83702353.cms||Aditya Dev

To achieve the target, Gurugram on Sunday received 20,000 more doses of Covishield. The city now has 50,000 doses of the vaccine for the drive. The session sites include 19 private hospitals and 190 government facilities. Recipients will be allowed to walk in at the government sites without pre-registration, while appointments will be compulsory at the private facilities. The health department has divided the district into urban and rural clusters for this drive. There will be 75 rural sites and 115 urban sites in government facilities. A special camp will be set up for people working at the Chandralok area in Sadar Bazar and a site will be set up for auto drivers at Rajeev Chowk. Both sites will have 200 slots each. Also, special camps will be set up near Khandsa mandi. The health department is also targeting daily wage labourers, for whom three dedicated sites will be set up at Sector 5, Labour chowk in Khandsa and one in Sohna. Also, five drive-ins vaccination sites have been planned for the day. “We have already given fixed timings for shopkeepers to get their shots at Chandralok session site. We are focusing on these groups as they might end up being super-spreaders of Covid,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon. Over 7,000 vaccinatedOn Sunday, a total of 6,386 people in the 18-44 age group got inoculated in the city. In the 45-plus category, 969 people took the shots. There were no session sites on Sunday at government facilities. In Gurgaon, as per the data by the health department, private hospitals carried out 69% of all vaccinations between June 1 and June 20. A total of 2,39,170 people were vaccinated in the city in that period. In private session sites, a total of people 1,66,508 got inoculated while the figure stood at 72,662 (30%) in government facilities. Going by the numbers, the private hospitals have administered 8,325 doses on average daily in the past 20 days, while the government facilities have given 3,633 doses on average every day. In May, Gurgaon carried out 2,16,415 inoculations. The private hospitals in the city had administered 56,108 (26%) doses in that month, while 1,60,307 (74%) doses were administered at government facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mega-vax-drive-gurgaon-to-give-30000-shots-at-209-session-sites/articleshow/83700713.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Every third adult in Lucknow has taken at least one vaccine shot||LUCKNOW: Every third adult in the city has received at least a single shot of Covid vaccine in six months since the start of the mass vaccination drive in January earlier this year, reveals the data shared by the health department. Total 12.26 lakh doses have been administered from January 16 till June 19. This means, one third of Lucknow's 35.78 lakh population has taken a dose of the twodose course. However, only 7% of the total population has been fully vaccinated with two doses. Experts say that while the government needs to ramp up inoculations, people must shelve all hesitancy or complacency and take the jab as early as possible to avert the third wave or at least ensure that it causes minimal damage in terms of life and sufferings. Various models predict that the third wav may hit in the next 3-4 months, that is by September-October. In Lucknow, religious places and government offices are also holding vaccination camps. Similar strategy should be adopted across the state. “Ideally, 70% of the population should be fully vaccinated to reach herd immunity, but even if we are able to inoculate 65-70% of the population with a single shot, it will prove crucial against the third wave. Studies suggest that a dose of vaccine can reduce the severity of Delta or Delta plus variants of the virus and save lives,” said Prof Virendra Atam, head, medicine, KGMU. Ex-head microbiology department Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU Dr Anil Kumar Gulati said, "Enough antibodies are generated 15-28 days after the booster dose, but even a single dose provides some protection.” He suggested that besides allowing walk-in vaccination facilities to the 18-44 age category rather than slot booking, the government should increase centres at work places. Microbiologist at RMLIMS Prof Manodeep Sen said that awareness campaigns to dispel myths and encourage vaccination will boost the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/every-third-adult-in-lucknow-has-taken-at-least-one-vaccine-shot/articleshow/83704625.cms||---

During an online meet on Sunday, district head (Haryana NHM) Karamchari Sangh outlined the schedule of their next leg of the ongoing protest that was launched against the state government earlier this month. Terming it as the fourth phase of their protest, all the workers, including contractual doctors, auxiliary midwife nurses, medical technicians, and ambulance drivers, will refrain from reporting to their duties. The workers claim that their efforts to engage with the state government in the past few weeks have failed to elicit any response, forcing them to use “extreme measures”. “Suspending work during a pandemic is not something we wanted to undertake. But the government has left us with no option. In media statements, the government presents itself as if they are very concerned about our well-being. But they refuse to acknowledge our repeated letters and memorandums,” said the state president of NHM Karmachari Sangh Rehan Raza. The NHM workers have maintained that they are working in extreme conditions without any safety net and government support. Workers have claimed that working at the frontline, they have been denied basic employee rights like complete salaries and insurances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/health-workers-to-go-on-strike-stay-in-home-isolation-for-2-days/articleshow/83701928.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

A convention organised by Shahidane Mewat and Nagrik Manch accused some groups of attempting to incite tension in certain areas. The convention was attended by several leaders of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), Centre of Indian Trade Unions, clerics, and some political leaders. “The convention was in response to what has been going on for the past few weeks,” said CITU state president Surekha. Last month, Asif Khan (27) was allegedly beaten to death by a group of men while he was out with his cousin to buy some medicines. While police said the incident was a fallout of old rivalry, Asif’s family alleged that the youth was lynched. “Since last year, several groups have been trying to divide people on communal lines. We are urging people to not fall into the trap and maintain law and order,” said local leader Ramzan Chaudhary. During the convention, the SKM leaders also announced to hold a “Kisan Mazdoor Bhaichara” event at Sunehra border on June 28.“These are the attempts to weaken the farmers’ movement by trying to divide farmers on communal lines. Such tactics will not work and we will do our best to thwart such attempts,” said former MP and leader of CPIM, Subhashini Ali Sahgal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gym-trainers-death-meet-condemns-divisive-efforts/articleshow/83702022.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

---||Noida||Allow shops to remain open on weekends too: Traders to govt||Noida/Ghaziabad: Traders in Noida and Ghaziabad said the UP government’s decision to relax night curfew hours would help lift business marginally, but the weekend lockdown was a great deterrent as neighbouring Delhi had allowed markets to stay open through all days of the week. “The days are hot and people prefer stepping out only in the evenings. Allowing shops to open till 9pm will help current businesses by 20-25%,” said SK Jain, president of Sector 18 market association. He added, “For markets, over half the business comes during weekends. If we remain shut, people will go to Delhi for shopping. We will be at a loss. The government should look at having similar norms across all NCR cities.” Restaurant owners further said that the relaxation to allow indoor seating will not impact business much. “For restaurants with seating, the lunch business is not very high and dinner usually does not end by 9pm. People will not be visiting restaurants much and the main business will continue to be through deliveries. However, most people go out for meals during weekends, which will not happen” said Varun Khera, head of the Noida chapter of the National Restaurant Association of India. Alok Kumar, the founder of the Federation of Association of Apartment Owners, said: “There is a need to maintain strictness of roads and in markets. However, the timings allowed for economic activities are insufficient, especially for restaurants and hotels.” Meanwhile, officials said that despite the relaxations, strict action will be taken against those who break norms. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that there are no additional restrictions apart from those in the state order. “The additional district magistrate (administration) and the ADM (City) have been appointed to monitor rural and urban areas, respectively. In their respective jurisdictions, city magistrate, sub-divisional magistrates and additional city magistrates, besides police officers, will ensure compliance. Penal action will be taken against offenders,” said Ghaziabad district magistrate RK Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/allow-shops-to-remain-open-on-weekends-too-traders-to-govt/articleshow/83702264.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Noida||Covid wards in Noida, Ghaziabad are empty, but ICU stays are getting longer||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: Sadanand Pandey (55) tested positive on May 15 and was admitted to District Combined Hospital in Ghaziabad. The Shastri Nagar resident was found Covid negative just five days later, but his oxygen saturation level had still not improved. A few tests revealed Pandey had developed lung fibrosis and his oxygen level had dipped to 70-75. He couldn’t walk even a few steps. It has been more than a month since then and Pandey is still admitted to the hospital. As the second wave seems to be on the decline and general Covid beds are lying vacant in most hospitals, ICUs and post-Covid wards are filled with patients across Noida and Ghaziabad. The average stay of a Covid patient in ICU has been much longer than that in the first wave, doctors have confirmed. According to doctors at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, the ICU stay for patients has been one and a half times longer during the second wave. Dr Sanjay Teotia, the chief medical superintendent of the District Combined Hospital, said Pandey was their longest-staying Covid patient so far. "His recovery is slow and the treatment involves antifibrinolytic medicines, physiotherapy and breathing exercises. However, Pandey is not alone. About 80 of 521 patients who had been admitted here stayed for more than 15-20 days because of Covid-related complications. About 90% of these patients needed oxygen therapy," he added. Unlike the first wave, the infection not only spread rapidly during the second one but also lasted for a longer time in patients. Many of those who have recovered from Covid are still undergoing medicines. Such patients are suffering from persistent fever, dry cough, headache and body pain. Most patients who needed oxygen during the second wave have battled complications for 25-60 days, Dr Teotia said. In contrast, the infection lasted around 10 days during the first wave. "We saw fewer people in the ICU last year. But this time, most patients were serious and needed an ICU bed. In the past two months, several patients have needed ICU care for 10-15 days on an average. A longer ICU stay also leads to a higher mortality," said Dr Rakesh Gupta, director of GIMS. According to him, 30% of Covid patients admitted at GIMS had to be shifted to ICU in the past few months. Last year, the figure was just 10%. Deaths have been a cause for concern too. Compared to 55 Covid patients who died at GIMS during the first wave, there have been 120 fatalities in the past two months. Ghaziabad IMA president and senior pulmonologist Dr Ashish Agarwal, who is associated with Gayatri Hospital, said two patients had been admitted at his medical facility for the past 40 days. They are still being administered oxygen. "Most patients have to stay for long in hospitals because of this issue. About 30% of over 500 patients admitted to our hospital had a longer stay (more than 25 days). This time around, there was more infection in the lungs, which took time to heal. Many of the patients panicked, which caused their recovery to take more time," he added. At Noida Covid Hospital, there have been over 2,600 admissions since last year.  "We have seen several cases where patients have stayed in the ICU for two months. As of now, we have a total of 13 patients in the entire hospital. While eight have been in the ICU for long, the rest are in the wards with symptoms," said Dr Tritya Saxena, medical superintendent at Noida Covid Hospital. He said that while the hospital saw just one fatality during the first wave, there were 142 deaths in the past two months. The severity of the second wave can also be gauged from the overall fatality rate. Of 466 deaths reported in Noida, 372 are in the past three months. Likewise, in Ghaziabad, 359 of 461 deaths took place in second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/2nd-wave-covid-wards-are-empty-but-icu-stays-are-getting-longer/articleshow/83702232.cms||Snehil Sinha

The project will come up across 80 villages between Dadri and Khurja in Bulandshahr in the Delhi-Noida-Ghaziabad Investment Region (DNGIR). While a preliminary draft of the plan is likely to be ready by October 2021, the final report is expected by April 2022, officials said. “We have hired SPA to make the master plan for New Noida, which will be developed across 20,000 hectares. Apart from agency selection, nothing has been decided or prepared yet. The agency will take about 10 months to prepare the master plan, which may be a mixed model,” said Ritu Maheshwari, the chief executive officer, Noida Authority. On January 29, 2021, the government had given the 80 villages to Noida Authority for development. Some of the areas were under the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Authority from August 29, 2017. According to officials, the region might be developed on the lines of Dholera investment region in Gujarat, which is located along the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC). “Dholera is one of the investment regions that is being studied as a model for the New Noida plan. We hope the agency will be ready with a base map by October 2021,” said Ishtiyak Ahmed, general manager (planning), Noida Authority. “Everything is in a preliminary stage. But the focus is on global investments and advanced infrastructure. We have not acquired any land yet,” he added. DNGIR is one of the seven proposed investment regions for the first phase of DMIC. It is one of the key nodes of the DMIC project due to its location near the western dedicated freight corridor. DNGIR is spread over Bulandshahr and Gautam Budh Nagar and covers 85 villages. A multi-modal logistics hub near Dadri and the multi-modal transit hub at Boraki, Greater Noida, are part of the proposed project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/agency-hired-new-noida-master-plan-likely-to-be-ready-by-apr-2022/articleshow/83700912.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

In Noida, Sector 47 residents complained of foul smell due to clogged sewers. Ajab Singh Pradhan, RWA president of Sector Delta 2 in Greater Noida, said, “All drains are clogged in L block. Despite repeated requests and complaints to the Authority, the work has not been done. It rained a little more than an hour today and even then, the streets got waterlogged. If this is the situation with just 2.3mm rainfall, I wonder what will happen when the monsoon sets in.” Harinder Bhati, a resident of Sector Beta 1 wrote to GNIDA complaining about the situation. “The Authority is not prepared to handle the situation. Monsoon is a week away and they are yet to clean the drains and sewers. There is also leakage in the pipeline in Beta 2 Sector due to damaged road.” Dinesh Bhati, another resident, added that the contractors and officials act only when photos and videos of the waterlogged streets are circulated on social media. When asked, officials said tendering is underway in some areas and contracts have been allocated in others. “The work will be completed soon,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/2-3mm-rain-leaves-greater-noida-streets-waterlogged/articleshow/83700948.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Goa||‘Goa only state where teachers taught throughout pandemic’||PANAJI: Over the last three years, Adhyayan Foundation has been working in collaboration with the Goa government to improve the teaching learning processes in government primary schools across the state. During the pandemic, Adhyayan Foundation also helped the directorate of education train close to 10,000 teachers in use of softwares for online teaching. Having worked with government schools in multiple states, and currently engaged with state schools in Goa, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh, the co-founder of Adhyayan Foundation, Kavita Anand, said that Goa is the only state where online teaching is taking place pan-state throughout the period of the pandemic. She said that in most other states the efforts can be described as sporadic at best, yet teachers in Goa have not received enough appreciation for their sustained efforts. “No other state has been able to do it. Some have done it sporadically, some are still doing trials with technologies or just telecasting TV programmes. But teachers in no other state have ensured that they have reached out to each child,” Anand said. Anand said that many primary teachers in Goa were engaging with students even during vacations. “In India, it is a major crisis, where children have not been in school for 15 months now and 90% children are only getting a WhatsApp message. In that circumstance, schools in Goa have been working right through the year in secondary and higher secondary schools. These are the best teachers in India today for the commitment they have shown,” Anand said. She said that at an individual level teachers are presently going through a struggle on multiple levels. “It is very difficult as your whole family can hear you teaching, you have to manage learning of your own child at home, you have to manage your house work and your family’s ill-health. Many are also new to the teaching softwares,” said Anand. Goa was also the only state which held its Class X and XII state board exams during the pandemic in 2020 with the help of teachers. “Everywhere in the country students have been left to their own devices. In these circumstances, we are proud of the teachers in Goa and Goans need to be proud of them. But we see that the expectations from teachers in Goa are abnormally high and all the teachers get is criticism. If they are only put down despite their tremendous efforts, it will be highly demotivating for the teachers. They need our appreciation,” said Anand, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-only-state-where-teachers-taught-throughout-pandemic/articleshow/83704714.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

He was produced in court on Sunday. Last week, Idris was booked in a third FIR filed in the probe into the assault on Samad after police claimed he had hosted a “provocative” Facebook live session with the elderly man by his side. Police had said that they had caught Idris near Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital in Delhi. Iraj Raza, SP (rural) said initially during questioning, Idris, a Samajwadi Party functionary, tried to confuse them. “We have come to know that he wanted to get an affidavit prepared that would save him from further investigation. Idris wanted Samad to sign the document as well. He was planning to surrender in court,” Raza said. “Idris made over 70 calls between June 16 and June 19 before he was picked up,” he added. A senior police officer said the politician has named a few people during questioning, including a councillor from the city. Earlier, Idris had gone underground and was constantly shifting base. Recently, he had ordered food from a restaurant while he was hiding at a Delhi hotel. But later, he refused to take the delivery fearing that he might be traced, the police officer said. A car, two mobile phones and a Wifi router have been recovered from him. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/ghaziabad-assault-idris-sent-to-judicial-custody-for-14-days/articleshow/83701006.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

---||India||'J&K political process is already underway': LG Manoj Sinha||Manoj Sinha has been in the news since taking over as lieutenant governor of J&K. Besides presiding over the smooth conduct of DDC polls, he has successfully pushed for expanding the reach of central government schemes and has personally been driving vaccination in the UT with an impressive speed. He spoke to Bharti Jain ahead of the dialogue between the Centre and political parties from J&K. Excerpts from the interview:An all-party meeting has been convened by the PM on J&K on June 24. Is this the start of a political process?When I was sent to J&K, the PM stressed on two things: First, there should be constant engagement with the common people and political formations; second, a conducive environment should be created for early restoration of political process. Accordingly, the DDC polls were held. Delimitation Commission is doing its work. In the last few days, the commission has sought information from all district heads of J&K on 18 parameters. The all-party meeting has been convened by the PM and it will not be right for me to comment. But this reflects faith in the democratic process and is meant to take it forward with the involvement of maximum people. There should be a constant dialogue in politics. Many parties in J&K complain that political activity is on hold since the abrogation of Article 370. Your view?Political activity in J&K started much before. DDC polls were held in a free and fair manner, with good participation of people. For the first time, a three-tier panchayati raj system was installed in J&K. Why it was not implemented earlier is something for the people to ponder. We have not only held local body polls but are also doing everything to empower them. This time we held wide consultations, involving DDC members, while approving budgets for new projects and infrastructure upgrade in districts; we have more than doubled the budget to Rs 12,600 crore from Rs 5,162 crore. So political process is already underway in J&K and the people's participation and trust is growing. Many political leaders were detained. Do you think this has created an element of mistrust?I feel there is no mistrust among the common people of J&K. I say it with full responsibility that in the past 10-11 months, not a single decision of J&K government was guided by bias or discrimination. Will delimitation be complete by March 2022, when the extended tenure of the Delimitation Commission ends?It is not right for me to comment on the work of a constitutional body. I am sure both Delimitation Commission and Election Commission will carry out their mandate. Will polls follow soon after delimitation?Nobody should have any doubt as the PM himself has declared that polls in J&K will be held after delimitation. Similar assurance was given by the home minister in Parliament. The country and people of J&K have faith in these assurances. As for the timing of polls, the decision lies with the Election Commission. There has been talk of further reorganisation of J&K. What is the correct position?When some people run out of issues to criticise, they rely on rumours and emotions. They cannot criticise the development that is happening at a fast pace, social security schemes have reached 100% saturation, tourism has broken records, new industrial policy has given hope to the people, horticulture and agriculture sector is doing well, Covid management is on track. Disillusioned parties, both within J&K and abroad, are spreading such rumours as part of a conspiracy. I refute these firmly. Will J&K's statehood be restored soon?The home minister has given a statement on this in Parliament. Restoring statehood is the domain of the government and it would not be appropriate for me to say anything. J&K has done well on the vaccination front. How was this achieved?As on Saturday, over 78% of the population of J&K in the 45-plus category has been vaccinated. The strategy is focused on a dedicated workforce and how to reach maximum number of people. We were in touch with the home ministry and the PM on vaccine availability. We followed a strategy of connecting with priority groups, deploying sufficient workforce, mobile vaccination and equitable allocation of vaccine to every region. We have achieved 100% vaccination in four districts of Shopian, Ganderbal, Jammu and Samba. How has door-to-door vaccination helped J&K?If we follow J&K's topography, it will be hard to expect all the people to come to vaccination centres. Hence, we decided to go to them with a door-to-door plan. Asha workers, PRIs, anganwadi workers and lambardarwere roped in to identify priority groups within three days. With the prepared data, which was matched with the voters' list, we could achieve a good vaccination rate. We believe vaccine is a public service and hence should be doorstep. The home minister was consulted on this and gave his go-ahead. How has J&K tackled vaccine hesitancy?In the initial stages, there was vaccine hesitancy in J&K, just like elsewhere in the country and also the world. Thanks to some media reports, there was more fear of the info-demic than the pandemic. We tackled this with a two-point strategy. First, we got our eminent doctors to put out messages, including through the electronic media like Gulistan and Doordarshan, that vaccine was necessary and safe. We also involved religious leaders and grassroots administration to allay vaccine fears. Are there any timelines for vaccination in J&K?We hope to complete 100% vaccination for the 45-plus population (at least one dose) by June 30 and 30% for those aged 18-44 years (first dose) by July. J&K did not face oxygen shortage during the second Covid wave. How was this ‘J&K model’ developed?I wouldn’t call it ‘J&K model’ as such. On September 19, 2020, when I went for the administrative council meeting in Srinagar, we reviewed the oxygen availability in J&K and took decisions to augment it. At that time the oxygen generation capacity of the UT was around 14,000-15,000 LPM. Today our capacity is more than 54,000 LPM. And I hope that by July 30, we will take this up to 90,000 LPM. We also set up oxygen war rooms in both Srinagar and Jammu. Thanks to our efforts, during the entire pandemic, J&K never faced an oxygen bed shortage. How will you rate the current security situation in J&K?The security situation is much better than last year. We will focus on investigation, engagement of youth and also updating school curriculum to include scientific education. We are also ensuring more employment for our youths through programmes like 'Mission Youth'. Our unemployment figure was 19% when I took over as LG, in March, it came down to 9%, though now it has risen to 11%. J&K is better placed than Delhi, Bihar, Goa or Rajasthan. This is thanks to Back-to-Village initiative. We had decided to extend financial help to 2 youths in every panchayat for becoming an entrepreneur. We have since offered assistance to 19,000 persons of which 4,500 are women. Now we hope to extend this financial assistance to at least 50,000 youths by the end of this financial year. What made J&K propose financial aid for families who lost their earning members to Covid?During the second wave, I was touring hospitals and was pained by how it had hit and destroyed families. I discussed this with the PM and HM. Thereafter, three decisions were taken: if an earning youth has died of Covid, his parents will be granted pension; if such deceased person had children pursuing education, the UT government will offer them scholarship; and that a special cell would be formed in the social welfare department to take responsibility for welfare of all such families, including giving financial help to a member of that family for self-employment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-political-process-is-already-underway-lg-manoj-sinha/articleshow/83703065.cms||Bharti Jain

"We hope the problem will be resolved soon," Doraiswami told reporters after a meeting with Awami Jubo League Chairman Fazle Shams Parash in Bangladesh, reported Dhaka Tribune. "The corona situation in India is still at a dangerous stage. So we are not yet able to say the exact time of giving vaccines to Bangladesh," he added. On the other hand, Parash recalled India's crucial help during the 1971 Liberation War and said India has always been by Bangladesh's side in everything. "India is our friend of bad days and partner in good days as well," he said. Parash said that he discussed with the Indian envoy about the current coronavirus situation in India. According to Dhaka Tribune, Doraiswami watched two documentaries on the humanitarian activities of the ruling party's youth wing during the Covid-19 pandemic. Bangladesh had started its inoculation drive against coronavirus with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine procured from India at USD 5 per dose. However, due to the devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India, vaccine exports have temporarily come to a halt. Meanwhile, Bangladesh is also experiencing an alarming rise in fresh Covid-19 related deaths and new cases. The health authorities had also detected the presence of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which is highly contagious.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-keen-to-resume-covid-19-vaccine-export-to-bangladesh-says-envoy/articleshow/83705098.cms||---
---||Salem||Tamil Nadu: Rural belt in central, west sees slower fall in Covid cases||CHENNAI: Over the past week, the number of cases reported from rural pockets of Coimbatore grew to 51 % while the daily Covid-19 caseload fell to 49 % in the city. While the drop in urban areas has been swift, the fall is slow in rural areas, particularly in and around Sulur and Thudiyalur in Coimbatore. Sulur town panchayat alone has been reporting about 100 cases daily, accounting for 10 % of the total cases in the district. Some of the rural pockets in Sulur threw up industrial clusters in May, due to the presence of small and micro industries. These later transformed into family clusters. "Now there are no specific clusters or hotspots,'' a health officer said. Coimbatore deputy director of health services Senthil Kumar said that more cases are coming up in rural because of increase in testing in rural areas. "We do focused testing which is effective and throws up more positives," he said, adding that cases are drastically reducing in rural areas too. The same trend could be seen in other western and central districts too where rural cases are higher. At present in Salem, more than 75% of cases are in rural areas. On Sunday for instance, out of the 517 fresh cases, about 350 were outside the city corporation limit. "However, the cases are spread across villages. There are no bulk cases from any one village," a health officer said. As of Sunday, Trichy district has 54 containment zones of which rural areas account for 48 containment zones while urban Trichy restricts its number to only six. Thiruverumbur block in Trichy rural continues to be on top with 12 containment zones followed by eight containment zones in Lalgudi block. Health department officials cited the movement of people to the urban areas from peri-urban Thiruverumbur for the high numbers. Deputy director of health services, Trichy, Dr S Ramganesh said that since the clusters don't have higher number of cases like previous months, they are going for micro containment. Health officials in Madurai said there are no clusters of Covid-19 in rural areas of Madurai as cases have dropped drastically. Out of the 11 districts in South Tamil Nadu, seven have reported less than 100 cases each while the rest are less than 200.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/tamil-nadu-rural-belt-in-central-west-sees-slower-fall-in-cases/articleshow/83705227.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Claims case: Official record prevails over private agency's opinion||Jai Prakash had four insurance policies from Tata AIG Life Insurance. On January 4, 2010, he came under a running train and died. When insurance claims were lodged, three were settled without any objection, while the fourth was rejected on the ground that death was not accidental, but it was a case of suicide, which was excluded under the policy. The insurer also alleged the previous policies were concealed while taking the fourth one. Jai Prakash's widow Kamla Devi and son Rajesh Bansal filed a consumer complaint. The Haryana State Commission noted all the four policies were taken through the same agent. It also observed the insurance company had the details of the previous policies. Hence, failure to disclose the previous policies would not render the claim invalid as laid down in an earlier SC ruling. Yet, it upheld the repudiation by relying on a medical opinion obtained by the insurer that death was due to suicide. Kamala Devi approached the National Commission, which observed the police had inspected the site and examined eyewitnesses, and an inquest had been carried out. The post-mortem report recorded it as an accidental death. The commission noted that the insurer was terming it a suicide merely on the basis of a medico-legal opinion from a private agency, and that too nearly a year after the incident. The commission also noted the insurer had not lodged a complaint before the judicial magistrate that a false case of accidental death had been recorded with the motive of making a wrongful gain. By its order of June 10, the National Commission held that when there is a conflict between the official record and the opinion of a private agency, the official record would prevail. It indicted the insurer for raising an objection only for one policy. It directed the insurer to settle the claim along with 9% interest and imposed punitive costs of Rs1 lakh.

---||India||Centralised free Covid-19 vaccination policy begins today||NEW DELHI: The centralised free vaccination policy began on Monday under which the government will provide free Covid-19 vaccine to all Indian citizens above 18 years of age.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the announcement in a televised address to the nation and said the central government would take over the nationwide vaccination drive, and the Centre would procure 75 per cent of vaccines and give them to states for free distribution to all citizens above the age of 18.  The Centre will also handle the 25 per cent vaccination that was with states till now under the liberalised plan announced earlier.  In a briefing on Friday, the health ministry had said states would be playing a facilitatory role by aggregating demand and vaccination capabilities of private hospitals in the state and ensure the administrations of vaccinations.  "There will be a systematic flow of vaccines to the private sector as well. I am hopeful that in this way, there will be a lot of energy in the participation of the private sector and vaccination sites will increase," Dr VK Paul, member, health of the Niti Aayog said. From June 21 (International Day of Yoga), the Centre will provide free vaccines to states," PM Modi said.  "Whether it is the poor, the lower middle class, the middle class, or the upper-middle class, under the central government programme, everyone will get free vaccines," the Prime Minister said.  Private hospitals will continue to buy the remaining 25 per cent and inoculate those willing to pay for their jabs. They can't, however, charge more than Rs 150 as a service charge per dose over the fixed price of the vaccine, the PM said.  The health minister had stated that the maximum price that can be charged per dose by private vaccine centres for the three vaccines currently available in the country - Rs 780 for Covishield, Rs 1,410 for Covaxin and Rs 1,145 for Sputnik V.  Before the Centre's takeover, it was the responsibility of state governments to procure and administer 50 per cent of the vaccines for citizens between the ages of 18 to 45. The Centre supplied free of cost vaccines to people aged 45 and above.  Chief Ministers of several states had urged the Centre to procure vaccines after manufacturers denied to supply directly. The shortage forced many vaccination centres across the country to shut down.  The Supreme Court had also slammed the Centre for the 'liberalised' vaccination policy for the 18-45 age group, calling it 'arbitrary and irrational'. The bench, headed by Justice DY Chandrachud, had asked the Centre about the Rs 35,000 crore earmarked for procuring vaccines in the Union Budget.  As per the union health ministry, as many as 27,66,93,572 doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered across the country so far, including 38,10,554 on Sunday.  As many as 5,42,21,110 citizens in the 18-44 age group and 14,42,38,142 0ver the age of 45 have received their first dose. 70,65,889 healthcare workers, 90,32,813 frontline workers, 12,27,088 between the age of 18-44, and 3,36,80,696 over the aged 45 and above are fully vaccinated.  As per a statement on Sunday, more than 29.10 crore (29,10,54,050) vaccine doses have been provided to States and union territories so far by the Centre through the Government of India (free of cost channel) and through direct state procurement.  More than 3.06 crore (3,06,34,638) Covid Vaccine doses are still available with the states/UTs to be administered, the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centralised-free-covid-19-vaccination-policy-begins-today/articleshow/83705234.cms||---

After a meeting convened to pass a resolution against Sasikala as per instructions from the AIADMK leadership, former minister and senior leader R Natham Viswanathan said neither cadres nor people of Tamil Nadu wanted her back in the party. “Cadres and the people will not accept Sasikala. So, why should we bear such a burden,” he told reporters. A meeting convened by him in Dindigul in south Tamil Nadu resolved that the AIADMK should expel cadres who had any association with Sasikala. “She tells cadres that a mother (Sasikala) and a child (cadres) cannot be separated. Sasikala is not a ‘thai’ (mother) but a pei (devil),” said Viswanathan. While AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami convened a meeting in Salem last week and passed a resolution, condemning Sasikala, party coordinator O Panneerselvam maintained a stoic silence in his Theni home turf. In many districts, however, the AIADMK closed ranks, terming Sasikala’s phone calls to party functionaries a `bizarre drama’ and described her kin as `parasites’. Partymen alleged that `one family’ was trying to take over the party. As party district after district passed pungent resolutions, criticising her attempts to take control of the party, Sasikala continued to bond with cadres. On Sunday, in a conversation with a cadre, she compared her situation to that of her friend J Jayalalithaa in 1987-88 when AIADMK founder M G Ramachandran died and the party split into two factions – one led by his protege Jayalalithaa and the other by his wife Janaki. “Many senior leaders in high posts hit out at her (Jayalalithaa) then,” Sasikala told a cadre from Tiruvarur. “Finally, it was Amma (Jayalalithaa), who came back to lead the party,” Sasikala said, adding, “Senior leaders are scared of an uprising among cadres in my favour.” The cadres and people wanted her back in the party and to lead it, she said. Meanwhile, the AIADMK’s Coimbatore unit led by party whip S P Velumani met on Sunday and passed resolutions, accusing Sasikala of sparking casteist feelings among the rank and file in a bid to create confusion among cadres. “The AIADMK will not surrender to the whims of one family. The party has no association with Sasikala,” the resolution said. AIADMK functionaries including former deputy speaker of Tamil Nadu assembly Pollachi V Jayaraman and party MLAs who participated in the meeting welcomed the high command’s decision to sack partymen who spoke to Sasikala over phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sasikala-is-a-burden-for-party-says-aiadmk/articleshow/83705323.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Everyone is vaccinated in this Shahdol village||BHOPAL: With 100% vaccination, Jamui village of Shahdol district has become the first panchayat in the state whose every citizen has got the jab. The village situated at a distance of 8 kilometres from Shahdol district headquarters has a population of around 3200, and out of it1855 are above18 years and everyone has been vaccinated! Officials say it was not easy to convince for the jab. “We had a very good response during the vaccination drive launched in April by the state government. A total of 65000 people were vaccinated in the district, thanks to awareness created by officials” district collector Shahdol Satyendra Singh told TOI. He said, “We had to dispel several rumours and apprehensions that became the main roadblock in rapid vaccination. As it is a tribal-dominated district, rumours spread like wild fire. Our teams visited each village. In Jamunia village, I can still recall that people started running away when we reached there. I told the locals that we have not come for vaccination but to know about the local problems, after which they were ready to get the jab”.. “We had first prepared a list of those above 45 years from the voters’ list and BLOs, besides officials going door to door to make people aware. In the next couple of days we will be announcing Budhar town also as 100% vaccinated because only 500 people are left in the town to be vaccinated so far. Then we started issuing pink certificates to beneficiaries after vaccination. These certificates are like the certificates downloaded from the cowin app. Our local police were instructed to ask for pink cards during their routine vehicle checking drives, and those who do not have it should be made aware of vaccine. People coming to the Shahdol town are also asked to show the card, as Shahdol town is nearly 85% vaccinated, those not having it are made aware of vaccination”, he said. The population of district is around 12 lakh and 7.41 lakh people are eligible for vaccination. Of these, we have vaccinated nearly 60% and are hopeful of vaccinating maximum people in the drive starting on Monday, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-everyone-is-vaccinated-in-this-shahdol-village/articleshow/83705464.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Another vaccination camp planned in Karnataka for those heading abroad||BENGALURU: The state government is organising another vaccination drive for students and professionals planning to go abroad for studies or work and for sportspersons headed to Tokyo for the Olympics. Deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan, who leads the state Covid-19 task force, said that the drive would start on Tuesday on the campus of the Bengaluru Central University near Mysore Bank circle. Jabs will be administered between 10.30am and 4.30pm. Dr Sanghamitra, deputy health officer (East Zone), has been appointed as the nodal official in BBMP limits for facilitating vaccination of the said categories of beneficiaries. The gap between two Covishield doses has been revised from 12-16 weeks to four weeks for the foreign-bound candidates. The reduced interval is in line with the guidelines of the ministry of health and family welfare, which said that students joining universities abroad, professionals flying out for work and Olympics participants could be administered the second dose after 28 days. This is the second such camp in the city. The first one was conducted at the same venue earlier this month, with around 1,500 people being jabbed. Delays in issuing vaccination certificates became a major concern after this round, leaving candidates anxious. Chief health officer K Vijendra said that technical issues had been fixed now. An officer has been also appointed to look into the issuance of certificates, and there won’t be any glitches hereafter, he added. For more details, eligible beneficiaries can contact Dr Sanghamitra on 9343793046, medical officer Dr Gayatri on 9591879025, and medical officer Dr Mohammed Aleef Ali on 9880037365.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/another-vaccination-camp-planned-in-karnataka-for-those-heading-abroad/articleshow/83705547.cms||---
---||Chennai||Gamer from hell: Dark, digital world of Madhan Manickam||CHENNAI: He calls girls prostitutes, idiots, good-for-nothing, and worse. Yet the ‘girls’ yearn to talk to him, meet him, go on drives with him, among other things. He posts photos of minor girls, all smiles and flashing victory signs. He openly talks of his erotic date with a Class IX girl in May 2017, and says how three years later when she met him again, he found her ‘big as a bull’. This is the dark and toxic digital universe that Madhan Manickam or ‘PUBG Madhan’ created in 2019 and ran unchallenged all this while, raking in lakhs of rupees and blighting the lives of countless children. He uses three YouTube channels to give expletive-laden tutorials on playing PUBG, even after the game was banned, that have attracted eight lakh followers, most of them pre and young teens. An unsuspecting girl who suggested that he avoid ‘bad words’ got an earful of filthy abuse. When a ‘follower’, a male this time, warned him of legal action and a cyber crime complaint, Madhan barked back, “do what you can. My money and my lawyers will take care.” A string of abuse follows. He boasts of his earnings and contacts, and says those complaining against him will be finished off. “You won’t even know what happened. One day your father will be gone. Your mother will be dead. Your sibling will be dead, too.” He also uploads the picture of a wrist with a bleeding cut, and says a ‘Madan fan cut his hand…try to suicide.” A child porn clip is claimed to have been sold for Rs 1,550. The child’s picture with the price tag is posted on his handle. There are also audio clips teaching how to transfer money from ‘dark accounts’ using fake SIM cards and digital payment accounts. There is a ‘donation’ provision, too. After a ‘superchat’ donation of Rs10,000, the son of a newly elected MLA says: “It is all over now. My Dad is an MLA (of a constituency in central Tamil Nadu) now. Power plus money is equal to heaven.” The ‘superchat’ of the Class X boy is promoted like a sponsored event, alongside a PubG game. Some popular television show anchors too appear on his channel and endorse his style. Vijay TV’s Makapa is seen saying, “nobody is straight in this world. All have bad habits. But you are doing it all in open forum. I am very happy I have connected with you.” In one post, Madhan livestreams his video calls to a woman alongside an ongoing PubG game, and offers to have her as his ‘third wife’. He calls her ‘muttaal’ (means fool in Tamil), and says, “I can have you as my third wife. It won’t be a marriage. All three of you will be my girlfriends.” (There is now a police theory that this ‘female voice’ is that of his wife Kiruthika, who is admin of the channel and who has now been arrested too). When Madhan’s bail plea came up for hearing before the Madras high court on Thursday, the prosecution needed to only pass on a sample audio clipping of his to the judge. The shell-shocked judge could not listen to the barrage of filth even for one minute. Of course, now that Madhan has been nabbed, the bail petition has become infructuous sparing some embarrassment for the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gamer-from-hell-dark-digital-world-of-madhan-manickam/articleshow/83705594.cms||A Subramani

Superintendent of police (SP) Khowai Kiren Kumar said the victims were identified as Zaid Hossain (30), Billal Mia (28) and Saiful Islam (18), all residents of bordering village of Sonamura in Sepahijala district. Police spotted the critically injured trio by the roadside and shifted them to a local hospital. They were later referred to Agartala Government Medical College for better treatment. They succumbed to their injuries on the way to medical college. Police have registered a case of mob lynching but yet to arrest anyone in this connection. Cops said, the villagers of Namanjoypara spotted a mini truck heading towards Agartala, carrying five cattle before sunrise. They chased it and stopped the vehicle near North Maharanipur village. When questioned the persons on the truck could not give satisfactory answers to the villagers, which aggravated the situation. Meanwhile in another incident, a Bangladeshi national succumbed to his injuries in North Tripura district hospital at Dharmanagar on Saturday. He was injured after falling down on a hard and blunt object when villagers of Shanicherra along the Indo-Bangladesh border chased him last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/three-cattle-lifters-lynched-to-death-in-tripura-village/articleshow/83705552.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

The severed head is yet to be traced. Three farmers have been booked in the murder case, of which two have been arrested, said the senior superintendent of police Satinder Singh. The victim has been identified as Sucha Singh (40), resident of Choti Badi Naggal village in Mullanpur. Those arrested are Satnam Singh resident of Parole village and Des Raj resident of Choti Badi Nagal village whereas Jagir Singh alias Ghora is at large, said superintendent of police, rural (SP) Ravot Kaur Grewal. The victim was married and is survived by a wife, an 18-year-old son, and two minor daughters. SP said Sucha was missing since June 12 and his missing report was registered at police station on June 14. According to her, the body was buried in a farmland and his feet, which were visible, weer spotted by some passersby who informed the police. The police exhumed the body only to find the head missing. The victim was identified from his clothes he was wearing and the body structure by the family members of the victim, said the police. The police said Sucha along with Satnam Singh, Des Raj and Jagir Singh alias Ghora, all small-time farmers went to have drinks on June 12. As Sucha owed some money to Jagir, they had an altercation after which all the three allegedly beheaded him with a sword and later buried his body in a vacant land near CM’s farmhouse in Siswan. Police have booked all the three under sections 302 and 201 0f the IPC at Mullanpur police station and the search for main accused Jagir in on. The arrested two will be produced in the court on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/headless-body-exhumed-near-punjab-cm-capt-amarinder-singhs-farmhouse/articleshow/83705573.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||22% of Karnataka’s population has taken at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine||BENGALURU: The state government has administered the first dose of Covid-19 vaccines to 22 per cent, or more than 1.5 crore, of Karnataka’s projected 6.7 crore population in 22 weeks. On Saturday, Karnataka entered the 23rd week of the vaccination drive, which has been punctuated by erratic supply and multiple policy changes. Of the 1.5 crore people, over 32.1 lakh (around 4.7 per cent of the population) have been fully inoculated. “Frequent changes in policy that led to the gap between two doses being revised a few times is the main reason for the number of people fully inoculated being low,” said a senior government official. More than 56 lakh people who received the first dose were covered after May 21, and it took the state 18 weeks to jab around 96 lakh citizens. The drive gained pace from May 22 after a huge dip in the three preceding weeks. But the numbers have dropped again, by 18 per cent, in the past week (June 12-18). So far, more than 1.8 crore vaccine doses — over 1.6 crore Covishield and 19 lakh Covaxin — have been given in the state. And, like in most states, more men have got the shot than women. Nearly 30 per cent, or 42.9 lakh, of the 1.5 crore people covered with the first dose are in Bengaluru Urban district alone. These include 37.6 lakh in BBMP limits. Nearly 8 lakh of the 42.9 lakh citizens have been fully inoculated as of 7am on Sunday. Realising that inoculation will be key in handling a potential third wave of Covid-19, the state government and BBMP have set ambitious targets, even though they have little or no control over vaccine production and supply timelines. While the civic body is looking at vaccinating 30 lakh people in June, the government, which wants to achieve 80 per cent coverage among targeted people in the 45-plus category, is hoping to jab most of the adult population by the year-end. “Lasika Mela will be launched on June 21. The special drive will include all groups and frontline warriors. We have a stock of 14 lakh doses and we have set a target to give 5 to 7 lakh jabs on Monday alone,” health minister K Sudhakar said on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/22-of-karnatakas-population-has-taken-at-least-one-dose/articleshow/83705674.cms||Chethan Kumar

The state had collected 1,159 samples from all districts between December 2020 and March 2021. They were referred to the Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine (InSTEM), Bengaluru, for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). Results of 554 samples available so far showed 66 were vaccine breakthrough cases. Among them, 55 (83%) were infected by delta variants despite vaccination. "This indicates that we need to watch this variant," said Dr P Ganeshkumar from the National institute of Epidemiology. Experts, however, say it is too early to come to any conclusion as the sample size was inadequate. Chennai-based infectious diseases expert Dr Subramanian Swaminathan said that four months is a long period during a pandemic as many things kept changing. "It is way too early to come to a definitive judgment with these numbers," he said. Public health expert Dr K Kolandaisamy too said it was early to draw any inference from it and there was no need to worry unless the results suggest change in preventive methods or treatments. The state needs to establish its own genome sequencing labs in at least three different places. Madurai Medical College, the state public health lab and King's Institute of Preventing Medicine in Chennai are potential locations for even future needs, he said. Another finding released by TN was that the delta variant was more among adolescents and adults (81%) compared to children (19%). Dr Balasubramanian of Kanchi Kamakoti Child Trust Hospital said, "With the older people getting vaccinated and more middle-aged people getting infected, the virus is looking for revenue from the other ages. So the percentage of children getting infected might be more but those requiring hospitalisation will be less than 5%, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tamil-nadu-12-of-fully-vaccinated-got-covid/articleshow/83705746.cms||Ram Sundaram

Performing Yoga shows the commitment of ITBP personnel because this area in Ladakh witnesses minus 30 degree Celsius during winter, which often leads to cracking gun barrels and other issues. The road to Galwan are also few, which means soilders have to survive in thin air while carrying all their equipments. With such a high terrain, soldiers often need time to acclimatise to their environment, or risk illness that can kill anyone in hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/itbp-performs-yoga-at-18000ft-icy-heights-of-ladakh/articleshow/83705707.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: High 1st weekend turnout in malls after ease in curbs||KOLKATA: The overcast skies and drizzle did not dampen the spirits. Nor did the absence of public transport prove a hurdle. In fact, mall operators said they were pleasantly surprised by the high turnout as people braved challenging conditions to shop and eat out during the first weekend after the facilities reopened following the restrictions were eased on Tuesday. “The footfall recorded this weekend was double that we had clocked in the first weekend last year (June 12-14, 2020). People are not only stepping in to purchase essentials, they are also checking out stuff and making impulse purchases that we didn’t see last year. On Sunday, Father’s Day, many came in with their parents for a treat,” said South City Mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree. At Quest, which had clocked very low footfalls for nearly a month after reopening post lockdown last June, the numbers have been pretty impressive this time round. “I don’t know if it is vaccination or a better understanding of how one should conduct oneself to minimise chances of being infected but people are a lot more confident. That finds reflection in the number of children that are coming in with parents, something that we did not witness last year. People are also behaving responsibly and don’t require to be told to wear masks or maintain distance,” Quest mall vice-president Sanjeev Mehra pointed out. While very few walked into the malls on Thursday after the heavy overnight showers that left many roads in the city waterlogged, the footfall bounced back on Friday. At City Centre, Friday was better than Saturday. And though the turnout on Sunday was higher, Ambuja Neotia group director Ramesh Pandey said the absence of public transport had been felt during the weekend. “Still, Friday and Saturday recorded a 100% increase in sales over Tuesday and three-times as much as we had clocked in the first weekend post opening last year,” he said. At Acropolis mall, it was the food and beverage section that was buzzing over the weekend. With seating restricted to 50% of capacity, there was a 30-45 minutes wait-time for customers to get a table in the afternoon. “The food court and fine dining restaurants witnessed more footfall than apparel and other stores. It is the F&B section that led to the mall clocking the second-highest footfall over the weekend,” said Acropolis mall general manager K Vijayan. With no public transport on the roads, the parking lot at the malls was busy. At South City that recorded the highest turnout this weekend, the car to footfall ratio was 1:10 against the pre-pandemic ratio of nearly 1:50.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-1st-weekend-turnout-in-malls-after-ease-in-curbs/articleshow/83697680.cms||Subhro Niyogi
