Non-wearing or wearing poor quality helmets is the main cause of death of nearly 78% of two-wheeler riders in India. According to the road transport ministry’s notification, manufacturing and sale of non-ISI marked helmets are illegal and according to the BIS Act, manufacturing, storing, selling or import of non-ISI helmets attract punishment with imprisonment of up to one year or a fine of Rs 1 lakh to 5 lakh. In 2019, out of the total 56,000 two-wheeler riders who were killed in road crashes, 43,600 were on account of not wearing helmets.  “If you are not wearing a standard helmet, it’s more harmful in case of a crash. Such helmets transmit the energy to the skull, don’t absorb it and hence injure the skull and the underline brain. Standard helmets absorb the energy and don’t allow such injuries,” said Dr Amit Gupta, professor of trauma surgery and critical care at AIIMS. He added wearing a non-standard helmet can be detrimental as in case of a crash the broken parts can actually cause more injuries to the brain. Not wearing a standard helmet attracts a penalty under the Motor Vehicle Act. Former DGP and chairman of Road Safety Authority in Telangana, T Krishna Prasad said the BIS should also put the list of products that have got the certification in public domain so that people are informed when buying these products and that the government should ensure their adequate availability. “The traffic police can challan those wearing non-standard helmets or any other plastic cap just to avoid a penalty. Since it’s an offence they should crack down on the sale of such helmets in the market. The larger aim is to save lives,” said Rajeev Kapur, president of Two-wheeler Helmet Manufacturers Association. Prasad said there should be zero tolerance against non-wearing of helmets and such offenders must be challenged. “The government should ensure that there is no black marketing of ISI-mark helmets in the market. One month time can be given to users to comply with the mandatory wearing of ISI-marked helmets considering that in several states helmet shops are not open because of lockdown,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/enforce-no-sale-use-of-non-isi-helmets-to-check-road-deaths-experts-urge-govt-agencies/articleshow/83244868.cms||Dipak K Dash

So good that Qatar’s left-back Abdelkarim Hassan — Asian Player of the Year for 2018 — walked up to the goalkeeper after the game and told him he should be playing at the highest level. “You should play in the Premier League. You are good enough. What are you doing here?” he asked. Gurpreet had foiled Abdelkarim so many times during the 90 minutes that everyone lost count. Some of the saves came from hand-shaking distance as the goalkeeper used his hands, and feet, to frustrate the hosts. This was not the first time. Against Qatar 18 months ago, at the same venue, Gurpreet had come up with another superlative performance that won India a memorable point. This time the Asian champions won 1-0, but had it not been for the goalkeeper, it could have so easily been worse, particularly since India were handicapped with the sending off of Rahul Bheke inside the first 18 minutes. Gurpreet’s performance against Qatar has put to rest debate on who is the best goalkeeper in the country, although given the terrific form of Amrinder Singh in the Indian Super League and Dheeraj Singh in the AFC Champions League, he is taking nothing for granted. “Personally, it’s great to have competition for the spot,” Gurpreet told TOI. “I know how it works because I have been in that position before. It took me five years to make my (international) debut. I know how difficult it is. When I was in Norway (with Stabaek FC), the guy who was playing in front of me was Ivory Coast’s second goalkeeper. He was playing there, and my job was to make his life difficult.” In training, it’s Amrinder who makes life difficult for the numero uno. The Mumbai City goalkeeper who won a rare double in the Indian Super League (ISL) last season and has now moved to ATK Mohun Bagan, remains a strong claimant for the lone spot in the team. “I love the competition, don’t want to be complacent. If I get picked to play, I will do it not because I did well against Qatar or the games before that. I will get picked only because of what I am doing right now on the pitch in training sessions. That goes for all the other players and keepers. “There are so many others who are pushing for that spot. There is Dheeraj who did so well in the ACL. It’s great to have that. That’s what I like about the national team right now. There are so many players fighting for the spot and there is so much competition,” said Gurpreet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/amrinder-dheeraj-keep-gurpreet-on-his-toes/articleshow/83245434.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Pakistan’s national security adviser Dr Moeed Yusuf said that the hasty withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan was not a good idea. “The United States has assured us that Pakistan will not be made a scapegoat amidst the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, but only time will tell whether they stay true to their word as history suggests otherwise,” Yusuf said, adding that it was too early to predict whether Washington will stick to its words. The NSA strongly denied that Pakistan had agreed to allow the US to use its airbases for counter-terrorism operation in Afghanistan. “It has been very clearly communicated to the Americans, so it’s not debatable,” he said. Other Pakistani officials, including foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, have also denied that any negotiation on military bases is being held with Washington. The controversy over the issue, however, refuses to die. Yusuf also stressed the need for bringing economic stability in Afghanistan, considering the fact that the country could not do so on its own. The US pullout from Afghanistan despite fighting raging across the country in the absence of any peace deal has raised serious concerns among the stakeholders about the future prospects of the country. The fears of a security vacuum have been growing because of the stalemate in the peace process. The peace dialogue between the Taliban insurgents and the Afghan government has made little progress since it started in September last year except for an understanding of the principles and procedures, which too was achieved after wrangling for months over minor issues. Politicians in Kabul believe that the American military withdrawal and the political division between leaders in the country has emboldened the Taliban in their hopes to take power by military means without much hindrance. Abdullah Abdullah, head of the Afghan High Council of National Reconciliation (HCNR), said on Thursday that the system will collapse if Afghan leaders do not forge a consensus on the issues of national importance. Afghanistan’s former vice-president, Mohammad Younus Qanooni, warned that the country would slip into a new crisis if government leaders do not come up with the necessary reforms to save the gains the nation has made in the past two decades. Although another round of intra-Afghan talks is scheduled to begin in the next couple of days, officials in Kabul and Islamabad don’t seem very hopeful about a breakthrough.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-scapegoating-us-amid-us-pullout-from-afghanistan-unacceptable/articleshow/83245439.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The administration quickly decided to eliminate the maneater. Ada Yasir Mir was attacked and taken away by the leopard when she was playing alone on Tuesday evening. According to locals, there were a few leopards on the prowl in the locality because there are nurseries of several government departments. Residents blamed wildlife officials for negligence as they had already informed them (the officials) about the movement of leopards in the area. Soon after the body was recovered, Budgam deputy commissioner Syed Shahbaz Mirza suspended the range officer of the wildlife department, Ompora, for dereliction of duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/leopard-mauls-4-year-old-girl-to-death-in-budgam/articleshow/83245667.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The incident created panic in the area but no one was reported injured. However, locals in the vicinity of 2km complained of breathing problems and irritation in eyes. The incident took place on Thursday at 10.22pm at Nobel Intermediates Pvt Ltd company. The fire brigade official said gas leakage caused due to a chemical reaction between sulfuric acid and benzyl acid in the plant. Fire brigade officials said after getting information they rushed at spot and controlled leakage by 11.24pm and brought situation under control. Later, MPCB officials visited the Nobel Intermediates Pvt Ltd company to find out reason behind gas leak incident. MPCB official S L Waghmare, "As per findings of our officials, we have served closure notice to the company as they were using a chemical which was not permitted."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/gas-leak-case-maharashtra-pollution-control-board-issues-closure-notice-to-badlapur-company/articleshow/83243039.cms||Pradeep Gupta

Authorities did not immediately release the name of the man killed in the shooting Thursday afternoon, but a woman who was in a longtime relationship with him identified him as Winston Boogie Smith Jr, a 32-year-old father of three.  The woman, Shelly Hopkins, said Smith, who was Black, had been harassed by police since he was in high school. She feared he had been killed when she heard about the shooting, then saw his vehicle on the news. While she was at the scene she got a call from the medical examiner's office confirming his death.  "We have a very big spiritual connection, and my intuition kicked in and I just had a feeling," Hopkins said. "I knew something wasn't right. ... I didn't want to believe it."  Authorities said Friday that members of the US Marshals Fugitive Task Force were trying to arrest Smith on a warrant for illegally carrying a firearm when he was shot. The Marshals Service said in a Thursday statement that Smith, who was in a parked car, didn't comply with law enforcement and "produced a handgun resulting in task force members firing upon the subject."  The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is leading the investigation, said Friday that two sheriff's deputies - one from Hennepin County and one from Ramsey County - were the officers who fired their weapons, striking Smith. The state investigators also said evidence indicates Smith fired his gun, saying a handgun and spent cartridge were found inside the car.  The US Marshals Service said task force members attempted life-saving measures, but Smith died at the scene.  State investigators said a 27-year-old woman who was a passenger in the vehicle was taken to a hospital and treated for injuries from glass debris.  The US Marshals Service does not allow body camera usage for officers on its North Star Fugitive Task Force, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said, and there is no squad camera footage of the shooting.  After Thursday's shooting, a small crowd gathered in the neighborhood, shouting expletives at police. Later in the night, people vandalized "numerous" buildings and stole from some, Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder said. A dumpster was burned and windows were smashed.  Nine people were arrested on possible charges including suspicion of riot, assault, arson and damage to property, police said.  On Friday, graffiti reading "Mpls still hates cops" and "No trial for them" marked the building next to the parking ramp where Smith was shot. A T-Mobile store and a pharmacy a few blocks down were boarded up and closed indefinitely after having their windows smashed.  The city has been on edge since the deaths of George Floyd, a Black man who died last year after he was pinned to the ground by Minneapolis officers, and Daunte Wright, a Black motorist who was fatally shot in April by an officer in the nearby suburb of Brooklyn Center.  Before the latest unrest, tensions in Minneapolis already had risen after crews early Thursday removed concrete barriers that blocked traffic at a Minneapolis intersection where a memorial to Floyd was assembled after his death. Crews also cleared artwork, flowers and other items from 38th Street and Chicago Avenue where Floyd was killed, informally known as George Floyd Square, but community activists quickly put up makeshift barriers.  Former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin has been convicted of murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death, and three other officers await trial on aiding and abetting charges. Former Brooklyn Center Officer Kim Potter is charged with manslaughter in Wright's death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/two-deputies-fired-at-man-killed-in-minneapolis-arrest-attempt/articleshow/83245904.cms||---
---||World||US CDC director urges teens to get vaccinated after hospitalizations rise||WASHINGTON: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director urged teenagers to get vaccinated, as new data from the agency's researchers showed one in three teenagers who were hospitalized due to Covid-19 early this year needed ICU admission. "I am deeply concerned by the numbers of hospitalized adolescents and saddened to see the number of adolescents who required treatment in intensive care units or mechanical ventilation," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement on Friday. The rate of hospitalization due to Covid-19 increased among adolescents aged 12 to 17 in April to 1.3 per 100,000 people from a lower rate in mid-March, the CDC said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Among 204 adolescents, who were hospitalized mainly for Covid-19 between Jan. 1 and March 31, 31.4% were admitted to an intensive care unit and about 5% required mechanical ventilation, the agency said. "Much of this suffering can be prevented," Walensky said. The CDC's latest data was based on a surveillance system of laboratory-confirmed Covid-19–associated hospitalizations in 99 counties across 14 states, covering approximately 10% of the US population. The data adds to previous information showing that hospitalizations due to severe Covid-19 occur in all age groups even though they occur more often in older adults. The CDC released the data as part of the United States' push to vaccinate teenagers with Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE's vaccine. The shot was authorized for use in 12 to 15-year-olds in May. Nearly 50% https://Covid.cdc.gov/Covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations of the US population, 12 years and older, has been fully vaccinated, according to the agency's data. The increased hospital admission rates in teens may be related partly to the circulation of more infectious variants of the coronavirus and a large number of children returning to schools, the agency said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-cdc-director-urges-teens-to-get-vaccinated-after-hospitalizations-rise/articleshow/83246019.cms||---

The United States is the worst-affected country with 596,434 deaths, followed by Brazil with 469,388, India with 340,702, Mexico with 228,362, Peru with 185,380 and Britain with 127,812. Here are the latest Covid related developments across the world:Fauci asks China to release medical records of Wuhan lab workersTop US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci on Friday called on China to release the medical records of nine people whose ailments might provide vital clues into whether Covid-19 first emerged as the result of a lab leak, the Financial Times reported on Thursday. The origin of the virus is hotly contested, with U.S. intelligence agencies still examining reports that researchers at a Chinese virology laboratory in Wuhan were seriously ill in 2019 a month before the first Covid-19 cases were reported. WHO warns of June-July Covax doses shortfallThe World Health Organization says a shortfall of 200 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines for the Covax programme for June and July could undermine the efficiency of the roll-out in poorer countries. Covax was set up to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, particularly to low-income countries, and has already delivered more than 80 million doses to 129 territories. But that is "about 200 million doses behind where we want to be", Bruce Aylward, the WHO's Covax frontman, told reporters in Geneva. So while wealthy countries had pledged to give some 150 million doses so far -- on top of the doses Covax procures with donated funds -- that would not resolve the problem. France welcoming back vaccinated touristsFrance says it will fully open its borders to EU residents from Wednesday, but vaccinated travellers from Britain and the US still need a negative Covid test. The relaxed rules will kick in Wednesday, offering a boost for France's tourism sector. Tourism will not be possible from countries wrestling with virus surges and variants, including India, South Africa and Brazil. People travelling to France from countries where the Covid-19 risk is rated "orange", such as Britain and the United States, will have to be vaccinated and show a recent negative test result, European affairs minister Clement Beaune said on Friday. Under new rules set to take effect from June 9, people coming from orange countries who have not been vaccinated will need to prove they have an imperative reason to travel to France - such a a legal case or child care - and will also have to show a recent negative Covid-19 test, Beaune said. US unemployment rate falls to 5.8% as recovery speeds upThe US economy added 559,000 jobs in May and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.8 per cent, as Covid-19 vaccines helped businesses reopen and rehire, in what President Joe Biden calls "great news", but disappoints analysts. "This is progress, historic progress" after "our worst crisis in 100 years," Biden said. "No other major economy in the world is going as fast." UK regulator approves Pfizer jab for 12 to 15-year-olds Britain's medicines regulator on Friday approved the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine for children aged 12 to 15. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said Friday that clinical trial data showed the vaccine was "safe and effective in this age group.'' The United States and the European Union also have approved the Pfizer vaccine for the 12-15 age group. The British government is aiming to give everyone over 18 at least one shot of vaccine by July 31 and has not yet decided whether to extend the vaccination campaign to younger people. It said it would act on a recommendation from its scientific advisory committee on immunization. US provides essential medical supplies to PakistanPakistan's foreign ministry says the US government has provided essential medical supplies to help Islamabad in dealing with the coronavirus situation. In a statement, the ministry thanked Washington for sending the much-needed Covid-19 supplies to Pakistan. The supplies, donated at Pakistan's request, include 685,000 KN-95 masks, 50,000 protective goggles, 250,000 diagnostic kits, and 1,000 pulse oximeters. Earlier, Washington provided 200 ventilators to Pakistan. Pakistan has a fragile health care system and is currently in the middle of the third wave of the pandemic. Pakistan has registered 928,588 confirmed cases and 21,105 deaths in the pandemic. Turkey's single-day coronavirus deaths below 100Turkey's single-day Covid-19 death toll has dropped below 100 for the first time in more than two months. The health ministry on Friday reported 94 deaths in the past 24 hours and 6,169 new Covid cases. Turkey announced this week an easing of its Covid-19 restrictions, including a relaxing of nighttime and weekend curfews, following a decline in the number of infections.

State forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya said the move would boost conservation efforts of big cats in the state. The National Committee of Conservation Assured Tiger Standards (CATS) recommended proposals for Kaziranga, Manas, Nameri and Orang tiger reserves for CATS accreditation on Wednesday. The CATS assessment has been conducted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in 27 tiger reserves in the first phase. “All four tiger reserves of Assam under Phase 1 have got CATS accreditation. Only seven proposals were recommended by the national committee at a meeting held in New Delhi on Wednesday. Besides four tiger reserves of Assam, Kanha, Panna and Sundarbans tiger reserves were awarded CAT accreditation,” an Asssan government statement said. The NTCA, which sets a benchmark for managing conservation sites through a set of minimum standards based on 17 parameters (F3 element wise) ranging from social, cultural and biological significance to infrastructure/equipment and from management planning to human-wildlife conflict (HCW) management, have given scores of 81.25% to Kaziranga, 78.49% to Manas, 71.21% to Nameri and 74.01% to Orang Tiger Reserve. Launched in 2013 with tigers as first species selected for the initiative, the conservation tool vis-a-vis CATS was developed in collaboration with field managers, tiger experts and government agencies engaged in tiger conservation. Forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya said the CAT accreditation accorded to the four tiger reserves of the state is a most welcome development and good news for conservationists and animal lovers alike. Thanking Union forest minister Prakash Javdekar and the members of the national committee for clearing all the four proposals from his department, Suklabaidya said, “The CATS certificate will go a long way in further strengthening and improving management interventions insofar as conservation of big cats in Assam is concerned.” CATS is an international coalition developed in response to the need for stringent conservation procedures for protection of big cats through a partnership between governments and conservation organizations. Under the accreditation system of CATS, tiger conservation areas provide evidence under seven pillars and 17 elements of critical management activity to demonstrate that they meet a range of criteria for effective conservation management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/4-assam-tiger-reserves-get-cats-accreditation/articleshow/83247400.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

With these hospitals left to stitch up deals with manufacturers directly, most that are not part of large pan-India corporate chains lack the wherewithal to arrange for procurement, transport and other logistics. As of end-April, there were around 5,000 private centres providing vaccines every day. Now, that number is down around 1,300 to 1,700 on most days; on Friday, for instance, 1,689 private vaccination centres were active, according to an analysis by TOI's Insight Group. Read AlsoMore infectious Delta variant behind 2nd wave, says studyThe Delta variant, which was first detected in India, is more infectious than the Alpha variant, first detected in the UK. “Our data indicates B.1.617.2 shows high transmissibility and surges without any increase in case fatality rate (CFR). We estimate the transmissibility to be as much as 50%In its affidavit in the Supreme Court justifying the "liberalised" vaccine policy, which envisaged a larger role for the private sector, the Centre had stated that setting aside 25% of vaccines for the private sector would facilitate better access and reduce the operational stress on government vaccination facilities from those who could afford to pay and would prefer to go to a private hospital. Yet, hundreds of private hospitals, especially small and medium ones even in India’s eight largest cities, have had to shut or drastically slow down vaccination due to non-availability of doses. They are too small to be able to deal directly with the manufacturers and place orders. Read AlsoCovid-19: US vaccine sharing with India may hinge on indemnity waiverThe ‘vaccine sharing’ initiative of the US, which will see the country giving 80 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to countries around the world, might put India in a piquant position. The Biden administration clarified that the US would ship out 25 million doses immediately.A comparison of the number of doses administered in private hospitals in the eight largest cities till May 30 shows that more than three-fourths of private vaccination centres had administered few or no doses since May 16. Only about 10% of the private centres had administered over 500 doses in this two-week period. Most of these were large hospitals, centres set up by corporate chain hospitals, and those set up in workplaces by private companies. It isn’t just smaller hospitals and nursing homes that have had to stop vaccinating. Among those who did little or no vaccination over this two-week period are big hospitals like HCG and SMS hospitals in Ahmedabad; BGS Gleneagles and Baptist Hospital in Bengaluru; Billroth, Kamakshi Memorial and Vijaya in Chennai; Spinal Injuries Centre, Jaipur Golden, Shriram Bharti and Holy Family in Delhi; Kamineni Health Services, Virinchi and Medicover in Hyderabad; Belle Vue Clinic and Peerless Hospital in Kolkata; Hiranandani and K J Somaiya hospitals in Mumbai; and the Aditya Birla Memorial Hospital and Aundh Institute of Medical Sciences in Pune. "We paid Rs 76 lakh on May 19 for 12,000 doses to SII. We were told the vials would be delivered by the end of May. Each time we follow up with the company, we are told that we will get our supply in due course of time. But no definite reason has been cited for the delay. We are confused," said Sudipta Mitra, CEO of Peerless Hospitals in Kolkata. In Delhi, Dr P K Bhardwaj of Saroj Hospital said things were fine as long as private hospitals were being provided doses by the government. But since May 1, after the liberalised vaccine policy kicked in, the hospital has not managed to get a fresh supply of vaccines. Dr Giridhar Gyani of the Association of Healthcare Providers of India (AHPI) said that it has brought together 850 small and medium hospitals to place an order for vaccines. "We are being told by the vaccine companies that the government has to approve the list of hospitals for us to be provided vaccines. I don’t understand why we need any government approval when the government has already said that we can procure directly from the companies. After much negotiation, SII and BB have agreed to provide us with vaccines, but it is not going to happen before middle or late June," said Dr Gyani. He added that AHPI has tied up with Vardhman Pharma, which has cold-chain facilities across the country, to store and deliver the vials to small and medium hospitals in smaller towns. While AHPI might be able to help a few hundred hospitals in Tier 1 and 2 cities access vaccines, Dr Gyani is clear that private hospitals and nursing homes in more rural areas will not be able to access the vaccines. "The government will have to take care of vaccination in rural areas as it is not possible for us to arrange for delivery to such areas," said Dr Gyani. There are indications that some of the bigger hospitals that have had to halt vaccination are beginning to access some supplies. But a month’s time has been lost and even the future holds no assurance of regular supplies for many of them, say private hospital officials.

---||World||Mexico to use US-donated vaccines along border||MEXICO CITY: Mexican officials said Friday they will use 1 million US doses of the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine to inoculate people along the border. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the vaccinations along Mexico's northern border with the United States is part of an effort to fully reopen border crossings, which are currently restricted to essential travel. ``There is going to be a special vaccination plan in the border communities of our country on the northern border, with the aim of getting border transportation back to normal,'' Lopez Obrador said. Mexican officials said they will have to obtain another 2 million doses of the one-shot vaccine _ which they might purchase from Johnson & Johnson to vaccinate the 3 million border residents between 18 and 40. Presumably, those over 40 will be covered by Mexico's regular nationwide campaign, which does not use Johnson & Johnson, although the shot has been approved for use in Mexico. On Thursday, an official said some might also be used at coastal resorts frequented by Americans, but that possibility was not included in the plan announced Friday. The announcement came on the same day that Mexico City announced the gradual lifting of a partial coronavirus lockdown that began more than a year ago. Lopez Obrador said US Vice President Kamala Harris told him the United States would send the vaccines, but did not specify when. Mexican cities on the border lag far behind their counterparts on the US side in vaccinating their populations. But goods and people move constantly across the border. It is not clear how plans to give priority to border areas would play in other parts of Mexico that have been much harder hit by the pandemic. Mexico has so far received 42.3 million doses of five different types of vaccines, not including Johnson & Johnson, and administered 32.8 million of those doses. That is still vastly insufficient for a country of 126 million. Mexico has suffered over 228,000 test-confirmed deaths related to COVID-19, but even government officials acknowledge Mexico's true pandemic death toll is far higher because many people have died at home or never got a test. A preliminary analysis of excess deaths suggests COVID-19 deaths now stand at over 350,000, giving Mexico one of the highest per capita rates in the world. In Mexico City, hospital occupancy rates and new cases have fallen low enough that capacity bans on venues like theaters, gyms and sports stadiums can now gradually be lifted. However, mask wearing will still be required in most indoor public spaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/mexico-to-use-us-donated-vaccines-along-border/articleshow/83247553.cms||---
---||World||Biden administration will restore key environmental protections||WASHINGTON: The administration of President Joe Biden on Friday announced it would restore protections under the Endangered Species Act, a law credited with saving iconic animals like the gray wolf and bald eagle, which were loosened by his predecessor Donald Trump. Conservation groups welcomed the move but said they were concerned about how long the reversal might take. "The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is committed to working with diverse federal, Tribal, state and industry partners to not only protect and recover America's imperiled wildlife but to ensure cornerstone laws like the Endangered Species Act are helping us meet 21st century challenges," said the agency's Martha Williams. The executive branch doesn't have the power to change an act of Congress, but under Trump the protections for plants and wildlife were tweaked in key ways. They included removing a rule that automatically conveys the same protections to threatened species and endangered species, and allowing information on economic impact to be gathered when making determinations on how wildlife is listed. The FWS now proposes to undo those changes, saying it would formulate new rules in the coming months. "We are grateful the Biden administration is moving to protect the most imperiled species by reversing the Trump-era rules, but time is of the essence," environmental law non-profit group Earthjustice said in response. "Each day that goes by is another day that puts our imperiled species and their habitats in danger."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-administration-will-restore-key-environmental-protections/articleshow/83248029.cms||---

The Naperville Police Department arrested Barry Lee Whelpley of Mounds View, Minnesota, on Wednesday for the 1972 slaying of Julie Ann Hanson. The retired welder, who was 27 at the time of the killing, has been charged with murder and was taken into custody in Minnesota, where he is awaiting extradition to Illinois. It wasn't clear whether he has an attorney.  The girl was reported missing July 8, 1972, after last being seen riding away from her home on a bicycle. Her body was discovered later that day in a field in Naperville. She had been stabbed 36 times and sexually assaulted, investigators said at the time.  No suspects were immediately identified and Naperville Police Chief Robert Marshall said through the years those suspects who were identified were "all eliminated through the exhaustive investigation of our detectives."  The breakthrough in the case came through technological advancements in DNA and genetic genealogy analysis, police said. From that came the scientific evidence that pointed to Whelpley, a 1964 graduate of Naperville High School who lived about a mile from the girl's house at the time of the killing.  "This horrific crime has haunted this family, this community and this department for 49 years," Marshall said. "The investigation and resulting charges were truly a team effort that spanned decades, and I could not be more proud of the determination and resourcefulness of our investigators, both past and present, who never gave up on Julie."  Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow said that detectives, who continued to work the case through the years, stayed in touch with the girl's family. Finally, they were able to "give them what they've been hoping for all these years," he said.  And at a the news conference, Marshall read a statement in which the family expressed its gratitude.  "As you might assume, it has been a long journey for our family,. We are forever grateful to all those who have worked on this case throughout the many years."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/minnesota-man-arrested-in-49-year-old-chicago-area-slaying/articleshow/83248154.cms||---

Twitter was still working in Africa's most populous country soon after Friday's statement, which triggered immediate criticism from rights groups and analysts about freedom of expression. The information ministry said the government had "suspended, indefinitely" Twitter in Nigeria two days after the social media giant deleted a remark on President Muhammadu Buhari's official account for breaking regulations. When asked about the decision, ministry special assistant Segun Adeyemi told AFP: "I can't answer technicalities... operations will be suspended indefinitely." The ministry also announced the suspension on its own Twitter account though it gave no details on when the decision would take effect. "The announcement made by the Nigerian Government that they have suspended Twitter's operations in Nigeria is deeply concerning," the company said in a statement. "We're investigating and will provide updates when we know more." Twitter had on Wednesday deleted a remark on Buhari's account for violating its rules, after he referred to the country's civil war in a warning about recent unrest in the southeast. The 78-year-old president, a former general, referred to those "misbehaving" in recent violence in the southeast, where officials blame separatists for attacks on police and election offices. Minister of Information Lai Mohammed on Wednesday accused Twitter of ignoring violent messages from a separatist leader and also referred to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's support for the #EndSARS protests last year in Nigeria against police brutality. Rights group Amnesty International called for Nigeria to immediately reverse the "unlawful suspension". "This is the height of muzzling the freedom of expression that can only happen in dictatorships," Bulama Bukarti, an analyst at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, said on Twitter after the announcement. "It will go down in history as one Buhari's biggest mistakes and PR disasters." Nigeria in 2019 had announced it would tighten regulations on social media to fight fake news and disinformation, but the proposal sparked concerns over freedom of expression. Several countries including China and Turkey have come under fire for putting restrictions on social media platforms like Twitter. Twitter in February condemned Myanmar's move to block access to its platform as part of a crackdown on social media, days after a coup that saw Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian leaders jailed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/nigeria-indefinitely-suspends-twitter/articleshow/83248236.cms||---

We estimate the transmissibility to be as much as 50% greater than B.1.1.7. Viral load of B.1.617.2 appears to be higher than B.1.1.7,” said their study in its conclusion. The scientists noted B.1.617.2 is capable of creating “very fast-rising outbreaks”, importantly with “vaccination breakthroughs” (infections after vaccination). “We would re-emphasise that prior infections, high seropositivity and partial vaccination are insufficient impediments to its spread, as seen in Delhi, and strong public health response will be needed globally for its containment,” the study said. The study was conducted by scientists from National Centre for Disease Control, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG) and others. For the study, samples from 10,427 adults were obtained of which 1,399 samples were from Delhi-based laboratories and offices in Phase 1 and 9,918 samples were obtained of which 1115 samples were from Delhi in Phase 2. On the origin of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in north India this year, the study noted that the outbreak in April in Delhi was preceded by outbreaks in Kerala, Maharashtra and Punjab. “While no Variants of Concern (VOC) was identified in Kerala in January 2021, the outbreak in Maharashtra has been related to B.1.617.1 and in Punjab to the introduction of B.1.1.7,” it said. So, the B.1.617 lineage of CoV-2 had been first reported from Maharashtra and later seen in other states such as Delhi, Gujarat, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. The scientists said the surge of SARS-CoV2 infections in Delhi was best explained by the introduction of a new highly transmissible VOC, B.1.617.2, with likely immune-evasion properties; insufficient neutralising immunity despite high seropositivity; and social behaviour that promoted transmission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/more-infectious-delta-variant-behind-2nd-wave-says-study/articleshow/83248080.cms||---
---||India||Case adjourned, team sent to get Mehul Choksi on way back||NEW DELHI: Mehul Choksi, the fugitive diamantaire accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank scam, has thwarted the prospect of immediate deportation to India, with a Dominican court adjourning the matter of his detention on Thursday. As the next date of hearing is yet to be fixed and the court proceedings are likely to take time, the long-range private executive jet India had chartered to bring Choksi back left the Caribbean island on Thursday. However, there are indications that four of the eight members of the Indian team, who were on the Qatar Executive Bombardier Global jet when it took off for Dominica on Thursday last week, are staying put to track proceedings in the court. The Dominican court has to adjudicate the duelling claims of the local police and Choksi about how he landed there. While the police have accused him of illegal entry on May 23, the alleged fraudster claims that he was abducted and brought there. The hearing was adjourned against the backdrop of what official sources termed a “shrewd campaign” by Choksi’s family and lawyers to enlist local opinion against his deportation. Opposition parties in Antigua and Barbuda, the Caribbean country where the absconding diamond trader had taken citizenship to avoid being prosecuted in India, launched a campaign against him being “snatched” and being taken to Dominica. In Dominica too, local media reported that people gathered outside the court to demand an investigation into how Choksi landed in their country. As per reports, Choksi’s brother Chetan is camping in Dominica amid allegations by Antigua and Barbuda PM Gaston Browne about payment of bribes to his opponents who have been campaigning against the alleged scamster’s deportation. However, senior official sources remain hopeful of Choksi’s return in view of the “documents” submitted by ED and CBI. A top official with an enforcement agency told TOI that they have submitted details of a non-bailable arrest warrant issued against Choksi by a special court in India as well as Interpol’s red corner notice pending against him to the Dominican court. Choksi has lived in Antigua and Barbuda with his wife since 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/case-adjourned-team-sent-to-get-mehul-choksi-on-way-back/articleshow/83248442.cms||Pradeep Thakur

EU headquarters said in a statement Friday that member countries will "be required to deny permission to land in, take off from or overfly their territories to any aircraft operated by Belarusian air carriers, including as a marketing carrier."  Belarus' international isolation has deepened since the May 23 incident, in which Belarusian flight controllers told the crew of a Ryanair jet of an alleged bomb threat. They also instructed them to land in Minsk, where journalist Raman Pratasevich was pulled off the plane by authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/eu-bans-overflight-of-its-territory-by-belarus-airlines/articleshow/83248704.cms||---
---||World||French 'paparazzi queen' detained in new Sarkozy probe twist||PARIS: One of the most powerful figures in the French paparazzi business and a journalist from Paris Match magazine were detained on Thursday over allegations of witness tampering, sources close to the case told AFP. Mimi Marchand, who runs the BestImage agency, was taken into custody for questioning in Nanterre, west of Paris, along with journalist Francois de Labarre. However de Labarre was released from custody without charge on Thursday evening, his lawyer told AFP. Marchand, known widely as "Mimi", works closely with a host of rich and powerful figures from the worlds of politics and entertainment, including President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte. She was detained and had her home searched on the orders of magistrates investigating alleged corruption by former president Nicolas Sarkozy, who has been accused of taking money from former Libyan dictator Moamer Kadhafi. Sarkozy denies the charges. Marchand and de Labarre were instrumental in organising an interview in November with one of the main witnesses against Sarkozy, Ziad Takieddine, in which he withdrew his allegations against the former head of state. Afterwards, speaking to French investigators, Takieddine changed his story again, retracting what he had told Paris Match and saying that his words had been "deformed". The investigative website Mediapart, which broke the news of Marchand and de Laberre's detention, said the pair were suspected of "underground negotiations with Mr Takieddine" in order to convince him to withdraw his allegations against Sarkozy. Under French law, this could be a criminal offence of witness tampering. Paris Match condemned the arrest of one of its journalists which it said was "contrary to all democratic principles". Reporters Without Borders chief Christophe Deloire tweeted that it was "obviously disporportionate" that five armed officers had banged on the door of a journalist in front of their small child and the arrest was part of a "deplorable legal process". Before retracting his claims in the Paris Match interview, Takieddine had always alleged that he delivered suitcases stuffed with five million euros ($6 million) in cash from Tripoli to Sarkozy's chief of staff in 2006 and 2007. The arrests on Thursday are the latest twists in years of extraordinary claims and investigations against pugnacious right-winger Sarkozy, who served one term in office from 2007-2012. Marchand, prized for her ability to organise favourable press coverage and photographs, has worked closely with Sarkozy's wife Carla Bruni in the past. Her lawyer declined to comment when contacted. In March, Sarkozy was found guilty of influence-peddling and handed a three-year prison sentence for attempting to influence a judge to obtain information in a separate case. Most of the sentence was suspended and he is appealing, meaning he is unlikely he go to jail, but he faces other charges including in the cash-from-Libya case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/french-paparazzi-queen-detained-in-new-sarkozy-probe-twist/articleshow/83248713.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: Rural India worst hit in 2nd wave, says report||NEW DELHI: Rural areas were worst hit by the second wave of Covid-19 compared to urban centres and India accounted for over half of daily global cases for six days in May due to surge in infections in rural districts, said the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in its ‘pandemic pointers’ released on Friday. As part of its new data compendium on overall environmental issues, released on the eve of the World Environment Day, the pointers show that 53% of new cases and 52% of deaths in the country last month were recorded in rural districts. “The Covid-19 pandemic has severely exposed India’s healthcare system. While the abysmal state of preparedness in urban India has been in the limelight, a more distressing scenario is emerging from the rural hinterland,” said the CSE in the new statistical report -- State of India’s Environment in Figures, 2021. Flagging the gaps in existing health infrastructure, it said, “The community health centres in rural India need 76% more doctors, 56% more radiographers and 35% more lab technicians.” Noting that India accounted for every other new Covid-19 case and every third death due to the infection recorded globally in the first 26 days of May, the report said, “What escaped everyone’s notice is that every second new case and death reported from India in May was from the rural districts. This means every fourth case reported in the world that month was from rural India.” Emphasising on the need to have enough data to take right policy decisions and make intervention on time to minimise the severity of crisis, CSE director general Sunita Narain said, “It is accepted today that one of the reasons we missed out on the virulence and speed of the second wave is because the model for predictions did not have adequate data on the immunity surveys on the populations.” Pointing to the load of biomedical waste the country is grappling with as a result of the pandemic, the report said there had been a 46% increase in Covid-19 biomedical waste between April and May 2021. “At the same time, treatment of this waste has dipped,” it said, noting that hospitals dealing with Covid-19 patients produced 2 lakh kg of biomedical waste per day in May which was roughly 33% of India’s non-Covid biomedical waste. Referring to available data, the report flagged a worrying picture, saying India managed to treat 88% of its biomedical waste in 2019 compared to almost 93% in 2017. “India still disposes 12% of its hospital waste without any treatment. Bihar and Karnataka fare the worst,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-rural-india-worst-hit-in-2nd-wave-says-report/articleshow/83248710.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||World||Pentagon not to allow pride flags to be flown on installations||WASHINGTON: The Pentagon said on Friday that it would not make an exception to allow US military installations to fly rainbow pride flags in June, keeping a policy set by former President Donald Trump that limited the type of flags that could be flown on bases.  Earlier this week, President Joe Biden said that nearly 1,500 of his federal agency appointees identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer, in a proclamation marking the start of Pride Month celebrating the LGBTQ community.  In July 2020, Trump's Pentagon issued a policy authorizing only certain flags on military installations and was seen as a way for then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper to issue a de facto ban on displaying the Confederate flag without specifically mentioning it.  "There won't be an exception made this month for the pride flag," Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.  He said that the decision was made because it could open the door for other challenges to the rule set in place in July.  "This is no way reflects any lack of respect or admiration for people that (are from) the LGBTQ+ community, the personnel in and out of uniform who serve in this department," Kelly added. "We are proud of them."  A 2015 RAND study found that 5.8 percent of service members identified as either lesbian, gay or bisexual.  On his first day in office, Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to protect LGBTQ people under all federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex. Biden also reversed a ban on transgender people openly enlisting and serving in the military.  The Biden White House also reversed an order issued by Trump's then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on flying the Pride flag and some US embassies, including in India and Australia, are highlighting their support for LGBTQ people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pentagon-not-to-allow-pride-flags-to-be-flown-on-installations/articleshow/83248776.cms||---

It provided another Rs 16,000 crore to SIDBI to meet the short- and medium-term credit requirements of micro, small and medium enterprises. The twin moves came along with an expansion of the loan restructuring window for loans taken by individuals and MSMEs, with the eligibility limit for debt doubled to Rs 50 crore. The latest measures announced by RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday came within a month of a separate facility being made available for the healthcare sector, with banks going ahead and offering loans to individuals. With several banks already flush with liquidity, large lenders may not need the refinance provided by the central bank for contact- intensive services. However, for lenders it is a signal that they should extend their loans here. “Announcement of on-tap liquidity facility of Rs 15,000 crore will ensure credit flow to the contact-intensive sectors and MSMEs including hotels, tourism, aviation, etc, which have been adversely impacted,” said S S Mallikarjuna Rao, MD & CEO, Punjab National Bank. Last month, RBI had said that banks could restructure loans up to Rs 25 crore advanced to individuals and small business. The restructuring would give the borrowers more time to repay without classifying them as defaulters thus ensuring continued support from the banking system. This limit has now been increased to Rs 50 crore. State Bank of India MD Ashwini Kumar Tewari said that since small businesses were able to avail of liquidity under the emergency line credit guarantee scheme last year, not many sought restructuring. He added that the second wave was also ebbing, which would reduce the pandemic’s economic impact. “Almost two-thirds of the CRISIL-rated mid-sized companies in the corporate sector now come under its ambit, compared with only half as per the previous threshold. Specifically, this will support companies with relatively weaker credit profiles. Three out of four companies eligible for restructuring have sub-investment category ratings, which indicates their relatively lower ability to manage liquidity shocks. Rescheduling of repayments under the scheme will help mitigate this,” said Subodh Rai, chief ratings officer, Crisil Ratings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-to-give-booster-shot-to-covid-hit-services-msmes/articleshow/83248852.cms||---
---||World||US lawmakers urge president Joe Biden to ensure equitable administration of vaccines around the world||WASHINGTON: Over 40 American lawmakers on Friday wrote to President Joe Biden, urging him to take all the necessary measures to ensure equitable administration of Covid-19 vaccines across the world.  The effort in this regard is led by two Indian-American lawmakers Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi along with Congressman Tom Malinowski. Other signatories include Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna.  In the letter, Members of Congress called on the White House to take five specific measures - from financial investments to diplomatic efforts - to achieve the goal of a rapid and equitable vaccination programme while mitigating Covid-19 globally.  The letter is being sent ahead of the G7 Summit and at a moment in which wealthy countries have administered more than 80 per cent of global vaccines while low-income countries have received just 0.3 per cent.  "We urge you to pursue additional steps to advance a bold, comprehensive strategy to vaccinate the world as quickly as possible," said the lawmakers.  "It is imperative that the United States act quickly and deploy every tool in our arsenal. Now is the time to build international cooperation and solidarity in ways we have never seen before, including using the full force of United States diplomacy, economic and commercial leadership, legal authorities, and membership in multilateral institutions. The fate of our own health and safety in the United States is inextricably connected to the wellbeing and protection of the most vulnerable among us worldwide," they wrote.  The lawmakers urged President Biden to ensure the immediate release of the 80 million doses of the vaccine which the government plans to share with the world, allocating the committed doses based on where surging numbers are greatest while also reassessing our stockpile of vaccines to release even more vaccines immediately to countries around the world.  They also urged Biden to invest an additional USD25 billion in the Build Back Better agenda to authorise the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to oversee the production of 8 billion mRNA vaccine doses; sufficient to vaccinate half the world and one of the quickest ways to increase the immediate supply of vaccines globally.  Additionally, account for and deploy towards production the remainder of the USD 16 million in American Rescue Plan funds allocated for COVID-19 vaccines.  Congressmen urged Biden to use all available tools of US influence, persuasion, diplomacy and legal authorities to facilitate the rapid and widespread transfer of technology and expansion of vaccine production, including directing the National Institutes of Health to participate in the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Covid-19 Technology Access Pool programme, and negotiating and securing vaccine licencing agreements with existing manufacturers to enable broad sharing of vaccine technology and industrial processes to scale up production.  They urged Biden to support a new issuance of Special Drawing Rights - a cost-free International Monetary Fund reserve asset - to help strengthen public-health budgets worldwide and provide low-income countries with resources to import medical supplies and carry out vaccination campaigns while guaranteeing support through the State Department, United States Agency for International Development, and the US membership at the WHO, UNICEF, and other agencies to help expand developing countries' technical capacities and health infrastructure to universally administer vaccines.  In the letter, the lawmakers urged Biden to convene a global vaccine summit with world leaders to spur cooperation and coordination in the development, production and distribution of vaccines; encouraging research transparency, open access, and global collaboration in engineering and manufacturing with a goal of accelerating universal vaccination.  "The world cannot wait. It is imperative that the United States act quickly and deploy every tool in our arsenal. Now is the time to build international cooperation and solidarity in ways we have never seen before, including using the full force of U.S. diplomacy, economic and commercial leadership, legal authorities, and membership in multilateral institutions," the Congressmen wrote in the letter.  The coronavirus has claimed over 3 million lives across the world so far, along more than 172 million confirmed infections, according to Johns Hopkins University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-lawmakers-urge-president-joe-biden-to-ensure-equitable-administration-of-vaccines-around-the-world/articleshow/83249025.cms||---

Corbevax is slated to be rolled out at a sub-Rs 500 pricing, not for one dose but both the doses, and may even be priced below Rs 400 for two doses. Biological E managing director Mahima Datla had hinted at this in an exclusive interview to TOI earlier, adding the pricing was yet to be finalised. Live updates: CoronavirusSII’s Covishield is priced at Rs 300 a dose for state governments and Rs 600 a dose for private hospitals, while the corresponding figures for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin are Rs 400 and Rs 1,200.

---||World||California draws 15 winners of $50,000 vaccine prizes||SACRAMENTO: California Gov. Gavin Newsom played gameshow host Friday in a drawing for 15 winners of $50,000 prizes for getting vaccinated against the coronavirus.  "If you're on the fence, if you're just a little bit hesitant or you just were unwilling in the past but all the sudden you think, 'Wait a sec, I could really use $50,000,' we're doing all of this to encourage that and to get you to think anew and hopefully act anew," Newsom said at the California State Lottery headquarters, where he was flanked by a machine used to randomly choose winners and a Wheel of Fortune-style colored wheel for show.  It was the first in a series of drawings for $16.5 million in prize money aimed at encouraging Californians to get their shots ahead of June 15, when the state plans to lift almost all virus-related restrictions. So far, 67% of eligible people 12 and older have received at least one dose of the vaccine. The state's goal is to fully vaccinate at least 75% of people.  Newsom announced the prize money last week, warning the state's vaccination rates were about to go off a cliff without an intervention. State officials said vaccine rates had dropped at the time by 18% from the week before.  In the week since Californians became eligible to win money, vaccinations were down 4% from the prior week, Newsom spokeswoman Erin Mellon said. One million vaccinations were given in the past week, she said.  Next week, another 15 people will win $50,000 and on June 15 there will be 10 grand prize winners who will get $1.5 million each - the largest of any vaccination prize in the country.  The winners will remain anonymous unless they give the state permission to share their names, and they have 96 hours to claim their prizes before the state draws alternate winners. The state will contact winners.  Additionally, the state has started providing $50 gift cards to people who get shots. More than 340,000 cards have been given out so far and the state plans to distribute 2 million, which are worth a total of $100 million.  Though vaccinations have slowed, California is among the leading states and already has surpassed Democratic President Joe Biden's goal of ensuring at least 70% of eligible adults have one shot by July 4.  Newsom acknowledged that with California's virus cases at record lows and the reopening looming it will be hard to convince the unvaccinated to finally get their shots.  "Moving from 70% of adults to 75% and beyond, that's stubborn, that's difficult work," he said.  State Sen. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and vaccine advocate, and Claudio Alvarado, a pediatric emergency nurse at UC Davis Medical Center, helped Newsom draw the first $50,000 winners. A machine spun numbered balls and individually dropped out the winning entries. The only information about the winners was what county they lived in.  Populous counties accounted for most of the winners - three each came from Los Angeles, San Diego and Santa Clara and two from San Francisco. Alameda, Orange, Mendocino and San Luis Obispo counties had one each.  More than 21 million people are eligible to win $50,000 prizes. The state assigned random numbers to each person then narrowed the list to 200 numbers. The first 50 were placed in the drawing, and the remaining 150 will be used to select next week's winners or replace any winner from Friday who doesn't claim the prize.  Anyone who has gotten at least one vaccine dose is eligible for the prizes, with a few exceptions including people who are incarcerated and those who work for the governor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-draws-15-winners-of-50000-vaccine-prizes/articleshow/83249523.cms||---

It is reassuring that we are steadily improving and intensifying the vaccine campaign and it will be intensified so much more in the days to come,” NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr VK Paul said. At least 43% of the 60-plus population in India has been covered with at least one dose and 37% of the population aged above 45 years covered with the first dose of the vaccines.   While India has overtaken the US in terms of absolute number of people given at least one shot, as a percentage of population, India’s 12.6% pales in comparison to the 50.6% achieved by the US so far. Also, the US has fully vaccinated 13.7 crore people while the number for India is 4.4 crore.

The Congress government said the decision had not been taken in the “right spirit”. The Amarinder Singh-led state government has been at the receiving end for diverting vaccine doses allocated by the Centre to private hospitals in the state and earning a profit. The government is alleged to have sold doses of Covaxin, procured for Rs 400, to private health facilities for Rs 1,060. Private hospitals then charged people Rs 1,560 a shot. According to the government, about 42,000 doses were allotted to private hospitals. Of these, it claimed, only 600 doses were administered to people in the age group of 18-44 years. The state government has directed private hospitals to return all vaccine doses available with them, while the doses that they have utilised are to be returned once they get direct supplies from manufacturers. The government will refund the amount deposited by the private hospitals in the vaccine fund. Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the instruction to provide one-time limited vaccine doses to private hospitals has been withdrawn on the directions of the chief minister. He said instructions have been issued to all civil surgeons not to make fresh allotments to private hospitals.  Sidhu said since the Punjab government was committed to providing all treatment services to Covid patients without discrimination at government hospitals, vaccines would also be free.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/under-fire-punjab-stops-sale-of-centre-allocated-vaccines/articleshow/83250280.cms||---

High-quality brown sugar is sold at around Rs3 crore/kg in the international market and over Rs 40 lakh per kg in the domestic market. NCB sources said the raids were conducted on a rented accommodation of one Sunny Kumar near Mauji Mala market at Khemnichak under Ramkrishna Nagar police station area on Thursday night, leading to the arrests. Apart from Sunny, the other two arrested were identified as Munna Ravidas and Raju Prasad. NCB Patna zonal director Kumar Manish said Sunny was the one of the main drug smugglers in Patna. He also said the amount of seized morphine is one of the biggest hauls seized by the NCB in the last few years. “He used to supply drugs in several localities of Patna. Youths from poor as well as well-to-do background were among his customers,” he said. The officer said the NCB was working on to bust the drug supply chain for more than two and a half months after which Sunny could be arrested. Manish said the NCB was continuously receiving complaints from several sources about rampant smuggling of drugs in several areas of Patna. “Sunny revealed that he was procuring the drugs from south Bihar. A couple of more high-level drug smugglers are involved in the racket. Separate raids are still continuing on the basis of information received from Sunny,” the director said. He said Munna and Raju worked for Sunny. “They used to make small packets and sell these to the customers in different locations on Sunny’s direction,” he said. Manish said Sunny and Munna are residents of road number one in Postal Park and Raju is a resident of Surya Path on Chandmari Road, all under Kankarbagh police station area. He said a case of drug smuggling has been registered with NCB while a separate case under the Arms Act has been lodged with Ramkrishna Nagar police station. Ramkrishna Nagar police station SHO Rajeshwar Prasad said they are investigating to know if the trio had any other criminal cases lodged against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-arrested-with-brown-sugar-arms/articleshow/83242944.cms||Debashish Karmakar

City SP (central) Vinay Tiwari said the party was thrown by a scribe named Harsh Gautam working for a local news channel on the occasion of his birthday. “Rest of the people, including girls, had reached the hotel to enjoy the party in which liquor was also arranged,” he said. Tiwari said they have been booked for violation of prohibition law, relevant sections of IPC and the Epidemic Diseases Act. Buddha Colony police station SHO Mohammad Kaiser Alam said other than Harsh, the others arrested persons have been identified as Vicky Kumar alias Vikash Kumar, Rashid, Manu Singh alias Siddhant, Bharat Kumar, Vivek Kumar, Nilesh Ranjan, Sandeep Kumar alias Sandeep Mukhiya and Tabussum Sheikh, Saumela Parween, Nandani Kumari and Jagriti Kumari. He said Tabassum is Harsh’s girlfriend while the rest three women are dancers. Alam said three half and two empty liquor bottles, a regular revolver along with its licence, 11 cellphones, 12 glasses and the press identity card of Harsh had been seized from the hotel which was sealed. “The revolver belongs to Manu, who is a contractor by profession and the son of a doctor named Nagendra Kumar Singh. Three rooms were booked in the hotel for the birthday party,” he said. Alam said the raid was conducted after receiving complaints about the liquor party. “One room was found vacant but four men and two women in each of the two rooms were found partying,” he said, adding that Vicky had arranged the liquor. The SHO also said Nilesh worked with an event management firm while Sandeep is the prime accused in an infamous gang rape case in which a girl was allegedly kidnapped from inside the GV Mall premises near Boring Road roundabout under S K Puri police station area of Patna in January last year. Alam said Harsh tried to pressurise the police that he was a journalist, but later gave up. He said even though the revolver was regular, it had been seized for verification. He said four out of the eight men and three out of the four women were found to be in an inebriated condition after breathalyser tests. He said Harsh is from Ram Nagri, Vicky from Ashiana Nagar, Rashid of Fazal Imam Complex on Fraser Road, Nilesh of Gardanibagh, Sandeep of Dulhin Bazaar, Saumela of Jaganpura in Ramkrishna Nagar in Patna, Manu of Marhaura in Saran, Bharat of Court Bazaar in Sitamarhi, Vivek of Ramgarhwa in East Champaran, Tabassum of Itarasi in Madhya Pradesh, Nandani of Tel Bigha in Gaya and Jagriti of Mairwan in Siwan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/4-women-among-12-held-at-liquor-party-in-a-hotel/articleshow/83243032.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Women to corner 50% share of nominated posts||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has started the exercise to fill nominated posts in the state. Having won the panchayat and municipal elections with a comfortable majority, the chief minister is now settling down to reward the rank and file with nominated posts. Having filled the nominated posts for all caste-based corporations, the chief minister has set his eye on general nominated posts. Each of these 70 corporations, trusts and other bodies will have 12 directors. Thus, they would accommodate 840 leaders, representing the 175 assembly constituencies. The chief minister had done the grassroots level exercise to accommodate these 840 leaders of the party and had marked 50 per cent posts for women, following norms of gender equality. The chief minister has already directed party MLAs and senior leaders to recommend four names from their assembly constituency to be nominated as directors for various corporations and bodies. Of these four, two posts will go to OCs, one to BCs and one to SC, ST and minorities. The four names from each assembly constituency would account for 700 posts, which would be filled based on population, duly following the 50 per cent quota for women in every category. The chief minister has kept the balance 140 posts to be filled at a later stage, after accommodating all castes. According to the arrangement by the chief minister, OCs would get 350 posts, followed by 175 for BCs, 108 for SCs, 28 for STs and 39 posts for minorities. Even among these posts, the chief minister has instructed party leaders and legislators to ensure 50 per cent posts are given to women in every category. “The nominated posts will be filled shortly giving due recognition to the party workers and the leaders from the grassroots. The chief minister is working on it and considering even minute details,” said a senior functionary of the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/women-to-corner-50-share-of-nominated-posts/articleshow/83242924.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Vadodara||Vaccine takers continue to decline in 18-44 age group||VADODARA: The downslide in the number of Covid-19 jabs taken by those in the 18 to 44 years age group in the city continued even on Friday. Against an availability of 20,000 vaccination slots only 11,008 people turned up. The steady decline in numbers has been witnessed after the city witnessed the highest vaccination on 19,081 vaccines on May 29. It has been more drastic since Wednesday. Officials said that at most session sites, vaccination was possible even if people decided to get registration just at the time when they get vaccinated. “This is as good as a walk in,” said an official. The total number of voters in the five assembly seats in the city is being taken as a benchmark for vaccination of adults across all different categories. Officials said that this could be around 14 lakh. Even if one were to add those who did not have a vote in the city, the number would not rise significantly. Sources said that some functionaries of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) have started suggesting that the civic body should start walk in vaccinations. An official said that while this may not have been formally announced, the situation was as good as walk in. The overall vaccination so far, however, is said to be satisfactory as officials believe that nearly half the adult population that is eligible for vaccination has taken at least one dose so far. Also, if a person has taken the first dose, he will take the second dose too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vaccine-takers-continue-to-decline-in-18-44-age-group/articleshow/83246183.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Panel against conducting Madhyamik, Higher Secondary this year||KOLKATA: The six-member expert panel appointed by the education department has unanimously agreed that it is neither advisable nor practical to conduct Madhyamik or Higher Secondary examinations, either in written format in classrooms or online at home, during the current Covid situation. But the members are yet to work out a solution on how to evaluate the students, particularly those in Class XII as there have been no class tests or appraisals in the past 18 months. Among the options is home assignment or a form of open book examination that students will be required to write and then send the answer scripts to their respective schools over post. While other boards — CBSE and CISCE — are working out an evaluation based on the performance in Class IX and X for those who are appearing in Class X boards and Class XI and XII for those appearing for Class XII boards, very few Madhyamik and HS schools have conducted online classes in the past year and nearly none of them has evaluated students. To overcome the challenge, one of the ideas being discussed by the panel is to provide a home assignment to Class XII students in which an integrated question paper or a set of smaller papers would be sent to students’ homes via post. Students will have to write the answers and send the papers back to the school or the address mentioned by post. “This, too, is an onerous task given that nearly 8.5 lakh students take the HS. But we have to think out of the box and come out with a workable solution by Saturday to then incorporate it in the report that is to be submitted to the education department. The latter is expected to then take a decision,” an education department source said. Speaking to TOI, panel members said there was no debate over conducting the exams in the current scenario. Though Covid cases are on the decline, they are still very high with nearly 10,000 getting infected in the state. As G K Dhali, professor at SSKM, had pointed out, 14,000 children had been affected in the first wave across Bengal and the numbers had soared to 21,000 in the second wave. “While there is no alternative to examinations, nothing is more important than life. While physical exams have been ruled out due to health concerns, online exams are not an option due to the digital divide. Some 21 lakh students from villages, towns and cities were to appear in the two board exams,” a panel member pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/panel-against-conducting-madhyamik-hs-this-year/articleshow/83244389.cms||Subhro Niyogi

It was around 2 am when the pregnant woman and her family members were looking for another vehicle after the autorickshaw carrying them went out of order midway to the hospital. The two constables Deepak Pandey and Jitendra Yadav, who were on routine patrolling, halted near the auto parked at the corner of the road, and stepped out of their patrolling jeep to inquire about the matter. Superintendent of police (crime) Ashutosh Mishra told TOI, “When the cops spotted the pregnant woman groaning in labour pain, it took them no time to understand the gravity of the situation. They immediately made the woman and her family members sit in their patrolling jeep and drove straight to the hospital in Kaudhiyara in trans-Yamuna area to ensure safe delivery.” The woman later gave birth to a baby boy. “Both the woman and the infant were doing well,” said doctors at the facility, adding, “Swift action by the policemen and timely arrival of the woman helped us in saving the lives of the woman as well as the infant.” Meanwhile, family members thanked the Pandey and Yadav for their help. Both the constables stayed on the hospital premises to ensure the well-being of the woman till she gave the birth to the baby. Tanu, wife of Neeraj Singh and resident of Geej Pahari (Bara) said, “We thanked the policemen on duty for offering us help at such a crucial time. If it weren’t for them, the situation would have been very difficult to manage.” Photographs of a cop carrying the baby in his arms was widely circulated online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cops-save-life-of-woman-in-labour-pain-take-her-to-hospital-in-middle-of-night/articleshow/83244162.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Panel moots specific role for jt collectors||Amaravati: A high-level committee chaired by the chief secretary has asked all departments to immediately ready the roadmap for delegation of powers to joint collectors in the districts. The committee observed that the absence of a clear mandate to joint collectors despite the allocation of departments is slowing down the pace of administration. The state government is creating a fourth joint collector post to oversee the housing project even as the existing three joint collector posts are not empowered with any specific job chart. Sources said that delegation of powers to joint collectors was not put in practice due to the reluctance of district collectors in many districts. The state government noticed that the district collectors were not allowing joint collectors to independently handle the subjects allocated to them resulting in the slow progress of works in many planned projects. “Many district collectors are allowing the JCs only to accompany them in meetings without giving them any specific role in administration. This is sheer waste of high-calibre human resources,” said a senior official. While the posts of both joint collector-I and II are filled with IAS officers, joint collector-III is filled with special deputy collectors. Interestingly, the newly created joint collector-IV post has been spared for young IAS officers. Chief secretary Dr Adityanath Das has written to all special chief secretaries and principal secretaries to take immediate measures to set things right by handing over specific responsibilities to joint collectors. “It has been observed that there is no clear delegation of powers to joint collectors even though departments were assigned to them,” said the chief secretary. He said that a clear description of powers and functions delegated to joint collectors shall bring in clarity and improve effectiveness in the day-to-day functioning of joint collectors. The state government is of the view that the role of the district officers should not become redundant even after delegation of powers to joint collectors. “As many departments have district officers in almost all districts, the delegation of powers and functions should not make the role of the district officer redundant, on the various governance channels at the district level, resulting in better service delivery,” said the chief secretary. He said that the high-level committee observed that delegation of powers to the joint collectors would no way undermine the powers and functions of the district collector as the powers of oversight and review would rest with the district collectors. The chief secretary advised special chief secretaries and principal secretaries to explore the issue and come up with a comprehensive list of powers and functions that could be handed over to the joint collectors. He has also asked the heads of departments (HoDs) to clearly earmark the role of district officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/panel-moots-specific-role-for-jt-collectors/articleshow/83242867.cms||Samdani MN

Officially, however, the weekly numbers released by the RBI pegged reserves at $598.2 billion as on May 28, which is also a record. India has seen an accretion of nearly $105 billon over the last year, with $5.3 billion added during the last week of May. Das said, with reserves at this level, the central bank has enough ammunition to meet possible challenges arising out of global spillovers. The governor was referring to the possibility of large capital movements if the US starts to normalise its monetary policy in the wake of economic recovery and inflation pressures. Forex reserves are closely watched by policymakers given that it had dropped to $5.8 billion in 1991 when India had a balance of payments crisis. In March, India had overtaken Russia as the country with the fourth-largest foreign exchange reserves, however, it has slipped to the fifth place again (see graphic). China, Japan and Switzerland continue to top the list of countries ranked by forex reserves. The RBI adds to its reserves by purchasing dollars from the market. India has come under pressure from the US for not allowing the currency to appreciate. However, unlike China and other Asian countries that prevent appreciation to keep their exports competitive, the RBI intervenes to prevent volatility. “Our forex operations are mainly driven by consideration of maintaining the stability of exchange rate, in which we have been quite successful,” said Das. “Emerging market economies have to build up their buffer and the RBI is no exception to that,” he added. India’s forex reserves ended FY21 at $579 billion, which indicates that the RBI has bought over $20 billion in nine weeks. The rate of accretion has been slightly slower than last year which saw $26 billion being added up to June 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/forex-kitty-hits-600bn-adds-105bn-in-fy21/articleshow/83246401.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Since then, we have seen only negative growth and this year was a blow. We do not expect business to come back to redeem even if the lockdown is lifted, especially after large corporations cut costs on business travel and the work from home concept is the new accepted norm. And imposition of Goods and Services Tax also created chaos,” its co-owner VP Harris said. Witco was started in 1951 by founder MPC Mohamed and was taken over by his sons — VP Nurdeen and VP Harris — after his demise. Witco announced the closure of 11 shops across Chennai, Trichy and Kozhikode. It had 30 employees. Driven by 70% of its business from premium luggage business for travel, he said that there was no hope “at the end of the tunnel as multiple countries have imposed travel restrictions”. Schoolbags, office bags and accessories consist of the rest 30% of business. “Unlike other retailers, we pay new rentals which are updated as per the market standards. After the first lockdown we got a 50% waiver on rent from a few owners, however we cannot expect the same again. We have also tried adopting online business, but we did not succeed as customers still prefer to check the luggage physically before placing an order,” Harris said.“We are happy to announce that we are under no debt to anyone. We have settled all employees with their gratuity payment, which was smooth with our tie up with LIC Gratuity Policy. Even among our suppliers, we had requested them to take back their last supplies which happened without any hiccups,” Harris said.C Venkat Subramanyam, founder and director of Veda Corporate Advisors, investment bankers, said, “Witco is a well respected brand. However, regional speciality retailers like them face scaling challenges. They have to compete with multiple players — both online and offline. With the major luggage brands opening and expanding their franchise stores, it has become difficult for speciality retailers. Between 2005 and 2010, there was a large availability of capital for their expansion, however, many retailers missed this opportunity and now face a hardship.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/travel-accessories-retailer-witco-pulls-down-shutters-after-70-yrs/articleshow/83244235.cms||Mamtha Asokan

The drug would not be sold directly to any individual against a doctor’s prescription, the department stated. To facilitate this, the health department has also listed out names and contact numbers of seven pharma company representatives that manufacture the drug and contact details of seven stockists with whom hospitals should get in touch. “The initiative to streamline the supply chain is a welcome move,” said internal medicine specialist Syamasis Bandyopadhyay, director medical services at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. For government hospitals, the drug will be supplied through its central medical stores. “We have been facing challenges in procuring this injection. But hopefully the supply will get better by coming week,” said Simmardeep Gill, COO CK Birla Hospitals CMRI. The hospital currently has three suspected patients whose specimen have been sent for confirmation.

The accused, who has been identified as Salman alias Arman, told police that he made the call as he “wanted” to go to jail. He is addicted to drugs and was sent to a juvenile correction home in 2018 in a murder case, they said.  The accused had called the PCR on Thursday around midnight. The number from which the call was received was immediately traced and shared with the district police unit, which then traced the accused. According to preliminary investigation, Salman was under the influence of drugs at the time of making the call.

---||Business||RBI remains concerned about crypto||MUMBAI: RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that the central bank has not changed its position about cryptocurrency and continues to harbour concerns. Das said that the RBI’s latest directive asking banks to ignore its 2018 circular cryptocurrency deals, was because lenders continued to cite the circular even after it was struck down by the Supreme Court. “There is no change in the RBI’s position. Our circular clarifies the position very well. The Supreme Court has set aside the RBI’s circular issued in 2018. To our surprise, some banks were still citing the circular in their correspondence with customers, therefore we had to set the record straight,” said Das. On the RBI’s position, Das said that the central bank has ‘major concerns’ around cryptocurrency and has communicated them to the government. When asked what the RBI’s advice for investors was, Das said “The central bank does not give any investment advice. It is for each investor to do his appraisal and due diligence, and take a very careful call,” he said. The RBI is among the few regulators worldwide who have taken early steps to study a central bank digital currency. Many central banks have expressed concern over the impact that cryptocurrency could have on the conduct of monetary policy. There are also fears that cryptocurrency could be used by criminals to bypass anti-money laundering laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-remains-concerned-about-crypto/articleshow/83246083.cms||---

As a result, the sensex on Friday closed 132 points lower at 52,100 with banking and financial services stocks mainly contributing to the day’s loss. According to Gaurav Dua of Sharekhan, the RBI reaffirmed its commitment to support economic growth as long as necessary while ensuring inflation remains within the 2-6% target range. “The moderation in real GDP estimate to 9.5% from 10.5% to factor in the impact of the second wave of pandemic is also in line with expectations. No wonder, the bond yields have not reacted materially,” Dua said. “With quarterly results and RBI policy behind us, the focus would shift to pace of unlocking and vaccination domestically and global cues.” In the government bond market, the benchmark 10-year yield closed at 6.02%, barely unchanged from its Thursday close. With nearly Rs 12,700-crore worth of bonds remaining unsold in the week’s auction, which was conducted on Thursday instead of on Friday due to the policy, the decisions were closely watched for any major move that could impact the government bond market. The central bank’s accommodative stance assured bond market players, dealers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-falls-marginally-10-year-yield-unchanged/articleshow/83246563.cms||---

Three children have already been jabbed. AIIMS-Patna superintendent Dr C M Singh said 102 registrations were done till Thursday and flow of children for the trial was satisfactory. “Parents are coming forward with their kids for the trial. I would still request more parents to let their children participate in the trial,” Dr Singh said. Of the 102 registered children, several were not allowed to participate in the trial as they had either tested Covid positive or were declared unfit by the paediatricians. The hospital administration has, however, refused to share details of such children, saying the information cannot be disclosed as the trials are still on. “In the first stage, we are vaccinating children between 12 and 18 years of age. Children in the age group of 6 to 12 years will be vaccinated in the second stage and those between two years and six years in the third stage. There is no plan to conduct trial on children below two years of age as of now,” Dr Singh said. He added there was no time constraint for the process as trial could be done in a flexible manner. “The target is to complete the trials on all three age groups within one-and-a-half month,” he added. Those interested to participate in the trial can get themselves registered on 9471408832 and Rs 1,000 is given to participants as travel allowance.

In case the hospital authorities are of the view that more screens are necessary to protect the “privacy of patients, they may make immediate arrangements for the same”, the court said The writ petition filed by Aam Aadmi Party convenor Rahul Mhambre stated that there are no proper screens per ward for convenience of patients when they are either examined or changed or cleaned or have to perform their daily ablutions. Mhambre also submitted that there is no facility of drinking water for relatives or caregivers in the waiting areas outside the wards in the super specialty block . The division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and S C Gupte also said, “It is in the interest of justice to make arrangements of water dispensers in the waiting areas outside the wards. The respondents/state may take immediate steps,” The high court has asked the government to file its reply to this petition. Advocate general Devidas Pangam stated that there are adequate screens per ward to take care of needs of patients in the super specialty block and also stated that hot drinking water is provided to patients admitted in the wards by the hospital itself.

The AAR concluded that the liaison office is liable to register under the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The supply of services by it will come within the ambit of this tax. The ruling points out that the liaison office connects business in India, with business partners in Dubai, which is nothing but a supply of services. “By connecting businesses in India, with business partners in Dubai, the applicant is actually arranging or facilitating the supply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more persons,” the AAR pointed out in its order. It further stated that as a liaison office the entity in Mumbai is acting on behalf of its head office. The website of the head office indicates that they accept fees for providing various kinds of services, which include credit rating services and creditworthiness background checks. This shows that DCCI is not a non-profit entity, hence the liaison office also cannot be treated as such, observed the AAR. The AAR also noted that it received consideration from its head office over and above the actual expenses incurred by it. Given these facts, the AAR held that the liaison office will have to register under GST regulations, its services will be treated as supply and will be subject to GST. The place of supply will be the location of the application (which is Maharashtra). Applicants impacted by a GST ruling can file an appeal. Further, while rulings do not set a judicial precedent, they do have a persuasive impact in assessing similar cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/liaison-office-has-to-pay-gst-aar/articleshow/83246138.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Her face was badly disfigured. Police said they have detained two persons on Friday for interrogation. The victim, identified as 17-year-old Pooja Kumar, was from village Madhavpur under Maniyari police station area in Muzaffarpur. Her body was recovered on June 1. It was later identified by her family members at the SKMCH on Thursday. She had gone out from her house at Madhavpur on May 31 evening. However, her father Shankar Rai lodged an FIR on June 2 against Sonu Kumar, Ranjeet Kumar, Deepak Kumar and Ganesh Kumar for kidnapping Pooja while she was on way to the market. Maniyari police station SHO Ajay Kumar Paswan said the girl’s nose and earlobes seemed to have been chopped off and her lower part of the face was disfigured. “There were several cut marks on her face. She was having an affair with one of the accused,” he said. When asked, Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant said they are not denying any angle in the murder case, including honour killing. “We are waiting for some concrete evidence for nailing the murderers. Police are quizzing two persons who were close to the girl as well as her family,” he said. “The way FIR was lodged two days after she went missing has raised several questions,” the SSP said. He said the postmortem report mentioned that the girl was killed by strangulation. “Nothing about rape has been mentioned in it yet. Several more things are yet to be cleared,” he said. The SSP said police would arrest the culprits soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/police-suspect-honour-killing-of-girl-in-muz/articleshow/83243085.cms||---

The Banaras Hindu University (BHU) and the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad have collaboratively sequenced genomes of coronavirus variants in Varanasi and adjoining areas. Their study reports at least seven major strains of coronavirus circulating in this region. The Multidisciplinary Research Unit, headed by Prof. Royana Singh at BHU, collected samples from Varanasi and areas around the city, mostly in April 2021. The team at CCMB sequenced these samples and found out that there were at least seven major variants circulating in the region. As many as 130 samples were sequenced in this study. “Among the Variants of Concern (VoC), the most predominant variant we found in our study was B.1.617. This variant was also reported to be one of the major drivers of the second Covid-19 wave in India,” said Prof Singh, who heads the Multidisciplinary Research Unit at BHU. “Just as in most of India, the B.1.617.2 variant aka Delta variant was the most common one in the samples we studied. They were found among 36% of the total samples. Other VoCs such as the B.1.351, detected in South Africa for the first time, was also found in this area,” said Dr Rakesh Mishra, advisor, CCMB. “This study confirms yet again that the Delta variant is the most widespread coronavirus variant in the country right now. But at the same time, it is imperative for us to keep an eye on the other emerging variants in the country to prevent another unprecedented surge of cases,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/delta-predominant-coronavirus-variant-in-region/articleshow/83244076.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar Education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary: 1.25 lakh school teachers to be appointed in two-three months||PATNA: A day after the Patna high court cleared decks for appointment of 1.25 lakh schoolteachers, the state government on Friday geared up for the hiring process which had been pending for over two years. Education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary said a fresh advertisement inviting applications from those eligible physically challenged candidates who could not apply earlier for some reasons earlier would be published in a day or two. “The submission of applications both in online and offline mode would start on June 9 as the state is having a lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic till June 8 and candidates residing in rural areas would prefer to submit their applications offline. Candidates will be given at least 15 days’ time to apply after which the compilation of all forms received by the due date will start,” the minister added. Chaudhary said the merit list of candidates for appointment of 94,000 teachers in elementary schools and 30,000 teachers in secondary and higher secondary schools of the state in the sixth phase would be prepared within a week of the receipt of applications from the eligible candidates. “After the publication of the provisional merit list, candidates would be given about a week’s time for submission of their objections, if any. All the appointments of teachers under different categories would be finalised in a transparent manner within two to three months if all goes well,” the minister said. Chaudhary said the government was very much seized with the problem of teachers’ appointment in schools. “In fact, the appointment was withheld for the last two years owing to the litigation, causing irreparable loss to both the students and the eligible candidates awaiting their appointment. As soon as the appointment of teachers in the sixth phase is completed, the vacancies available in the seventh phase would be assessed and advertised immediately. Necessary steps would be taken to complete even the seventh phase appointments soon with a view to ensuring regular teaching in schools,” Chaudhary added. The high court had stayed the preparation of merit list for appointment of teachers on July 24 last year on the ground that physically challenged candidates were not being given reservation as per law. The government tried to make a special mention in the court for vacating the stay with the plea that it was agreed to act strictly as per law on several occasions, but it got a success only on Thursday when a division bench heard the case and decided to vacate the stay on the recruitment process. Details of vacancies to be available on June 9: The state education department on Friday issued a notification, saying the details of unit wise, category wise and subject wise vacancies for physically challenged candidates will be published on district NIC websites on June 9. Candidates will be able to submit their filled-in applications from June 11 to 25, the notification added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/edu-min-1-25l-schoolteachers-to-be-appointed-in-2-3-months/articleshow/83242889.cms||B K Mishra

As a result, owners of salons, wedding bands, furniture shops and hardware stores continue to suffer losses. Mohammed Shayan, who owns a hardware store on Ashiyana Road, said he made the first sale on Thursday after the reopening. “Our future seems uncertain. My store is on the main road and I have to pay a big amount as rent. The landlord doesn’t spare me despite the pandemic and resultant losses that I have been suffering.” Shravan Kumar, who has an electrical store at S K Puri, said, “Customers come in small numbers after 1pm and we have to down shutters at 2pm. An average shop in the city has to pay more than Rs 1.5 lakh per month for different bills and rent. It’s impossible to recover our losses anytime soon.” Faizal Ansari, a resident of Indirapuri, said, “The extension of business hours for shops is a good move. We were finding it difficult to buy goods when shops were being closed at 10am. However, I personally prefer not to leave home unless necessary.” Sanjeev Kumar, a trader, said the footfall of customers at his supermarket has reduced drastically. “We are, however, receiving home delivery orders,” he added Anil Kumar Singh, chief financial officer at another supermarket, said, “Maintaining social distancing has become easier now as people are taking precautions.” Mukesh Kayasth, accountant at a salon chain in Patna, said, “It has been two days since the salons opened, but the response is still poor. We have not been able to clear outstanding salaries of our employees.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-days-on-shops-continue-to-record-minimal-footfall/articleshow/83242808.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Widowed by Covid and haunted by kids’ safety||MUMBAI: As dusk creeps into the chaotic bylanes of Dharavi, Shabana Pathan feels a knot in the pit of her stomach. It’s time to hunt for night’s lodging for herself and her 11-year-old daughter, Mahenoor. Pathan’s husband, Rafiq, would make just enough money to keep a roof over their heads. With Rafiq succumbing to Covid-19, Pathan's world came crashing. Homeless and penniless, the duo has taken to staying with acquaintances during the day and sleeping in dargahs or at railway stations at night. Mahenoor has had to drop out of school and Pathan fears for her safety. Covid widows, especially those from impoverished backgrounds, are a neglected dimension of the crisis. Already suffering economic hardships and discrimination, the tribulations of these women have been aggravated by the death of the breadwinner. The impact will be seen on families across the country, warn experts, pointing out the government must take cognisance of their plight. “Many of these families were just about entering the lower middle class with the men working as drivers or handymen, earning about Rs 20,000-30,000 a month. With their deaths, income has dropped to zero. Such families will be pushed back into poverty,” said Neeraj Hatekar, professor of econometrics at the Mumbai University. In some instances, reverse migration has been triggered. “After my husband’s death, I have to single-handedly look after our six daughters and my in-laws,” says Worli resident Jyoti Shinde. Her husband, Amar, worked as a guard and caught the infection from members of a society where he was employed. After losing her job in the pandemic, Shinde is struggling to put food on the table. She plans to return to her hometown in Aurangabad. “Migrants going back home will be dependent on their extended families who are already living hand to mouth,” said Hatekar. “Some families would have borrowed heavily to pay for Covid treatment. Now, the widows are left with the burden of debt.” Probably the most serious outcome, though, would be vulnerability to trafficking and juvenile delinquency. Sabila Khatoon, a Covid widow from Dharavi, worries constantly about her four teenage daughters who are forced to work as house help or shop employees to support the family. Sabila says she will have to get them married off soon. Civil society organisations have been doing their bit. “We have identified around 20 widows like Khatoon and have been supporting them with food and essentials through the past few months. Many of them have no documentation or bank accounts and we are getting it done to organise financial assistance for them,” said Aditi Mahajan, Program Lead, of the non-profit Enrich Lives Foundation. A few corporate employees, too, have come together to launch a portal, covidwidows.in, which has 4,500 volunteers across the globe, trying to help women in speech training and skill development. For Naseema Khatoon, who has to look after seven children, skill development is crucial to find employment. Naseema, a frail 29-year-old, is a dropout. “My husband, Sajid, was a small entrepreneur. But he had to shut shop during lockdown and we ended up spending every rupee on survival. I was eight months pregnant when he died of Covid,” she said. "After Sajid's death, we supported Naseema with ration, baby food and clothes. But our goal is to make her self-reliant,” said Mahajan. The state government has initiated the process for releasing a combined pension for April-May for deprived citizens, including widows, senior citizens, orphans and differently abled, in view of the pandemic. “But the question is whether the relief is actually reaching the widows and is the amount enough? The pandemic has exposed the lack of social protection. The government must provide unemployment insurance, ration and direct cash transfers to these women, else there will only be an increase in hunger, vulnerability to trafficking and inability to educate their children,” said Dr Samya Shinde, assistant professor, department of sociology, L S Raheja College of Arts and Commerce. India is one of the worst affected countries from the pandemic and reported 3.4 lakh deaths till the first week of June. The government has not published sex-disaggregated data on deaths due to Covid after May 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/widowed-by-covid-and-haunted-by-kids-safety/articleshow/83249336.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Delhi||Delhi ready to fight 37,000 Covid cases: CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Delhi government will establish two genome sequencing centres as it prepares to face a possible resurgence in Covid-19 infection even as the current wave is waning. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday that the state government was readying to manage at least 37,000 daily Covid cases. Disclosing details of the meetings he had with two committees on Friday, one comprising experts and the other the Covid preparation panel, Kejriwal said, “The discussions concluded that we should prepare for a peak of 37,000 cases per day. Even if this figure is breached, we will be prepared to handle more cases. We are making calculations about the number of beds, ICU beds, paediatric beds needed, oxygen and medicines required.” At its peak, the current wave caused 28,000 cases in a single day. The genome sequencing labs are being created at Lok Nayak Hospital and Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in Vasant Kunj. “We should know which variant comes to Delhi, whether it is the old ones or a newly emerged one. We can then ask the experts about the precautions to be taken,” said Kejriwal. A separate paediatric task force has set up to decide how many oxygen and ICU beds should be reserved for children Stung by the oxygen crisis recently, Delhi government has made ample preparations to prevent a scarcity of the gas during the expected new wave. “A storage capacity of 420 tonnes of oxygen is being readied. We’ve had talks and asked Indraprastha Gas Limited to prepare a 1.5-tonne oxygen production plant. They said it will take them 18 months to do this,” said Kejriwal. Within two months Kejriwal hoped to have completed the task of buying 25 oxygen tankers and putting up 64 small oxygen plants. “Now that we have decided 37,000 as the peak daily caseload, then the number of oxygen beds, ICU beds will be decided accordingly and based on that, the number of oxygen cylinders required daily. We need to know how many more cylinders we need after having garnered 9,700 so far and how many more oxygen concentrators we need to procure in the next 1-2 months,” the CM said. A team of doctors and experts will be set up to analyse the efficacy of medicines. “The experts will examine medicines in demand and inform us whether a particular medicine is beneficial in treating Covid. If the doctors approve, the government will procure that medicine. If not, we will make the public aware of it and ask them to stop running after the medicine,” the CM stated. ICU beds have been increased from 1,830 in April to 3,100 in June, while hospital manpower has gone up with the engaging of 610 doctors, 628 nurses and 162 paramedics. For improving accessibility to doctors in all hospitals, Delhi government will introduce a one-year internship in Delhi hospitals for graduating medical students after which they can immediately begin as senior residents. The government will also train all non-ICU medical personnel in oxygen therapy, ICU management, paediatric healthcare, Covid care, etc., by developing about 500 master trainers in these critical areas. MBBS and BDS students will be oriented for tele-consultations and non-clinical activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-ready-to-fight-37k-covid-cases-cm/articleshow/83268116.cms||AlokKNMishra

He was en route to his assembly constituency Hasanpur in Samastipur district. “Swasth vibhag bhi Nitish Kumar ki tarah hin hawa hawai hai,” he said, adding that the state government has failed on all fronts, including in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic. Expressing his displeasure over filth and garbage scattered all around the hospital premises, the former state health minister said the situation was grim and people were left to fend for themselves. He pointed out the lack of facilities for patients undergoing treatment in the emergency ward and the gynaecology ward at the hospital. Even oxygen cylinders were not available there, he said. When contacted, Vaishali civil surgeon Dr I D Ranjan said the hospital authority had no prior information about the visit of the RJD leader. Moreover, the civil surgeon’s office opens at 10.30am whereas he reached the hospital before 10am. He also rubbished Tej's allegation about filth and garbage littered around the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tej-pratap-visits-vaishali-hospital-flays-poor-facility/articleshow/83242835.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||SDG India Index: RJD, Congress blame govt for poor performance of Bihar||PATNA: The opposition RJD and Congress lashed out at the Nitish Kumar government over the state’s poor performance in NITI Aayog’s SDG India Index, the report of which was made public on Thursday. Bihar stood third from the bottom with a score of 52 points, followed by Jharkhand (56) and Assam (57). The index evaluates the performance of states and union territories on social, economic and environmental criteria. Taking a swipe at CM Nitish for the state’s poor performance for the third time, RJD chief Lalu Prasad tweeted, “Badhai ho! Aakhir 16 varsho ki vinash karak mehnat se Bihar ko niche se top kara diya.” Lalu’s younger son and leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, also didn’t miss the opportunity to attack the “double-engine government”. In a tweet, Tejashwi said Bihar that gave 39 seats out of the 40 in the general election, performed worst in the rankings. On the other hand, Kerala, which rejected the BJP, managed to retain its top position. Sarcastically congratulating Nitish, Tejashwi said, “The onus lies on the driver of the double-engine government for the worst performance. This is the reality of the development during the 16-year NDA rule in the state.” He, however, blamed the greed for power, unforesighted policies, wrong decisions and lack of able leadership for the situation. “It indicates that the development has been done in the state on papers only,” he alleged. Congress also took a dig at the state government over the report. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said, “It’s a matter of investigation as to why the state failed to perform better despite a budgetary allocation of over Rs2 lakh crore per annum.” He demanded from CM Nitish to make things clear and present a real picture of the state's development before the people. “The index report has proved hollow the NDA government’s tall claims about the state’s development,” Mishra added. He blamed the CM and his cabinet colleagues for the poor performance. However, national general secretary of BJP’s OBC cell and spokesperson Nikhil Anand defended the NDA government in the state. He said, “The NDA government took several initiatives towards social justice. For example, the government reserved 20% seats for extremely backward classes and 50% for women in 3-tier panchayati raj institutions. Similarly, 35% seats were reserved for women in government jobs. Recently, the government announced to reserve over 33% seats for women in government medical and engineering colleges, he pointed out. Nikhil lambasted the RJD for making hollow promises to people belonging to reserved category and seeking votes in the name of social justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sdg-india-index-rjd-congress-blame-govt-for-poor-performance-of-bihar/articleshow/83243134.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||3rd wave apprehension: PICUs being readied, says health minister||PATNA: Health minister Mangal Pandey on Friday said paediatric intensive care, neonatal intensive care and special newborn care units across the medical colleges and hospitals were being made ready, keeping in mind the third wave of Covid-19 and prediction that children will be affected more. His announcement came on a day when a suspected multisystem inflammatory syndrome case (MIS-C) was reported from IGIMS. IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal told the media that a child admitted on May 22 with problems in breathing had tested negative in his RT-PCR report. However, his blood report the next day indicated deranged kidney and liver function. Before IGIMS, the child was undergoing treatment at Chhapra, where also his Covid-19 report was negative. “This was not a normal case. We isolated the child and a team of doctors from nephrology, gastroenterology and critical care department started his treatment. He is better now. Earlier, he was on 16-litre oxygen support and now he is on four-litre oxygen support,” said Dr Manish. He added that they were treating the child as a suspected MIS-C case. Noted paediatrician Dr Nigam Prakash Narain had told TOI previous week that he had got two cases of MIS-C — one of a 10-year-old boy from Khagaria and another an 11 months old baby from Patna. Paediatricians have cautioned parents to remain on guard for at least two to eight weeks after children or anyone in their families recover from Covid-19 as MIS-C takes time to develop. They have also suggested to go for antibody test, as MIS-C takes time to develop and by that time Covid-19 report is negative. As per centres for disease control and prevention, in MIS-C, different body parts like the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs can become inflamed. Children with MIS-C may have fever and various other symptoms, including abdominal (gut) pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes or feeling extra tired. Large number of MIS-C cases have been reported among children in Delhi-NCR and health experts feel such cases will crop up in Bihar too. Noted paediatrician Dr Arun Shah had advised immediate sensitisation of parents and healthcare workers regarding MIS-C.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3rd-wave-apprehension-picus-being-readied-says-health-minister/articleshow/83242865.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The university will start counselling the successful candidates in arts, science and commerce streams once the classes resume following lifting of Covid induced lockdown. The university has initiated its research work project as per the UGC guidelines for the first time since its creation in March 2018. According to PPU media in-charge B K Manglam, the university had held pre-PhD test on April 11, in which 4674 candidates had appeared. “The university had loaded answersheets on its website on April 14 to maintain transparency and facilitate the candidates compare their answers,” he said. Acting VC Prof Surendra Pratap Singh had set up a five-member committee to look into the pre-PhD test result process based on the state government reservation roster and guidelines. “More than 2000 candidates qualified the pre-PhD test this time, while equal number of Net/Slet/Bet/JRF/CSIR qualified candidates also applied in different streams to pursue their research with the PPU,” he said. According to PPU registrar Jitendra Kumar, the university has also started the process of appointing guest faculty in each stream. “The university is likely to appoint 462 guest faculties as per the state government guidelines. The university, which is facing faculty crunch in all major subjects following superannuation of most of the teachers, will thus send guest lecturers to all those departments of the constituent colleges, where number of teachers is almost negligible,” he said, adding the process to appoint guest faculty will be completed before beginning of the new academic session from July. PPU examination controller Mahesh Mandal said the university has revised its examination calendar due to Covid-19 and closure of the university and colleges caused by the lockdown. “However, the university intends to clear all backlog examinations soon maintaining Covid protocol after getting the state government’s nod. The university has also started filling up examination forms online for the BEd and law students,” he said. “The PPU, which had adopted its resolution at the last syndicate meeting to streamline academic session from July and give an impetus to research work, has thus taken various steps to promote research work in the university from the ensuing academic session. Besides, the university has set up its own central library to facilitate its students to carry on research work smoothly and avail the facilities of ‘Sodhganga’,” Manglam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ppu-starts-guest-faculty-appointment/articleshow/83243158.cms||Kumod Verma

Speaking to TOI a day after the chief minister hinted at a possible nod for mall to reopen in the latter half of the month with a quarter of the capacity footfall provided the staff were vaccinated, mall management executives said they were in sync with the proposal and ready to comply with but needed the government’s support in vaccinating the frontline retail staff. On Friday, mall operators contacted agencies to which it outsources security personnel and housekeeping staff and asked them to complete the vaccination by June 15. They also contacted the retailers and urged them to draw up a list of employees deployed at the facilities to then chalk out a vaccination strategy. At Quest, where Woodlands Hospitals has set up a vaccination centre for RP-SG group employees, the critical operational staff are being vaccinated. So is Mani Square that has set up a vaccination centre with IQ City Medical College. At South City, too, a section of employees have been vaccinated at the KMC-run vaccination centre. Forum Rangoli in Belur also houses a vaccine centre. Several other malls, including Acropolis and Forum, have reached out to hospitals to set up vaccination centres there. “We have welcomed the CM’s proposal that malls start operations with vaccinated staff. That will make the controlled environment in the facilities even more safe. We are working on the logistics but it will help if the government declares mall employees as frontline workers and allocate vaccines,” said Merlin Group chairman Sushil Mohta who is also represents the umbrella organisation of malls — Shopping Centres Association of India — in the eastern region. Quest Mall vice-president Sanjeev Mehra and Forum mall management services director Ujjal felt vaccinating at least 50% of the retail staff was required for the facility to start operations at 25% capacity. “Getting vaccines available and commencing public transport in a limited way so that the employees can reach the CVC set up in the mall can help facilitate the process,” said Mehra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jab-for-retail-workers-key-to-mall-reopening/articleshow/83244443.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Despite the allotment of additional beds in government-run hospitals and private health facilities, many patients are being turned away. One Amit Kumar Shukla from Raxual, whose mother is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the district with black fungus symptoms, was referred to All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) by the doctors. “However, there is no bed available at the hospital. I have also tried at PMCH, but to no avail,” Shukla said. Amresh Singh, a resident of Kankarbagh whose father developed black fungus treatment during Covid-19 treatment, is also undergoing treatment at a private hospital on Bypass Road. “The doctors have suggested some medical tests and referred him to AIIMS-P. However, we are not getting any bed there. At NMCH, the doctors are saying that they do not have tools for the surgery,” he said. At AIIMS-P, the number of mucormycosis patients rose to 110 on Friday from 65 a week ago. At least 15 patients have died due to black fungus infection at the hospital so far and 12 recovered from the disease. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-P, said only three-four mucormycosis patients are being admitted at the hospital daily due to lack of beds. “The number of beds for black fungus patients has been increased to 140. We admit the patients depending on their symptoms. We have 30 beds for Covid positive mucormycosis patients, 60 general beds for patients who have contracted mucormycosis after Covid recovery and 20 ICU beds for such patients,” he said. Dr Kumar said Liposomal Amphotericin-B injection, which is used to treat black fungus patients, is also in short supply. “The AIIMS-P is getting 400 vials of injection per day. The demand, though, is much higher,” he added. Dr Manish Mandal, medical superintendent of IGIMS-Patna, said 117 mucormycosis patients are undergoing treatment at the hospital which has the strength to accommodate 120 such patients. “There are 14 Covid positive black fungus patients at the hospital and 93 other black fungus patients who have recovered from Covid. We conduct at least four open and four endoscopic surgeries of black fungus patients per day. The number of open and endoscopic surgeries will be increased to five each from Saturday,” he said. A senior IGIMS doctor said shortage of anti-fungal injection and not availability of beds was the main problem at the hospital. “The hospital has received 500 injections this week and all of them have been used. The injection is not available in the market. As a result, the treatment of mucormycosis patients has been disrupted. The government hospitals like PMCH and NMCH have the injection in stock, but they are not conducting open and endoscopic surgeries on black fungus patients,” he said. Head of ENT department at PMCH, Dr Vinit Sinha, said as the hospital did not have surgical instrument to remove the dead tissues through surgeries, they refer the patients to AIIMS-P and IGIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/black-fungus-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-injection/articleshow/83242731.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Vaccination for eatery, bar employees before opening||KOLKATA: Hotels, bars and restaurants are adopting a multi-pronged strategy for reopening as soon as possible following assurance from chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday. Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) is starting a mass vaccination drive from Tuesday in association with the tourism department while leading restaurants have started implementing Covid-related SOPs, including sanitization and reducing floor capacity.  HRAEI representatives met with state tourism secretary Nandini Chakravorty on Friday, after which HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar said the body will get co-operation from the state. Restaurants will be allowed to operate from 5pm-8pm, the CM had said. Banerjee had said restrictions were needed because of the pandemic but she wants businesses to run after taking necessary precautions. She also made it clear that restaurants would be allowed to reopen after vaccination of staff. The owner of Peter Cat and Mocambo, Nitin Kothari, said they will follow instructions issued by the state for reopening and said they have told employees about getting vaccinated. Kothari said he would reopen only Mocambo because of restricted hours, but the Peter Cat menu will be available there. Charles Mantosh, owner of Waldorf, Moulin Rouge and Floriana said they have vaccinated the majority of employees. Former president of FHRAI T S Walia said the association is writing to all members of HRAEI about the vaccination drive. “The state is helping us get the vaccine while we shall provide the venue and cost. There will be multiple centres,” he said. Debaditya Chaudhury, director of Chowman, Oudh and Chapter 2, said “We are gearing up, stocking sanitization kits and setting up a touch-less menu.” Aminia director Kabir Azhar said he is waiting for the government notification and getting the remaining doses administered to the staff. They also have a plan for a vaccination drive at outlets. Pradip Rozario, owner of KK’s Fusion and Mio Amore, said “Our employees are happy to rejoin work as soon as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccination-for-eatery-bar-employees-before-opening/articleshow/83244411.cms||---

When will RBI start normalising the monetary policy?It is too premature to talk about normalisation. There is no thinking on normalising the policy stance at the moment. Our inflation projection has gone up from 5% to 5.1%, which is not significant. Should the government shift some spending from capital expenditure to boost demand?This question should be for the government. We are only in May, there are still 10 months in the year for the government to start spending. Capital expenditure has been increased by 30% that is also demand-creating. While rural and urban demand has been dented, the second wave has also moderated, and we expect it to be confined to the first quarter. I expect demand to pick up when restrictions are lifted. Would NPAs rise beyond what was projected in January?I do not want to pre-empt the financial stability report (FSR), which is due at the end of this month. Having said that many banks have raised capital last year. The capital position of the banking sector and individual banks are at stable levels and whatever projection we had given in our earlier FSR looks quite manageable. There has been a call for the RBI to print money, expand the balance sheet...Central banks take a decision (on creating money) based on complex factors relating to financial stability, inflation, exchange rate stability. For now, the RBI has been successful in managing the borrowing requirement of states and the Centre. Last year, government borrowing rates were the lowest in 15 years. This year, we have supported markets with G-sec Acquisition Programme 1 (G-SAP 1.0) and G-SAP 2.0, in addition, we have injected Rs 36,000 crore through our operations in the secondary market. Why is the RBI focused on 10-year yield at 6%?We have only talked about an orderly evolution of the yield curve. Our focus is on the entire yield curve across maturities and not just the 10-year. In the G-SAP, we have included bonds across maturities. Markets should draw a conclusion based on our forward guidance, action, and communication.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-talk-of-change-in-policy-stance/articleshow/83246631.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: People’s involvement key to conserving ecosystem, experts says||PATNA: With Covid-19 pandemic showing the adverse impact of rampant intervention of human beings with nature, senior officials and environmental experts have called for immediate steps for ‘ecosystem restoration’, which is the theme for this year’s World Environment Day to be celebrated on Saturday. UN’s secretary general Antonio Guterres, in his message on the eve of World Environment Day, said, “We are rapidly reaching the point of no return for the planet. We face triple environmental emergencies – biodiversity loss, climate disruption and escalating pollution...Science tells us the next 10 years are our final chance to avert a climate catastrophe, turn the deadly tide of pollution and end species loss...We still have time to reverse the damage we have done, that is why UN Ecosystem Restoration is being launched for 10 years.” As per United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), ecosystem restoration can take many forms, including growing trees, greening cities, changing diets and cleaning up rivers and coasts. Dipak Kumar Singh, principal secretary (environment, forest and climate change department), said taking pledge for protection of environment every year should not be a mere lip service. “It should be reflected in all development strategies. The year 2021 is the centenary birth year of the great writer Faneeshwar Nath Renu from Bihar, whose creations are unparalleled in terms of the connect to nature and the blissful pleasure felt by his protagonists in being one with the creation of nature. The day we feel the silent cry of birds, insects and animals affected by felling trees and vanishing forests and give up the pursuit of self-destructive path of development will be the day for true celebration of World Environment Day,” Singh said. Environmentalist and chairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board Ashok Kumar Ghosh called for extensive public participation to achieve the goals set for ecosystem restoration. “Covid pandemic has shown us that people’s involvement is crucial to tide over severe challenges faced by mankind. Government alone can’t address environmental issues. People’s participation in terms of introducing behavioural changes is a must,” he said. Zoological Survey of India’s regional incharge and senior scientist Gopal Sharma said, “Patna is densely populated and encroachment has happened in the agriculture, grassland as well as riverine areas. It has led to destruction of flora and fauna of the region. Similarly, the river ecosystem is facing much pressure as it has been adversely affected due to illegal mining and construction of dams and bridges among other activities,” he said, adding public awareness and education is key for ecosystem restoration. On its part, Bihar government has claimed that forest cover in the state is 15% at present and efforts are being made to raise it up to 17%. Speaker’s message: In his message on the eve of World Environment Day, state assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha made an appeal to all elected representatives as well as common people to come forward for environment conservation. He lauded the Jal Jivan Hariyali programme of the state government and urged people to make individual contribution in the same direction without wasting time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-peoples-involvement-key-to-conserving-ecosystem/articleshow/83242799.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Patna||Rumours derail vaccination drive in rural areas of Bihar||PATNA: Despite the government’s efforts to create awareness about the importance of vaccination in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, lots of myths and misunderstandings circulated on social media have badly hit the inoculation drive in rural areas of Bihar. People hesitate from taking vaccine and also attack the medical officers and vaccination vans at some places . They fear that taking vaccine jab may cause loss of sexual virility (manhood), instant death, disability, life-threatening reactions and other life-time illnesses. Dr Arvind Kumar, civil surgeon of Arwal district, on Friday said several incidents of scuffle between villagers and the medical staff involved in the inoculation drive were reported in the last few weeks. “Every time the villagers see the vaccination van or camp, they chase the medical staff away. These people think that on taking the vaccine shot they would become impotent or die. They get misled by the social media posts. We have the target to vaccinate 1,700 persons per day in rural areas. However, we manage less than 30%,” Dr Arvind said, adding that to allay rumours, they are soon going to start the awareness drive in rural areas. Citing the recent incidents of attack on medical staff, Bhagalpur civil surgeon Dr Umesh Kumar said the vaccination drive in rural areas has hit the dead-end. “On Friday, the vaccination van went to Barari village, where people came out of their homes with sticks. To save their lives, the medical staff returned without vaccinating even a single person. Such incidents were often reported from rural areas. Earlier, the villagers attacked the mobile van in Rangra block. We have reported the matter to the health department,” he told this newspaper. “Minor scuffle between medical personnel and the villagers often breaks out as people are not even ready to listen. Many of them say they have heard that those who take the vaccine die. To allay the fear, we roped in anganwadi and ASHA workers and local representatives to motivate people for the vaccination. However, in urban areas, we have not seen any such hesitancy,” said Dr Ajay Kumar Singh, civil surgeon of Khagaria. Bettiah civil surgeon Dr Arun Kumar Sinha said villagers are not only hesitant about the vaccine, but they straight-forward refuse to take it, particularly for no reason. “I, along with the DM, visited Loriya block where there was so much rumour against the vaccine. Some villagers told us that they heard if they take the vaccine, they would suffer lifelong illnesses. We are trying to disseminate the right information to them,” he said. Dr Maheshwar Prasad Gupta, civil surgeon of Araria, said local leaders and religious gurus were engaged to allay the fears associated with the vaccine as there was much hesitancy among the rural population. Alok Ram (52) of Chakiya village in Saran district said people were dying after taking the vaccine shots, which scared the villagers. “I am illiterate but not a fool. I have seen some people who took the first shot of vaccine and fell ill. A few of them even died. My kids are small. How can I risk my life,” he said. Raju Khan (49) from Sareyan block in Gopalganj said, “After witnessing so many deaths, I am scared of taking the vaccine. The mobile van had come today, but we refused to open our gates. Only some stupid people in the village have taken the vaccine even though we had told them about deaths and side-effects.” Vikash Mahto, who had taken the first dose about 45 days ago, refused to take the second shot. “I was really naive to take the vaccine after the medical staff in Basantpur block (Siwan district) told us that it will protect from the infection. Now, I feel cheated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rumours-derail-vaccination-drive-in-rural-areas-of-bihar/articleshow/83242787.cms||Faryal Rumi

Vijay Sisnada was on Friday arrested for creating a fake Facebook account of Amreli superintendent of police Nirlipt Rai. J P Bhandari, deputy superintendent of police (DySP), Amreli, confirmed that the arrested accused created the fake account of IPS officer Rai in order to garner ‘likes’ on the social media. “Sisnada has no criminal past,” a police official said. “This is the screenshot of the fake Facebook profile made in the name of SP Amreli. We have initiated legal action. The posts and comments may be ignored,” Amreli SP Nirlipt Rai tweeted on Friday after the accused was arrested. “Sisnada accessed photos of Nirlipt Rai from his personal FB account and used the photos as profile pictures of the fake social media account. He used to post comments on other social media accounts and those users would believe that it was the Amreli SP commenting on their posts. The domain name of the fake FB account was SPNirlipt Rai and profile name was SP Amreli. We came to know that accused Sisnada even wrote derogatory remarks on someone’s post and that’s how the fake FB account came into notice of the police officer,” police sources said. The accused has been booked under various sections of IPC including 469 (forgery), 471 (Whoever fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine-document or electronic record), 419 (cheating by personation), 501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory) and other sections of IT Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-creates-amreli-sps-fake-fb-profile-arrested/articleshow/83246568.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Covid takes a toll on couples waiting to be parents||HYDERABAD: The long-drawn lockdown, coupled with confusion over Covid-19 vaccination, has adversely impacted dozens of couples — both from India and overseas — waiting to head to Hyderabad for their fertility procedures. With still no clarity on just when travel restrictions and other bans will be lifted, these parents-to-be say that their anxiety levels are peaking, especially with many already having waited for years, to take home a baby. Apart from in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment, scores of couples travel to the city every month to opt for surrogacy. It is among the leading cities in India to offer these procedures. “We are both in our mid-40s and fear that our chances at parenthood might dry up, if we don’t start the process soon,” said Roshan K* from a small city in Karnataka. They couple started the fertility treatment five years ago. “We tried many cycles of IVF first. When that didn’t work, we finally settled for surrogacy last year and were hoping to be in Hyderabad for it. But thanks to Covid-19 and this lockdown, we don’t know when we can initiate it. It’s leading to a lot of stress among the two of us,” he said. Across the border in Saudi Arabia, Malik M* and his wife are caught in a similar situation. “We are waiting since January to travel. But the airline has suspended services and we are not sure when it’ll resume. It is very frustrating,” he told TOI, hoping that operators start ferrying, at least those in need of medical treatment, in the next one week. Doctors say that these delays, apart from taking a toll on the mental health of couples, have other medical pitfalls. “When patients are on birth control pills (usually prescribed before IVF) for very long, it can impact on their physiology,” said Dr Samit Sekhar, owner and director of Kiran Infertility Centre adding how dragging this “fertility preservation process” is turning out to be most difficult for women diagnosed with cancer. That many doctors are advising patients to get vaccinated before going ahead with the IVF treatment, is also adding a few extra months to the process. “I came here from Indonesia last year, but my first cycle failed. Now, post the second wave my doctor has asked me to get the jab before starting the next cycle,” said M Shivani*.

Sawant on Friday said that based on the inputs of stakeholders, a decision will be taken on whether to extend the statewide curfew or begin a calibrated opening up. When asked about the curfew, which is scheduled to end on Monday, Sawant said multiple factors had to be considered before the decision to end the curfew could be taken. “On June 6, I have called for a review meeting to decide how long to extend the curfew or how to go ahead. We will take stock of the situation before deciding on the curfew,” Sawant told reporters. Goa reported 17 Covid-19 fatalities on Friday while the number of active cases stands at 9,099. Goa’s recovery rate has improved to 92.5 and the positivity rate has declined to 14%. Of the 4,086 swab samples tested, 576 fresh Covid-19 cases were detected. Sawant said that the authorities will consider the decline in the mortality rate and the positivity rate along with the general adherence to Covid-19 safety norms. “It is also important to see how many people have become disciplined. If we lift the curfew, it does not mean that people can once again crowd around,” said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-curfew-decision-likely-tomorrow/articleshow/83246828.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Deadly 2nd wave variant first seen in Dec’||Mumbai: B.1.617, the most infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant at the moment, was first noticed in India in December 2020—at least three-four months before it led to the worst Covid-19 outbreak in the world so far, reports Malathy Iyer. This was revealed by one of India’s leading scientists, Dr Anurag Agrawal, director of IGIB, in two research papers over the last two days. B.1.617 was initially called the Indian variant until the World Health Organisation promoted an unbiased nomenclature, naming its sub-lineages 1 and 2 are named as Kappa and Delta, respectively. Despite 18 months into the pandemic, little is still known about the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be able to make forecasts about emerging mutations and their ability to wreak havoc. From February onwards, B.1.617 spread rapidly, with five-digit cases reported from Mumbai and Delhi every day. “Looking back, the first sequences of what turned out to be B.1.617 were available in December 2020, when cases were declining. It was identified as a cause for concern in March (from samples sequenced in February after a January outbreak), on the basis of spiking cases and the presence of mutations seen in other troubling variants,” wrote Dr Agrawal in leading science journal, Nature. In December, no scientist in the country or the world (as genetic sequences are shared by most scientists in open source format in real time) could predict that Delta would emerge as the variant of concern that managed to infect vaccinated people. “The emergence of Delta only proves that we need to study the virus closely. The biology needs to be studied. Before planning for the third wave or looking for other variants, we need to understand what made Delta more transmissible,” he told TOI. On Friday, a pre-print study by scientists of India’s INSACOG consortium of laboratories said that "surge of SARS-CoV2 infections in Delhi is best explained by the introduction of a new highly transmissible VOC, B.1.617.2, with likely immune-evasion properties; insufficient neutralizing immunity, despite high seropositivity; and social behavior that promoted transmission’’. In January, it was believed that the ‘UK variant’ B.1.1.7 was the most common variant in circulation in Delhi. “This was followed by seeding of the B.1.617 VOC, which too is highly transmissible, with rapid expansion of B.1.617.2 sub-lineage outpacing all other lineages. This unprecedented growth of cases occurred in the background of high seropositivity,” said the study. Dr Agrawal said that at present there is no technology to ascertain which mutation or variant would trigger a new wave. “Analytics and genome sequencing will only take you so far. Sequencing cannot figure out what the emergence of a new variant means. We can only tie it to an outbreak later. We are in that sense always behind the curve. Hence, we need to learn more about the virus so that we can sequence better and forecast better,” he added. There is a need to develop more tests, plan more sequencing and adopt promising new technologies, including low-cost CRISPR diagnostics for places with limited resources, should be prioritized, said the scientist. Dr Nerges Mistry of the Mumbai-based Foundation for Medical Research, which has sequenced B.1.617 variants, said that there is an urgent need to scale up genomic sequencing. "We need to identify clusters and keep a watch on vulnerable patients (in whom Covid stays for longer and could engineer a mutation) in order to stay ahead,’’ she said. Dr Kayzad Nilgiriwala said that sequencing is low in India as compared to European nations such as the UK and Denmark which sequence about 5% of the positive samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deadly-2nd-wave-variant-first-seen-in-dec/articleshow/83249406.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Cycles, bikes that brought migrants back lie in neglect||MIDNAPORE: Hundreds of bicycles, many with punctured tyres, rusted frames and mangled rims, and at least three dozen motorbikes that lie abandoned outside Soakunia village in West Midnapore on the edge of National Highway 60. They serve as a grim reminder of the harrowing journeys migrant labourers had undertaken when a nationwide lockdown was announced overnight a year ago. With no train or bus being available to make the journey that ranged from several hundreds to a few thousand kilometres, cycles and bikes had proved invaluable for the hungry and desperate migrants to return home. Thousands of migrant workers from Bengal either trekked down on foot or pedalled their way back from distant places, where they had to gone to earn a living. Those who could, bought old bikes to ride back home. Police had stopped all of them—cycles and bikes—at Soakunia near the Bengal-Odisha border and put them on administration buses to ferry them to their home districts. They had left their two-wheelers at that point. “After the lockdown, some owners returned to reclaim their vehicles, but most did not. Many may not have wanted to be reminded of the traumatic journey without food and water. Around 500-600 cycles and 30-40 bikes are still lying here. Since they are not our property, we can’t discard them. They are lying in the field as the police station doesn’t have enough space to park them,” said an officer at the local police station. Last year, more than 70,000 residents from Bengal working in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi and Maharashtra returned home via the Odisha border. The district police and administration used thermal guns to check if they had fever, a symptom of Covid-19, subjected those who had temperature to rapid antigen test to confirm Covid and housed the rest in temporary sheds where they were served meals till buses could be arranged for to ferry them to South and North 24 Parganas, Malda, Bankura, Purulia, Jhargram, Nadia, Murshidabad and Cooch Behar. “The cycles are still in cop custody. We understand they are not parked properly. If the cops raise a requisition, we can create a temporary shed, where the two-wheelers can be kept till the owners reclaim them,” said Chittajit Basu, block development officer of Dantan I block, which has the jurisdiction of the place. Kharagpur SDO Azmal Hussain, too, said he would speak to the local police to know the exact status and number of bikes and cycles lying in neglect and promised to take necessary steps for their better upkeep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cycles-bikes-that-brought-migrants-back-lie-in-neglect/articleshow/83244810.cms||Sujoy Khanra

Anything less than free supply of vaccines to states is a huge disservice by the Centre, said the party on Friday. Congress submitted a memorandum at Raj Bhavan addressed to Kovind and Goa governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari stressing on the need to increase the pace of vaccination from the current rate of 16 lakh people a day to one crore people per day. The Centre’s vaccination strategy has been a “dangerous cocktail of blunders and bloopers” which includes a deliberately created digital divide, delayed procurement and multiple price slabs for states and hospitals, said Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-writes-to-prez-for-free-vaccinations/articleshow/83246800.cms||---

Parents of children upto ten years age have been included in the priority group of parents. Just a day earlier, the government had announced that priority group for vaccinating parents had been increased to parents of children up to five years of age as against the earlier norm of children below two years of age. “Yesterday we found the response to the vaccination in the 18-44 age group was not as we expected. Today we found the response was a bit better but to encourage people, those parents who have kids up to the age of 10 years can take the vaccines at any of the vaccination centres in the state,” said Sawant after chairing a meeting of 15-member special task force to prepare for the third Covid wave. “The executive committee has made certain recommendations which have been accepted, particularly regarding training of paediatricians, doctors, nurses which will start from Monday,” said Sawant. Sawant said that infrastructure is also being readied to handle the third wave. “We have existing infrastructure which we will be able to use, but some equipment we will need to procure. We have told them to start purchasing from June 10,” said Sawant. A 60-bed paediatric ICU is being established at the super-specialty hospital at Bambolim, intensive care units in private as well as government hospitals will be upgraded as part of the preparations for the third Covid wave. Experts indicate that the third wave could hit the state by September. The chief minister said that paediatricians, resident doctors and nurses will be trained in treatment protocols for treating children infected by the novel coronavirus in the third wave. “There are almost 120 doctors available in Goa and aside from the most senior doctors, all the others will get training on ventilator support. The nurses will also be trained,” said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-permits-parents-with-up-to-10-year-olds-to-get-jab-on-priority/articleshow/83246853.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Will cost capping pass test of Bombay HC ruling quashing fixed non-Covid therapy rates?||Mumbai: After the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court set aside the state government’s notification capping prices for non-Covid treatments at private hospitals last October, this is its second attempt at regulation.A senior state official said mucormycosis cannot be considered a health problem independent of Covid and hence, conditions of the Nagpur order don’t apply here. “Mucormycosis is not a non-Covid health problem since it is mainly seen in patients who are either undergoing treatment for Covid or have recently recovered from it,” said the official. The circular defines mucormycosis as a sequalae of Covid that requires high-end treatment, both in the way of medical management and surgeries.The government had capped treatment prices for 270 non-Covid procedures on April 30 and May 21 last year as part of the 80:20 scheme. Under the scheme, 80% private beds were set aside for Covid treatment and 20% for non-Covid. However, hospitals in Nagpur had contested the notification, which was quashed by the court.The head of a private hospital in Mumbai said they will study the rates. “Mucormycosis is a very complex disease that requires a multidisciplinary approach. Only capping prices will not help, the state must facilitate availability of antifungal amphotericin B,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/will-cost-capping-pass-test-of-bombay-hc-ruling-quashing-fixed-non-covid-therapy-rates/articleshow/83246873.cms||---
---||Delhi||Trials on, kids can’t get vaccine, Centre tells HC||New Delhi: The Centre has informed Delhi High Court that children could not be vaccinated currently as it had recently allowed the clinical trials to be conducted. In an affidavit on May 12, Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) had permitted Bharat Biotech to conduct clinical trials of Covaxin on healthy volunteers between 2 and 18 years. “The companies manufacturing Covid vaccination have given only emergency use authorisation for vaccinating people of 18 years and above. Therefore, vaccines are not recommended for people/children below 18 years. This is also because the clinical trial group during phase I, II and III did not cover children below 18 years,” said the affidavit, which has been filed in response to a petition seeking direction to vaccinate all students of Class XII appearing for the Board exams. The court had earlier sought response from the Centre and the AAP government on a PIL seeking direction to administer Covid vaccination for free to Class XII students in Delhi. The petitioner, Jyoti Aggarwal, had submitted that all the students appearing for the offline written and practical exams from Delhi must be administered the vaccine urgently. According to the petition, 2.5 lakh Class XII students had enrolled for the exams in Delhi. Meanwhile, in a related development, another plea in the court sought a stay on the phase II/III clinical trials of Covaxin on children below 18 years. The application was moved in a petition filed in May for setting aside the permission granted by DCGI to Bharat Biotech for conducting the trials on children. The petitioner had claimed that, while the issue was pending before the high court with notices issued to the Centre and Bharat Biotech, the trials had already commenced from June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/trials-on-kids-cant-get-vaccine-centre-tells-hc/articleshow/83268165.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||You were over-optimistic on getting vaccines for second dose: Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: The AAP government was overconfident that it would be able to administer a second dose of Covaxin to all those eligible, even when it became clear it won’t be able to vaccinate all people, Delhi High Court said on Friday. “You were either too optimistic or overconfident (that) you will get the second dose vaccines... you should have stopped on May 11-12 by when you knew the vaccines for the second dose were not coming. But you carried on till May 24. You allowed people to take the first dose in this period, knowing no second doses are coming,” Justice Rekha Palli observed while hearing petitions on vaccine shortage. Taking note of Delhi government’s reply, the court pointed out that 1.5 lakh people had got the first dose between May 1 and 24 at centres run by Delhi government and now need the second dose within six weeks. It highlighted that as per the government’s own documents, there was no confirmation from Bharat Biotech, the Covaxin manufacturer, on additional supplies. The court said the current situation — where thousands of people may not get the second dose within the incubation period — was “a situation of your own doing”. The comments came after Delhi government’s standing counsel, Anuj Aggarwal, said the government had made preparations for vaccinating people with Covaxin based on Bharat Biotech’s assurance that the capital would receive 5 lakh doses in May and four times of that in June. But it received only 1.5 lakh doses in May. Aggarwal said Delhi government continued to vaccinate as the Centre had told it not to set aside any doses specifically. He added that by June 9, Bharat Biotech would send around 15,000 doses and another 90,000 by July 2. But Justice Palli underlined that the first lot would help only 10% of the 1.5 lakh recipients and the second lot would not be of any help to them. “People took the first shot of the vaccine under the belief that you would provide them with the second one also,” the court said, asking both the Centre and Delhi government to find a way out. The court suggested that private hospitals could be asked to give their Covaxin stock only to these people and the government could reimburse them. It was hearing a clutch of petitions, including by advocate Ashish Virmani, who said he was unable to get the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-you-were-over-optimistic-on-getting-vaccines-for-second-dose/articleshow/83244911.cms||Abhinav Garg

In a letter to chief minister Pramod Sawant and the North and South Goa collectors, the Quraishi Meat Traders’ Association said that like vegetables, fish and grains, meat also qualify to be essential commodities. “Many of our members operate their trade of selling meat, mutton and chicken from shops situated in municipal markets. Due to rise in cases of Covid-19 during the second wave, our members kept the shops closed throughout May as per government orders. However, now there is a decline in the cases and it has been a month without any trade for sustenance,” association president Manna Bepari said in the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/meat-traders-seek-govt-nod-to-restart-work/articleshow/83246869.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi logs 523 new Covid cases, 50 deaths; over 24,000 beds available||NEW DELHI: The capital on Friday recorded 523 fresh Covid cases and 50 fatalities, while the positivity rate stood at 0.68%, stated data shared by health department. According to the latest bulletin, the new fatalities pushed the death toll to 24,497. On Thursday, Delhi recorded 487 cases — the lowest daily count in over two-and-a-half months — and 45 fatalities. This was the first time the daily death count went below the 50-mark since April 11, when the tally was 48. The positivity rate on Thursday stood at 0.61%. According to official data, on March 16, the capital had recorded 425 cases and 536 on March 17. The infection rate, which had reached 36% in the last week of April, has come down to below 1% now. Meanwhile, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held two key meetings on Friday to discuss preparations for the anticipated third wave of the pandemic. He held an important meeting with the expert committee and then with the preparation committee later. Delhi government, on May 27, had set up a 13-member committee to prepare an action plan for a possible third wave after assessing the current status and projected requirement of the health infrastructure, such as hospitals, oxygen plants and drug supplies in the city. Another eight-member expert committee was set up to devise a strategy to mitigate and manage the third wave. Also, keeping an eye on the anticipated third wave, health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday visited two healthcare project sites at Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital and Lok Nayak Hospital. Since April 19, both daily cases and single-day deaths count had been spiralling, with over 28,000 cases and 277 deaths recorded on April 20; rising to 306 fatalities on April 22. On May 3, the city registered a record 448 deaths, said the official data. However, the number of cases has shown a downward trend and the positivity rate, too, has been shrinking in the past several days. The number of deaths per day, has also seen a decline in the past couple of days. In total, Delhi has 28,038 Covid beds, of which 24,461 beds are currently vacant. There are total 6,745 ICU beds of which 4,730 are vacant. “New admissions for Covid-19 have declined significantly over the past few days. The occupancy of Covid beds in our hospital has reduced to less than 300,” said a senior doctor at Lok Nayak hospital. Safdarjung Hospital has 390 vacant beds, while AIIMS Jhajjar has 288 vacant beds for Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/523-new-cases-over-24k-beds-available/articleshow/83246893.cms||---

A sample survey conducted by some doctors from Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, results of which have been published in Indian Paediatrics, offers a glimpse into the crisis. It shows that of the 26 patients suffering from Lysosomal Storage Disorders who were receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) at the hospital, 20 (77%) had significant interruption in their treatment, with an average eight missed doses. “Of the 20 patients who missed multiple doses, 13 (65%) could not collect the medicine from the tertiary care centre due to lack of transportation as lockdown was in place, while for two (10%), the medicine import was delayed,” the survey revealed. Four patients did not get the infusion as the local hospital had closed and one patient avoided going to the hospital for fear of infection. Two patients each of Fabry and Gaucher disease switched to home-based ERT and two more patients specifically mentioned wanting to do the same,” the survey report published in Indian Paediatrics states. It was conducted by Institute of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the authors were Dr IC Verma and Dr Ratna Puri, among others. According to the report, most patients did not report any acute worsening or new symptoms. One Fabry disease patient experienced increased pain and rising serum creatinine level and one patient with Gaucher disease reported weakness and bone pain, the report says. It adds that the long-term impact of ERT interruption needs follow-up. Home-based therapy, doctors add, is one of the solutions to prevent interruption in treatment on account of unforeseen circumstances such as lockdown to prevent the spread of infection in a pandemic. “As the pandemic continues, we still grapple without guidelines to manage chronic genetic disorders. There is an urgent need to draw the attention of medical authorities to facilitate multi-specialty care for these patients to prepare for similar unforeseen circumstances,” say experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-hampering-treatment-of-other-illnesses-survey/articleshow/83268212.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The guidelines by director of public health said hospitals must monitor the renal function test (RFT) and Serum Electrolytes levels for hypokalemia (when the blood levels have below normal potassium levels), among patients who are on Amphotericin-B. Dose of lyophilised Amphotericin needs to be titrated against GFR/renal functions and Amphotericin-B (crystalline) should be preferred, it said. Only if the patient has deranged RFTs/LFTs or the patient does not tolerate it, then lipid complex or liposomal Amphotericin-B should be used, the guidelines said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/watch-blood-sugar-govt/articleshow/83246870.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Any unlock model in Maharashtra without accelerated vaccination will be useless: Experts||NAGPUR: The five-level unlock model introduced by the ministry of disaster management for Maharashtra is trending all over. The unlock model has only 2 parameters — test positivity rate and availability of oxygen beds. However, there is no word about vaccination in this model. Doctors involved in Covid-19 treatment told TOI that no module of unlock will become successful unless vaccination is accelerated effectively. “Vaccination is a must. We have to cover a large number of population at the earliest. Only this will bring the desired results of the proposed unlock. Otherwise, as soon as normal life resumes, new cases will also start,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, who has been treating Covid patients at Alexis Hospital. “I support the unlock, but there must be a proper exit policy. There are many things which can be done at the public level and on government level. Even after reopening markets, we must continue with testing,” he added. “I am a supporter of full unlock. I also liked the parameter of oxygen beds. Instead of partial unlock, we should go for full normal life. If people shun carelessness like the last time and follow protocol properly, we can bring life normal in Nagpur in next two weeks,” said pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnkar, who heads Covid treatment at Getwell Hospital. A senior member of Maharashtra State Covid Task Force, who was not willing to be named, told TOI that the five-level unlock policy was designed by the department of disaster management and it was not recommended by the task force. “Doctors still believe that we should be careful while unlocking. Cases have gone down in cities, but still coming from rural areas. Unlock may result in mix-up of population and cases could increase. Still, the decision is to be made by chief minister,” said the member. In rural areas, doctors are still sceptical about public behaviour. “Once we announce full unlock, people will start celebrating with community gatherings, marriage functions and religious fairs. Marriage season is still on. Agriculture season will begin now. Covid cases are still being reported from villages. We must think twice before unlocking them fully,” said Dr Maheshwar Tagare, who works in a PHC in Yavatmal district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/any-unlock-model-sans-accelerated-vaccination-will-be-useless-experts/articleshow/83244908.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Singh was also traced and arrested from the city’s Naubasta area on Friday. Soon after his arrest, Bhadauria was expelled from the party. Additional CP (Law & Order) Akash Kulhary told TOI, “Narayan Singh Bhadauria along with his two aides — Rocky Yadav and Gopal Sharan Chauhan — have been arrested from a flat in Noida, while wanted criminal Manoj Singh, who was helped by Bhadauria and his aides in his escape was nabbed from near a private hospital in Barra-8 area of the city.” “Those arrested from Noida are being brought to Kanpur for further questioning,” said ACP, adding, “So far, five people have been arrested in the case. One Randhir Singh Tomar was arrested by the police from the city on Thursday itself. The police team that went to Noida was led by ACP Govind Nagar Vishal Kumar Pandey.” The arrests have been made with regard to the incident which took place on Wednesday wherein Bhadauria, along with his supporters, had allegedly helped Manoj escape from police custody. Police after being tipped off about the presence of Manoj at a party organised by Bhadauria had picked him up. Bhadauria and others, however, reached the site and allegedly created ruckus and facilitated his escape. The two videos of the incident had gone viral on the internet, prompting police to register an FIR and issuing photos of the absconding accused and constituting several police teams to make their arrest possible. The police had even promised a reward for those providing information about absconding wanted criminal Manoj Singh. Meanwhile, a day after being removed from the post of zila sangathan mantri, Bhadauria has now been expelled from the party’s primary membership for helping Manoj Singh escape arrest. “Narayan Singh Bhadauria has been expelled from the party’s primary membership. The same is being conveyed to the regional and state president of the party,” said Veena Arya Patel, BJP’s Kanpur South president while talking to reporters. After being dismissed from his post, Bhadauria had tried to prove himself innocent by releasing a video on social media wherein he said he could not recognise the cops who were in civil dress during the raid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/absconding-bjp-leader-wanted-criminal-arrested/articleshow/83244264.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra to unlock at five levels, many curbs go||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government late on Friday issued a detailed notification regarding its plan to unlock the state by categorising five levels of restrictions —based on weekly positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds. Cities and districts that have a positivity rate of less than 5% and oxygen bed occupancy of less than 25% can open up entirely—restaurants, shops, theatres, malls, public transport, weddings, gyms and salons. Offices and all industries can run at 100% capacity and there will be no requirement for an e-pass, except if the travel is to the cities/district that fall under the fifth category. Officials said that if the state notification comes into effect from Saturday, local authorities will have to issue their own orders which may come into effect from Monday. “While relaxations have been given, some larger oxygen consumption-related triggers have been kept at the state level, which if crossed will see all relaxations cease to exist,” said an official. Cities and districts that have a positivity rate of less than 5% but have a bed occupancy of 25-40% have been categorised as level two—under which section 144 will be applicable; shops can remain open as per regular timings, but malls, gyms, salons, restaurants and theatres can run with 50% capacity. Weddings can take place with a 50% capacity or maximum of 100 people. Offices can open up with 100% capacity. Sports activities are restricted to 5am-9am and 5pm-9 pm; all industries can operate as per regular norms. Level three covers cities and districts which have a weekly positivity rate of 5-10% or oxygen bed occupancy of more than 40%, including Mumbai which had a positivity rate of 5.56% and bed occupancy of 32.51%. In this category, timings of shops have been extended till 4pm on all days, Malls, theatres and auditoriums will remain shut. Restaurants can work at 50% capacity and will allow dine-in till 4pm, that too on weekdays. Gyms and salons can also open till 4pm at 50% capacity. Public places will be open only from 5am to 9am. Section 144 will be applicable till 5 pm and a curfew will be imposed after that. Local trains for general public will not be allowed. Public transport will allowed 100 % without standing The fourth category comprise cities with a positivity rate of 10-20% and oxygen bed occupancy of more than 60%. At the fifth level, positivity rate is more than 20% and oxygen bed occupancy is over 75%. In the fourth category, the permitted sectors include essential shops till 4pm, takeaway from restaurants, 25 people for weddings and public transport at 50% capacity without standing. For the fifth category, most current restrictions will continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-to-unlock-at-five-levels-many-curbs-go/articleshow/83249433.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Kochi||Kerala: Special package to fight coastal erosion||KOCHI: The urgency for mitigating coastal distress and ensure coastal protection gets due importance in the budget that proposed a special package for the purpose. Acknowledging that the ‘traditional solutions’ adopted so far against sea attacks would not be a viable solution, finance minister KN Balagopal proposed a two-pronged approach — coastal conservation and improvement of infrastructure in coastal areas. The budget proposed development projects worth Rs 11,000 crore in coastal regions in the next four years. Also, coastal conservation projects worth Rs 5,300 crore will be implemented in the next four years. An amount of Rs 1,500 crore will be provided as financial assistance from KIIFB in the first phase and the work will be tendered in July. “Sea erosion and rough seas plunged the lives in coastal areas into huge distress. In these circumstances, we cannot go ahead with the traditional solutions adopted so far against sea attacks and other natural phenomena. A long-term solution needs to be formulated by scientifically understanding these natural phenomena. Urgent relief efforts will be completed on war-footing. It is expected that the development package comprising coastal conservation project, coastal highway project and wayside amenity project will provide a huge economic stimulus to the coastal sector,” Balagopal said. The plan is to protect the most fragile lands within 40 to 75 metre from sea by integrating tetrapods and diaphragm walls, which are structural concrete walls constructed in a deep trench. Besides, bathymetric (the study of underwater depth of ocean floors) and hydrographic studies will be conducted for finding out the technologies most suitable to the geography of Kerala’s coastal areas. Kerala Engineering Research Institute (KERI), Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI), National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), IIT-Chennai, IIT-Palakkad, engineering colleges, etc, will be roped in for formulating the most suitable strategy for coastal conservation. New technologies like double-layered tetrapods with anti-scour layer, mangroves, diaphragm walls with anti-scour layer, rolling barrier systems, geo-containers, and geo-tubes will be used. “Extensive stakeholder consultations will be conducted with local participation before finalizing designs. For this, the views of community organizations working in the coastal areas will be sought with the assistance of local self-government and fisheries department,” Balagopal said. Under the proposed development projects worth Rs 11,000 crore along the coast, the completion of the coastal highway project, for which KIIFB has sanctioned Rs 6,500 crores, will be prioritized. Along with this, eco-friendly wayside amenity centres will be established at every 25 to 30 km along the coastal highway. For purchasing the land required, KIIFB will provide financial assistance from its land acquisition pool. “Wayside amenity centres project worth Rs 240 crore will be implemented through KIIFB. Investors will be selected through transparent bidding in a build-operate-transfer (BOT) mode. It is anticipated that this will bring an additional investment of Rs 1,500 crore to the state,” Balagopal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/spl-package-to-fight-coastal-erosion/articleshow/83244939.cms||---

The Biden administration clarified that the US would ship out 25 million doses immediately. About 75% of the 80 million doses would be given over the summer months. Of those, between 1 and 2 million would be made available to India. These will not be AstraZeneca doses, which are yet to be cleared by the US drug regulator. The rest would be gifted according to the US administration’s discretion. The US has said the donations would be from Pfizer, Moderna and J&J shots which have received emergency use authorisation (EUA) in the US. Jeff Zients, part of the White House Covid response team, told journalists, “The AstraZeneca doses — the 60 million AstraZeneca doses — are awaiting FDA concurrence. So, the 25 million will be comprised the three EUA-approved authorised vaccines — some combination of Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Moderna.” While the Indian government has granted broad authorisation for vaccines that have been cleared by the US FDA, Japan, European Medicine Agency (EMA) and the WHO, Pfizer and Moderna have both demanded separate indemnity waiver from the Indian government. This essentially means that to receive the US vaccine donation, India will have to grant indemnity to these two companies. There remains some degree of hesitation in the government about this. Senior officials said the debate was centered on the fact that if the government granted an indemnity waiver to th US companies, all other vaccine manufacturers, particularly Indian ones, would be within their rights to ask for the same. The government is still to decide whether it would give a similar waiver to others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-vaccine-sharing-with-india-may-hinge-on-indemnity-waiver/articleshow/83250432.cms||Indrani Bagchi

If the states fail in their duties, the court directed home secretaries of both the state to appear before it and explain the failure. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy gave this direction while hearing the suo motu contempt case the high court took up four years ago against the inaction of the states. The objective behind SSC was to ensure some functional independence to DGP, commissioners of police by reducing political interference in their appointments and transfers. The PCAs would be acting as checks and balances on the functioning of police in the districts. While SSC would be headed by a retired HC judge, the PCAs would be chaired by retired district judges. Telangana sought the names of the judges for forming these structures. The high court prepared panels and sent them to the state. “We sent the panel but the state is not acting,” the bench said. The case of AP is different. The process did not begin there. Its counsel sought time to do this on the ground that they want to bring out a law to implement this. The bench reminded him that this was the result of a judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in the Prakash Singh case in 2006. “Oneand-ahalf decades are over. Now act in tune with the SC judgment till you make a law,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-to-t-ap-appoint-ssc-pca-in-dists-in-four-weeks/articleshow/83246928.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

They also decided to conduct the examination in the conventional offline mode. Following a rise in Covid-19 cases, the university had earlier decided to conduct the final semester exams online. With the number of cases now showing a downward trend, the university decided to conduct the examination physically at the centres. “The university is exploring feasibility to conduct the fourth year second semester examinations of BTech/ BPharm courses to the students in conventional (offline) mode at the centres which are near to their respective hometowns/villages,” read a letter issued by Kamakshi Prasad, director (evaluation), JNTUH. The university has asked all principals to make necessary arrangements to contact all final year students and take three cluster options (in the order of preference) from each student for writing their final year examinations. “The places which the students are opting must have at least one JNTUH affiliated engineering/ pharmacy college. The students who desire to write the exam at their parent college cluster (where the student is studying), need not give their options. If any student does not submit his/her options, it shall be assumed that his/her parent college cluster is his/her cluster preference,” read the letter. All the students have to submit their preference before June 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jntuh-set-to-conduct-final-sem-examination-offline/articleshow/83246946.cms||---

Owing to the sudden increase (10 cm) in the water level of the Ganga in the past 24 hours, there has been a rampant erosion of banks along the river at certain points. This led to a situation wherein several bodies buried close to the river bank were facing the threat of exposure. “After getting a formal approval from senior officials, my team unearthed six buried bodies. Thereafter, I cremated all of them one by one,” said Niraj. It was quite an emotional day for me as I cremated the six bodies, and kept praying that the departed souls may get salvation. I did not know who the six of them were or which village they belonged to, and here I was, performing their last rites with the same grief and compassion as I would have felt for my own relatives,” added Niraj. The pyre was set up by the funds of PMC. When the official realised that there was no possibility of finding the family members of any of the six deceased, he himself lit the pyre. “We have been keeping a close watch on the ghats to ensure no bodies are buried there. At the same time, when we found out that a few buried bodies could get exposed and fall in the river owing to the erosion of banks, we promptly dug out the bodies and cremated them,” said public relation officer of PMC, PK Mishra. The PMC official did all the work himself, which is otherwise done by the workers present at the cremation site who have expertise in the task. “Right from setting up the pyre along with the team members to lighting the pyre and adding powder to enhance the flames, I had to do everything. This has given me immense satisfaction because conducting a proper cremation is considered very auspicious in Hinduism,” said Niraj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/pmc-officer-saves-the-day-cremates-six-buried-bodies-on-phaphamau-ghat-by-himself/articleshow/83244201.cms||---
---||Delhi||Release Rs 14cr to firm in tie-up for Sputnik vax: HC to Centre||New Delhi: A private firm looking to produce Russian vaccine Sputnik V in India got a fund boost from Delhi High Court on Friday, even as judges lamented vaccine shortage. A bench of justices Manmohan and Najmi Waziri directed the Centre to release Rs 14 crore to the company along with interest since the time it won the arbitral award, once it obtains all required permissions from the authorities to manufacture the vaccine locally. The bench reiterated to the Centre that “flexibility and alacrity” has to be the key, saying it found no evidence to show the Centre “hand held” Indian manufacturers to tide over the crisis. “Today, we are a bit anguished with the way things have transpired during the second wave. As a responsible citizen you also would be anguished. Vaccine shortage is hitting each and everyone. Even today, vaccines are not available in Delhi… You have good products in India, a little hand holding will work,” the bench remarked, asking it to “look at the big picture.” It pointed out as an example that someone from Russia was able to locate infrastructure in Himachal Pradesh but the Centre failed to do so, despite being aware of the capacity. The bench said vaccine shortage is hitting everyone and the best way to fight the pandemic is to vaccinate the entire population. The court was hearing a plea related to manufacture of Sputnik V by Indian firm Panacea Biotec in collaboration with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), where the firm had approached court seeking to release the money it won against Centre by way of an arbitration award. The bench said the release of the amount, awarded to the company by the tribunal, will also be subject to the undertaking of the firm that 20% of its sale proceeds of Sputnik V will be deposited with the court’s registry till the awarded amount is secured. In its plea the company had urged the court to release the arbitral award saying it needs funds at the earliest in the larger interest of humanity as it has already manufactured trial batches of Covid vaccine Sputnik V in collaboration with RDIF and the process of manufacturing scale-up batches is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/release-rs-14cr-to-firm-in-tie-up-for-sputnik-vax-hc-to-centre/articleshow/83244967.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Varanasi||Varanasi: BLW stops producing diesel locomotives||VARANASI: In order to reduce carbon footprint and provide green traction, the Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW), one of the prominent loco manufacturing units of Indian Railways in Varanasi, has stopped manufacturing diesel locomotives. “As the BLW is committed towards a clean environment, it embarked upon a journey to manufacture energy efficient electric locomotives from 2016-17,” said BLW general manager Anjali Goyal. The BLW entered the domestic manufacturing industry when the first diesel-electric locomotive was dedicated to the nation by then Prime Minister late Lal Bahadur Shastri on January 3, 1964. Since then, it became India’s leading diesel locomotive manufacturing unit. According to her, BLW is among the leading locomotive manufacturers of the world. It now has the capability to design and manufacture multi-gauge and multi-traction locomotives. BLW manufactured locomotives ply not only in India but over several international railway systems across Asia and Africa. Locomotives manufactured by BLW are running in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Tanzania, Sudan, Senegal, Mali, Malaysia, Vietnam, Angola and Mozambique. BLW is also supplying locomotives to various steel plants, power plants and port trusts in India. “BLW has always been conscious of its larger role with regard to its community stake holders especially towards the river Ganga. BLW took the lead way back in late 1980s and installed two treatment plants — sewage treatment plant (STP) of 3.4 MLD capacity for treatment of discharged human waste and industrial effluent treatment plant (IETP) of 3 MLD capacity for treating contaminated and mixed petroleum oil and lubricants (POL),” she said. “The digested bio-manure as sludge is dried and used as fertilizer for horticultural purposes. STP treated 1248 million liters of water during 2020-21, while IETP separated 500 liters of POL from water. The parameters of STP and IETP are monitored online to ensure that these remain within the laid down standards of the Central Pollution Control Board,” she added. She said that the BLW is also committed towards water harvesting by construction of more than 425 soak pits and 50 deep recharge wells to recharge ground water. Approximately, 44,000 sqm roof top area has been covered under rain water harvesting. Two water recycling plants (WRP), each of capacity of 0.25 MLD, have been commissioned. This recycled the water used for horticulture and groundwater recharging thereby reducing fresh water consumption. In order to provide focus to its efforts towards maintaining various parameters of water, air, hazardous waste, exhaust emission within limits at par with laid down standards, BLW went in for ISO:14001 certification for Environment Management System in 2001. With this certification, BLW has a well-defined and documented policy for preservation of its environment of its workshop and colony. She claimed that BLW is the first unit of Indian Railways which was awarded the status of Green Co Silver rating by CII-Godrej Green Business Centre (CII-Godrej GBC) for its initiatives towards protecting the environment. According to the GM, the BLW has the installed capacity of 3.86 MWp of grid connected solar power at various locations. Additional solar power of 2.4 MWp is planned in future. BLW achieved a 17.6% increase in solar energy generation in the current financial year over previous year. Contribution of solar energy is 23.31% in total consumption of energy at BLW in 2020-21. BLW could achieve 22.4% saving in electrical energy consumption per equated unit and 26.6% saving in energy bill paid in current financial year over previous. BLW has obtained ISO:50001 certificate for better energy conservation. BLW has also completely changed from conventional to Energy efficient LED based lighting systems. Under the Swachchh Bharat Mission, vigorous cleanliness drives are carried out in workshops, colonies, offices and hospitals at BLW. All the officers, employees and their family members including the members of Civil Defence, Bharat Scouts & Guides and St. John’s Ambulance Brigade actively take part in these drives to keep the premises neat and clean. BLW township area has more than 1,50,000 small and big trees giving around 40% green area. In the year 2020-21, more than 2,000 trees were planted at BLW.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/blw-stops-producing-diesel-locomotives/articleshow/83244038.cms||---
---||Allahabad||3-day sero survey launched in 31 villages of Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: Officials of the health department launched a three-day Covid-19 seroprevalence survey in 31 villages of Prayagaj district on Friday. The survey involves lab tests to find the presence of antibodies against coronavirus in humans through blood samples. The survey is crucial in finding out whether immunity against the virus is developing in the population and to what extent. A total of 786 samples will be collected between June 4 and 6. Nodal officer (Covid-19) and additional chief medical offer Dr Rishi Sahai told TOI that after the formation of medical teams, sample collection exercise for the survey has started, and a total of 31 villages would be covered. He further added that at least 24 samples would be collected from each village. Samples of six persons, including two men and two women (aged above 45 years) and two children (from five to 18 years of age), will be collected under random sampling process. Dr Sahai further added, “We will collect four sets from each village (samples of six members from each of the four families) for testing. Besides, samples of 42 people who tested Covid positive either in the first or second wave will also be collected for testing. Names of these 42 persons have been sent by the state to the district for sample collection.” Samples collected from villages falling under Shankargarh, Dhanupur, Handia, Koraon, Manda, Meja, Urwa, Bahadurpur, Pratappur, Phulpur, Kaurihar, Mauaima, Soraon, Bara and Prayagraj urban. Officials, meanwhile, said that a similar survey was carried out in 11 districts of the state in September last year, and the districts covered included Kanpur, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Agra, Prayagraj, Kaushambi, Baghpat, Moradabad, Ghaziabad, Lucknow and Meerut. The exercise conducted by KGMU found out that one in five persons in the state had developed antibodies against coronavirus. In sero surveys, scientists and health experts will look for IGG against Covid to find out percentage of the population that has developed immunity against the deadly virus. Public health specialists also pointed out that the fact that most of the cases are asymptomatic and therefore liable to be missed by RT-PCR testing, seroprevalence surveys could play a significant role in the ongoing battle against the pandemic. The findings will help the state plann for the anticipated third wave as well. Many states, including New Delhi, Punjab and Maharashtra, have released the results of their sero surveys.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/3-day-sero-survey-launched-in-31-villages-of-district/articleshow/83244185.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19: How delta variant gave Delhi its worst phase||NEW DELHI: The fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Delhi was caused by the predominance of the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), a sub-lineage of the Kappa variant (B.1.617.1) that was first detected in Maharashtra in October last year. Indian scientists have found that Delta, which has been categorised as a variant of concern (VOC) by World Health Organisation (WHO), is not only highly transmissible compared to the other variants but also has a higher viral load and vaccination breakthrough rate. Scientists from National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) and Academy for Scientific and Innovative Research (ASIR) have noted in the study, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, that “…prior infections, high seropositivity and partial vaccination are insufficient impediments to its spread”. The study concludes that “strong public health measures will be needed globally for its containment”. Delhi reported the first peak in Covid-19 cases in June 2020. The second and third peaks were reported in September and November, respectively. A sero survey report released in February 2021 showed more than 50% of the capital’s population had developed protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 during the three peaks. Despite that, the city witnessed a fourth peak from April onwards which turned out to be the deadliest yet. The scientists analysed community samples from Delhi from the previous outbreak in November 2020 until May 2021 and related it to the effective reproductive number (Rt) -- the average number of secondary cases per infectious case. After the third peak in Covid-19 cases in November last year, new cases had ebbed significantly but started to rise again in January. This coincided with an increase in the detection of B.1.17 or the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2. The highly transmissible variant was first detected in UK in November 2020. Till January 2021, the scientists say, its detection was minimal in Delhi but it increased to 20% in February and 40% in March. The farmer’s rally, which was attended by many people from Punjab, may have contributed to this, the study suggests, pointing out that Punjab had a high prevalence of the Alpha variant then. However, according to the study, the real rise in Covid-19 cases in Delhi started happening April onwards as prevalence of B.1.617.1 (Kappa variant) and its sub-lineage, B.1.617.2 (Delta variant), went up. The B.1.617 variant was first detected in Maharashtra in October 2020. Until February this year, according to the scientists, the detection rate of the lineages of this variant, namely B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.617.2 (Delta), in the capital was as low as 5%. In March, it rose to 10% and by April B.1.617 overtook B.1.17 with 60% detection rate. The sub-lineage B.1.617.2 (Delta) showed maximum rise, going from less than 10% of B.1.617 to 80% in Delhi during this period. “Our data shows that B.1.617.2 has higher transmissibility than B.1.1.7 in north India, with initial seeding by B.1.1.7 being constantly replaced by B.1.617.2, even in Punjab, where B.1.1.7 has reached 100% prevalence,” the study says. It adds that B.1.617.2 has seven spike mutations of which three are at critical sites that may be leading to its enhanced transmissibility. “We estimate transmissibility of B.1.617.2 to be 50% greater than B.1.1.7. The viral load of B.1.617.2 appears to be higher than B.1.17, based on data from India and the UK, and so does the vaccination breakthrough rate. While immune escape seems less for B.1.617.2 compared to B.1.351 (another SARS-CoV-2 variant first detected in South Africa), overall, we note that B.1.617.2 is capable of creating very fast rising outbreaks,” the report concludes. B.1.617.2 or the Delta variant has been detected in many countries now, including UK and Australia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-delta-variant-gavedelhi-its-worst-phase/articleshow/83246990.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Naidu is the eighth woman to be arrested for drug peddling in the city in the last five months. Though she has been allegedly peddling drugs since the last eight years, this is the first time she has been arrested, said an officer. Naidu lives with her husband, who works in a private firm, and a son in Kalbadevi. Explaining her modus operandi, the officer added that Naidu did not use cellphone to contact her suppliers and all her transactions were in cash. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the ANC arrested Muttuswami Naidu (38) with 115gm of heroin worth Rs 35 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-50-yr-old-woman-arrested-with-rs-3cr-heroin-in-sobo/articleshow/83249547.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: City industrialists leaving green footprints for others to follow in||LUDHIANA: Local industrialists, who are known for avant-garde manufacturing processes at a fraction of cost of their competitors in other states and countries, are now taking a lead in adopting technologies that help the environment. Some businessmen are not hesitating in spending huge sums for the processes that cut down pollution and conserve natural resources. They are also disposing of environmentally hazardous material safely. City-based New Swan Enterprises has adopted a unique water recycling and conservation technique on its factory premises with which it has managed to save a huge amount of water in a year that is enough to meet the needs of more than 3.5 lakh people. The company was bestowed with the Excellence in Water Management and Conservation Award by the ministry of jal shakti. Upkar Singh Ahuja, chairman of the company and president of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), said, “Extraction of groundwater by submersible pumps is the most commonly used method by factories. But we, in order to conserve the groundwater and maintain the water-table around our factory premises, adopted a 3R (reduce, reuse and recycle) system. It has helped us in reducing our dependence on groundwater extraction and we have managed to reduce the use of fresh water by 85%. Besides, we have also installed state-of-the-art tricotect plants for passivation (an industrial process) which helped us in saving nearly 1.44 lakh litre of water. In one year, we saved 17,817.6 KL of water.” Ahuja added, “In the second national water awards held a few months ago, we won in the excellence in water management and conservation category of MSMEs. Due to the fast depleting natural resources, there is a big responsibility on the industry to adopt environment-friendly practices.” Another company, AP Refinery Private Limited, Jagraon, has set up a biomass power plant of 3.4MW capacity and all the heating and power needs of the firm are being met by it. The company also has cut its carbon footprints to almost zero and recently FICCO-FLO had conferred upon it the Greenpreneur Award-2021. Bhuwan Goyal, director of the company, said, “We have been using green fuels for a long time. The energy requirement of the company is being met through the 3.4MW biomass-based cogeneration power plant at our unit. Our plant was commissioned and is running for the past six months. Besides this, we have developed a novel process to convert by-products of our industry into biofuel. Not only does this enable effective disposal of by-products, but also reduces consumption of fossil fuels. We have set up the pilot plant and will commence commercial production shortly.” In another green initiative, Ludhiana firm New Star Industries has set up a micro jungle adjacent to its factory where hundreds of trees of different varieties are being grown to increase flow of oxygen in and around the premises. The firm has also set up a small farm on its premises, where green techniques are used to grow vegetables and fruits, which are distributed free of cost among workers. Narinder Bhamra, managing director of the company, said, “Due to the ever-increasing pollution in Ludhiana, we set up a micro jungle near the factory to cut down pollution and also increase the green cover. Hundreds of trees have been planted, and every year we add more to this initiative and also encourage others to follow suit. We are also doing organic farming on our factory premises, where 15-20 varieties of fruits and vegetables are grown and distributed among our workers free of cost.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-industrialists-leaving-green-footprints-for-others-to-follow-in/articleshow/83242822.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Kanpur||NCR putting best efforts to make Railways energy efficient||JHANSI: Out of total 6119.55 km, North-Central Railway (NCR) has electrified 5642.91 km of rail track on which 90 per cent of trains are running in the region. The NCR has been able to save Rs 364.27corer worth of diesel oil in the year 2020-21 which has been considered as a big step towards environment conservation. Giving these details, principal chief electrical engineer, NCR, Satish Kothari speaking on the eve of the World Environment Day, to be observed on Saturday (May 5), said in the previous financial year, 268 km of track of the rail network had been electrified in the NCR region. Electrification works are in progress in the left out sections. More trains in future are expected to run on electric traction, he said. “NCR as one of the important zonal railways is enormously contributing towards increased utilization of electrical energy in traction, improving energy efficiency in traction and non-traction systems and in utilization of renewable energy (solar) in non-traction areas like railway stations, workshops and offices”, he said. In addition, there has been an increased utilization of three-phase electric locomotives that has further helped in conserving energy. The specially designed locomotives have ‘Regenerative Braking’ features which, when used, generate electric energy which is utilized by other electric-run- locomotives available in the section, he further said. “Previous year, 53 new locomotives were commissioned in Kanpur and Prayagraj divisions. They helped in saving Rs 61.84 crore in the last financial year alone. The NCR with an increased utilization of ‘Head on Generation’ (HOG), has been able to further save around Rs 10 crore by saving 1.4 million litres of diesel oil during previous financial year achieving another milestone in energy conservation”, he added. Apart from this, intensive use of solar power in the division has helped in energy conservation. During 2020-21 a total of 11 MWp capacity of solar power plants were installed in various divisions including Jhansi, Prayagraj and Agra generating 10.73 million units of electricity and thus adding Rs.5.13 crore to the exchequer, Kothari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/ncr-putting-best-efforts-to-make-railways-energy-efficient/articleshow/83244292.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Indian Railways plans to be ‘net zero carbon emitter’ by 2030||NAGPUR: The Indian Railways (IR) is in a mission mode to become the largest ‘Green Railways’ in the world and is moving towards becoming a ‘net zero carbon emitter’ by 2030. Railways is looking at helping the environment through steps ranging from massive electrification to day-to-day water and paper conservation. In a release issued by the Central Railway on the eve of World Environment Day, officials said, “With a view to transforming Indian Railways into ‘Green Railways’ and to capture the economic benefits of electric traction in an accelerated manner, railways have planned to electrify broad gauge routes by December 2023 to achieve 100% electrification. This will eliminate diesel traction resulting in a reduction in carbon footprints. IR is also introducing the Head On Generation (HOG) system, whereby electrical power is fed to the coaches directly from the overhead equipment (OHE) through the locomotive. Already, 1,280 trains have already been converted to HOG. “There will be a reduction in carbon footprint by 31.88 lakh tonne per annum. This will also save fuel costs by Rs2,300 crore,” they said. As a part of ‘Swachh Bharat Mission”, IR has completed the installation of bio-toilets on its entire fleet. This has ensured that no human waste is discharged from coaches on track. Nearly 2.74 lakh litres per day of excreta on tracks is being avoided. Human waste led to corrosion of rails and fittings costing Rs400 crore per annum. Over 73,000 coaches have been fitted with 2.59 lakh bio-toilets on IR. Officials said, “To harness clean energy, IR is promoting the use of renewable energy like wind and solar energy. It has installed about 114 MW of solar rooftop plants in over 1,000 stations and 400 service buildings. IR plans to be a zero net carbon emitter by 2030.” According to the officials, IR has taken initiatives to reduce, recycle and dispose of plastic waste generated in stations in an eco-friendly manner. A total of 585 crushing machines have already been installed at more than 400 railway stations and more are in process. To promote water conservation, 6,112 rainwater harvesting systems have been installed across IR up to March 2021, they said and added, e-tendering has been implemented and thereafter, its processes including bills have been digitized. All activities related to procurement, supply chain, and vendor approval have also been digitized and made paperless. As per the release, hospital and colony waste management for a cleaner environment is followed in all its 128 hospitals and 586 health units.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Local bodies earn praise, to receive health grants||T’puram: The local bodies earned a word of praise from finance minister KN Balagopal who presented the revised state budget on Friday. The minister said that LSGs have rendered unique service in Covid prevention activities. “Through quarantine centres, FLTCs, SLTCs, DCCs, local self-governments could prevent the spread of the disease and ensure better treatment, care, medicine and food for patients. Prevention of disease could be ensured by coordinating ward-level committees, rapid response teams, volunteers, youth organizations etc. The community kitchen activities undertaken through mass participation during lockdown period are commendable,” he said. Over the past two months, local bodies have been fully occupied with the constitution of rapid response teams and ward-level monitoring committees for Covid management. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had also stressed on the need for local bodies to step up in various activities related to managing Covid-19. The establishment and running of care centres has played a crucial role in easing the burden on hospitals. Besides, local bodies also took measures to work with health department to ensure oxygen supply in various care facilities. The minister said that Kerala has effectively made use of decentralization in revamping the health sector. Fifteenth finance commission has appreciated this intervention of the state and has commented that other states shall strengthen their health systems like Kerala model under the leadership of local government institutions. This is a matter of pride for Kerala, said Balagopal. The 15th Finance Commission allocated Rs 70,051 crore across India as health grant for five years from 2021-22 of which Kerala’s allocation for the next five years is Rs 2,968 crore. The minister said that Rs 559 crore will be allocated this financial year. This will be provided to local governments and utilized for strengthening family health sub-centres, family health centres, CHCs, urban primary health centres etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/local-bodies-earn-praise-to-receive-health-grants/articleshow/83245065.cms||---

---||Delhi||AAP: No vax for youth at govt centres for 2 weeks||New Delhi: Senior Aam Aadmi Party functionary and MLA Atishi on Saturday hit out at the Centre for failing to provide adequate vaccinations for Delhi. She said it had been two weeks of no vaccination for the youth who were looking to get vaccinated at government schools, while private hospitals continued to have a large supply. Presenting Delhi’s vaccination bulletin on Saturday, Atishi said around 25,000 doses of Covaxin had been supplied to the Delhi government for the 45+ age group on Friday, which were distributed to various vaccination centres, however, these were being used for second doses only. “Vaccination is the only way we can fight with this virus. Delhi has faced a number of adversities in the face of the second wave. To hinder the chances of a third wave, it is important that each one of us is vaccinated on time. Yesterday, on June 4, 40,605 doses were administered, out of which nearly 35,547 were first doses and 5,058 second doses. With this, the total vaccine count of Delhi has gone up to 55,92,986,” said Atishi. She said more than 43 lakh people had so far been given the first dose and more than 12 lakh had been completely inoculated. “On Friday, nearly 25,000 doses of Covaxin were sent to us, which will be distributed to various vaccine centres. Until today, for 45+, no doses of Covaxin were being administered in any centre. These will be used only for the second dose. The list of centres administering Covaxin will be displayed on delhifightscorona.com. We have nearly 32,000 doses of Covaxin and 5,76,000 doses of Covishield,” said Atishi. She said while two days’ stock of Covaxin and 28 days’ stock of Covishield were available at present for the 45 plus age group, it had been two weeks of no vaccination for the youth of Delhi. “We have been receiving multiple queries from youth regarding restarting vaccination, but we are afraid that we don’t have any concrete answer.” Atishi further said, “The Delhi government, which decided to administer vaccines for free, does not have any vaccines but private hospitals have sufficient stock and are immunising people at expensive rates. Hence, it has been our constant question to the central government that how is it happening.” On Saturday, a free government vaccination camp for the 45 plus age group was held in Indra Camp in Begumpur. It was organised by MLA Somnath Bharti through Bridging The Gap Foundation. Bharti said only around 20 people were vaccinated in total at the site, largely owing to people in the 45 plus age group either waiting for Covaxin to arrive, while those that had taken Covishield were waiting for the 84-day period to lapse. “Ninety-nine per cent of the people in the 18-44 age group are yet to be vaccinated but we are not allowed to use vaccines for the 45 plus age group for them,” said Bharti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-no-vax-for-youth-at-govt-centres-for-2-weeks/articleshow/83268315.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||One chief minister, many super chief ministers in Maharashtra, says Devendra Fadnavis||NAGPUR: A day after the embarrassment faced by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) over lifting of restrictions, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Friday slammed its constituents stating that there seems to be many super chief ministers in the government though only one (Uddhav Thackeray) has been named as chief minister. On the confusion created by state relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar’s statement on lifting of restrictions from districts not in the red zone from Friday, which was later denied by the CM’s office, Fadnavis said every minister in the MVA considers himself to be the CM and makes such hasty announcements to take credit that often leads to such confusion. “In any government, only the CM has the powers to take a policy decision. In some cases, he appoints a minister, but the latter toes the former’s line. In the MVA government, all ministers interact with the media, except the CM. They make an announcement and later say the CM will officially declare it. The CM needs to instil discipline in his ministers. Major policy decisions should be communicated directly to the people. There’s a complete lack of coordination between the MVA constituents,” said Fadnavis. Responding to Fadnavis’ charges, Wadettiwar said the opposition is doing its job of flaying the government, but none of the coalition partners is hungry to take credit. He also added that the notification regarding lifting of restrictions from the districts not in the red zone would be issued by Friday afternoon, but again it wasn’t released by the CMO till the filing of this report. “The draft is ready and is currently being looked at by the CMO,” he said. MPCC president Nana Patole also came out in support of his fellow minister, stating that the latter was right in making announcements related to his department, but ultimately, the CM authorises those decisions being the head of the government. “The citizens of Maharashtra are apprehensive about either succumbing to the deadly virus or losing their livelihood. Therefore, any decision taken has to be a balance one. It takes time as precautions need to be taken so that the virus does not spread again. Our government cares for people unlike the Modi government which has shrugged off its responsibilities and put the onus on the states,” said Patole. Refuting the opposition leader’s charges regarding lack of coordination among the three coalition partners, the former speaker said that Fadnavis should check the BJP government’s records regrading its ministers making statements. “Even you will know who was the super CM during their (BJP) tenure. We will soon come out with a foolproof standard operating procedure (SOP),” said Patole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/one-cm-many-super-cms-in-state-govt-says-fadnavis/articleshow/83245043.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Following a meeting with paediatrics as well as neo-natal experts, revenue divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar issued the directives for scaling up the infrastructure in accordance with the standard operating procedure (SOP). According to experts, each district will need to have a minimum of 200 oxygen beds per million children. These beds will be meant for level-II patients having moderate symptoms. While minimum 30 ICU beds per million children have been made mandatory for level-III patients who develop severe symptoms. In addition to this, each district has been asked to set-up four special newborn care beds for non-Covid patients per 1,000 deliveries, four special newborn care beds for Covid patients per 1,000 deliveries and eight post-natal care beds per 1,000 deliveries for Covid positive mothers. As per an estimate, Marathwada region has a population of 20.5 million children, out of which 4.1 million are in Aurangabad and 3.7 million are in Nanded. When contacted, assistant revenue commissioner Rashmi Khandekar said efforts are on in every district to scale up the infrastructure at the earliest. “Around 95% children are likely to be asymptomatic, while two to three per cent children having comorbidities or health issues since birth are likely to develop symptoms and may get critical,” said Khandekar. Another official privy to the meeting said the experts have specifically mentioned ailments like congenital hypothyroidism, sickle cell disease, neonatal diabetes amongst other health conditions in newborns or children that will require more attention from doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/administration-plans-4-5k-beds-for-children-in-mwada/articleshow/83240512.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The tribals who ventured into the forest area made make-shift shelters and put up tents to be in isolation, which is mandatory for Covid patients. With district officials getting to know about the tribals making the forest area their isolation place, they ventured into the forest and spoke to the tribals. They shifted the tribals to a Covid isolation centre they had set up for them. For the last few days, Covid positive cases were being reported in Yathnaram village of Mahamutharam mandal. As per protocol, the entire village was declared as a containment area and Covid victims were being provided with medicines. However, in some families, those who tested positive did not have enough space in their houses to be in isolation. Lest their other family members too get Covid, as many as 14 people from seven families left the village and went into the forest and put up temporary tents to stay there in isolation. It is learnt 34 tribals tested positive for Covid-19 in the village in the last four days. On learning about this, district collector Krishna Aditya sent a team of officials into the forest area to explain to them that they could stay at an isolation centre and come back from the forest. Mandal special officer Sudheer Kumar, tahsildar Sathish Kumar, MPDO Pedda Anjaneyulu, health official Dr Gopinath and other officials convinced the tribals to come back into the village from the forest. At the isolation centre, arrangements were also made for providing the tribals with food and essentials everyday at a local primary school. “All the tribals who went into the forest have been shifted to the isolation centre,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tribals-isolate-in-forest-shifted-to-govt-run-centre/articleshow/83247018.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Delhi||Delhi HC order on private school fees: government, students file plea||NEW DELHI: From next week, Delhi High Court will examine several pleas regarding private schools in the capital, including one filed by the AAP government against a single judge order to allow private unaided schools to collect annual and development charges from students. Petitions have also been filed in the court by students of private schools. Delhi government, in its appeal, contended that its orders of April and August last year were issued in larger public interest. It maintained that “charging fees is not the only source of augmenting the income” and schools, if unregulated, will determine their own fee structure “as per their whims and fancies.” The appeal added that the government was duty bound to not allow fees to be charged under any other heads than those necessary. The appeals filed on behalf of the students have argued that establishment costs, like repairing of buildings, administrative expenses, rent and hostel expenses,were not applicable when the schools were closed. They also contended that the charging of annual and development fees was only deferred and not stopped. The single judge, in the May 31 judgment, quashed two office orders of April and August 2020 issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE) of Delhi government forbidding and postponing collection of annual charges and development fees, saying they were “illegal” and “ultra vires” the powers of the respondent stipulated under the Delhi School Education Act and the Rules. The court held that Delhi government has no power to indefinitely postpone the collection of annual charges and development fees by private unaided schools as it would unreasonably restrict their functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-order-on-pvt-school-fees-govt-students-file-plea/articleshow/83247047.cms||---

---||Delhi||No death in those infected after Covid jab: AIIMS study||NEW DELHI: The first study on breakthrough infections during the April-May period by All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, confirmed that none of the vaccinated people died due to the Covid-19 disease. Breakthrough infection denotes whether one has contracted Covid-19 after being fully vaccinated. According to the study, in the present group of vaccine breakthrough infections investigated using genome sequencing, closely overlapping and mirroring the Covid-19 cases in the state in Delhi, the variants of concern are B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.7 comprising the majority cases. While a number of vaccine breakthrough infections have been reported previously, it has been largely associated with non-severe symptoms. During the subsequent course of illness, neither disease worsening (stable biomarkers) nor mortality was reported in the present group, confirming the previous observations. Out of the 63 breakthrough infections, 36 patients received two doses, while 27 received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Ten patients received Covishield, while 53 received Covaxin. “Viral load at the time of diagnosis was high in all the patients irrespective of vaccination status or type of vaccine received and the initial course of disease with high-grade non-remitting fever lasted for five to seven days in the vaccinated group, similar to the clinical presentation in unvaccinated patients,” it added. While a number of vaccine breakthrough infections have been reported previously, it has been largely associated with non-severe symptoms. The patients had a mean age of 37 (21-92), among which 41 were male and 22 were female. None of the patients had any comorbidities that could act as a predisposing factor for breakthrough infections. “While antibody levels for a subset of patients were available, they became infected nevertheless and presented to the emergency just like other patients, putting in doubt the protection offered and or clinical relevance of total immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a surrogate of Covid-19 immunity,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-death-reported-so-far-in-those-reinfected-after-jab-finds-study/articleshow/83245118.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: No hike in water tariff for first time in 11 years||NAGPUR: The distress, anxiety and financial crisis in several families during the pandemic of over one year has otherwise brought some relief to the city residents in the form of annual water tariff. The civic body this year has decided not to increase the tariff of 5%, an annual feature since Orange City Water Private Limited (OCW) took charge of the supply in 2010-11. Nagpur Municipal Corporation commissioner Radhakrishnan B has taken the decision despite the fact that the civic body has been incurring a loss of over Rs 70-80 crore per annum from water supply and it will further increase the loss with the decision. “The pandemic has not only left its impact on people’s mind but has hit many of them economically also since March last year. The civic body is doing what it can do the best for the people of this city by deciding not to raise tariff,” he said. He further said, “So far as loss to the civic body is concerned, all measures are being taken to prevent it. Directives have been given to regularize illegal water connections. Also, the authorities concerned as well as the OCW have been directed to increase recovery,” he said. Intrestingly, BJP-led ruling party in the NMC has time and again claimed to take decision in the general body directing the administration not to hike water tariff. But the decision is yet to be taken. Radhakrishnan has given some relief to the people before that. The NMC’s water works department had tabled a proposal before the civic chief in the last week of March this year seeking permission to increase water tariff by 5% from April 1. Radhakrishnan rejected the proposal citing pandemic. The NMC had decided to hand over entire drinking water supply to the OCW in 2010-11. Minimum water tariff which is recovered from the consumers was Rs 5 per unit in 2010-11. The civic body had finalized to pay rate of Rs 7.90 per unit to the OCW which was Rs 2.90 per unit more than what was being collected from consumers. Also, the OCW’s rate was linked with wholesale price index (WPI) and consumer price index (CPI) which is bound to increase every year. The OCW had taken over water supply from March 1, 2012. Then, NMC increased tariff by 5% in 2011-12. The general body had taken a decision to give powers of increasing water tariff by 5% every year to the civic chief. Accordingly, all civic chiefs have been increasing the tariff by 5% every year for the last 10 years. Even the last municipal commissioner, Tukaram Mundhe, had also increased the tariff by 5% when the pandemic started last year. Radhakrishnan has become the first civic chief to halt the spree of the tariff hike. In a nutshell *Decision was taken to hand over entire drinking water supply to in 2010-11 *Minimum water tariff was Rs 5 per unit *NMC accepted to pay rate of Rs 7.90 per unit to the OCW *The OCW’s rate was also linked with the WPI and the CPI which is bound to increase every year *The NMC increased tariff by 5% in 2011-12 and gave powers to civic chief for increasing by 5% every year *All civic chiefs increased water tariff by 5% every year for the last 10 years *District started to witness pandemic from March 2020 *Full lockdown was also in effect from March 2020 causing financial loss to the people *Still, the then civic chief had increased water tariff by 5% *Radhakrishnan B rejected the department’s proposal seeking hike citing pandemic||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-hike-in-water-tariff-for-first-time-in-11-years/articleshow/83247048.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Kochi||Rs 50cr allotted for phase 1 of water body management||Kochi: Since Cyclone Ockhi, the state has been seeing back-to-back disasters caused by erratic and unprecedented heavy rainfall, leading to frequent flooding, landslides and sea inundation. Extremely heavy rainfall and poor dam water management had led to massive floods, which saw the state looking for solutions to prevent a repeat of this disaster. New rule curves for dams, clearing clay and sediments from dams have been scheduled as precautionary measures. Taking the recommendations of the Post Disaster Need Assessment (PDNA) report published after the 2018 floods, finance minister K N Balagopal announced a comprehensive package to push for a better system in management of water bodies in the state. An amount of Rs 50 crore is earmarked for the first phase of this project with an estimated expenditure of Rs 500 crore. The report looks at multiple systems such as ‘room for river’, ‘living with water’ and ‘eco-friendly construction’. Floods could be contained through augmenting and improving water-carrying capacity of various water bodies and river basin systems. It suggests adopting ‘Room for the River’ principles to lower flood-water levels in rivers by increasing the wet areas of the rivers, i.e. giving them more room or space. The comprehensive project will be implemented through a multi-departmental coordination including the water resources, environment and local self-governments. Some of the projects which will be implemented are: protecting the banks of canals, cleaning and deepening through desilting; removal of sand deposited in dams, reservoirs and rivers; construction of mangrove barriers along coastal areas; strengthening or raising of higher portions of land and bunds; deepening of rivers; shifting of bunds and dykes to outlying areas; removal of low-level bunds to facilitate free flow of water in flood plains; lowering of flood plains or plain areas adjacent to river banks for ensuring free flow of water; dredging of river and canal beds and making temporary storage mechanisms by creating water retention areas through interlinking lakes, irrigation canals and backwaters. Policies and rules to ensure that waste, including plastic and hazardous elements, in water bodies are also in the pipeline as it could lead to stagnation and breeding ground for diseases and death of fishes. However, experts said that enforcement with regard to increasing flood-bank area or widening of canals which have already been encroached would be a major challenge. Political interests could clash with decisions of land-use planning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rs-50cr-allotted-for-phase-1-of-water-body-management/articleshow/83245191.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A decision in this regard was taken late on Thursday and all the citizens above the age of 45 can make use of this service for getting vaccinated. The move is in line with similar service being provided to the citizens in several metro cities where people are afraid to visit the vaccination centres with a fear of getting infected. Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) health officer Dr Neeta Padalkar said the facility is all set to kick-start at Prozone Mall’s parking space from Monday morning. “Those willing to get vaccinated may avail the service between 10 am and 4 pm.” The beneficiary will have to carry a valid identity proof like Aadhar, PAN or voter identity card. Post vaccination, each beneficiary will be kept under observation for a brief period of 30 minutes at the vaccination centre, before they are allowed to leave. Authorities have clarified that for none of the processes, including while being under observation, beneficiary will have to step out of their vehicle. Different sections have been marked at the parking space including waiting area, registration area, inoculation point and observation area. Health authorities clarified that even the citizens coming in autorickshaws will be allowed to get inoculated at the drive-in vaccination facility. “Depending on the response, the facility may be extended to other suitable locations in the city,” an official privy to the development said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/amc-to-start-regions-first-drive-in-vaccination-facility-from-monday/articleshow/83240523.cms||---

The non-PDS beneficiaries include unorganised workers, migrant workers, building and construction workers and domestic help. “This distribution is being carried out from one school in each of 280 wards of Delhi,” the minister said. The city government also stated that each school identified for the distribution of non-PDS ration has been provided a login id and password for entering the stock for record-keeping and for the purpose of registration at the site. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-starts-giving-free-foodgrains-to-non-pds-group/articleshow/83268336.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Should everything stop until India is vaccinated, asks Bombay high court||NAGPUR: “Should everything be stopped till entire country is vaccinated,” asked the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court of the MBBS students on Friday. The oral poser came while hearing a plea by NGO Herd Foundation and a physiotherapy student challenging Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) May 19 circular to conduct winter examinations in offline mode. Over 45,000 students across the state would be appearing in the papers commencing from June 10 at 173 centres. The exam has been deferred thrice on April 19, May 15 and June 2 due to the Covid-19 second wave. Reserving the case for pronouncing the verdict on Saturday, Justice Avinash Gharote asked petitioner’s counsel Rahul Bhangde assisted by Dhruv Sharma that even those over 45 years aren’t getting the vaccines then how could these students bypass everyone. “Getting infected is the risk all of us carry and the doctors face greater one,” he said. In their PIL, the petitioners have made the Union ministry for health and family welfare, state health department, and National Medical Commission chairman, besides MUHS vice-chancellor as respondents. Not only have they prayed for online exams, but also demanded to vaccinate all 45,000 students along with entire teaching and non-teaching staff conducting them, if MUHS wishes to hold offline papers. They also opposed move of asking the students to sign an undertaking that MUHS wouldn’t be having any responsibility, if they contracted the disease during exams. Pointing out that over three 35 lakh lives were lost due to Covid-19 pandemic across the globe, Bhangde strongly argued that if offline exams are conducted it posed a risk to all 45,000 students. “If exams led to even 10 fatalities, are those worth it? We have to weigh both sides. Due to the pandemic, the structures of families have changed. Students have lost one or both parents. Do we want to put them at risk or can we wait for them to be vaccinated,” he asked. Citing a recent statement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the health and safety of students is of utmost importance and there would be no compromise on this aspect, Bhangde said the government has a paramount duty to protect citizens as per the Constitution of India. “The first phase of the exam was for postgraduate students, while the second was for final year, where all of them were inoculated. Therefore, all these 45,000 should also be given a jab before the offline papers. They aren’t afraid of exams, but they should be vaccinated first,” the counsel contended. MUHS counsel Abhijit Deshpande said two phases of winter exams were already over and only third was remaining. “Even the question papers have been dispatched and we are taking all precautions. We have also floated a Suraksha Kawach Scheme for the examinees and staff in case of unfortunate death of anyone. If they are afraid of coronavirus, how will they treat patients? Only one student, who is not pursuing MBBS, has approached HC out of 45,000,” he said. He pointed out that the students were informed in October last year that the theory examinations would be held physically, but they moved HC only on May 29. “If exams are deferred, the entire calendar will collapse. The petitioners can’t hold up the careers of 45,000 students. Vaccination may take another six to seven months to reach them,” Deshpande said. The government said they had granted a choice to the students to skip the papers and directed MUHS to strictly follow SOP while holding the papers. Deshpande further pointed out that the principal seat had disallowed urgent interim relief to medical students last year. Bhangde then contended that if the students were not being allowed to take admissions to foreign universities without vaccination, why MUHS students couldn’t be inoculated first?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/should-everything-stop-until-india-is-vaccinated-asks-hc/articleshow/83245176.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Currently, the health workers at Bowenpally and Bolarum general hospitals are administering the second dose of vaccine. For the first dose, approximately 50,000 people, aged between 18 and 45 years and above, have registered their names on CoWIN app. However, many are not able to avail online slots for the first dose on the portal. Unless the state government announces gives the go ahead for vaccinating those yet to take the first shot, we can’t do much, said the incharge of an urban healthcare centre. Meanwhile, a health official said the number of Covid-19 cases and the death toll in Secunderabad has reduced. “Since the second wave started, over 500 to 700 positive cases have been reported so far in Secunderabad,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/health-centres-in-cantt-flooded-with-calls-for-first-vax-dose/articleshow/83245195.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Second Covid wave in Hyderabad similar to peak of 2020||HYDERABAD: The second wave of Covid-19 that hit the city between March and May this year, appears to have distinct similarities to the peak of the first wave, which lasted from July to September, 2020. The second wave saw the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits record 47,214 cases of Covid-19 — only 14 less than the peak period last year, where it stood at 47,228. Further, while July 2020 reported the highest monthly caseload — with 26,660 cases — for the city ever since the first Covid-19 case was reported in March 2020, this year April reported the maximum cases. It saw 22,883 people test positive for the virus. But despite the high numbers, officials said that Hyderabad remained largely stable through the second wave in comparison to other cities like Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune. “Measures like Covid- 19 surveillance, early identification of symptomatic people etc helped in keeping the numbers in check. Many others are now following us to tackle the spread,” said Dr K Ramesh Reddy, director of medical education. Speaking about the impact of the lockdown, experts said that the 20-day restriction did see cases drop, but marginally. During this period, Hyderabad reported 21,985 cases which is 1,488 less than the cases reported in April 2021. “This shows that apart from the problem of conglomeration, other reasons including the presence of various variants of virus are also a reason for the surge in numbers,” said a senior professor who helped the Centre in developing a mathematical model to study the spread of Covid-19. At present, Hyderabad is reporting between 250 and 300 cases every day. On Friday, after a gap of almost two months, the count dropped below 300.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/second-wave-in-hyd-similar-to-peak-of-2020/articleshow/83247104.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Vaccination drive for super-spreaders loses steam, target still far||HYDERABAD: With just two days left for the special vaccination drive for ‘superspreaders’ to end, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) may not be able to achieve the intended target of vaccinating about 3 lakh beneficiaries during the 10-day drive. Going by the daily vaccination figures, the civic body was not able to reach the fixed target of vaccinating 30,000 people per day. The drive, which was initiated on May 28, includes owners and workers of rythu bazaars, grocery stores, street vendors, fruit and vegetable markets, liquor marts and wholesale markets among several others. After eight days, the figure of vaccinated ‘super-spreaders’ stands at over 1.8 lakh, with the highest vaccinations on June 1 at 27,117. With over one lakh vaccinations remaining, the data shows that the civic body may not be able to achieve its target before the drive ends on June 6. “I am still waiting to receive the message for vaccination, but I am not sure if it will be done in the next two days. The only way to achieve the target is by extending the drive by at least another week. This way, the officials can issue tokens to those who were left out for vaccination,” said Ashwin Kumar, a grocery store owner at Kukatpally. Meanwhile, another vaccination drive which is being conducted from Thursday for autorickshaw, cab and taxi drivers aims at vaccinating around 2 lakh beneficiaries in 20 days. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar said that a special vaccination drive would be conducted at ten centres under GHMC limits. In this drive, the beneficiaries will receive a message on their mobile number and only those drivers who receive it would be allowed at the vaccination centres. The registration of the drivers on the CoWIN portal would be done at the vaccination centre. To avoid misuse of the vaccination drive, officials stated that no same-day walk-ins would be allowed. “The process to register our names on the transport department’s website and then in the CoWin portal is a bit elaborate and time consuming. Apart from that, we have not faced any problem so far,” said Shaik Salauddin, chairman, Telangana State taxi and drivers JAC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vax-drive-for-super-spreaders-loses-steam-target-still-far/articleshow/83245161.cms||---
---||Nagpur||WII report on radio collar data shows tigers use farm lands to travel||NAGPUR: Even as the country celebrates World Environment Day with the theme ‘Tigers as flag-bearers for ecological restoration’, a report by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and Maharashtra Forest Department (MFD) calls for enhanced protection of over 37,067 sq km tiger corridors identified in the Vidarbha landscape. This is the first corridor study based on tiger telemetry data in India. It reveals that the agricultural landscape in Vidarbha is still conducive for tiger movement and is hope for long-term conservation of tigers. Between 2015-2020, WII and MFD radio-collared 15 tigers under the ‘Long-term research projects in Maharashtra’. The report ‘Telemetry-based tiger corridors of Vidarbha landscape’, which is ready for release, identified 37,067 sq km of tiger corridors of the total area of 97,321 sq km landscape, which harbours 331 tigers. The study categorized tiger corridors into 5 classes: very low (10,289 sq km), low (18,728 sq km), medium (5,690 sq km), high (1,418 sq km) to very high (942 sq km). “This indicates the importance of the pathways of the corridor. The very high values indicate good connectivity where as ‘very low’ values indicate low connectivity. Attempts should be made to bring these identified areas under corridor management plan and enhanced protection,” said WII scientist and project investigator Dr Bilal Habib. “The study specifies that rural areas of Vidarbha are still favourable for tiger movement. We need to maintain these corridors so that tigers are able to disperse from one PA to others,” Habib said. “Dispersing tigers in the Vidarbha landscape are using a much wider swathe of the landscape outside PAs for movement than earlier known. It extends well beyond forested structural corridors or the least cost-corridors modelled by earlier studies,” said Nitin H Kakodkar, PCCF (wildlife), Maharashtra. “The study uses movement data to call for attempts to bring areas under corridor management plan and enhanced protection. Tigers in this landscape were pushing boundaries of human tolerance, ready to accept risk of exploring a human-dominated landscape,” said Kakodkar. “Data has also shown extensive use of agricultural lands for movement. Tigers have used whatever small fragment of forest patch or parcel of cultivated land with standing crops, to seek refuge during daytime,” the PCCF adds. The report notes the Vidarbha landscape is dissected by 84,202 km of roads, which need pre-emptive mitigation where the roads cross important tiger corridors. Such habitat connectivity is increasingly used to mitigate effects of habitat fragmentation, land-use dynamics, and climate change. “Such findings not only add to our knowledge of tiger movement ecology but also have tremendous management implications on the ground. It changes the quantum of management efforts for creating awareness related to human-tiger conflict management and mitigation, connectivity conservation etc. It provides direction as to where to focus management interventions on the ground to make the corridors more permeable and aid successful tiger dispersals,” said Kakodkar. “The purview of tiger conservation, which till date was thought to be restricted to lands under the jurisdiction of the forest management, now seems to extend beyond such boundaries and into a realm where successful conservation effort should necessarily include many stakeholders,” said Habib. “The local people, district administration, local NGOs, and various development agencies should work in tandem with forest management. The report provide clues to managers to target proactive and pre-emptive management interventions for conflict prevention, mitigation, and connectivity conservation,” Kakodkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wii-report-on-radio-collar-data-shows-tigers-extensively-use-farm-lands-to-travel/articleshow/83246865.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Agra||Agra: Priyanka Gandhi sends help for 4 orphans suffering amid pandemic||AGRA: Following a TOI report highlighting the plight of four orphans waiting for government help for the last six years, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has sent help for the kids. Uttar Pradesh Congress secretary Amit Singh with his team visited the hut where their four children live and gave them food and grocery items. He said that a Congress worker will be visiting the family once every week. Meanwhile, nearby people and social workers also came to help the kids. “We will take care of all their needs. Following orders of our leader Priyanka Gandhi, one month of food and grocery items has been supplied to them. Congress workers will be visiting the kids at least once a week to ensure their well-being. Soon, we will get the hut structured in such a way that water does not enter it when it rains. A regular power connection will also be provided to them. Our team will also pursue with the district administration to provide them help under the government schemes for the poor children,” Singh said. One of the four children, a 12-year-old girl, said, “We had not eaten properly for the last four days. On Friday, we got packets of food items and groceries. We are thankful for the help. Several people came to meet us and extended their love and support.” According to neighbours, the father of the children aged between 10 and 16 years died in a road accident in 2012. Due to lack of proper treatment, their mother succumbed to tuberculosis in 2015. The children living in the hutment have been waiting for government help for the last six years. Until the pandemic struck, the eldest one used to work at a shoe factory as a temporary labourer. But the lockdown took away his job. The children, who live in the hut near the railway line in Rajnagar area, have been surviving on food offered by their neighbours and a child rights activist. In March 2016, state commission for protection of child rights member Jyoti Singh had visited them and directed officials to extend help. There has been no word from the officials ever since. Child right activist Naresh Paras said, “It is good that people are finally reaching out to help the poor children. Authorities must also realize their responsibility and benefit the orphans under government schemes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/priyanka-gandhi-sends-help-for-4-orphans-suffering-amid-pandemic/articleshow/83242872.cms||Deepak Lavania

The papers of BA, BCom and BSc first semester were scheduled this week, but a majority of them were marred by complaints from distressed students, who failed to login in the system. The NU Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) quickly took a decision to conduct re-exam of all aggrieved examinees. They, however, need to lodge a written complaint within three days with their respective college principals, who in turn will forward them to the NU Exam Section. “Actually, the issue wasn’t from our side. These students were appearing for the exams for the first time and therefore weren’t familiar with the login system. They made several mistakes while filling up their credentials during login. Many of them, particularly from the rural areas, faced connectivity issues. We would give them another chance to appear in papers,” BOEE director Prafulla Sable told TOI. After receiving scores of complaints, NU once again dispatched the video link prepared by the director detailing steps on how to login for the paper. “I’ve sent it to all principals and also told them to train their students on this aspect. Many students failed to enter captcha, as they weren’t aware of that. Since it was their first paper, they committed mistakes. But today, the same students appeared and they successfully solved the paper. Over 22,000 have enrolled for the BA exams and 14,000 for BSc, which constitutes the largest chunk for our winter-2020 exams,” the BOEE director added. The difficulties started cropping up from Tuesday, when over a thousand students appearing in the BA Geography paper weren’t able to connect to the system. The trend followed over the next two days during the papers for BA, BCom, BSc (IT and Home Science), BCCA and others. As per the examinees, they were under the impression that the colleges would send them an exam link, instead of the university and kept waiting for it. “In their hall-tickets, the name of the subject and online link is mentioned clearly, but they failed to notice it. However, only 5,000 students out of 68,000 who appeared this week had complained, which isn’t a big number. Apprehending these difficulties, we had started our papers with few examinees from May 27 and eventually increased it to 68,000. Earlier, we conducted exams of engineering students, but didn’t face such issues,” Sable said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-5000-nu-students-miss-exams-due-to-login-and-connectivity-issues/articleshow/83245252.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The labour department said it will soon launch an exclusive portal for the purpose. Sources said that migrant workers from the unorganised sector could not avail the vaccine due to lack of employers’ guidance and shortage of vaccines. Soon after the second Covid-19 wave, officials found that over 40% migrants have gone back to their hometowns for vaccination. “Migrants in the city and those working in other districts can register on the new portal that will be launched in a few days, to get the vaccine dose. Officials from the labour department and employers of the units concerned will assist them during the registration,” E Gangadhar, joint commissioner, Telangana labour department, told TOI. The migrant workers must furnish their names, name of the state and Aadhaar details on the portal. “The data will help us implement various state and central government schemes for workers and link them to Telangana State Social Security Board for Unorganised Workers (TSSSBUW),” said Gangadhar, who is also an administrative officer at TSSSBUW. Migrant workers who have already taken the first dose of the vaccine in their hometowns can register for the second dose on the portal. “The vaccine will most likely be free of cost,” said Gangadhar. The data of vaccination will be linked to the health department to chalk out a drive to administer doses at private hospitals or state-run healthcare centres in the state. The labour department official said that a meeting of TSSSBUW will be convened soon where the measures for enrolment of migrant workers for vaccination would be discussed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-to-vaccinate-over-5-to-8-lakh-migrant-workers/articleshow/83245223.cms||---

According to a press release, professor Podile in March had requested the ministry of education to relieve him from the post as his extension period was coming to an end. President Ram Nath Kovind recently approved his request, the varsity said. It was during Podile’s tenure in 2016 that dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula committed suicide, triggering nationwide protests. His death garnered attention from national political leaders such as Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and many others, who camped at the campus to protest against the authorities. Professor Podile was appointed the UoH VC on September 21, 2015 for a period of five years and granted one year extension in September, 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, sources from the university said that professor Podile was asked to leave following a long extension sought by him. “Such a long extension is not granted to any VC and a new VC will have to be appointed,” said a faculty member. During his tenure, the university attained the Institution of Eminence status and continued to maintain its high rank among the higher education institutions in the country. Professor Podile is a senior professor in the department of plant sciences in the School of Life Sciences at UoH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uoh-vc-appa-rao-podile-to-step-down/articleshow/83245217.cms||---
---||Agra||Agra launches sero-survey to check development of antibodies||AGRA: Health department on Friday started a sero-surveillance to check the rate of spread of Covid-19 and evaluate development of antibodies among people of different age groups in Agra district. Ten teams will conduct random antibody tests on 720 people at 31 centres over the next three days. For this purpose,14 booths have been marked in rural areas and 17 in urban. A sero-survey provides estimates of antibody levels against infectious diseases and is considered crucial for measuring population immunity due to past infection or vaccination. It is an important component of disease surveillance. Dr RC Pandey, chief medical officer, said, “Serology tests will be conducted for surveillance of Covid-19 in Agra district. It looks for antibodies in blood. If antibodies are found, that means there has been an earlier infection.” Dr Sanjay Kala, principal of SN Medical College, said, “When antibodies are found, it may mean that a person was infected with Covid-19 and their body’s immune system responded to the virus. People develop antibodies when their body’s immune system responds to an infection. These antibodies can be found in the blood of people previously infected with the disease irrespective of whether they were symptomatic or not.” The CMO said, “The sero-survey will provide a clear estimate of the spread of Covid-19 in Agra district and development of antibodies among people against the disease. Samples of 720 people will be sent for lab testing in Lucknow. Results are likely to come in next two weeks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-launches-sero-survey-to-check-development-of-antibodies/articleshow/83242883.cms||---

Vigilance officials led by DSP Babu Peringeth recorded the statement of Abdullakutty as part of inquiry into the alleged irregularities in the implementation of a light and sound show project set up at St Angelo Fort in Kannur at a cost of Rs 3.5 crore which was inaugurated in February 2016. Peringeth said they had come to record the statement of Abdullakutty as he had proposed the project as MLA. The official clarified that it was not a raid. The Vigilance director had given sanction for a preliminary inquiry after an earlier report filed by the Vigilance found prima facie irregularities in the project. Vigilance sources said that prima facie there are many irregularities in the implementation of the light and show facility which had functioned only for a few days after it was inaugurated. “The site inspection done by PWD officials have found that many of the equipment and facilities set up there are missing or damaged and also many of the facilities installed are substandard,” an investigating official said. He said that it has been found that the Bengaluru-based company which carried out the works had taken the equipment back after some days. According to Vigilance officials, they will interrogate officials of the DTPC and the firm which carried out the works, in the coming days. Meanwhile Abdullakutty said that he had no role in the implementation of the project except for the fact that he had proposed setting up the facility at the St Angelo Fort which was a prominent historical fort in the state. “The information coming out now reveals that shocking corruption had taken place in the project. The firm which had carried out the works had run the light and sound show for only two weeks after the project was inaugurated,” he said, adding that the contract was given for the firm by then tourism minister and the DTPC. “My hands are clean and I personally welcome the probe into the matter,” Abdullakutty said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vigilance-records-bjp-leaders-statement/articleshow/83242887.cms||---

With a 35%-40% shortage of supply, many patients are hit, worst being thalassemia patients. Many children with thalassemia, with critically low haemoglobin levels below 5, were awaiting blood transfusion for over a month now, severly affecting their quality of life and posing a threat to their life. “We have a few such kids with us awaiting blood transfusions, who are overdue for one to two months now. A thalassemia patient requires a transfusion every 15 days when their haemoglobin levels dip from 12 (normal) to 8. After the due date, it keeps falling further,” Dhiraj Kaveri, blood coordinator, Arohi Blood Bank, which caters to thalassemia patients, told TOI. “While haemoglobin level below 8 itself is dangerous, levels lower than 5 can be life-threatening and can result in cardiac arrest. Currently, we have a waiting list of 34 patients, but with the lockdown and ongoing vaccination drives, we are seeing just 2-4 donations per day,” Kaveri added. “We are forced to ration blood units. We are supplying based on a patient’s condition and level of emergency,” admitted an official from another blood bank. Also, a problem with regular donors is that they are not in a rush to donate. “When we call regular donors requesting them to donate, they say we will come next month as they tend to look at other cases as an emergency but feel that it is okay to delay donation for thalassemia patients,” said Mohammad Kareem, parent of a six-year-old patient awaiting B negative blood, urging people to donate blood before going for vaccination. As majority donors fall in the 18-44 age-group, now with the vaccination kicking off for this category, it might be more difficult to get donors, especially a bigger dip being likely in June. Explaining the scenario, Red Cross Blood Bank medical officer Dr KP Reddy said, “Typically, a donor can donate blood 15 days after vaccination, which means that there will a gap of 15-20 days in the donation for each donor who goes for vaccination.While we are having enough supply in Hyderabad due to tie-ups with police and other organisations, there is a shortage in other blood banks and districts,” Dr Reddy added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lockdown-and-vax-drive-hit-thalassemia-patients-hard/articleshow/83247075.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Kolhapur||Industrial units in Kolhapur to get 10% of oxygen||KOLHAPUR: Industrial units in Kolhapur will get 10% of the liquid oxygen generated and refilled in the district. As the cases across the state started to reduce, the state government allowed the district administration to increase the quota of liquid oxygen up to 20% for the industries and the rest for Covid patients. After assessing the oxygen need for the Covid patients and ensuring emergency buffer stock, the Kolhapur district administration has decided not to give a 20% quota and instead fixed the quota at 10%. Bhausaheb Galande, the resident district collector said, “We have over 3,000 Covid patients on oxygen support at present, and for them, around 47 tonne of oxygen is required per day. It is provided from one major generator and other refillers from the district. Additional supply takes place from plants outside the district. As we continue to need high amount of oxygen, we have not permitted the oxygen manufacturers and refillers to divert 20% quota as prescribed by the government.” Currently, not all industries are permitted to operate. As per the existing Covid restrictions, the industries, which are related to essential services like the food industry, are allowed in the district. Galande said the overall demand from the industries is less at present. Currently, the 10% quota is sufficient for the industries to run efficiently. Meanwhile, district collector Daulat Desai has asked local authorities to speed up the process to set up the oxygen-generating plants in the public hospitals. The district administration has proposed 16 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plant. It is estimated that the commissioning of these plants will begin by June-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/industrial-units-in-kolhapur-to-get-10-of-oxygen/articleshow/83240527.cms||---

An FIR related to burglary was registered by worker Mohammad Alam (25). Alam, in his FIR, said there are 22 rooms in which around 100 workers reside in the labour camp at the construction site. The FIR read that the workers had gone to work at 7am. When some of them returned to the camp to have lunch at 12.30pm, they found the locks of five rooms to be broken, their belongings scattered everywhere and cash, collectively worth Rs36,500, stolen.” Sub-inspector Mahesh Bhosale of the Chatushrungi police said on Friday, “We suspect the involvement of local criminals behind the burglary. We are working o certain clues and hope to detect the case at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/11-workers-lose-rs-36500-to-burglars/articleshow/83245321.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Three senior ONGC officials suspended in inquiry into barge tragedy||MUMBAI: Three executive directors of ONGC have been suspended as part of a high-level committee inquiry into last month's barge tragedy which claimed the lives of 86 personnel, even as an association of ONGC officers has demanded that the decision be revoked. In its letter dated June 2, the Association of Scientific and Technical Officers (ASTO) stated if the decision is not revoked by June 15, it would be “constrained to take further action”. The high-level committee was set up by the ministry of petroleum and natural gas to probe the tragedy, the biggest so far off Bombay High, due to Cyclone Tauktae. Eighty-six people died in the mishap, including 75 from barge P-305 and 11 from the tugboat Varaprada. The committee took the decision on the basis of technical evidence that senior ONGC officials were allegedly responsible for the incident also involving barges SS-3 and Gal Constructor, and drilling rig Sagar Bhushan. Meanwhile, barge master Agnelo S Rebello of Gal Constructor which ran aground blamed both Afcons, the company that chartered the vessels for ONGC, and ONGC. ASTO has demanded that the committee and ONGC debar Afcons and its partners from further work in ONGC with immediate effect and criminal proceedings be initiated against them. “The fact is that 22 barges were working for ONGC during that period and19 of them adhered to the ONGC weather advisory but the three barges belonging to M/s AFCONS did not. M/s AFCONS failed to adhere to the requirements of the Marine Operations manual, bridging documents, and warnings issued by ONGC. They also gave false information to ONGC that they have taken adequate precaution as per ONGC’s advisory,” the letter stated. The Indian Navy and Coast Guard had rescued 628 personnel from various locations in Arabian Sea off Mumbai. A source from ASTO told TOI: “The action taken to suspend the three senior officials was wrong. It is the vessel charter company, the vessel owner, that should be held responsible for the mishap after it failed to follow the standard operating procedure (SoP). Action should be initiated against the contractor Afcons and its partners as their culpability is established in their failure to adhere to the weather warnings given by ONGC and for giving false compliance report of the same to ONGC. The three suspended senior officials were in charge of drilling, safety and executive exploration, respectively.” In reply to the letter, an Afcons spokesperson said, “The letter makes several unsubstantiated and factually incorrect allegations against Afcons, all of which are belied by the voluminous documentary evidence on record that Afcons has already submitted to the HLC (high-level committee) that is investigating this incident. The letter is replete with misinformed allegations, including that the barges chartered by Afcons did not leave the operational area in time. It is well known and documented that all barges charted by Afcons were instructed to demobilise from the work area and did so by May 14/15, well before the onset of the full fury of Cyclone Tauktae.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-ongc-officials-suspended-in-inquiry-into-barge-tragedy/articleshow/83249727.cms||---

According to the district-wise data of active fire events (rabi season) in Punjab, based on satellite data by remote sensing department, from April 16 to May 28, the total number of such incidents in Ludhiana was 517. The number of such incidents last year was 1,001. Fire incidents recorded for the same period in 2019 were 997. The data suggests that the number of fire incidents were lowest this year as compared with previous two years. Also, the data suggests that the fire incidents in Ludhiana on May 28 this year was the lowest in last three years. This year, one incident was recorded as compared with last year when May 28 saw eight incidents and in May 28, 2019 there were 14 such incidents. The data suggests that with 517 fire incidents this year, Ludhiana was at number 10 — Firozepur had highest (946), Tarn Taran witnessed the second highest (810) and Amritsar had 789 such incidents. SAS Nagar had the lowest — 43 cases this year. The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) authorities have acknowledged that the change is substantial. “Rabi season has already ended and data was recorded till May 28. According to the data, there is fall in such incidents. We are trying to educate the farmers, which could be the reason for change. But we need to keep at it, bring down burning incidents more,” said Ludhiana PPCB senior officer Sandeep Behl. “It is good that number of such incidents are less as compared with last two years, but the more than 500 such cases is still huge. The authorities should educate and also compensate farmers for not burning stubble to bring more positive change. The stubble burning does cause problems to us as it does result in environment pollution,” said Harpreet Singh, a city resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ludh-records-517-stubble-burning-cases-this-rabi-season-lowest-in-3-years/articleshow/83242886.cms||Shariq Majeed

Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts are, however, considered as one unit each in accordance with the government’s plan. There were some confusions in the Solapur city administration over the state’s unlocking plan. Despite having a population of above 10 lakh and the positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy in the limits, the Covid restrictions continued in the city just like in the rural parts, where the positivity rate continues to be above 10% and bed occupancy more than 60%. From Friday, the Solapur district administration allowed non-essential standalone shops to open till 2pm. It was only agitation by the traders, the civic administration allowed further relaxations in the city. In the rest of the region, the Satara district administration continued with its order to keep even essential shops closed. “The restrictions will continue till June 8, after which the situation would be reviewed for further relaxations,” collector Shekhar Singh said. In Kolhapur district, the city is not considered as a separate unit despite having 10 lakh population. The district administration has deployed 10 vehicles with rapid action teams to disperse crowd in the areas listed as “hotspots”. Sanjaysinha Chavan, Kolhapur ZP chief executive officer, said, “People moving around without any purpose will be subjected to antigen test. Those testing positive will be sent to isolation facilities.” Sangli district is also considered as a unit and has a positivity rate between 10% and 20%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/non-essential-shops-reopen-in-solapur-curbs-on-in-kolhapur/articleshow/83240550.cms||---

Sanjay Minni in his complaint said the callers have been making calls and harassing him and his wife for the last five months to recover money. In an email to TRAI and MHA, he said the callers were harassing him for a small loan that he had taken. “The harassment stopped only after police cracked down on loan apps businesses,” he wrote. Stating that the telecallers were untraceable, the complainant questioned government agencies on how the mobile network operators were able to issue unidimensional communication SIM cards. “The single reason they can get away is because they will call from mobile numbers to which you cannot call back or which are not traceable. This is a total failure of our system and telecom regulations. Despite the rules, how are the operators able to issue such SIM cards,” he wondered. The mobile network operators said that they tried to reach Sanjay but in vain. “No one contacted me. This is the most common standard reply one gets if we lodge a complaint. So far, I did not get a reply even from TRAI or MHA,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trai-centre-get-plaint-over-unidimensional-sim-cards/articleshow/83245259.cms||Srinath Vudali

The online meeting held here on Friday decided to examine the matter legally, while also combining the recommendations of an expert panel and practical suggestions from stakeholders. The chief minister said that the matter would be discussed with legal experts and would also consider healthy practical solutions. He said that a consensus would be arrived at, and Friday’s meeting was the first among the meetings in this regard. Opposition leader V D Satheesan, A Vijayaraghavan (CPM), Sooranad Rajasekharan (Congress), Kanam Rajendran (CPI), Stephen George (KCM), P K Kunhalikutty (IUML), Mathew T Thomas (JDS), P J Joseph (KCJ), P C Chacko (NCP), K C Joseph (Janadhipathya Kerala Congress), Kasim Irikkoor (INL), George Kurien (BJP), Anoop Jacob (KCJ), Varghese George (LJD) and A A Azeez (RSP) among others spoke. The high court last Friday had cancelled a government order issued in 2015, under which 80% of the scholarships for the minority went to the Muslim community, while the rest 20% went to the Christian community, including Latin Catholic Christians and converted Christians. The high court bench comprising chief justice Manikumar and justice Shaji P Chaly, while quashing the government order, had directed the state government to provide merit-cum-means scholarships to the members of the notified minority communities equally. As part of the scheme, the state had provided 5,000 scholarships for degree and post-graduate Muslim women students. In 2011, the benefit of the scheme was extended to students belonging to Latin Catholic and converted Christian communities. The government order in 2015 then said that the reservation among Muslim and Christian students would be in the 80:20 ratio.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/all-party-meet-decides-to-explore-legal-options/articleshow/83242901.cms||---

According to the State of India’s Environment, 2021 in figures report, biomedical waste consists of cultures, stocks of infectious agents, human blood and blood products, contaminated sharps, amputated body parts and isolation waste. The report indicates that Telangana has 5,552 authorised healthcare facilities and 649 unauthorised healthcare facilities which generate 20,472 kg of biomedical waste per day. Of this, 4,000 kg per day accounts for Covid-19 biomedical waste. In AP, there are 7,092 authorised healthcare facilities and 485 unauthorised healthcare facilities that generate 15,051 kg per day of biomedical waste of which13,110 kg is Covid-19 related waste. “Although it is a small proportion of the total waste generated (around one per cent), it needs special handling due to its highly toxic contents that can pose a severe threat to human health,” read the report. While both states effectively treat and dispose of 100 per cent of its biomedical waste, states such as Bihar, Karnataka and Rajasthan have been able to treat and dispose of less than 50 per cent of its biomedical waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-ap-disposed-of-100-medical-waste-in-last-1-yr-report/articleshow/83245237.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: ‘Stimulus a sham, figures misleading’||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The opposition termed the second Covid-19 stimulus package announced in the revised budget presented by finance minister K N Balagopal as sham, terming the figures presented in the state finances as misleading and incorrect as per facts. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said that if the government was serious about a second Covid-19 package of Rs 20,000 crore, it should have been included under the category of additional expenses in the revised budget estimates for 2021-22, which at present, has been shown as only Rs 1715.1 crore. “The government’s budget speech was nothing but a political speech that should have been made before the crowd. The budget estimate means the expenses that are likely to be incurred in the upcoming financial year. If the government was serious, the Rs 20,000 crore package should also have been part of additional expenses to be incurred. Once this is also included, the revenue deficit should actually be Rs 37,000 crore, instead of Rs 16,910 crore as shown in the estimates, especially when there are no proposals this time to increase the government revenue,” he said. The budget had announced a second Covid package of Rs 20,000 crore to face the socio-economic and health challenges that are emerging in the backdrop of the second wave of the pandemic. The opposition leader also alleged that contrary to what has been announced in the budget that Rs 8,900 crore would be utilized for direct transfer of money to the beneficiaries, the finance minister changed his stand while speaking to the media after presenting the budget. The finance minister had said in his post-budget press conference that the government does not intend to hand over money directly to the public. Satheesan said that former finance minister T M Thomas Isaac had claimed that the state would receive Rs 18,000 crore from the Centre and he had left a balance of Rs 5,000 crore in the state treasury when he demitted office. But the Rs 23,000 crore is not seen anywhere in the budget estimates, which again amounts to fooling the public, he said. IUML leader M K Muneer said that it is clear from the budget that the government’s intention is only to avail more and more loans and spend more. At the same time, there is no intention to cut expenses as the speech is clear about continuing all of them, without cutting down any wasteful expenses. IUML parliamentary party leader P K Kunhalikutty said that the budget should have given an answer as to what is the way forward for the state after the ongoing firefighting steps. However, the speech is completely silent about the future of the state. Kerala Congress (Joseph) leader Mons Joseph said that the budget has completely ignored the farmers’ issues, as it is silent on the agricultural sector. He also alleged that while the budget speaks about reviving the tourism sectors of Malabar and Travancore, the central Travancore area comprising major tourism destinations like Munnar and Kochi have been left untouched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/stimulus-a-sham-figures-misleading/articleshow/83245392.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Four districts of Telangana report single digit Covid cases but concerns remain||HYDERABAD: Health authorities on Friday said Covid-19 cases in several districts of Telangana are coming down and at least four districts have reported single digit numbers in a rare good news, ever since the second wave hit the state. Adilabad, Kamareddy, Komaram Bheem Asifabad and Nirmal are reporting a downslide in cases.On Friday, Adilabad had reported eight cases, while Nirmal district reported five cases. Interestingly, it was the Nirmal district which reported zero cases during the January-February period along with Narayanpet for the first time this year. Other than these districts, Narayanpet also began reporting below 15 cases during the last one week on more than one occasion. However, other districts, including Bhadradri Kothagudem, Khammam, Warangal rural and Nalgonda are a cause for concern. These districts, where polls were held, are still reporting more than 150 cases daily. The government is focusing on these districts to bring down their high positivity rate. On Friday, health secretary Syed Ali Murtaza Rizvi, along with director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao visited Jogulamba Gadwal and Narayanpet districts. “A high positivity rate of around 5% in bordering districts has to be controlled. We had meetings along with district officials on containment measures,” one official present at the meeting said. However, Yadadari Bhongir district, which had reported the first case of Covid-19 very late during the first wave, has been reporting more cases this time. The number of daily cases has not come below 50 in the district. The government is also focusing on villages, especially during the procurement season, as more farmers gather at the centres. Meanwhile, three family members of RMP doctor (along with him) succumbed to Covid-19 in Damaragidda mandal of Narayanpet district. The son of the local doctor was infected few days back and parents were also infected, and on Friday, three of them died while receiving treatment at a hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-dists-report-single-digit-cases-but-concerns-remain/articleshow/83247135.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Delhi||Court: Platforms Like IMA Can’t Be Used To Propagate A Religion||New Delhi: Mazhab nahi sikhata apas mein bair rakhna, said a court while directing the president of Indian Medical Association, Dr J A Jayalal, not to use the IMA platform to propagate any religion, and warned him that a loose comment couldn’t be expected from a person chairing the responsible post. “This couplet of Mohd Iqbal gives strength to our belief and secularism and will remain so for ages in our country. The word Hindi in this couplet, written by a Muslim poet, does not refer to Hindus but is referred to all Hindustanis irrespective of caste, colour and religion, which is the beauty of secularism,” said additional district judge Ajay Goel. The court was acting on a suit filed by one Rohit Jha against Dr Jayalal for allegedly hurting Hindu religious sentiments “by way of promoting” another faith “in the garb of proving superiority of allopathic medicines over ayurveda in treatment of Covid-19 patients”. Jha alleged Dr Jayalal was misusing his position and misleading the nation and its citizens. The IMA chief, however, stressed that he had neither remarked against Hinduism nor ever tried to force conversion of any Indian into Christianity. The court noted, “Secularism is a fundamental aspect of our Constitution... Freedom to profess one’s own religion is also an integral part of the Constitution but with respect to other religions as well.” It said “exclusivism” or preference of one religion over others by the state or public functionaries or private bodies, while discharging public functions, struck at the very root of secularism. “It negates neutrality, promotes discrimination and denies equal treatment.” Noting that the suit seems to be an offshoot of a verbal duel on allopathy vs ayurveda that had “turned into an ugly tussle between two sections of society”, the court said no injunction was required based on the assurance given by Dr Jayalal that he won’t indulge in such activity. “It is expected from him that he will not give any such occasion so that people may believe otherwise or indulge in any activity contrary to the principles enshrined in the Constitution and shall maintain the dignity of position chaired by him,” the order stated. “He shall not use the platform of IMA for propagating any religion.” Dr Jayalal submitted he was not against ayurveda but against “mixopathy”. The court said, “Though the controversy...has been raised but this court is not inclined to further comment upon the same.” It continued, “Any kind of unguarded or loose comment cannot be expected from anybody chairing the responsible post.” Pointing out that IMA is a prestigious institution meant for the welfare of doctors and other related aspects, the judge said, “Such a platform cannot be used to propagate any individual’s views on any religion.” “While the fundamental rights have been given in the Constitution, fundamental duties have also been assigned. It becomes a bounden duty of every Indian to honour the religion of each other,” the court said. “Saying Christianity and allopathy are the same and is a gift by western world would be the most inaccurate assertion. Sushrata who was an Indian is considered god of surgery and surgery is an integral aspect of allopathy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-platforms-like-ima-cant-be-used-to-propagate-a-religion/articleshow/83245353.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra to bear cost of costly jab for kids with post-Covid MIS||Pune: The Maharashtra government has decided to bear the cost of the intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a blood product made up of antibodies and other care components involved in treating Covid-linked multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), at designated hospitals and medical colleges across the state. The decision has been taken in view of the rising cases of post-Covid MIS-C in the state—an estimated 500 children are currently undergoing treatment for post-Covid MIS-C.On Thursday, the state-sponsored health scheme, Mahatma Phule Jana Arogya Yojana (MPJAY), allowed IVIG expenses up to Rs1 lakh to a 5-year-old patient, son of an autorickshaw driver in Pune. The child is undergoing treatment at Bharati Hospital, one of the MPJAY-designated hospitals in Pune. “There are about 63 treatment packages meant for children under the MPJAY. We have decided to club the relevant treatment packages together for the treatment of MIS-C. We will soon come out with a well-laid down plan so that more patients can seek free treatment at designated hospitals across the state,” MPJAY chief executive officer (CEO) Sudhakar Shinde told TOI.MIS-C is considered a syndrome — a group of signs and symptoms, not a disease — because much is unknown about it, including its cause and risk factors. A 10gm vial of IVIG costs around Rs 20,000. “Depending upon weight, 2gm per kg of the bodyweight is to be given in 12 hours. A child weighing 25kg will need 50gm IVIG costing Rs1 lakh,” said Bharati Hospital’s paediatric rheumatologist, Jitendra Oswal.Oswal, along with Sassoon Hospital’s paediatrician, Aarti Kinikar, followed up with the state officials independently about including the MIS-C treatment under the MPJAY. “The process to add MIS-C treatment package under MJPJAY has been initiated. We are awaiting the state government’s letter. Something positive should come out,” Kinikar said.“Considering the incidence calculated in studies conducted in the US, we may expect around 500 children to be affected by MIS in Maharashtra,” Oswal said.The Centre has stepped up efforts to estimate the burden of the post-Covid MIS-C across the country. The director-general of health services has told all states and Union Territories to submit weekly data on new cases of MIS-C. Currently, there is no system in place as the cases are scattered across hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-to-bear-cost-of-costly-jab-for-kids-with-post-covid-mis/articleshow/83248622.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The incident occurred when the suspects were allegedly transporting six cows to Mewat. However, one of them managed to escape from the spot. According to police, while Sher Khan died on the spot, his aides - Rehman, Shehzad, Aanish, Sher Khan’s son Shahrukh and Kadeem - were beaten up and were admitted to the district hospital. They all are residents of Bulandshahr, said police. The seized cows have been sent to a “gaushala”. A case of murder has been registered by the police against an unidentified person as it was not clear yet how Sher Khan was shot. Two cross FIRs have been registered at Kosi Kalan police station. The first FIR was registered against the nine alleged cattle smugglers, including three identified ones, under sections 3/5A/8 of UP Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act and sections 147 (rioting) and 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC on the basis of a complaint filed by one Chandra Shekhar Baba, who runs a cow shelter in Mathura. The other FIR was filed by Sher Khan’s son against an unidentified person under section 302 (murder) of IPC for killing his father. According to the FIR, the incident took place at 3:30am, when eight persons, travelling to Singar in Haryana in a Tata 407 vehicle, were stopped by a group of people near Tumola village. The locals allegedly assaulted them after accusing them of "smuggling cows for slaughter". Superintendent of police (Rural) Shireesh Chandra said Sher Khan had suffered a bullet injury in his stomach. The body has been sent for postmortem to ascertain the cause of death. The FIRs have been registered and further investigations are on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/man-killed-six-aides-injured-in-clashes-over-cattle-smuggling/articleshow/83242952.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik: Covid cases decline but deaths remain high in May||NASHIK: The decline in the new Covid cases last month brought relief to all citizens in Nashik district but the medical fraternity and administrators are worried over the high death rate in the month of May. Official, however, said that the deaths too are expected to go down now. The district reported 1,184 Covid-19 deaths in April, which declined marginally to 1,082 in May. Though the number of deaths was slightly lower, its comparison with the number of cases in the respective months was much higher. The case fatality rate for Nashik district has climbed up from 0.8% in April to 2.45% in May. “The number of patients was at a peak in late April. So naturally, there were more critical patients during the period, who lost their lives in the month of May,” Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare said. Similarly, there were some critical patients who were fighting covid for longer durations but succumbed to the infection either late May or even in the month of June. The other issue is delayed uploading of the deaths on the ICMR portal. “During the peak period, the focus was on treating patients and data uploading required. The death registry had slowed down. However, the death of each covid patient has been registered in the ‘Birth and Death’ registry. It is just that these are now being uploaded on the portal and will continue for some time now,” Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav said. Nashik has been registering a recovery rate of 96.7% but patients from rural areas struggled to get beds in hospitals. “People in the rural areas were unable to find beds in the Dedicated Covid Hospitals in Nashik city and hence, they were forced to be treated in the covid health centres despite sinking. This was the major reason for the rise in the deaths in the rural areas,” Nashik civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-cases-decline-but-deaths-remain-high-in-may/articleshow/83240579.cms||Abhilash Botekar

While various NGOs across the country are reaching out to those in need, the Indian Flair Bartenders Association (IFBA) has decided to look out for specifically those from the hospitality industry. Rohan Carvahlo, president of IFBA, said, “Last year itself, we started getting calls from those who were out of work saying that they will commit suicide. We understood that even their employers are in a tight spot because their standalone establishments are closed even as the rental of lakhs per month continued.” Even in the hospitality industry, there are certain workers who have taken the worst. Carvalho said, “Majority of the employees are from the unskilled sector, so it’s always difficult to find other job options. You don’t need to be highly skilled to clean tables or wash dishes, hence, it’s such people who are facing really tough times after hotels, bars and restaurants closed.” IFBA says they used their industry contacts to reach out to those in need. Over the last one year, the process has taken a more concrete shape with social media being used to amplify the reach. Carvalho said, “Those who wish to avail of this benefit have to apply following a set format. There is a link for Google sheet which we share and details of the beneficiary are filled up here. The person also has to submit identification documents plus their bank statement. Once all the documents are verified at different stages, we transfer money through NEFT.” Funds are being raised from within the industry and even through online platforms, and those willing to contribute can get in touch with IFBA through their website http://indianflairbartendersassociation.com.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ifba-offers-a-helping-hand-to-badly-hit-hospitality-workers/articleshow/83245341.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Vegetable and fruit vendors would be allowed to sell their produce maintaining social distance in various parts of the district, including city areas. However, vegetable markets will remain shut. Officials said that the milk shops will be allowed to operate from 7am to 9am and from 5pm to 7pm on the weekend. The vegetable and fruit vendors can sell produce from 7am to 12 noon. There are no restrictions for industries although the owners have to ensure that all employees follow Covid appropriate behaviour. DDMA chief and district collector Suraj Mandhare said the administration had made it clear on May 31 itself that there will be strict restrictions on weekends till June 15. “If we get any communique from the state government related to the unlock process, the administration will issue fresh orders. Till then there will be strict restrictions during weekends in Nashik will continue,” added Mandhare. Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav said that the decision to have weekend restrictions was taken to ensure there is no overcrowding in public places like markets. “The gathering during the weekends tends to be much more than during weekdays. It is a precautionary step that the DDMA has taken to ensure that there is no spike in Covid cases both in Nashik city and in rural areas of the district,” added Jadhav. Unlike some other big civic bodies in the state, Nashik Municipal Corporation does not issue any separate orders related to restrictions or the unlocking process. Jadhav said that the DDMA issues orders that are applicable for the district and the municipal limits. This arrangement is in place in Nashik to ensure that there is uniformity in the decision-making process. Apart from the district collector, the civic chief, zilla parishad CEO, city police commissioner and the Nashik rural SP are part of the district DDMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/weekend-restrictions-in-force-till-june-15-in-nashik/articleshow/83240586.cms||---

The IGC research paper authored by an assistant professor of economics at University of Connecticut Nitish Prakash and Karthik Murlidharan, associate professor of economics, University of California-San Diego, evaluated the bicycle programme and its impact on girls’ access to secondary education in Bihar. As per excerpts of the research on IGC’s website, the researchers found that the cycle programme was successful in increasing girls’ enrolment in secondary schools. “Being in the Cycle programme increased girls’ age-appropriate enrolment in secondary schools by 30% and reduced the gender gap by 40%. This increase mostly took place in villages where the nearest secondary school was further away, suggesting that the programme impact was driven by reduced time and safety cost of school attendance made possible by the bicycle,” the IGC research stated. Sharing the excerpts of the research on his Twitter handle, Jha stated: “The IGC research captures the impact of Mukhyamantri Cycle Yojana quite nicely...In Bihar, bicycles have become a medium of social re-engineering. Something as simple as girls cycling to school was considered remote before 2006.” He added that the Cycle Yojana is a ‘fine example of CM Nitish Kumar’s far-sighted vision. “Young girls pedalling their way to schools, full of dreams and aspiration became a common sight after CM Nitish’s ‘Cycle Yojana’ was launched. This scheme quietly wheeled a revolution in our state,” Jha tweeted. ‘Cycle girl’ interacts with Priyanka Vadra: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday spoke to Jyoti Kumari, popularly known as ‘cycle girl of Darbhanga’ over phone. Priyanka enquired about Jyoti’s education and advised her to continue her studies. She also assured to help her in case of any difficulty. “The five-minute interaction focussed on my family and our financial status,” Jyoti said, adding that Vadra knew her since the days when she brought her father on bicycle from Gurugram during the lockdown last year. Jyoti had hit the headlines in May last year for bringing her father to Darbhanga from Gurugram on a bicycle, pedalling about 1100km. Incidentally, Jyoti’s father Mohan Paswan died of cardiac arrest on May 31. Priyanka also offered her condolence on the demise of Jyoti’s father. Jyoti said that Priyanka boosted her morale, saying that “trouble comes in one’s life and facing it with courage is the only option.” (With inputs from Binay Kumar Jha in Darbhanga)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-nitishs-bicycle-scheme-worked-wonders/articleshow/83213211.cms||Piyush Tripathi

District collector VP Gautham who interacted with officials and public representatives on Friday pointed out weddings where gatherings were taking place were the cause of Covid positive rate being high. “Avoid giving permissions for weddings,” he told officials. During the meeting, zilla parishad chairperson Angotu Bindu said a lot of activity is involved in weddings – from buying jewellery and clothes and other things. “No permission should be given for weddings as this is what is resulting in the spread of Covid-19,” she suggested to the collector. The collector asked the police and revenue authorities to restrict giving permissions for weddings. If any permission was given, there should be strict surveillance in seeing that there was not more than the permitted crowd, he said. During the review on Covid-19 situation, officials were advised to shift positive patients to the isolation centres in gram panchayats. Some ‘high risk’ areas have also been identified where it was decided lockdown should be more strictly implemented. These places include Maripeda, Dornakal, Kuruvi, Garla, Bayyaram and other mandals. It was also discussed in the meeting that positive cases were being reported among traders and business community and therefore a Task Force team be constituted to go around and ensure that social distancing and Covid-19 protocols were adhered to during the lockdown relaxation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mahabubabad-admin-not-to-give-permission-for-weddings/articleshow/83247156.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Nagpur||First dose of Covaxin not administered for last one month in Nagpur||NAGPUR: The wait many for first dose of Covaxin has got longer. For a month now the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has stopped administering first dose of Covaxin. The civic body on Thursday received 1,600 Covaxin doses. NMC officials told TOI, “State government is yet to allow resuming first dose of Covaxin for 45-plus. The government has asked us to give only second dose of Covaxin. Second dose is available at GMCH, Mahal Diagnostic Centre and Khobragade Hall situated at Siddharth Nagar.” NMC stopped giving first dose of Covaxin from May 5. A resident of Vitthal Rukmini Nagar Shakuntala Tripathi, 71, told TOI, “I had undergone two surgeries including one for cancer. I was waiting for advice from doctors for taking vaccine. Doctor suggested Covaxin to me. But no centre in city is ready to give first dose for last one month.” As per doctors, adverse event following immunization (AEFI) especially fever, bodyache is negligible in Covaxin. Hence, doctors are advising it for persons with comorbidities or those who underwent surgeries. Also, efficacy of Covaxin is more than Covishield’s. Another advantage is that second dose of Covaxin can be taken after 28 days whereas after it is 84 days for Covishield. Since beginning of Covid-19 vaccination programme on January 16, doses of Covaxin are available in limited centres in the city resulting in very few beneficiaries of Covaxin. As per the NMC’s data, 5,01,715 people have taken first dose in city of which 4,66,655 (93%) have taken Covishield and only 35,060 (7%) took Covaxin. The civic body also started vaccination of homeless and destitute who do not have age, address or identity proof from Friday. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said, “Couple of homes taking care of such persons requested us for vaccination of all inmates. We submitted a proposal with the government seeking permission which was received a couple of days ago. Accordingly, we inoculated 88 women at Shanti Bhavan on Friday. Vaccination of 78 men inmates will be done on Saturday. We will also be able to complete vaccination of all inmates at Mental Hospital. Earlier, we had done inoculation of inmates who had Aadhaar or identity proof. We will now be able to vaccinate destitute residing in other homes too.” NMC on Friday continued vaccination of students who have confirmed admission in foreign universities. 154 students were inoculated on Friday. 112 had taken the jab on Thursday. Kingsway Hospital vaccinated over 2,000 on Friday. The number was 3,675 a day ago. Total 7,630 including 7,493 from 18-44 years age group took the jab in the last five days here. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said housing societies had begun approaching for organizing special camps of vaccination for 45-plus. “RBI Colony and association of staffers of an insurance company have requested for special camp in their areas. We have given them a format and asked to fill it. We will send teams and vaccinate all. Only condition is that number of beneficiaries should be over 50,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/first-dose-of-covaxin-not-administered-for-last-one-month-in-city/articleshow/83245401.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Hyderabad||Telangana minister Eatala Rajender snaps 20-year old TRS ties, targets KCR; to quit assembly||HYDERABAD: Former minister Eatala Rajender ended his nearly two-decade long association with TRS on Friday by resigning from the party primary membership. He also announced his decision to resign as Huzurabad MLA and is likely to hand over his resignation as legislator to the assembly speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy on Saturday. Former TRS MLA Enugu Ravinder Reddy and Karimnagar former ZP chairperson Tula Uma also resigned from the party. They are now set to join the BJP along with Eatala. Speaking at a press conference here, Eatala attacked chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao alleging there is no freedom for ministers and MLAs to function and that they are treated as ‘slaves’. He said he swears by his ‘atma gouravam’ (self-respect) and cannot tolerate humiliation any further. The former minister added that he was not KCR’s slave and moved along as a colleague during the Telangana statehood movement. With Eatala set to resign as MLA, Telangana will face yet another assembly byelection in the next six months. Sources said Eatala himself may contest on a BJP ticket. TRS is likely to field former MP and state planning board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar. Eatala was sacked from KCR’s cabinet on May 2 following allegations of land grabbing by his wife-owned Jamuna Hatcheries. Sources, however, said there was a growing rift between KCR and Eatala for some time. To the extent that KCR was unwilling to induct Eatala in the cabinet after winning the assembly election in 2018, but had later relented. “Before taking action on the allegations (of land grabbing), the CM removed me from the cabinet without seeking a clarification. Even a person facing death sentence is asked about his last wish before he is hanged. But, the CM acted on a complaint and completed the inquiry overnight,” Eatala said. “KCR wanted to bury me politically and deputed TRS leaders to Huzurabad.” Eatala said he was not allowed into Pragathi Bhavan thrice. He said the CM openly claimed in some meetings that he won’t mind being called a dictator and added there was no scope for a dictator to rule in a democratic country. “Being a minister, I faced humiliation and even Harish Rao faced a similar situation. He (CM) thinks we should keep quiet because he made us ministers, but a ministerial post is not greater than one’s self-respect,” the ex-minister said. He said the widening gulf between him and the party leadership had been there for the last five years. “The CM holds finance department review without the FM and health review meetings are held without the minister concerned. He thinks ministers and MLAs are his slaves.” Clarifying on the charge that he was aspiring for a bigger (CM) post, the former minister said he had never opposed KT Rama Rao as a CM candidate. “During the height of Telangana movement, the CM said he was ready for any sacrifice as only he and his wife were here in the state (son KTR and daughter Kavitha were in the US then) and asked people to stone him to death if he compromised on the movement. The TRS was born from the movement and is not run like a family party like Lalu Prasad’s or Mayawati’s parties. Telangana state was achieved with sacrifices of thousands of people and not with a handful of people,” he said. Targeting the CM further, he alleged KCR has least respect for BCs, STs and SCs and sought to know why there are no SC, ST and BC officers in the CMO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-snaps-20-yr-old-trs-ties-targets-kcr-to-quit-assembly/articleshow/83248652.cms||Koride Mahesh

The administration is strengthening the health infrastructure for the challenges of the third wave, in which the experts believe more children will be affected by the infection. “At civil hospital, we had planned to reserve 50 beds for the paediatric use. The number has now been increased to 100 beds,” said Dr Ashok Thorat, the civil surgeon. The increase in the number of beds is to ensure children coming from the rural areas – who may not be able to afford treatment in private hospitals — get a bed. Of the 100 beds, 25 will be reserved for Pediatric Intense Care Unit (PICU). Moreover, if the number of children infected with Covid increases, the Covid beds from other wards will also be converted for use. On the government level, the beds have been reserved for children across all the talukas so that the children find treatment at their taluka headquarters. The six sub-district hospitals (SDH) will have 25 beds each reserved for children, 22 rural hospitals (RH) will have 10 beds, besides 50 beds in Malegaon General Hospital. The private medical colleges at Adgaon and Igatpuri will also have about 100 beds. Thorat said since children have better immunity, they can fight the infection in a better manner. Despite large number of children being infected with Covid, the doctors hope to see fewer cases of children requiring to be admitted in hospitals or the ICU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/civil-hospital-to-have-100-beds-for-kids/articleshow/83240594.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The district reported 771 cases on Friday, which is the lowest number of cases after it started registered three digit figure from Wednesday. The district was reporting fresh cases in four digits before Wednesday. The number of fresh cases is consistently reducing from around 4,000 cases per day recorded during April and May. The number of active cases has also dropped significantly to 7,712 across the district. “The number of people, who are discharged from the hospitals after recovering, is now higher than the number of patients getting admitted. This has also contributed to the higher recovery rate of the district,” said Ahmednagar collector Rajendra Bhosle. The total number of people who have recovered from the contagion so far stands at 2.55 lakh, while the number of active cases is 7,712. As many as 3,385 patients have succumbed to the infection. The rate of recovery of the district is 95.86 %, which has increased during the past fortnight. Meanwhile, the collector has asked the officials to keep up the pace of tracing, testing, tracking and treating Covid patients across the district to ensure a decisive fight against the infection. The testing has been increased across the district along with the contact tracing so that the potential carriers of the infection do not skip the eye of the health department and thus help in containing the spread of the disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/in-ahmednagar-new-cases-drop-to-3-digits-since-april-5/articleshow/83240598.cms||---

In addition to the existing provision of Rs 100 crore, the revised budget earmarked Rs 50 crore to tourism department for marketing.

It will be started in Kollam, Kochi, Thalassery regions in the first phase. This project will be implemented at a cost of Rs 5 crore. The minister said that the spread of Covid was a setback to the tourism sector. “Tourism is a crucial sector in the GSDP of the state. This sector provides employment to 5 lakh people directly and 20 lakh people indirectly. In the first phase of Covid spread, the international tourism sector saw a decline of about 80%. This has reflected in the Kerala economy also. Covid’s second transmission and subsequent restrictions have wiped out the livelihoods of those in the tourism sector,” he said. The government is focusing on reviewing the post-Covid tourism potential and formulating long-term plans to ensure rapid growth in the sector, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/more-sops-to-revive-tourism/articleshow/83245430.cms||---

An IAS officer of the 1995 batch, Mopalwar retired on February 28, 2018. He had been heading MSRDC, and a day after his retirement, he was appointed on contract for a year. This was followed by subsequent extensions. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has approved the latest renewal of his contract for six months. As per an official order signed by public works secretary Ulhas Debadwar, Mopalwar is overseeing the prestigious Rs 55,000-crore Balasaheb Thackeray Nagpur Mumbai Samrudhi super expressway, which is in the final stages of completion. During the tenure of Devendra Fadnavis, former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan had levelled corruption charges against him following which former chief secretary Johny Joseph was asked to conduct a probe against him. Joseph gave him a clean chit, saying there was no substance in the allegations. Mopalwar’s fresh extension assumes political importance since it comes despite a strongly worded letter by minister Aslam Shaikh, who had urged the chief minister not to grant extension to retiring IAS officers as it demoralises serving bureaucrats. From the decision of the government, though, it appears Mopalwar wields considerable clout. “He is really a powerful bureaucrat. Despite the letter by a cabinet member, the chief minister has signed the extension proposal,’’ a senior cabinet member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-3-yrs-post-retirement-msrdc-chief-still-in-saddle/articleshow/83249805.cms||---

State energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said that Andhra Pradesh is far ahead of other states in terms of supplying quality and affordable power. “While some states are struggling to provide uninterrupted power, Andhra Pradesh stood first in the country in achieving cost-effective power at the national level,” said Srikant. The state government had earlier announced ‘renewable export policy’ for large scale promotion of renewable energy projects for export of power outside the state without any obligation to discoms. The policy is expected to attract investments for establishing wind, solar and wind-solar hybrid projects on a massive scale in the state. The state has also planned pumped hydro storage (PSP) projects with a capacity of 33,240 MW both on the river and off-river sites. These projects will help convert variable renewable energy sources into round-the-clock power. When the energy secretary briefed the energy minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy about the NITI Aayog report, the minister said that the significant progress in the sector in the last two years has become possible only with the strong support and guidance of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-tops-energy-category-in-niti-aayogs-sdg-index/articleshow/83243043.cms||---

He said a committee would be constituted under the Pune divisional commissioner, Saurabh Rao, to discuss the issue with warkaris and a report would be prepared in three-four days. “The chief minister will take the final decision,” the deputy chief minister said. Ajit Pawar hinted at easing of curbs in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation areas from Monday after assessing the Covid positivity rate — down to nearly 5%. Relaxation in curbs might be announced for Pune Cantonment Board and Khadki Cantonment Board areas also with a decline in cases, said Ajit Pawar. “There would be no concessions in the Dehu Cantonment Board area because of higher positivity rate,” he said, after the district’s Covid review meeting. — Nisha Nambiar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cm-to-decide-on-wari-says-ajit-pawar/articleshow/83248654.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Pune to be split into 3 units for unlocking: Divisional commissioner||PUNE: Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao on Friday said the district would be divided into three separate units — Pune Municipal Corporation areas, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits and Pune rural areas — while considering the possibility of relaxations and during the unlock process in the coming weeks. “The weekly positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen-supported beds would be considered separately for the three units for relaxations and orders would be issued separately for each of them,” said Rao. On Friday, the weekly positivity rate of the district was below 10% (9.3%). According to the health department’s data, the weekly positivity rate for the period May 27 to June 2 was 6.1% in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, 7% in (PCMC) areas and 13.4% in Pune rural areas. Districts and municipal corporations would be divided into five categories for opening-up, based on the positivity rate and the occupancy of oxygen-supported beds. These would be assessed weekly and the state government would announce the final decision. Rao, the Pune divisional commissioner, said all the three units — PMC, PCMC and Pune rural areas — have shown a decline in positivity rate with overall decline in weekly cases from the last week. “In the earlier week (May 20-26), the positivity rate in the PMC areas was 7.8%. It was 9.6% in the PCMC limits and 17.4% in the rural areas in the same period. This week, there has been a slight decline further,” he told TOI. He said 26.7% patients were in oxygen beds in the PMC areas, 13.28% in the PCMC limits and 13.39% in Pune rural areas. The overall average occupancy of oxygen beds for the district as on June 2 was 16.39%. A total of 48.52% patients were in home isolation in Pune district, 6.7% patients were undergoing treatment in ICUs and 4.45% patients were on ventilators as on June 2. Rao said, “While there has been a gradual decline in weekly cases in the last six weeks, we shall not be letting our guard down. We shall keep testing, tracking and tracing cases, besides keeping the infrastructure ready ahead of the possible third wave.” State technical advisor to the state government Dr Subhash Salunkhe said a close watch should be kept in all the three units, especially on areas showing a sudden rise in Covid cases. “While relaxations would be in place, extreme caution should be followed. Else, there could be a spurt in cases in the third week of June. Covid protocols should be followed strictly when the state is deciding on certain relaxations,” said Dr Salunkhe. He said less than 30% population’s vaccination in the community — because of short supply of doses from the Centre — was nowhere close to vaccine-induced herd immunity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dist-to-be-split-into-3-units-for-unlocking-div-commissioner/articleshow/83248646.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The government has also limited the number of slot searches per user on the portal, which is likely to prevent bots or browser extensions from automatically — and continuously — searching for slots. “The Captcha was originally introduced to deter distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, but it was proving to be an inconvenience for those booking slots. With technology advancing, simple Captchas can be tampered with and the introduction of more complex Captchas would have proved inconvenient to users,” the government official said. The official said additional security measures were now in place on the CoWIN portal. “The number of searches for a slot has now been restricted to 15-20, after which the portal will log the user out. This would prevent bots from playing with our systems and carrying out multiple searches at any point in time,” he said. In a recent report, TOI had highlighted how newly introduced browser extensions were being employed by coders to bypass the Captcha code feature on CoWIN, with claims that such programmes could automatically book appointments on the portal, including entering the code. Founders of apps and websites, which use CoWIN’s APIs to alert citizens about the availability of vaccination slots as soon as they open, said the additional security measures, introduced on the night of June 3, seemed to help people book slots manually. Ankita Garg, co-founder of Questrack, an app that sends vaccination availability alerts for more than 75 cities, including Mumbai and Pune, told TOI, “After the recent changes, the system will now automatically log a user out after 20 searches for slots on the website. The user will have to log in again to continue. The same rule is applicable to coders accessing CoWIN APIs. After 20 calls from the same account, that user will be logged out from the CoWIN portal.” “The recent security measures introduced by the government have had an immediate effect on bots. Right now, the bots are programmed to search fast and will hit this limit of 20 searches almost immediately. However, there is still the concern that this can be overcome by tweaking the scripts/extensions later,” programmer Berty Thomas, who developed ‘under45.in’, a website that sends Telegram alerts to users on slot availability on CoWIN, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-security-measures-on-cowin-website-negate-auto-booking-bots/articleshow/83248667.cms||Neha Madaan

The residents, who were staging sit-in protest on the premises of the medical college for the last three days, joined their duties at 9pm on Friday. “Mayo Hospital is ready for non-Covid patients now. We want to assure poor non-Covid patients will get good treatment in surgical complex building here. The stigma and fear of being a Covid Dedicated Hospital will be gone now,” said Dr Rajat Agrawal, president of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), at Mayo Hospital. Dr Keoliya issued a letter in which he has given 10-point assurances to the residents. Most important of them is that surgical complex building, which was earlier reserved for Covid-19 patients, will be handed over to non-Covid in-patient activity. New Covid-19 patients won’t be admitted in surgical complex. They will get beds in other buildings. Those who are admitted in Covid ICU will stay in surgical complex as it’s not possible to shift them. The letter issued by the dean has in detail explanation of how non-Covid services will be resumed in the surgical complex building in next few days. Operation theatres (OTs) will now be available for general surgery, ortho and ophthalmology specializations. The letter also has a mention that in case the number of Covid-19 patients increase in future, the complex will again be used for Covid service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mayo-gets-non-covid-duty-docs-call-off-stir/articleshow/83245454.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Finally, municipal commissioner Kailas Jadahv directed the health department of the NMC to cancel the licence of the hospital concerned. This is for the second time the NMC has taken such a decision where the licence of a private hospital has been cancelled for overcharging and recovering excess bills from Covid patients.

According to the industrial associations of Nashik, the daily requirement of over 1,000 industries, which depend on oxygen, is about 60 metric tonnes (MT) per day. However, they will be getting 22 MT as per the government directive. Due to strict restrictions and the non-availability of oxygen in the past two months, many industries have a huge pending workload. As restrictions have now been eased, these industries have to work overtime to deliver orders to their clients. Nikhil Panchal, the vice-president of the Ambad Industries & Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA) said the production of over 1,000 industrial units have been badly affected for the past months due to the closure of oxygen supply to the industries and diverting it for medical purpose. “But there has been a drop in demand for medical oxygen due to decline in Covid-19 cases. Even though the state government has allowed the release of 20% of the oxygen supply, it will not be enough for the industries,” he said. “The supply of oxygen should be varied as per the scenario in each of the districts in the state. As demand for medical oxygen is low in Nashik, we want the district authorities to release 50% of the oxygen for the industries,” he added.  Santosh Gawli, the general manager of the district industries centre (DIC), Nashik. said the instruction of the state government will be followed. “We had sought the requirement of oxygen from different industries in Nashik and 225 units had come forward stating that their requirement is around 8 MT per day,” said Gawli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/industries-in-nashik-unhappy-with-20-o2-supply/articleshow/83240645.cms||Tushar Pawar

A Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) official said unlike the sero-survey held last year, this round would be conducted solely by the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital officials. Last time, the PCMC and DY Patil Medical College and Hospital had jointly conducted the sero-survey. Pimpri Chinchwad mayor Usha alias Mai Dhore on Friday said both the high- and low-incidence zones of Covid in the twon towns would be covered in the sero-survey. A YCM hospital official told TOI that they wre preparing the pre-survey formalities and marking the zones to be covered. “The zones should give us a fair idea about the Covid infection. The fact that we now have vaccinated our senior citizens will give us a clear idea about the sero-prevelance in the ‘vulnerable’ age category.” The PCMC’s second sero-survey is comprehensive not only because of its sample size, which is double than the first round, but also for the fact that it would cover all eight zones of the civic body. The first sero-survey done in the PCMC limits was conducted in October 2020. The sameple size of the sero-survey was 5,000. The sero-survey had then found around 35% of sero-prevelance among the population in the twin towns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/second-sero-survey-in-twin-towns-this-month/articleshow/83248672.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: TRS hits back, says charges a pack of lies||HYDERABAD: Soon after Eatala Rajender quit TRS and accused CM K Chandrasekhar Rao of enslaving MLAs and ministers, the ruling party went on the offensive against the former minister saying that he had benefited a great deal politically at the cost of several senior leaders like Harish Rao in the party. The party said Eatala was made MLA for six terms, minister twice and party floor leader in the assembly in united Andhra Pradesh. Addressing a press conference, Rythu Bandhu Samithi chairman and MLC Palla Rajeshwar Reddy, MLA and government whip Guvvala Balaraju and MLC Balasani Laxmi Narayana refuted the rebel leader’s allegations that he was insulted by the CM by not allowing him into Pragathi Bhavan in 2016. Rajeshwar Reddy charged that Eatala lacked leadership qualities, but KCR gave him an MLA ticket and made him a leader. He was invited for all the meetings and he used to come late for some of them, including PM’s video-conference, the MLC said. The former minister is now talking about selfpride. How can he acquire assigned land of the poor which is illegal. He has more respect for his properties than the law of the land,” he said. On the probe into the assigned land issue, Rajeshwar Reddy, who is also TRS general secretary, said the government has to react to every petition filed by the common man and the CM has done the same by ordering a probe. Faulting Eatala, the TRS general secretary said if he had any suggestions to make about any government scheme, he should share them in the cabinet meetings but not air them in open forums. “Rythu Bandhu is one the best schemes announced by the state and even the Centre has adopted it. Many small and marginal farmers have benefited from the scheme. Only 6,000 among the beneficiaries have huge extent of the land,” Rajeshwar Reddy clarified, rebutting Eatala’s charges that the scheme was helping the rich land owners. He also said Telangana state was realised only because of the efforts of KCR. “There may be numerous leaders, but KCR towers over every leader. Eatala was not the only MLA to quit his post during the statehood movement, several other MLAs quit, including KCR,” he recalled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-hits-back-says-charges-a-pack-of-lies/articleshow/83248673.cms||---

The MSP was raised to Rs 170 per kg from the earlier Rs 150 per kg in the previous budget by T M Thomas Issac and the farmers were to get the subsidy from April 1. The market rate of natural rubber has now reached Rs 170, thus making the MSP announced in the previous budget irrelevant now.

---||India||CJI plans national corporation to modernise judicial infrastructure||NEW DELHI: To shore up the justice delivery system, groaning under the burden of over three crore pending cases, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana has unveiled an ambitious plan to set up a National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation (NJIC) to build modern and self-sufficient judicial infrastructure across India. In the two-day-long deliberations with high court chief justices in four sessions on June 1 and 2, the CJI said poor infrastructure was proving to be a major stumbling block in delivery of justice and shared his vision for creation of NJIC, which according to him would be tasked to build “comprehensive, self-contained, all-inclusive and modern court complexes across the country to augment judicial infrastructure”. Though most CJIs in the past two decades have highlighted the deficient infrastructure, especially in smaller towns and rural areas, as a major stumbling block for speedy delivery of justice, the judiciary had always remained dependent on the mercy of state and central governments for grants to augment its infrastructure, including the use of information technology. The proposal for creation of NJIC appears timely, but much will depend on what characteristics it will have in its final shape and the command under which it will build modern court complexes. Justice Ramana’s plan envisages that the NJIC will be managed by a CJI-led committee comprising SC judges who would become CJIs in future. The NJIC managing committee will also include finance secretaries to the Union/state governments and HC CJs having long tenures. Under the new proposal, states would be required to fund modern court complexes through a one-time grant. The pandemic-caused disruption of physical hearings and courts functioning virtually has given rise to the urgent need for augmenting the video-conferencing systems in trial courts, especially in rural areas with links to litigants. Some HC CJs suggested mobile vans to establish connections between courts and rural populations. The CJI agreed to examine the feasibility of the proposals and integrate them as part of the modern court complex infrastructure. Justice Ramana said, “I am of the firm belief that unless infrastructure is strengthened, it is unfair to expect courts, particularly lower courts, to do miracles and increase the pace of justice delivery. Both quality and quantity of justice delivery can be improved only when support systems are strong enough to meet the challenges.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cji-plans-national-corporation-to-modernise-judicial-infrastructure/articleshow/83250724.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The lab was formally inaugurated on May 31 and tests started from Thursday. Many advanced hormone-related tests can be conducted in this laboratory. Especially, it will be of a great benefit for diabetes patients. “Diabetes has already emerged as the biggest threat for India. We are experiencing the ill-effects of diabetes in the form of mucormycosis among Covid-cured patients. Early diagnosis, good monitoring and control is possible with advanced tests which could be conducted in this lab,” said Dr Sudhir Gupta, GMCH dean. The lab will conduct tests like HbA1c, which provides estimate of average blood glucose (sugar) levels for the last two to three months. This is an important blood test that gives a good indication of how well diabetes is being controlled. “Earlier, patients had to conduct these tests out in private labs where they are very costly. In GMCH, they will be available at government rates,” added Dr Gupta. Chief executive officer of GMCH Dr Milind Fulpatil said the GMCH receives patients from financially weaker sections and from rural areas. The lab will provide much needed relief to them. Dr Parimal Tayade said human resource from the pathology department of the super specialty hospital will initially help running this lab. Another important benefit of the lab will be to the patients with hormonal imbalance. Hormones affect numerous systems in the body, including development of male and female sexual characteristics, fertility, growth, energy consumption, digestion, glucose utilization, stress response, fluid/water balance, bone metabolism, and maintenance of proper blood pressure. Hormonal tests could be conducted in this lab. One lab, many benefits Many advanced hormone-related tests can be done at GMCH now Diabetics will get more benefits, as tests like HbA1c will be done Such tests cost a lot in private labs, but will be charged at govt rates in GMCH Many tests of anaemia, hormonal imbalance patients will be done in the lab Will help a lot for sugar control in rural/financially weaker section patients Eventually, will reduce incidence of sugar-triggered illnesses like mucormycosis||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gmch-nagpur-1st-in-state-to-start-endocrinology-lab/articleshow/83245538.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Along with putting to use huge number of waste plastic bottles, this vertical garden campaign has been able to plant thousands of plants of different varieties on the walls of the buildings. Against all odds, about 30,000 plants have bloomed on the walls of eight vertical gardens of the city. Buoyed by the success, dozens of vertical gardens are being setup in Ludhiana district across different types of buildings of religious places, schools and government departments. The biggest vertical garden of the city is at the IT department’s Rishi Nagar office, which boasts of 13,000 plants on its walls and which have given the building such unique look that it has inspired and motivated visitors, specially officials of other departments who have got these vertical gardens installed in other cities and places after taking guidance from the IT officials here. The second biggest vertical garden comprising about 8,000 plants is showing results at Dukhniwaran Sahib Gurdwara. Both the gurdwara committee and the devotees look after the project, adding new varieties of saplings. According to gurdwara authorities, the garden has improved the aesthetics of the premises. Another major vertical garden of the city is the one at Ludhiana railway station, where 2,000 saplings have survived the hustle and bustle of a busy public space. The vertical garden at Indra Hoseiry’s Sarabha Nagar outlet too is the talk of the town and this garden of about 1,800 plants has become a selfie point for the Ludhiana residents. The garden at DAV Public School BRS Nagar, Satpaul Mittal School, Punjabi Bhawan and Arya College are also among the most successful ones in the city and having considerable number of plants and waste bottles. According to Rohit Mehra, additional commissioner of income tax, said, who had initially pushed the vertical garden concept, “It gives immense sense of pride and happiness that the campaign that was started on income tax day four years ago has gone on to become a movement. The impact of this movement is not only seen in Punjab, but all over India. As of now, more than 2,00,000 plants have managed to survive and bloom in the waste plastic bottles in Punjab and other states. The biggest projects we have done so far outside of Ludhiana include that of 25,000 plants at Sri Harminder Sahib in Amritsar. We have also been able to establish vertical gardens at IIT-Jammu, Roorkee Jail, Saket district and sessions court and Takht Sri Damdama Sahib, to name but a few.” According to Mehra, the green team of IT department is available 24x7 to assist people with vertical gardens — from giving them tips on maintenance of the gardens to keep them updated about the new techniques and seasonal advisories. Pritpal Singh Pali, president of the managing committee of Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib, said, “We are greatful to the IT department, specially B K Jha and Rohit Mehra. The best part of vertical garden is that it has fulfilled our wish of having a garden in our gurdwara premises even though there’s not much space.” According to Sanjay Jain, owner of Indra Hosiery, “We feel blessed to be part of this noble initiative under which we have been given the chance of doing our bit for the environment and city. The real value of plants and oxygen is being realised by entire human race during this Covid-19 crisis and I think more people should come forward and take up this vertical garden campaign, which is far better than the traditional ways of the mass plantations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ludhs-foray-into-vertical-gardens-is-paying-green-dividends/articleshow/83243131.cms||Mohit Behl

It has decided to depute government officials on board local fishing boats for intelligence gathering. The administration has also decided to monitor local fishing boats and crews and to give out instructions to intensify checking of motorized and other passenger vessels reaching Lakshadweep. The decisions were taken following a meeting held on May 28, 2021, for reviewing the security of the islands. The meeting was held under the chairmanship of the principal secretary-cum-advisor to the administrator. “Necessary action should be taken to strengthen ship or vessel berthing points and helibase by installing CCTV cameras,” states the order. The order issued by the department of port shipping and aviation further stated that all the employees under the officials concerned may be sensitized and briefed on the matter and asked to report on any kind of suspicious activity/movement to the superior concerned at the earliest. Meanwhile, the district disaster management authority in the UT on Friday issued a set of directives for mitigation of the spread of the pandemic and to ensure general cleanliness and hygiene in all inhabited islands. The directions include scientific disposal of tender coconut shells, tree leaves, coconut husk, shell and trunks by landowners. Disposal by burning of any type of solid waste on road sides, beaches and open places is prohibited. Residents should maintain their peripheral area of 25m radius of their household litter free or else responsibility shall be fixed on dwelling house/resident, if found littered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fresh-guidelines-issued-for-security-in-lakshadweep/articleshow/83243136.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The study, which focussed on Varanasi, also states that the Delta variant is a dominant strain in other parts of India too. Incidentally, the Delta variant was last month declared as the variant of concern (VoC) by the Public Health England, a UK government agency dealing with health, and is currently linked to the threat of a third wave in the United Kingdom. Back home, the delta variant’s ancestor B.1.617, first discovered in Maharashtra and erroneously dubbed as the double mutant, was responsible along with another strain for the second wave in India. B.1.617 has almost disappeared after giving rise to three more variants – B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3. Of these, B.1.617.2 is the variant of concern. The WHO recently renamed it as Delta variant, delinking it from the geographical area where it was first detected. Researchers from Banaras Hindu University and Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology collaboratively sequenced genomes of coronavirus variants in Varanasi and adjoining areas. The study reported at least seven major strains circulating in these regions. The multidisciplinary research unit at BHU collected samples from Varanasi and areas around the city, mostly in April 2021. The team at the CCMB sequenced these samples and found out that there were at least seven major variants circulating in the region. As many as130 samples were sequenced as part of the research study. “Among the Variants of Concern (VoC), the most predominant variant we found in our study was B.1.617.2. This variant was also reported to be one of the major drivers of the second Covid-19 wave in India”, said prof Royana Singh, who heads the multidisciplinary research unit. CCMB advisor Dr Rakesh Mishra said the study confirmed again that the Delta variant is the most widespread variant in the country. “But, it is imperative to keep an eye on the other emerging variants in the country to prevent another unprecedented surge of cases,” he added. He said just as in most parts of India, the B.1.617.2 variant was the most common one in the samples studied. It was found among 36% of the total samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/delta-variant-most-widespread-in-india/articleshow/83248689.cms||Syed Akbar

The civic body has since received over 100 registrations for the drive via its mobile application. A civic official said that they vaccinated two bedridden citizens on June 1 and they returned the vials to the nearest functional vaccination site after the inoculation. The team members observed the beneficiaries for 30 minutes, said the official. Now that the civic body has been receiving a considerable number of registrations, the teams will be deployed in shortlisted areas. Vikas Dhakane, additional commissioner, PCMC, said, “The team is ensuring that the vials opened to vaccinate bedridden citizens are used in a responsible manner so as to avoid any wastage.” Dhakane said that the civic body’s mobile application Me Jababdar, offers citizens an easier option to register their relatives for vaccination. “We accumulate the data and prepare a roadmap so that the process is smooth,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-starts-vaccinating-ailing-bedridden-citizens/articleshow/83248691.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Pune||Private hospitals in Pune conduct maximum inoculation||PUNE: Vaccination data of the last two days revealed that private hospitals were doing the maximum inoculations in the district, as against the government sites that are administering half or less this number. District health authorities’ data showed that 20,537 jabs were on Wednesday administered in private hospitals as against 3,725 at government sites. On Thursday, the private sites administered over 22,878 doses as against 13,821 by the government sites. A couple of top private hospitals in Pune city TOI spoke to said they were doing almost 2,000-3,000 inoculations a day. The data spread over a couple of days are a sharp contrast to the all-India picture, which recently showed that private centres accounted for barely 7.5% of total doses administered till May 30. A district health official told TOI, “In rural areas too, private hospitals are doing higher vaccinations (70%). One of the issues is procurement, as the government sites have sporadic access to vaccines. The government sites are giving priority to citizens due for second dose, mostly in the 45+ age group.”  An official said some private hospitals in Pune had better access to one of the vaccine manufacturing companies, which is why they were getting higher supplies while hospitals in some other districts in Maharashtra may not have this advantage. “Of the 50% vaccine quota that can be directly purchased by the state governments and private hospitals, the state’s limited supply also goes to government sites across Maharashtra,” an official said. Another district health official said, “On Friday, 125 private sites and 290 government sites administered jabs in the district. Private sites are carrying out higher number of vaccinations not only because of limited stock with government facilities but also because second dose beneficiaries among healthcare and frontline workers have not been coming forward to get their pending doses. This was also reducing vaccination numbers at government centers. Those who got their first doses in January and February are being followed up for second jabs on priority.” The official said only if its performance (i.e. fully vaccinating those due for second doses) is good, the district could get better vaccine supplies in the future. “On the other hand, private hospitals are allowed to give first doses to both the 18-44 and 45+ categories. This is driving the numbers,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/private-hosps-conduct-maximum-inoculation/articleshow/83248684.cms||Neha Madaan

In a year, they have lost every loved one bringing them up — father, mother and both grandparents. District officials said under the new government scheme, while financial assistance will be arranged, the children will continue to live alone in their house at Lisadh with a relative checking in on them from time to time. Disappointed, their lives in disarray, Samarpit, just a teenager himself, said he will step up and raise his siblings. Their father was a farmer with nine bigha land and five buffaloes. The three were bright and diligent students at the local school. In April last year, just into the lockdown, their father got Covid-19. Treatment didn’t work and he passed away. The family was still coping with the loss when their grandparents died in quick succession in December. Before they could recover, they were struck another blow — the second wave hit and claimed their mother in the last week of April. There is a lot to be done. The farm and cattle have to be managed, the finances sorted, but they have no one around to help them. The closest relative they have is a maternal uncle in Muzaffarnagar, who would visit occasionally. “Tragedy has befallen us. But we are dealing with it together. I will try my best that my siblings’ education is not impeded. I will work hard and look after them,” Samarpit told TOI. The villagers they have known and grown up around have been in touch with the district administration to secure their future. “All four elders of the family are gone. These little kids have been orphaned. We appeal to the government to take care of these children until they become adults,” Shyam Singh, a local, told TOI. When asked why the children have not been rehabilitated, district probation officer Prasoon Rai told TOI, “We are aware of their status. Among various provisions in the government order (under the Mukhya Mantri Bal Seva Yojana) which came into effect only two days ago, the one best suited to them is a monthly assistance of Rs 4,000.” Under the new scheme, boys only younger than 10 who have no guardians will be rehabilitated, which rules Samarpit and Shankar out. For minor girls, the government had said it would arrange their stay in schools being set up by the government. So, Meena will not be moved because, technically, they have a guardian. Rai added, “They will stay in their own house. Their maternal uncle (from Muzaffarnagar) will be declared their guardian to check on them and their property. Members of the Child Welfare Committee will monitor if they are doing alright.” (Names have been changed to protect identity.)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/covid-orphan-13-says-he-will-raise-minor-siblings-12-11/articleshow/83243144.cms||Sandeep Rai

He even injured himself to authenticate his story, police said. Identified as Shaukeen, the man is the driver of a cattle trader of village Baghra under Titavi police station. On Thursday, he allegedly created a ruckus, claiming that five criminals had taken away the money after beating him up. He had been sent by his employer to collect the money from a trader in village Umarpur. Police immediately cordoned off the area to nab the culprits. A search was launched to arrest the culprits but to no avail. Each vehicle was checked at all the exit points in the district. While questioning Shaukeen, police became suspicious as he made several inconsistent statements. Under sustained questioning, he broke down and confessed that he made up the story to keep the money. Radheshyam Yadav, station house officer of the Titavi police station, said, “Shaukeen allegedly made up the story because he wanted to keep Rs 45,000. The money has been recovered and action is being taken against him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-injures-self-to-claim-he-was-attacked-robbed-of-rs-45k-arrested-as-cops-call-his-bluff/articleshow/83243165.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rift over a proposal to unlock reveals disquiet in Cong camp||Mumbai: Cracks are surfacing in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government over the Sharad Pawar-led NCP and Shiv Sena’s inability to establish a working rapport with the Congress.This has shown up in statements by Congress ministers, which diverge from the government’s overall position. The latest was relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar’s comments that the lockdown would be lifted immediately in a graded manner. It prompted the CM’s office to issue a denial saying no decision had been taken yet. Wadettiwar has defended himself saying a hue and cry was being made about his statements though the proposal was discussed in the CM’s presence. In his defence, it was pointed out that public health minister Rajesh Tope, who belongs to NCP, routinely makes announcements on many lockdown-related matters and even on unrelated subjects like the SSC exam schedule despite the fact he does not head the concerned departments.“Wadettiwar has explained the circumstances to revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat (the seniormost Congress minister in the government),” said a source. Thorat conceded to TOI that Wadettiwar had spoken in haste on plans to lift the lockdown despite the fact that no final decision had been taken. “The convention is that after the proposal is submitted to the government, it is examined by the state level task force and then the CM makes the announcement. In the present case, it appears Wadettiwar made the announcement at his own level without waiting for the CM. There was breach of convention,” Thorat said.However, the perception that the Congress is being bypassed or denied its say in matters of governance continues to rankle the party. The issue crops up even with allocation of funds or subsidies for Congress-led departments. Recently, a move to abolish reservations in promotion to government posts was seen to be orchestrated by NCP without consultation. A headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar with Nitin Raut, K C Padvi and Varsha Gaikwad as members, has been set up to examine the issue, but the decision to abolish the quota was taken without involving it.The move came in the wake of the Supreme Court striking down the Maratha quota and was seen as an attempt to placate the community which forms a considerable chunk of the NCP’s support base. A senior Congress minister said, “It was a shocking decision, we have lodged a protest, but so far it has not been reversed.”The opposition meanwhile sees the frequent discord in the ruling coalition as a sign of confusion and indecisiveness in policy-making. BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Friday took a dig at the MVA government, saying while there is only one chief minister in the state, there are many “super chief ministers” who make announcements about key policy decisions on their own.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rift-over-a-proposal-to-unlock-reveals-disquiet-in-cong-camp/articleshow/83248709.cms||---

The last date for filing the bids was Friday, but none of the pharma companies came forward, officials said. Vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca (UK) and representatives of Sputnik V, the Russian vaccine, had earlier participated in the pre-bid meeting, health department officials said. They sought clarifications about supply schedule, cold chain and payment methods. “It seems production shortage was the reason for the companies not coming forward for bidding. After the supply improves, the government may go for another bidding in August,” a top official said. But Friday’s development comes as blow to Telangana’s hopes of buying vaccines to meet the requirement in the state. “We require four crore doses to vaccinate all, and so far, little over 63 lakh people have got the jabs in the state. So, we need more vaccines and that too in a short period of time,” the official said. Many states, including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Odisha and Uttarakhand have invited global tenders saying they need to procure directly to bridge the shortage of vaccines. The Telangana government had invited global tenders through Telangana State Medical Services and Infrastructure Development Corporation (TSMSIDC) to buy one crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines from the manufacturers or their agents in case of imported jabs. And with Pfizer and Moderna saying they would negotiate only with the Centre, the Telangana government’s hopes of procuring vaccines from global players diminished further. Bharat Biotech, the maker of Covaxin, has stayed away from the entire process altogether.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-govts-global-bid-to-procure-vaccines-directly-draws-a-blank/articleshow/83248707.cms||---

Finance minister K N Balagopal said that Covid transmission has caused various mental health problems and anxiety regarding the future in children and parents. From tele/online counselling to incorporating yoga and other exercises as part of the ongoing digital classes, the budget proposes a slew of measures to enhance the well-being and immunity of students. It proposed the constitution of a committee comprising educational, health and social experts for conducting a detailed study on the subject. Steps will be taken to promote creativity of children, exhibit their art and craft works and telecast the selected works through KITE Victers channel. Unlike the previous budget, there is no major allocation for the general educational sector this time. However, Rs 10 crore has been earmarked for incorporating virtual reality and artificial intelligence, aimed at improving the quality of digital classes. Along with classes on Victers channel, online classes led by teachers will also be organized. Also, 2 lakh laptops will be distributed to students in a time-bound manner through a scheme formulated by KSFE. Knowledge economy Acknowledging that a rapid transformation towards a knowledge society is essential in Kerala today, the budget reiterated the previous budget’s focus on developing a knowledge economy with the active participation of Kerala Development and Innovation Strategic Council (K-Disc). The FM said that the government aims to rebuild the education system to develop the capacity for knowledge creation in the new environment. A skill-oriented approach in education is needed to create an impact in the local and global job sectors. K-Disc will lead the ‘Knowledge Economy Mission’ and the allocation for ‘knowledge economy fund’ for skill promotion, technological transformation and strengthening the higher education system has been increased from Rs 200 crore to Rs 300 crore. “ A high-power commission will be constituted to examine our education system and submit a report within three months containing practical recommendations to reorganize it,” Balagopal said. The budget also allocated an additional Rs 10 crore to provide basic facilities to the recently-started Sree Narayana Guru Open University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/students-physical-mental-wellness-get-more-thrust/articleshow/83245613.cms||---

This week, the state general administration department, headed by CM Uddhav Thackeray, promoted 69 desk officers to under-secretary of which 36 were from backward classes and the rest from open category. The order stated that these are ‘temporary promotions’ subject to the final verdict of the SC, so the officers may have to demote to his or her earlier post. The GAD, on May 7, two days after the Supreme Court quashed the Maratha quota, issued an order saying that all the promotion posts will be filled only by seniority and without keeping 33% posts vacant for the ‘reservation in promotion’, but subject to the final verdict of the SC.

However, local residents and activists said that the facilities on the ground are not adequate. “No government hospital has been declared a Covid-dedicated facility for critical patients in the district so far. The government did arrange for ventilators ahead of the Kumbh mela but no staff was recruited to operate them, so the machines were moved to private hospitals,” RM Dobhal, a local social activist, alleged. He added that the district does not have a single RT-PCR testing lab. “How were 15 lakh tests conducted then?

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: With SSC results due month-end, teachers want to travel by train for assessment||MUMBAI: Teachers carrying out evaluation of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) students to help finalise their results are unable to reach their schools as they are not allowed to travel by trains. Last week, the state announced that SSC results will be declared based on a 50:50 formula. Class 9 and 10 teachers had to report to their schools for tabulation of marks from June 1. Teachers from far flung suburbs like Kalyan-Dombivli, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Palghar have complained to the state about their travel difficulties. A large number of teachers from distant suburbs teach in Mumbai schools. TimesViewEducation minister has demanded ‘frontline workers’ status for teachers to ensure priority vaccination. Along with that, they need to be listed under essential category to be able to travel by Mumbai’s lifeline. The state needs to address this issue considering several teachers are coming from far away places. Any delay will only stretch the wait for SSC results.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, suburban trains are strictly for essential services. Teachers do not fall in the category. “I could not purchase a pass or ticket to travel to my school in Goregaon. Travel by road is not a viable option for me,” said a teacher from Vasai. Though schools are awaiting clear guidelines from the state on the evaluation method, subject teachers have begun tabulating marks of students in class 9 and 10. “A section of teachers have left the city for summer vacation. Those around are finding it difficult to commute. Teachers should be permitted to travel by trains, else the assessment work will be delayed,” said the principal of a Byculla school. Rajesh Pandya, VP of the Teachers Democratic Front said that for assessment purposes teachers should be included in the essential services list for SSC assessment work. “The state wants to declare the result by month-end but nothing has been done to ensure that teachers get to schools,” said Pandya.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala budget opens up countercyclical window?||In his maiden budget, KN Balagopal offers a ‘care economy vaccine’ to address the double negatives that have emerged in the Covid context. Balagopal has attempted to scale up the state’s health and care economy, while stimulating the regional economy. Knowing well that it would be counterproductive to impose taxes when the aggregate demand is weak, the budget has not attempted the same, though the tax potential has not fully dried up. With the second economic package worth Rs 20,000 crores, which is a first in India and equivalent to last year’s relief package, Kerala government has proved time and again how it takes care of the vulnerable social sections during a crisis. Equally important are the three major components of the package of which ‘health first’ is assured (Rs 2,800 crore) by taking precautionary measures for the cyclical occurrence of Covid-19. The livelihood and welfare component (Rs 8,900 crore) and the rejuvenating component, in the form of loans, interest subsidies, are preserved (Rs 8,300 crore). It was further supplemented with coastal developments, scaling up of MSMEs, diversification of plantations, livestock developments and so on. Further, there is a renewed focus on cooperatives and banks. Despite unfavourable conditions, the finance minister has opened up opportunities in imaginative forms. A few examples are worth citing. In the agri sector that has registered a significant negative growth over the past one year, there is a clear shift from crop credit to investment credit which would be realized through Kerala Bank and potential investors with government support. This would not only help Kerala Bank scale up the otherwise declining credit growth in state but also boost value-addition processes and manufacturing sectors aimed at domestic and international markets. This would certainly boost a new responsible entrepreneurship here, apart from assuring food security. Given that Kerala is characterized by a knowledge society, which is yet to be transformed into a knowledge economy, the importance given to upgradation of higher education, digital innovation and multi-skilling though K-Disc and so on, thanks to KIIFB, has the potential to make the state a knowledge hub. This will benefit not only the educated youth but also women, whose low labour force participation is still a constraint in the way of advancement of the economy. The new finance minister is fortunate enough to have access to revenue deficit grants of 15th finance commission —worth Rs 19,891 crore this year— and grants to health in particular and a provision for additional borrowing within FRBM regulations. The state would also be eligible for GST compensation worth Rs 4,500 crore. New sources of tax could obviously be identified and tax revenue could also be scaled up by improving the efficiency of tax collection. Covid crisis is also a moral economy crisis and the only government, which could be ideologically sensitive to this, would be a Left-leaning one. This is reflected in the current budget. Yet, the challenge of addressing the ‘scissors crisis’, increasing divergence between government’s revenue and expenditure, is a challenge that Left government faces yet again in its second term.

Health department officials said that the positivity rate has gone below 2% in the state on Friday. Also, the occupancy rate at various government and private hospitals has fallen below 45%. Doctors also claimed that there was a drop in mucormycosis cases. With the continued dip in daily infections, active cases and the consequent fall in hospital occupancy, medical staff has been able to utilise essential resources such as remdesivir injections, oxygen and other required medicines properly. “Earlier, we were facing a crisis for remdesivir and other injections,” said Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent of RUHS. “We had to struggle to get our quota of oxygen every day. But for the past one week, we have had ample oxygen, life-saving injections and, most importantly, we now have at least 55% beds available,” said Dr Singh. Jaipur recorded only 203 new Covid cases and eight deaths on Friday. “Active cases have decreased to 5,118 in Jaipur. We are now focusing on reducing the mortality rate. Despite this dip, I still urge people to continue following Covid appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. He also said that there has been a dip in black fungus cases. “The number of patients coming to the hospital since last week has gone down. This will enable us to utilise resources properly and judiciously and prevent complications among these patients,” Bhandari said.

---||Ludhiana||Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh’s Congress battle: From support to dossiers on MLAs||JALANDHAR: The challenges that Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh is facing, while struggling to stay in the saddle for the 2022 assembly polls and fighting the perception battle, is a study in contrast to the level of support he enjoyed in 2015, when he was trying to take control of the party in Punjab and his own projection as the CM for the 2017 elections. Captain Amarinder was not even the Punjab Congress president, the post he lost to Partap Singh Bajwa after the party suffered a consecutive poll defeat in 2012, when he launched “Mission 2017” in the middle of 2015 and had the support of around three dozen MLAs. In contrast, when Congress has 80 MLAs and he is in power, the number of legislators and ministers who have spoken up openly in his support during the ongoing crisis barely make a dozen. It was his huge victory from the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat in 2014 when he defeated senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley that pushed his stock high and by the next year, he was out to oust Bajwa, with most of the Congress MLAs rallying around him. According to party sources, out of 44 MLAs around 36 had openly sided with him after he launched “Mission 2017” from the Jalandhar Cantt constituency. Then District Congress Committee president Jagbir Brar and two other leaders, including an MLA, even had to face a show-cause notice for anti-party activities on the eve of this function. “Mission 2017” was parallel to the mass contact programme started by Bajwa. The then Congress Legislature Party leader Sunil Jakhar had even offered to give up his post to make way for Amarinder to be the PPCC chief. It was during this time that the ‘Majha Brigade’ – a group of MLAs from the Majha region – emerged as Amarinder’s strongest strength. Now, from this ‘brigade’ only Sukhbinder Singh ‘Sukh’ Sarkaria spoke up for him and sought action against Navjot Sidhu before becoming quiet. Another ‘brigade’ member Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa even had a meeting with Sidhu. In September 2015, there was speculation in the political circles that Amarinder may even launch his own regional party and he (Amarinder) even took potshots at Rahul Gandhi. It was with this strength, popularity, and clarity that Amarinder finally made the party high command yield and he was appointed Punjab Congress president in November 2015. That was then. After Sidhu started questioning the CM and party colleague Pargat Singh joined in, seven ministers and around half-a-dozen MLAs have spoken up for him and against Sidhu till now. Most have preferred to stay quiet or confined themselves to whispering within party circles instead of openly taking sides. However, now reportedly dossiers on MLAs have replaced the popular support from them. Pargat was on record alleging he received a threatening call from one of the CM’s key aides, that papers had been collected about him and he could face some inquiry for speaking up. Minister Charanjit Channi too faced a similar warning from a different quarter. On the eve of his meeting with the three-member panel set up by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, three MPs, two MLAs, and two ministers huddled with the CM at Delhi on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/capts-battle-within-party-from-support-to-dossiers-on-mlas/articleshow/83256566.cms||IP Singh
---||Kolkata||Monsoon may hit Kolkata late next week||KOLKATA: A low pressure in north Bay of Bengal is likely to end the scorching summer in Kolkata and south Bengal and usher in monsoon rains by June 12-13. The low-pressure is set to form on June 11 — which is the official date for the arrival of monsoon in Kolkata and adjoining south Bengal — and quickly develop into a monsoon depression which will bring in the rainy season in the region, said the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Alipore on Friday. Monsoon arrived in Kerala on June 3. There is a good chance of ‘moderate to heavy showers’ in and around Kolkata between June 11 and 13, according to weathermen. “This system will usher in monsoon in the city and its neighbourhood. The system is yet to form so it’s still too early to predict the volume of rain. But we expect heavy rain to usher in monsoon,” said RMC director GK Das. While last year, monsoon had arrived in Kolkata a day late — on June 12, it had been delayed by 10 days in 2019. Even though it’s on time this year, this doesn’t reflect on the possible volume of rain for the entire season. “We are just heading for the beginning of monsoon and there can’t be any prediction for the month or even the first week of monsoon. Usually, June is the driest of the monsoon months in Kolkata while July is the wettest. The pattern, however, is often broken,” said Das. Monsoon in Bengal is by driven low-pressures forming over Bay of Bengal. More frequent low-pressures increase the volume of rain. “So, there are dry periods interspersed with wet spells. Often, we have a relatively dry monsoon month, followed by a period of very heavy rain which makes up the deficit,” said Das. Meanwhile, Kolkata will remain dry and warm over the next 48 hours with chances of thunderstorms triggered by the heat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/monsoon-may-hit-city-late-next-week/articleshow/83245649.cms||---

Retired IAS officer Vijay Bansal, who is currently the president of the board of trustees, told TOI,“With consistent restrictions during the past year due to the Covid pandemic, it has become difficult to afford basic maintenance costs. We are also struggling to pay salaries of staff members.” The library, which has has a collection of 45,000 books on a wide range of subjects, was established by a retired postmaster, Khushi Ram in 1921, who donated his life’s savings and all the books he owned to set it up. In October this year, the library will complete 100 years of its existence. The library’s trustees have urged the state government, its existing members and all those who love to read, to do their bit in preserving its rich history. “Our trustees, patrons and life members have already come forward with generous contributions to keep the dream of Mahatma Khushi Ram alive and the hopes of our younger generation intact,” Bansal said, adding that they are appealing to “the state government as well as the general public to come forward at this difficult time and support the library.” He further said that “many activities and developments had been envisaged by the board of trustees during the library’s centennial year” for which help was required. “We plan to modernise, upgrade and add more features for the benefit of the reading public, students and research scholars of Dehradun town in particular and the whole of Uttarakhand in general. Our multi-purpose community hall needs to be air-conditioned for heat and cold; it needs to be properly furnished and equipped with digital audio/video facilities. There is also an urgent need to improve the entry, driveway, parking and general landscape besides improvement in upkeep of valuable books, reading rooms and the newly-added author’s lounge.” "The library is registered under Section 80 G of the Income Tax Act and donors can claim exemption from payment of income tax against donations made by them," Bansal said. He added that “there was a need for providing a small elevator or lift for senior citizens and bringing self-sufficiency in electricity and water by providing solar panels and rain-water harvesting is also envisaged depending upon availability of funds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/iconic-mahatma-khushi-ram-library-in-doon-struggling-to-survive-trustees-ask-govt-book-lovers-for-help/articleshow/83267142.cms||Abhijeet Singh

---||Pune||Pune: Learning on correction course after year’s slide||PUNE: Right through the pandemic, except for a very short time, school closures have been common with their costs insufficiently known till now. But, a new study District Institute of Education and Training Pune (DIET) shows that students made little or no progress while learning from home and the loss of learning was more pronounced. Close to 90% of parents with their wards studying in primary classes and 94% of their teachers in the Pune district have said that the students have suffered a learning loss in the 2020-21 academic year. This survey by the District Institute of Education and Training Pune (DIET) covered 15 talukas of Pune district with 14,320 parents and teachers participating. The final report titled ‘Learning Loss Recovery Programme’, is probably the first such initiative by any district to guage and compensate to some extent the learning loss for students in the context of Marathi and mathematics and to guide parents on how to help them cope. The report recommends the need for keeping the initial months of the new academic year reserved for revision of the previous year’s topics. As per the programme, the teachers are supposed to download the classwise PDF files made available to them on the common link and send these weekly learning materials to the parents of the students in their class who have access to online devices. An online meeting of such parents should be held to guide them on how to take this forward. For those parents with no online access, a weekly photocopy of these activities should be made available and parents should be guided on how to use them through home visits. Every Saturday, parents will be sent an online test based on the weekly material. It should be solved by the students. For parents who are not able to go online, the photocopy of this test will be sent by the teacher. Even if the school starts on June 15 in the new academic year, parents should continue to take these actions for their children, says the report. Divisional head of DIET Rajesh Bankar said, “The motive of this exercise was to reduce the learning loss that students were facing. We felt that if we do not identify the losses and provide a way forward, then there could be major troubles in teaching-learning process in the upcoming academic year.” The institute has prepared PDF files of various activities in language and maths that would motivate and inspire the students and make a positive change in the personality of students, Bankar said. The entire learning loss programme is recommended by DIET to the students of Std I to VIII at present for students in Pune district and could also be replicated by other districts. The programme is scheduled for May 31 to July 11. The elements included in learning, reading, elocution, communication and writing abilities in language subjects and for Maths based on every standard number activities like multiplication, division, addition and subtraction modules are prepared. The government must ensure quick and effective implementation of DIET Pune’s LLRP program across the state, said Mayur Shinde, convenor, Action for the Rights of the Child (ARC) Pune. “The LLRP provides guidelines for the teachers and parents to continue the education of the children in case the schools do not reopen or partially reopen in the next academic year. The programme suggests involving educated parents and community youth as volunteers to support the parents in educating their children. Local NGOs can be involved in training and coordinating with the volunteers for conducting educational activities for the children in the communities. However, the government should seriously think of paying these volunteers instead of expecting charity at the community level,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/learning-on-correction-course-after-a-year-long-slide/articleshow/83254194.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Hyderabad||Pay compensation to Jurala farmers in two weeks, says Telangana high court||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Friday directed the state government to pay compensation within two weeks to displaced farmers of Jurala project. Nearly 100 acres of land was acquired from 45 farmers by then state government in 2003-04 and no compensation has been paid to them till now. “Pay it within two weeks or face the music,” said a bench of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice K Lakshman while hearing a batch of petitions filed by 45 farmers from Mahbubnagar district. Counsel for the petitioners CB Ram Mohan Reddy said the compensation would not be more than Rs 9 crore and asserted the government was duty bound to pay the farmers. Objecting to the state government citing difficulties because of the pandemic to deposit the compensation to land losers, the bench reminded the authorities to think about the havoc the pandemic might have played with the lives of the farmers whose land was taken away 18 years ago for constructing the Jurala project. Describing the attitude of the state government as unacceptable, the bench asked the state counsel who was seeking time even after one-and—a-half years whether the government would pay it in the next century. Warning the officials with serious repercussions, the bench gave them two weeks to pay the compensation. As the compensation awarded was paltry, the farmers had approached a civil court seeking enhancement of compensation. The civil court enhanced the amount. But, the state preferred an appeal against the civil court order. The high court, while admitting the state’s appeal, asked it to deposit 50 per cent of the enhanced amount as a precondition to hear the matter.

Health department officials said that the positivity rate has gone below 2% in the state on Friday. Also, the occupancy rate at various government and private hospitals has fallen below 45%. Doctors also claimed that there was a drop in mucormycosis cases. With the continued dip in daily infections, active cases and the consequent fall in hospital occupancy, medical staff has been able to utilise essential resources such as remdesivir injections, oxygen and other required medicines properly. “Earlier, we were facing a crisis for remdesivir and other injections,” said Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent of RUHS. “We had to struggle to get our quota of oxygen every day. But for the past one week, we have had ample oxygen, life-saving injections and, most importantly, we now have at least 55% beds available,” said Dr Singh. Jaipur recorded only 203 new Covid cases and eight deaths on Friday. “Active cases have decreased to 5,118 in Jaipur. We are now focusing on reducing the mortality rate. Despite this dip, I still urge people to continue following Covid appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. He also said that there has been a dip in black fungus cases. “The number of patients coming to the hospital since last week has gone down. This will enable us to utilise resources properly and judiciously and prevent complications among these patients,” Bhandari said. Health department officials also stated that the positivity rate, which was below 4% on Thursday, had fallen below 2% on Friday. The districts which reported fatalities on the day are Jaipur (8), Jodhpur(4), Udaipur(4), Hanumangarh (3), Bikaner (2) and one death each from Ajmer, Alwar, Banswara, Baran, Barmer, Bharatpur, Bhilwara, Chittorgarh, Jaisalmer, Jhunjhunu, Karauli, Kota, Nagaur, Pali, Sawai Madhopur, Sikar and Tonk. Following Jaipur, districts which reported new cases are Alwar (101), Hanumangarh (101), Jodhpur (88), Bikaner (51), Dausa(38), Sriganganagar (38), Udaipur (37), Sawai Madhopur (33), Jhunjhunu (29), Barmer (23), Rajsamand (22), Nagaur (21) and 20 cases came from Ajmer. Other districts reported less than 20 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/dip-across-parameters-in-state-positivity-below-2/articleshow/83256399.cms||---

The ongoing pandemic has affected physical and mental health of thousands of frontline workers, including doctors, nurses, psychotherapists, hospital staff and crematorium staff, many of whom work more than 14 hours a day often without PPE kits or essential safety equipment. “Affected by what was happening in India, Millner reached out to help me. We have been friends for 20 years. I told her how I had offered free therapy to frontline workers on Tuesdays and was overwhelmed by the number of people who contacted me. Our dialogue led to her offering to help on a larger scale,” said Bapat. Over 400 mental health practitioners, including psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers, have volunteered their time and expertise for this initiative. The sessions are available in Bengali, English, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Marwari, Odia (Oriya), Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-400-offer-free-mental-health-support-to-frontliners/articleshow/83245729.cms||---

A resolution to the effect was adopted in its meeting at Khempur village. The announcement of the decision was made after the Friday prayers, where five members were present as per Covid-19 protocol. Terming dowry and DJ dance parties as “un-Islamic”, the committee added that clerics will not perform funeral prayers if family of the deceased violates the resolution regarding weddings. Committee chairman Niyaz Ahmad told TOI that due to the ever-increasing demand for dowry, girls were not getting a suitable match. Muhammad Tariq, a resident of Khempur village and a lawyer, said, “Muslim community members of the village have accepted the resolution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/no-nikah-where-dowry-music-are-part-of-function-says-muslim-body/articleshow/83243316.cms||Nazar Abbas
---||Jaipur||BJP councillors attacked me inside mayor’s office: JMC commissioner||JAIPUR: The Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Greater, commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh has alleged that he was attacked by BJP councillors inside mayor Somya Gurjar’s office on Friday.  He had gone to meet the mayor to discuss the issue of making payment to the company collecting garbage. The workers of the company have been on a strike for the past two days. Inside the mayor's office, he alleged that he was pressured by 10 BJP councillors to give an order for an alternative arrangement to collect garbage. “The meeting was held in the inner room of the mayor's office on her invitation. The court had already given an order not to take any action against the company for eight weeks. I suggested to mayor Somya Gurjar and councillors to convince the company and pay them at least the amount for fuel as otherwise the public would continue to suffer,” Singh said. “But they verbally abused me. When I left the office as I had to attend a meeting at the collectorate, three BJP councillors stopped me at the main office gate and manhandled me,” Singh said. When he called his personal staff, the home guards posted at the mayor’s office didn’t let them enter, he alleged. Two home guards were later suspended. “I could have become violent with the councillors, but that's against my dignity. I will soon file an FIR against them. This is a well planned conspiracy against me by the councillors. How can they call me for a meeting and attack me?” asked the commissioner. Refuting all claims made by the commissioner, mayor Somya Gurjar said that it was just a drama for cheap publicity. “No one manhandled the commissioner. If someone misbehaved with the commissioner, give us proof and action will be taken against them. I have asked all my staff but they have all denied it. I called the commissioner to discuss the sanitation issue faced by the public, but he chose to create a controversy. I think he is not interested in working for the public,” Gurjar retorted after the incident. She further alleged that the commissioner has created this situation for his own benefit. “I don’t know what relation he has with the company that has stopped working. The commissioner has not been able to provide any alternative solution to the problem,” said Gurjar. The directorate of local bodies (DLB) director, Deepak Nandi, has ordered an investigation into the issue and sought a report as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the sanitation staff came out in full support of the commissioner and announced a full day strike on Saturday in both the corporations. Sanitation workers' union president Nand Kishore Dandoriya said that when such a senior officer was not safe in the corporation, who can guarantee their safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-councillors-attacked-me-inside-mayors-office-jmc-commissioner/articleshow/83247434.cms||---
---||Pune||Tools, tech & teachers biggest hopes to recover lost ground||PUNE: Assessments of how a year of remote learning has affected the scholastic and social aspects of lakhs of students are trickling in but what is visible is damning enough for educators and experts to back the absolute need for better tech infrastructure for teaching and solutions for online assessments. The other suggestions experts and NGOs working in the sector listed out for this academic year were putting books and workbooks in the hands of students on time, efficient bridge courses, volunteers in every village to help students and smaller centres for online for a village or two. A possible third wave affecting children may delay the reopening of all schools and the government must plan well in advance for age-appropriate learning level, they said. “We should have more satellite centres where 10 to 15 students can gather to use the internet, computers, tablets, books and other teaching-learning material for online and offline education. Teachers can visit these centres for guidance and evaluation. Community volunteers and facilitators among the parents can conduct activities according to a schedule from the school,” Mandar Shinde, convener of Action for the Rights of the Child (ARC) Pune, said. An efficient survey of school children, ensuring delivery of all books on time, midday meals irrespective of the reopening and using learning aids from the community can also help, Shinde added. Amruta Prabhu, principal of The HDFC School, said all education boards must find other ways of assessment. “Central Board of Secondary Education had a non-exam route a few years ago with a continuous and comprehensive evaluation before going back to board exams. The pandemic has forced all the education boards to look at alternative evaluations, and CCE is the best way forward. A common board pattern would be a good idea so that assessments are fair.” Sheetal Bapat of Shyamchi Aai Foundation said teacher training programmes and parallel technology solution for online assessments must be the focus now. “The education department can equip teachers with the right tools, both online and offline, for bridge courses for clearing last year’s concepts and orienting the students for the coming year through self-learning and learner-centric activities. Many NGOs and teachers have done some amazing work in adopting learner-centric teaching-learning in rural areas. The department should utilise this time to collaborate with all stakeholders to strengthen the teachers and make them more effective facilitators,” Bapat said. Somraj Giradkar, Maharashtra state head of Pratham, one of the largest NGOs in India working for education, said the emphasis should be on self and group-study with parents in a supportive role. “The government can initiate a ‘school readiness’ campaign, before reopening with parents, teachers and villagers. Some basic activities on physical, socio-emotional, motor-sensory skills, cognitive and linguistic development may be carried out near homes. Authorities should also help teachers or parents through cellphone, radio and TV with a strong distribution and review system of educational programmes,” Giradkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tools-tech-teachers-biggest-hopes-to-recover-lost-ground/articleshow/83259063.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: US-bound students anxious as visa process hit||Mumbai: Several students aspiring to fly overseas for higher studies are unable to get their visa appointments on time. Lockdown restrictions in the city, on account of the second wave, have forced consular offices to remain shut or operate with limited staff, thereby slowing the visa issuance process. City students, especially the ones aspiring to fly to the US, are anxious that they will not make it to their universities on time. Many of these students had already deferred their admissions by a year. A parent from south Mumbai said that the US student visas (F1) fall under the emergency visa category. Students can book the earliest date available for their visa and then use the emergency appointment to move up the slot. For instance, a student can get a visa appointment for November, but they can use the emergency slots to move it to June. “But many students are unable to get the first appointment date,” said the parent. “Many are struggling to book a slot the whole day, but end up with no luck,” she added. Another student from the suburbs managed to book a slot through the consulate in Delhi, but that too is for July-end. Nick Novak, spokesperson of the US Consulate General Mumbai, said that they are providing limited visa services until further notice due to the second wave of Covid-19. “However, student visas are a high priority…,” he said. “Students who begin their programmes on or after August 1, 2021, can apply for an expedited visa appointment up to 60 days prior to the programme’s start date and may travel to the US within 30 days of their programme start date. We will continue to add additional appointments throughout the coming weeks as conditions allow. Students should monitor www.ustraveldocs.com/in for further updates,” he added. Officials also suggest keeping tabs on social media handles of the consulate for information. Misbah Sayyed, a student who is heading to Canada for her masters programme, said that the VFS Global office abruptly asked them to apply for the visas till May 15 with all relevant documents, but without any guarantee that they will get a decision till September. On social media, they only say that their centres are shut as per the directives of the High Commission, said Sayyed. Faisal Shaikh, from NSUI, has written to the high commissioner of Canada in India to re-open VFS centres adhering to the Covid-19 guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-us-bound-students-anxious-as-visa-process-hit/articleshow/83248725.cms||Yogita Rao

Srinivas Reddy in a recent reply to the ED said Rs 1.58 crore cash seized from his residence was not his but it belonged to his late fatherin-law. Srinivas said wellwishers had gifted his father-in-law cash when he was sick. The ED said that all the seized currency are of continuous serial number and freshly minted currency, indicating a common source. “The money could have been withdrawn from bank. It was new currency and not in circulation. So the claim that multiple people had donated to Narasimha Reddy is not true. How can the currency be of same serial numbers if multiple people have gifted it,” said the ED. Investigators said Srinivas Reddy did not reveal the names of the persons who had gifted the money to Narasimha Reddy during grilling. “If people have gifted the money, he should come out with a few names,” said the ED. The ED alleged that the total contracts in the ESIIMS scam are worth ₹900 crore and bribery involved would be around Rs 200 crore. The ED booked a case under the PMLA based on FIRs lodged by the ACB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ed-disputes-nayanis-son-in-laws-claim-on-seized-cash-at-house/articleshow/83247430.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||India||Editors Guild welcomes Supreme Court verdict on sedition case against Vinod Dua||NEW DELHI: The Editors Guild of India on Friday welcomed the Supreme Court’s verdict quashing the sedition charges against journalist Vinod Dua, and said in a statement that “a citizen has the right to criticise or comment upon the measures undertaken by a government.” “The apex court not just quashed the criminal complaint against Dua, but has also underlined the importance of protecting journalists from sedition cases,” a statement by the Editors Guild of India said. The apex body of editors in India also welcomed the Supreme Court’s observations that sedition laws are misused by law enforcement authorities in different parts of the country, leading to “pre-trial incarceration”, and said such sedition laws have a chilling effect on free media and India’s democracy. “The Guild demands repeal of these draconian and antiquated laws that find no space in any modern liberal democracy,” it added. The Indian Women Press Corps (IWPC) also welcomed the SC verdict citing protections to journalists under the Kedar Nath Singh judgment against sedition charges and added that criticism of the government, even if brutal, cannot be termed as sedition. “We have noticed, with dismay, a growing trend in India in recent times where both central and state governments have routinely slapped sedition charges on journalists for articles, tweets, Facebook posts that criticise government policies…In January 2021, IWPC founder member Mrinal Pande and some other journalists were booked for sedition for tweets relating to farmers’ protest,” IWPC said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/editors-guild-welcomes-supreme-court-verdict-on-sedition-case-against-vinod-dua/articleshow/83250931.cms||---

AAP leaders demanded legal action against managers of the illicit liquor factory and their patrons. They asked the state government who was stopping officials of Punjab Police and excise and taxation department from taking action in the case. They accused political leaders in Punjab of plunging the youth into the mire of alcohol and drugs. As for the spurious liquor factory case, AAP demanded an investigation by sitting judge of Punjab and Haryana high court and stern action against the owners and operators of the factory. AAP MLA and Punjab Kisan Wing president Kultar Singh Sandhwan accused leaders of the ruling Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) of patronising the drug trade. “This is why the Captain Amarinder Singh government did not take any action in the case of the spurious liquor factory busted at Badal village,” he said, adding that even though a number of people died after consuming spurious liquor in the past, no action was taken by the government against the liquor mafia. AAP Punjab youth wing president and MLA Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said had the Punjab Congress government acted against those involved in establishment of spurious liquor factories, the liquor mafia would not have been in such high spirits. He also said that people of Rajpura and Badal knew which leader or MLA was running spurious liquor factories. MLA Baljinder Kaur said though the illegal unit was busted many days back, no action had been taken by the Congress government led by Capt Amarinder Singh, who had reneged on his promise of eradicating drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-protests-in-lambi-disrupts-highway-traffic/articleshow/83247443.cms||---
---||Pune||Residents’ relocation begins, land to be cleared for Metro||Pune: The civic body and the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) have finally started relocating residents of the Kamgar Putala and Rajiv Gandhinagar slum pockets to clear the land for Metro work. The residents are being moved to accommodations in Vimannagar and Hadapsar. The long-pending plan saw movement after multiple discussions and consultations among the stakeholders, and completion of technical formalities. Recently, deputy chief minister Pawar told the officials concerned to expedite the process after taking residents into confidence. Over 1,000 families are expected to be relocated in a phased manner. The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro), which is executing the project in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, plans to use the vacated land for the viaduct, a bridge to cross the railway tracks and a station. Deputy municipal commissioner Nitin Udas said the administration was finetuning the list of eligible residents for the past three months. “As part of the process, the residents were told to produce certain documents. Some did not submit relevant documents and raised objections. We held hearings in each case,” Udas said. SRA officials have initiated the process of registering the homes with the sub-registrar offices. The process is expected to be complete by next week, officials said. The plot is crucial for the Metro project — a part of it would be used for the piers of the elevated Vanaz-Ramwadi line, and a portion would be reserved for the Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar line, which is being developed by Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority. “Plans for utilization of vacated land are being finalized,” a MahaMetro official said. they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-relocation-begins-land-to-be-cleared-for-metro/articleshow/83245753.cms||---

---||Bareilly||Fear of vaccine runs high in UP’s rural belt||BAREILLY: In several UP villages where the fear of vaccines is far greater than the Covid-19 itself, the health department teams are finding it tough to motivate locals to take the shots. The health workers on the inoculation drive have heard scores of rumours, some of them strange -- like vaccines will sterilize men or people will die after two years of taking the jabs. Instead of information on the benefits of the vaccines and the dangers of ducking it, gossip and fake news have flooded the social media space. In Barabanki district, scores of people jumped into the Saryu river to evade the vaccine. While in Etawah, an elderly woman was found hiding behind a storage drum inside her house when a health department team came to visit. Earlier this week, in Mathura’s Nayi Basti, with a population of about 15,000, health officials could convince only 20 to get the jab. Rumours of “vaccine death” have kept most villagers in Bareilly away from vaccination centres too. In some areas, elderlies have fled to other villages to escape the shots. And some villages are collectively boycotting the drive. Bareilly's district immunization officer Dr RN Singh told TOI, “People in rural areas are staying away from the jab. They are scared because of social media rumours. Countering the rumours with awareness is necessary. Health teams are holding frequent meetings with village heads and locals to allay their fears.” To curb the misinformation and tackle the vaccine hesitancy, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) had released ‘Covid-19 Vaccine Communication Strategy’. Released in January, the document was to serve as a guide for national, state and district level authorities to fight vaccine hesitancy. But little has been done at the ground to check the rumour mongering. Recently, a health department team was sent back by the residents of Dagroli village in Faridpur block of Bareilly. The video of the residents refusing to come forward for the vaccination was widely shared on social media on Friday. In Shahjahanpur, people from rural areas of Kalaan and Mirzapur block have also not shown interest in the vaccination. Shahjahanpur DIO Dr Laxman Singh told TOI, “We are able to vaccinate nearly 4,500 people against the target of 7,000 every day. All the slots for vaccination in urban areas are full but vaccination in rural areas where people are not much educated is still a challenge for us. Like the polio vaccination programme, if celebrities come up with positive campaigning then I am sure that people will show more interest in vaccination.” The hesitancy was also prevalent in minority dominated areas. Union minister of minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi was in Rampur district to oversee the vaccination programme and spread awareness amongst the masses towards vaccination. While speaking with the media persons, he said, “Those who are spreading misinformation about the vaccine are enemies of the people as well as the nation. Vaccination is the only way to control Covid-19. Unfortunately, a few people instead of becoming a part of this collective battle against Covid-19, are trying to create panic among people regarding the vaccine for setting their political agenda.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/fear-of-vaccine-runs-high-in-ups-rural-belt-several-villages-boycotting-health-department-teams/articleshow/83243382.cms||---

The incident was earlier reported in TOI. Though the modus operandi of the accused, Asfaq Khan (39), is different from the one involved with the hacking of several ATMs of a private bank to siphon off nearly Rs 2 crore in the city last month, cops will, however, question him on the heists. On Friday, forensic experts visited an ATM at Jadavpur to study how the cyber gang had hacked into multiple ATMs. Cops have picked up Khan for interrogation because he hails from the same Mewat area of Haryana, where they suspect the cyber gang that decamped with Rs 2 crore is also based. An officer said Khan had admitted to be part of a pan-India gang. His statement was recorded under 161 CrPC. Details of ATM cards used for fraud were collected. Khan was nabbed from Rahara, where he was living for the last few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/behala-atm-fraud-haryana-man-held/articleshow/83245772.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

After the Supreme Court struck down the Maratha quota on May 5, the state had appointed a committee comprising legal experts headed by former chief justice of Allahabad High Court, Dilip Bhosale, to study, analyse the apex court order on Maratha quota and to make suggestions and recommendations. The committee on Friday submitted its 570-page report to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in the presence of chairperson of the state cabinet sub-committee for Maratha quota, Ashok Chavan. The committee, in its recommendations, has mentioned more than 40 legal points, based on which the state can file a review petition. The committee pointed out two major issues for the review petition— 50% cap on state reservation quota and the 102nd amendment in the Constitution. Ashok Chavan while speaking to mediapersons indicated that the state government may file a review petition before the Supreme Court. “The committee has also pointed out that allotting the rights to the state to decide on reservation while keeping the 50% cap does not serve the purpose. Hence, the reservation ceiling of 50% should be relaxed,” said Chavan. He added that the Centre has mentioned only about the rights allotted to the state, but has not mentioned the Maratha quota in its review petition in the Supreme Court. “If needed, CM Uddhav Thackeray will have a word with the PM on the issue,” added Chavan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maratha-quota-panel-submits-report-calls-for-review-petition/articleshow/83248765.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Now, vigilance clearance must to hire retired babus||Mumbai: The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has said government organisations must seek vigilance clearance for retired officials before re-hiring them on contracts. It also says retired officials must mandatorily observe a cooling-off period before taking up jobs in the private sector. The rules were laid down in a circular issued on Thursday. The guidelines are mainly aimed to address the rising trend of retired officers being re-hired on contracts by the government. Many within bureaucratic circles see this as a much-needed tool to bar tainted officials from occupying key posts even after retirement. However, some see it as an attempt by the Centre to exert control over bureaucrats posted in states after former West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay did not take up a central deputation issued days before his retirement and joined Mamata Banerjee as chief advisor. “The absence of uniform, defined procedure for obtaining vigilance clearance before engaging retired officials sometimes leads to a situation where officials with a tainted past or having cases pending against them are engaged by government organisations,” says the CVC circular. “Such a situation not only leads to unnecessary allegations of favouritism but is also against the tenets of fairness and probity which is the basic principle governing the functioning of government organisations.” In May, the Maharashtra government had appointed retired irrigation secretary V K Gautam as an OSD in the same department, a week after he was issued a notice of inquiry regarding alleged irregularities in the awarding of contracts for the Commonwealth Games, where he had earlier served. The CVC notice lays down a procedure for hiring retired officers belonging to the All India Services on contracts in government organisations. It says vigilance clearance should be taken from the employer organisation from which the officer had retired. If the official had worked in more than one government organisation, then vigilance clearance should be obtained from all organisations where he had worked for the previous 10 years, it says. If there is no response received within 21 days, the clearance will be deemed to be given. However, if it is subsequently found that the ex-employee was involved in a vigilance related matter, the former employer will be responsible for consequential actions. The guidelines also say post-retirement contracts should be advertised so that there is transparency and equal opportunity to those willing to serve in the posts. On retired officials taking up jobs in private organisations, the circular says the acceptance of an offer without observing a cooling-off period, “constitutes a serious misconduct on their part.” “These were much-needed rules. Typically, pliant officials are favoured for post-retirement contracts. They continue to do the bidding of politicians and are not accountable to follow service rules on probity,” said a senior officer. Another senior official felt the rules also reflected the Centre-state tussle on the control of retired officials posted in states. “The Centre perhaps sees such contractual appointments as undermining its control over the bureaucracy. For instance, if a retired contractual employee does not turn up for a PM meeting, he will not face consequences as the Centre has no power over him.” The order has been issued to secretaries of all central government departments, central public sector undertakings and chiefs of public sector banks among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-vigilance-clearance-must-to-hire-retired-babus/articleshow/83250091.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Since a week, the passenger traffic at the airport has been around 2,500-3,000 (both arrivals and departures), which was not the case during May when the number of arriving and departing passengers dipped to three digits. Also, figures have shown that the number of arrivals since the past week has been higher than departures. On June 2, a total of 1,709 passengers arrived and 1,319 passengers departed from the airport. Before that, on June 1, as many as 1,674 passengers arrived and 1,449 of them departed. The trend was the same towards the end of May as well. On May 31, 2,099 passengers arrived while 1,404 departed; on May 30, 1,735 passengers landed in Pune while 1,194 passengers left the city and on May 29, 1,397 passengers arrived and 1,139 passengers departed.  “It is a good sign that the number of flyers is increasing again but we are not keeping our hopes very high amid the possibility of an incumbent third wave,” an airport official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/airport-passenger-traffic-shows-signs-of-improvement/articleshow/83245796.cms||Joy Sengupta

The earlier re-carpeting, slated from April 26 to May 9, was postponed. Sources told TOI that now the work was expected to be completed in one go in the later half of the year. The runway would be shut for the duration of the work. “The IAF is coordinating with the civil aviation ministry and the ministry of health and family welfare because of the pandemic and keeping in mind the transport of vaccine from Pune Airport,” a senior airport official told TOI. Air Marshal Bhushan Gokhale (retired), who is in the know-how about the project, said, “This is a critical phase of vaccine movement and also transportation of other medical equipment. Hence the previous closure was postponed,” he said. He added that at present, the work at the concrete portions of the runway at both the ends was on. “The airport is closed for flight movements from 8pm to 8am. It has been decided to postpone the runway closure to September or October. Work at one end of the concrete portion is already completed. The remaining flexible portion will be done in one go when the runway is completely closed for two weeks or so,” Gokhale added. “Once the dates are finalised, they will be formally announced,” another airport official told TOI.Pratyush Kamlakar had decided to cancel his flight to Delhi, which was scheduled for May 2, because of the earlier announcement. “Such announcements should be made big and bold via different mediums, so that everyone can know about it,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/runway-closure-expected-around-oct-for-re-carpeting/articleshow/83245791.cms||Joy Sengupta

Vaccinating those between 18 to 44 years will cover 30% of the state’s population and could keep mortalities low during the third wave of Covid-19, Sawant said on Friday. The response to the Tika Utsav has been less than encouraging with just 1,300 persons getting the jab on Thursday, Sawant said on the sidelines of a function. “I want Goa to be the first state in the country to complete 100% vaccination for the people above 18 years,” Sawant told reporters. The CM said that eligible citizens should come forward and get themselves inoculated. While the state’s population is projected at 15.4 lakh, the directorate of health services and private hospitals have administered 5,43,701 vaccine doses as on June 3. The opposition has urged the state government to liberalise the vaccination drive and to involve local elected representatives to get maximum participation. While Sawant’s move is to ensure that those likely to be vulnerable to the third wave are completely vaccinated by July 30, it appears as if the state has not taken into account that there is a three to four month gap recommended by the Centre between the first dose and the second dose. Thus, even a person who received the first jab in May will not be able to take the second dose before July 30. The Union health ministry’s Covid-19 working group chaired by N K Arora recommended increasing the interval between two doses of Covishield vaccine to 12-16 weeks, while suggesting no change in interval of Covaxin vaccine doses. The recommendation has been implemented. Goa has prioritised phase-wise vaccination for parents with young children, differently abled, seafarers, operators of motorcycle taxis, taxis and rickshaws, the chief minister said. “We had opened up vaccination for parents of children below two years of age and also for those with co-morbid conditions on Thursday. I had taken a review and found that only 1,300 people had gotten themselves vaccinated under this category,” he said. Sawant said that the state government has now widened the scope for vaccination under priority groups, covering parents of children till the age of five. He said that even those who have received both the doses of the vaccine should continue wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawants-mission-vaccinate-entire-18-44-group-by-jul-30/articleshow/83247465.cms||---

These districts — Bageshwar, Champawat, Haridwar, Dehradun and Udham Singh Nagar — recorded a test positivity rate of below 5% in the past week. More shops are likely to be permitted to open in these five districts and curfew timings are likely to be relaxed. At the same time, the Uttarakhand government is also planning to permit the plying of public transport vehicles with a two-third occupancy. In the last week, Udham Singh Nagar recorded the lowest test positivity rate at 2.28%, followed by Haridwar at 2.35%, Champawat at 3.40%, Bageshwar at 3.45%, and Dehradun at 3.96%. Further, the daily Covid infections in the state have come down from nearly 10,000 cases per day in April to around 500 cases per day in the last few days. Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said, “There has been a big drop in daily Covid infections and we hope it goes down further in the next few days. A decision on extending relaxation will completely depend on the scenario on June 7. If the numbers are under control, we may permit some more shops to open.” He, however, maintained that the state government would prefer a phase-wise unlocking of the curfew. “We are reviewing the location block-wise. Also, the positivity rate and the situation in hospitals will be considered before taking a call on curbs,” added Uniyal. Notably, traders recently held a meeting with Uniyal and state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj and urged them to allow more shops to open during the curfew period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttrakhand-govt-planning-to-extend-relaxations-in-five-districts-from-june-8/articleshow/83243410.cms||Kautilya Singh

Dr Satish Mishra, who works as a medical officer at the chief medical health office (CMHO) in Jaipur, saw a request from a woman from Bhutan for plasma for her mother battling cancer in Kolkata and arranged for the same. The woman required some 70 units of plasma for mother who was undergoing treatment at a hospital in Rajarhat in Kolkata. After seeing the request, Mishra worked day and night, called up and coordinated with blood donors and arranged 60 units of plasma. On Friday, TOI spoke to the doctor and a few of his friends who had helped the Bhutanese family. “I was here in city arranging oxygen and beds for Covid patients when one day I saw this post on a social networking platform,” said Mishra. “In the post Tshering Tshomo, a woman from Bhutan, had requested plasma for her 56-year-old mother Pabi Maya Tikhatri. I was upset and restless as it said that the woman had cancer and required at least 70 units for blood transfusion,” said Mishra. “Us raat neend nahin aayi (I couldn't get any sleep that night),” he said, adding, "The first thing that struck me was how people from Bhutan can find a blood donor in Kolkata? Who will help them?“ The next day, Mishra searched his contact list for donors and got in touch with one Vikram Dadhich, a donor who has a group of blood donors across the country. “We managed to find 60 willing donors who gave her blood. The patient has since been discharged. I am thankful to God that I could do it with the help of Vikram ji," he said. “I had just put the request on the wall of my social networking account when Mishra ji called me and asked for help. He then coordinated with donors in Kolkata and arranged some from other cities,” Vikram said. After she received the plasma, the cancer patient was discharged from the hospital. Her family expressed their gratitude to Mishra and India. Speaking to TOI from Kolkata, an elated Tshering Tshomo said, “I am not only thankful to Dr Mishra but also to every Indian. I was clueless when I was told by doctors that my mother required almost 70 units of plasma. I had never expected it to happen. We will not forget this for the rest of our lives. India is a great country. Such help coming when India too is fighting Covid is highly commendable.” “My mother was discharged on Friday. We will wait for the doctors’ advice to see if we can return to Bhutan or have to stay back,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-doctor-arranges-plasma-for-cancer-patient-from-bhutan/articleshow/83247461.cms||Ashish Mehta

The incident occurred around 3.30am near Aundh Hospital when police constables Amol Lawand and Kalyan Bhosale were on the night patrol duty. “Lawand fractured his skull. He is undergoing treatment at a hospital,” senior inspector Ranganath Unde of the police station told TOI. Unde added, “The two assailants escaped from the spot after the attack. We have detained a few suspects from the area for questioning.” Lawand and Bhosale were on night patrolling duty on Thursday. “After visiting different ATM kiosks, they ran out of fuel. The duo then began patrolling the area in a private vehicle,” Unde said. Around 3am, the constables entered the premises of Aundh Hospital. “During the night patrol, all our men visit the hospital premises and campus as the internal roads are lonely,” Unde said. As the constables were stepping out after checking the premises, Lawand noticed two men behind an arch. “He stopped the car and asked them why they were out at that time. Suddenly, the suspects came forward and pelted stones at the car,” Unde said. Bhosale took Lawand to the hospital and alerted the police. “We suspect that the duo must have been waiting there to attack and rob passers-by. We will soon arrest them,” Unde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cop-suffers-grievous-injuries-in-stone-pelting/articleshow/83245798.cms||---

Galib submitted a memorandum addressed to the President of India with SDM Jagraon while Congress’s urban unit also submitted a memorandum on similar lines to deputy commissioner of Ludhiana today. Galib said, “Covid-19 has caused unprecedented devastation and immeasurable pain to nearly every Indian family. Tragically, the Union Government has completely abdicated its duty and abandoned the people, leaving them to fend for themselves. Vaccination is the only protection in the mid of the raging Covid-19 pandemic, but Modi government’s vaccination strategy has been a dangerous cocktail of blunders and bloopers. As other countries started placing purchase orders for vaccines from May 2020, the Modi Government failed India, as it went on to place its first order of vaccines only in January 2021. According to publicly available information, Modi government and state governments have till date ordered only 39 crore vaccine doses for a total population of 140 crores.” According to Galib, only 4.45 crore Indians have received both the doses of vaccine, which is only 3.17% of India’s population. “In the last 134 days, the average pace of vaccination is about 16 lakh vaccine doses per day and at this pace, it will take over three years for us to vaccinate our adult population. Till date, Union government has exported 6.63 crore vaccine doses to other countries. This is the biggest disservice to the nation. The multiple pricing slab for the vaccine fixed by them is another instance of profiteering from people’s misery. Serum Institute’s Covishield single dose costs Rs 150 to Modi government, Rs 300 to state governments and Rs 600 to private hospitals. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin single dose costs Rs 150 to Modi government, Rs 600 to state governments and Rs 1,200 to private hospitals. The private hospitals are even charging up to Rs 1,500 for a single dose. The full cost of two doses should be accordingly calculated.” Galib said Congress has urged the President of India to direct Centre to ensure one crore vaccination per day and make vaccination free of cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cong-demands-free-vaccine-for-all-sends-letter-to-prez/articleshow/83243407.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Himachal Pradesh needs to keep an eye on glacier surface area change||Himachal Pradesh, a Himalayan state with dense temperate and alpine forest reserve and rich environmental heritage, has undergone tremendous infrastructural change over the years with influx of tourists and construction projects in the name of development. All these activities have had or will have negative consequences, disturbing the natural homeostatic balance of the environment beyond its re-entering capacity. There should be convergence of developmental growth measures with preservation and restoration of environment. Future financing of developmental projects has to be sustainable and wise, where we can use the potential of tourism horticulture and hydroelectricity from the state but not disturb the balance of Himalays. There has been rapid contractions in glacier surface area, and on the other hand, expansions in glacial lakes over the past few decades. Since these are tell-tale signs of a looming disaster in the coming years, a watchful eye, sustainable and planned infrastructure development is the need of the hour. Since Himachal is a green-fuel (hydro power) surplus state, there is certainly no need for arresting large rivers as planned for the Chandra and the Bhaga in Lahaul-Spiti district. The recent Chamoli disaster in Uttarakhand should serve as a warning for undertaking such ambitious but highly unsustainable developments. High-rise constructions in a highly earthquake prone area of Zone-V are an invitation to mass annihilation any day, a making of pre-planned bomb. World Environment Day, celebrated annually on June 5, marks the celebration of rich diverse heritage of environment in providing various ecological services and livelihood of mankind. The National Environmental Policy of India is an attempt to treasure this rich heritage. Himachal has to focus on imbibing all possible sustainable development practices towards green economy. The level of environmental awareness needs to be raised along with drafting of new legislations to support the environment. Eco village is an emerging concept in the hill state. It focuses on treating village life being in absolute sync with nature by developing low impact lifestyles that reduce the “ecological footprint” by as much as 50% of the base assessment from launch of the scheme.

An MPCB official, S L Waghmare, said, “This company was using chemical for which it had no permission, our finding has revealed...

A chemical reaction caused overheating which led to a gas leak, fire brigade officials said. The leakage was brought under control before 11.30pm after which the situation become normal. An activist from Badlapur, Satyajit Burman, said, “There are many reasons for pollution from these companies... One is that inspectors, whose job is to keep watch on safety-related work, never visit the companies. Also, unqualified labourers operating manufacturing units and excess use of chemicals are to blame.” —Pradeep Gupta||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-company-told-to-shut-shop-a-day-after-chem-leak/articleshow/83250153.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Murder-suicide whiff after three of a family found dead in Sodepur house||KOLKATA: Three members of a family, a couple and their son, were found dead at their rented house in Sodepur on Friday morning. Police suspect that 58-year-old garments trader Samir Guha first killed his wife Jhuma (48) and their 23-year-old son Kishalay alias Babai by giving them poison and then hanged himself from the ceiling. The bodies of Jhuma and Babai were lying on the bed while Guha was found hanging from the ceiling of the same room that was locked from inside. A suicide note was also recovered in which it was written that nobody was responsible for the deaths. Financial crisis could have led to the incident, police said. Samir Guha and his wife JhumaAccording to a source, Guha, a ready-made garments trader, was staying with his wife and their only son at a rented accommodation off RN Tagore Road in Sodepur’s Basak Bagan for over four years. “Guha used to bring garments from Burrabazar and supply them to local markets in the Sodepur-Khardah areas. But, ever since the lockdown restrictions started last year, mounting losses in his business led to financial distress. He had to borrow money from several persons. Some of his friends had helped him, too. But the situation took a turn for the worse this year and he couldn’t recover his losses,” said Tarun Kumar Ghosh, Guha’s friend. On Friday morning, locals got a pungent smell from their room. They said the family members weren’t seen in last couple of days. A team from Khardah PS rushed to the spot, broke open the door and recovered the bodies. “In the note, Guha tells his friend to sell out all household items to repay the loans. We are probing if it was written by Guha himself. An unnatural death case has been started,” said an officer of Barrackpore commissionerate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/murder-suicide-whiff-after-three-of-a-family-found-dead-in-sodepur-house/articleshow/83245808.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
---||Jaipur||Tamlore village: An oasis in the heart of Thar Desert||JAIPUR: A dusty village in the midst of the mighty Thar desert has managed to survive water scarcity through its unique recharging wells for over a century now. Tamlore village in Barmer has no water body or tap connection to fulfil its drinking water needs. It is from the small dry wells known as ‘Beria’ that the villagers have quenched their thirst for so long. The village with a population of just over 2,000 is among the few in the region where such wells of 2-meter diameter recharge every 24-48 hours giving 20-40 litres of water. The wells are divided among 300 households on the basis of caste and have proven to be a boon for women in the region for providing ease to fetch water within the limits of the village. A mother of two children, Prakash Kanwar, 32, has to spend almost three hours every alternate day waiting for her turn to fetch water from her designated well 500 metres away from her house. “Every family can fetch three earthen pots every alternate day. So, by the time third and last round comes, the water table almost hits bottom, leaving us to see the well filling drop by drop,” said Prakash, who was married 12 years ago. The village grooms are preferred for marriage due to access to drinking water supply. Unlike other neighbouring villages like Makhan-Ka-Par, Ammi-Ka-Par, Rohidi and Bechawad where high fluoride content in drinking water has caused health problems in every household, Tamlore boasts of good quality water. The village has a total of 71 wells, the oldest is almost a century old while most of them came up after partition with the arrival of people from across the border. The wells have been divided among the dominant families on caste lines. The locked-up wells belong to dominant — Rajput and Muslim — families, while other unlocked and those with less refill capacity are open for other communities. The average water refilled is between 40 litres to 500 litres in 24 hours. The local authorities have clinically approved the water quality fit for human use. Prakash says that they divide the water by visually assessing its volume and on the luckiest days every family takes back 40 litres on a camel cart. The source of water is not exactly known to anyone, but legend says that the village is blessed by a local deity, Jagdamba Mata. Considering the deterioration of environment leading to closure of many wells in the village, sarpanch Hindu Singh Tamlore, has devised a system regulating the digging of new wells. “The stress on the existing wells has almost doubled in the last 15 years. The migration of people from nearby villages is leading to exhaustion of the limited resource.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tamlore-village-an-oasis-in-the-heart-of-thar-desert/articleshow/83247490.cms||Shoeb Khan

They also urged the CM to dissolve the Devasthanam board. The priests pointed out that no decision has been taken in this regard even after two months of the CM's announcement. They threatened to launch a mass stir from June 21 if their demands are not met. Rajesh Semwal, chief of Char Dham Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat, confirmed to TOI that a memorandum addressed to the CM was handed over to the Uttarkashi district administration. “During Kumbh, the CM assured us that 51 temples will be denotified from the Devasthanam board but even after two months, no action has been taken. The government can not befool us by making false claims,” added Semwal. The priests have said that they will wear black bands on their arms while performing pooja from June 11 and if their demands are not met, a mass protest will be held on June 21 which will be followed by a hunger strike. Earlier on April 9, CM Rawat had announced that the state government will denotify 51 temples from the Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act, giving the control of the shrines back to the priests. The announcement was made during Vishwa Hindu Parishad's ‘Margdarshak Mandal’ meeting in Haridwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/will-launch-stir-if-temples-are-not-denotified-from-devasthanam-board-gangotri-priests/articleshow/83243467.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Goa||Goa: Women volunteers chip in with funds, care to support Covid +ve||PANAJI: Every evening after 6pm, Ana Gracias, a Chimbel resident finds her phone inundated with calls and text messages from residents in her village who need resources to survive the pandemic. Sometimes the requests are as simple as provision of a few days’ ration and medication for the home-isolated. For others, the requirement is that of an ambulance or the urgent need to go to the nearest Covid hospital. “I give ration and cooked meals to the home-isolated, which are donated by priests, besides personally taking people to Goa Medical College if they are symptomatic. There was one case where a woman living in Curca died in her home and her family couldn’t cremate her. I took it upon myself to do her final rites,” Gracias told TOI. From driving patients to hospitals at odd hours to fostering children of underprivileged Covid patients, there are a few women in Goa who are volunteering to help within their capacity, sometimes with their own funds, even if all they receive in return, at times, is thanklessness. Diana Tavares, a nurse from Margao, personally visits Covid patients and monitors their health. She also connects them with doctors for phone advice and helps their families arrange oxygen cylinders, oxygen masks and ambulances. “This is especially in cases where families are not willing to go near the Covid patient for fear of contracting the virus,” she said. A month ago, Runa Aggarwal, a business consultant, was driving around the city till 4am trying to find an oxygen mask for someone who desperately needed it. The SOS was posted on a WhatsApp group from an unknown number for a home isolated patient she had never met. She is always on her feet responding to several such SOSes, irrespective of the time of day, giving hope to humanity. “There is an army of people risking themselves to ensure that others don’t die. It is the people that are out there doing all this for one another when it’s the government’s duty to do so,” Aggarwal said. Activist Tallulah Da Silva has taken it upon herself to watch 15 children of underprivileged backgrounds — most of whom are kin of daily wage workers. She keeps them engaged in a backyard class involving art, community farming and learning activities through the day until it is time for them to return home. Six of these children aged between 10 to 16, she has been fostering herself, since their families are struggling with pandemic-related difficulties. “The children are slowly overcoming their fears and finding their own peace during this turbulent time,” she said. While most of Goa’s educated community is able to get at least some attention at hospitals and testing centres, the underprivileged are often treated like second class citizens, leaving them hesitant to seek help. “Many of them don’t want to go to hospitals due to the behaviour meted out towards them, and often don’t even get themselves tested when they show symptoms. They now also have a fear that taking the vaccine will kill them, which is why there is a need to educate them,” Gracias said. Her efforts to enlighten Chimbel’s Indiranagar slum dwellers with the importance of getting the vaccine has often been snubbed, with some of the migrants even rudely demanding that she leave their doorstep. “The underprivileged have no access to accurate information and even the government isn’t doing enough to help them. They are totally at the risk of the virus,” said Crystal Lobo Fernandes, a Mapusa resident. Having lost her job due to the pandemic, Lobo was figuring out how to stand on her feet again when she instead decided to dedicate the entire month of May to volunteer work. “Women in many areas tend to be more empathetic and can respond better to crisis situations. We have therefore been able to do more than men during the pandemic,” Lobo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/women-volunteers-chip-in-with-funds-care-to-support-covid-ve/articleshow/83247502.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Nashik||Maharashtra to bear cost of drug for kids with post-Covid MIS||PUNE: The Maharashtra government has decided to bear the cost of the intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a blood product made up of antibodies and other care components involved in treating Covid-linked multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), at designated hospitals and medical colleges across the state. The decision has been taken in view of the rising cases of post-Covid MIS-C across the state. Around 500 children are likely to be currently undergoing treatment for post-Covid MIS-C in Maharashtra. On Thursday, the state-sponsored health scheme, Mahatma Phule Jana Arogya Yojana (MPJAY), allowed IVIG expenses up to Rs1 lakh to a 5-year-old patient, son of a Bhavani Peth autorickshaw driver. The child is undergoing treatment at Bharati hospital. “There are about 63 treatment packages for children under MPJAY. We have decided to club the relevant treatment packages for MIS-C treatment. We will soon come out with a plan so that more patients can seek free treatment at designated hospitals across the state,” MPJAY chief executive officer Sudhakar Shinde told TOI. MIS-C is considered a syndrome because much is unknown about it, including its cause and risk factors. A 10gm vial of IVIG costs around Rs 20,000. “Depending upon weight, 2gm per kg of the bodyweight is to be given in 12 hours. A child weighing 25kg will need 50gm IVIG costing Rs1 lakh,” said Bharati hospital’s paediatric rheumatologist, Jitendra Oswal. Oswal, along with Sassoon hospital’s paediatrician, Aarti Kinikar, followed up with the state officials independently about including the MIS-C treatment under the MPJAY. “The process to add MIS-C treatment package under MJPJAY has been initiated. We are awaiting the state’s letter. Something positive should come out,” Kinikar said. “Considering the incidence calculated in studies in the US, we may expect around 500 children to be affected by MIS in Maharashtra,” Oswal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-to-bear-cost-of-drug-for-kids-with-post-covid-mis/articleshow/83252480.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Besides hiring more staff and strengthening infrastructure, the Centre plans on introducing transportation services between hospitals and homes for mothers and children, setting up five blood storage units and gathering more data. “After health checkups of school children, they can be referred to hospitals. For this, referral transport has been approved by the Centre. The state will be providing this transport facility to mother and child after delivery as well,” said an NHM official. To keep an eye on maternal health in the state, the government will incentivise those who share data. “This year, the state government will be able to start a scheme for giving a Rs 1,000-incentive to the first person who shares information about maternal deaths at the community level,” the NHM official said. The state will appoint 400 auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) and 158 staff nurses this year. It will also set up 54 delivery points and 29 first referral points for safe delivery. The operation and maintenance of 132 new ambulances under 108 emergency services has been provided for. Also in the pipeline are five blood storage units and five new dialysis centres — at Bageshwar, Chamoli, Champawat, Tehri and Uttarkashi. A peritoneal dialysis centre (peritoneal dialysis does not require an artificial kidney machine) will also be set up at Doon Medical College. Two cardiac care units will come up — in Rudraprayag and Uttarkashi — and free diagnostic services will be offered at public health institutions, covering 56 tests at district hospitals and sub district hospitals, and 28 tests at community health centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-gets-rs-900cr-for-nhm-projects-highest-grant-of-all-time/articleshow/83243498.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Pune||Covid-19: Overcharging continues at Pune private hospitals during second wave||PUNE: Overcharging for Covid-19 treatment, which had turned into a major problem for patients last year, continues even during the second wave within Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. The civic administration has directed reduction of Rs 1.8 crore from bills in 310 cases since March, after the objections were found to be valid. The civic body has restructured around 1,000 bills between August and February. An amount of Rs 2.8 crore was reduced during that period. “The audit of hospital bills was resumed after complaints started coming in mid-March once there was a rise in cases. There were hardly any complaints in February, when there was a major drop in Covid-19 cases,” said a senior civic official. The PMC has set up teams to verify hospital bills, who conduct surprise checks at hospitals. “The PMC will take strict action against those not adhering to norms pertaining to billing,” said Manisha Naik, assistant medical officer, PMC. According to civic data, around 1,387 complaints were received since August last year and the bill amount was reduced in 1,023 cases. The concerned patients got back Rs 4.6 crore in total. Earlier till May-end, the team members would check bills above Rs 1.5 lakh, but in a recent change of policy all bills are being checked since the first week of June. PMC officials said strict action has been taken against hospitals, which included cancellation of license. PMC issued notices before taking any action. In some cases, hospitals were stripped of the permission to treat Covid-19 patients. Overcharging has been reported in charges levied for treatment in ICU. Hefty charges are said to be taken for PPE kits, a common violation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/overcharging-continues-at-private-hospitals-during-second-wave/articleshow/83247505.cms||---

The Chicalim youth farmer’s club which registered in December last year has taken upon itself the challenge to organically cultivate paddy on around 20,000sqm land that was lying fallow for two and a half decades. They will also be engaging the community to turn it into a community farming project. The group will be mentored and guided by the owners of the land, farmers themselves. “The land belongs to different owners who have given us their NOC to revive their land. They will be the mentors and benefactors and will share all their knowledge with the youth,” said parish priest of Chicalim Fr Bolmax Pereira who initiated the movement. The youth got involved by accident when the pandemic struck last year as there was no labour to work in the fields. “The farmers who were regularly cultivating their land asked us for help and that’s when the youth stepped in,” he said. The youth began getting their hands dirty in June 2020 and after participating in various projects, they began growing vegetables organically in January this year. “We want to get back to organic farming and getting people to go back to their fields. There are many settlers here from other villages who gave up farming and who are showing interest in farming again,” Pereira said. The youth are getting people from surrounding areas to give them their kitchen waste instead of throwing this out, which s being used as manure. “Instead of littering we can use this organic waste in our cultivation. Giving us the organic waste will help do away with the habit of people throwing away food residue which contributes to stinking and garbage dumps,” Pereira said. The efforts of the Chicalim farmer’s youth club and Pereira will be among the stories from across the country shared during the launch of the Prithvi Parivar- pan India Ecological Movement on Saturday. Pereira has been selected as the “Eco achiever” from the western region and will present ‘Hope Story of Chicalim village’ focusing on the farmers club and efforts to document the heritage and biodiversity of the village. Although the lead for the Chicalim youth farmer’s club was through the church, youth of different religions have got together for this movement. “If people support each other and grow their own vegetables and food we will live a healthier life and won’t be left in the lurch during lockdowns and bandhs,” Pereira said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chicalim-youths-turn-farmers-to-cultivate-20k-sqm-of-fallow-land/articleshow/83247521.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Nine more lions at the zoo have tested positive for SARS CoV-2. Specimens collected from the animals were sent to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, on 24th and 29th May after some animals showed infection symptoms, including nasal discharge. The institute confirmed the virus infection on Thursday morning. As per protocol, any suspected death due to coronavirus in zoos must be reconfirmed by Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, and Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad. Samples have been sent to these institutes for confirmation. Results are awaited. According to a statement from the zoo authorities, the CCMB, which is the approved virus sequencing centre of the Central Zoo Authority, will carry out genome sequencing of the virus strain for better understanding of zoonotic transmission to prevent further infection spread. A veterinarian from the state animal husbandry department said the virus could have been transmitted from humans (animal keepers/workers). Virus can reach up to 2 metres, survive for three daysThe virus can reach up to two meters and can be alive for three days. Animals carry many viruses, but they are not as fatal as coronavirus, a source said. Prophylactic measures for mammals, reptiles, birds and primates in consultation with an expert team from Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (Tanuvas), veterinarians from Hyderabad zoo and Bronx Zoo in the US, have been adopted at the Vandalur zoo. All the lions that tested positive are under observation and are being cared for in line with the prescribed treatment regimen by inhouse veterinary team in coordination with Tanuvas experts. Vandalur zoo authorities are getting information about the treatment protocol for coronavirus-infected animals from the Hyderabad zoo and the Jaipur zoo, where similar incidents took place sometime ago. At present, Vandalur zoo houses six lions and seven lionesses, but no cubs. All animal-keepers and helpers in the zoo have been inoculated. A separate team of animal-keepers has been engaged for each group of lions. PPE kits are mandatory for animal-keepers, veterinarians and field staff. The Vandulur zoo was closed on April 24 after the state government announced a lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19. Subsequently, precautionary measures were implemented in the zoo to avoid the spread of the virus. It’s not known how the lions were infected, a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/lioness-dies-of-suspected-coronavirus-in-city/articleshow/83245860.cms||P Oppili

The water below 40 metres contains sulphur, chlorine and fluoride more than the permissible limit, posing health hazards when consumed constantly. Ministry of Jal Shakti’s latest groundwater report on Rajasthan 2019-2020 says that five districts had more than 40% of their wells recording water level below 40 metres in January 2020. The figure comes in stark contrast with the fact that annual rainfall in the state increased by 29.5% in 2019 from 2010-2018 (average). The situation doesn’t appear better even this year as rainfall in 2020 was slightly higher and intense, but took place over a less duration. Jhunjhunu is leading, with 91% of the wells that had gone 40m and above in January 2020 (post monsoon) while in monsoon, the arid city received 32.81% more rain than the previous years. The report says that Jaipur alone had 41% of the wells with water table below 40 metres, despite receiving 744MM rain, which was 29.21% more than the average of the previous 8 years. Experts have said that wells are being overused and are thus not recharged even after sufficient rain.  The health hazards of a lower water table are many. However, no action has been taken on the report due to the pandemic. “Every year, at least twice we conduct a quality check on the wells’ water and ones with high chemical content are banned from use, until their level touches the permissible limits,” said Narottam Sharma, CMHO Jaipur-1. He assured that once the staff gets some time from Covid duty, they will go for the quality check. Jal Jeevan Mission scheme data says that barely 19% of rural households have piped water connections, leaving the vast majority to depend on other water sources, including wells for drinking and other purposes. “Every eight out of 10 respondents I met during the research report were suffering from skeletal fluorosis in blocks Ahor, Jalore and Sanchore of Jalore district,” said Navneet Mishra, state programme officer, INREM, a sector partner of Jal Jeevan Mission scheme, while adding that he has suggested to the district administration to promote surface water storage structures under MGNREGA’s rehabilitation of water storage structure like in Karnataka and Gujarat. Calling for the immediate action on wells with low water table, RK Goyal, principal scientist (Hydrology), Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI) said, “A deeper groundwater table comes with geogenic salts like fluoride, nitrate, calcium, magnesium and in some places, uranium as well. Its consumption is not clinically good for the human body,” said Goyal. On the other hand, shallow water level less than 2 metres or below has been observed in some places in districts like Bundi, Kota, Pratapgarh, Banswara, Jhalawar, Baran, Dungarpur and Pali districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/water-in-20-wells-of-raj-unsuitable-for-drinking/articleshow/83247518.cms||Shoeb Khan

Earlier on Wednesday, the CM ordered to reserve 33.3% seats for girls in all engineering and medical colleges in the state from the next academic session. While chairing a high-level meeting through videoconferencing to review the state’s law and order scenario, Nitish said women police officers and constables must be posted in all police stations as it will boost up the morale of women reaching the police stations to lodge a complaint. Bihar has 853 police stations and 40 of them are rail police stations. Nitish also asked DGP S K Singhal to ensure the parade of all chowkidars at their police station concerned every Saturday to get information about his/her village-related problems/ disputes. While discussing the land disputes, Nitish said, “The DM and the SP must hold a joint meeting once in a month to solve land-related disputes in their jurisdictions. Similarly, the SDO and the SDPO will hold a joint meeting at the subdivision level once in a fortnight and the circle officer and the SHO once in a week.” He asked the police officers to increase the conviction rate through speedy trial in the cases of serious crimes. “Investigate the cases properly so that the government can ensure stern punishments to the criminals. There should be no laxity in crime investigation and it should be continuously monitored,” he said. “Also, ensure continuous analysis of different types of crime at all levels so that the law and order remains maintained,” Nitish told the senior police officers. He also ordered for strengthening the system of night patrolling in all police stations. Nitish said he would not tolerate any laxity in crime control. He asked the DGP to identify the officers indulged in committing irregularities and take stern action against them. Earlier, the DGP informed the CM about the steps taken to improve the law and order scenario in the state. Additional DGP (Special Branch) Jitendra Singh Gangwar told him about the works being done by the special branch of the state police.

As many as 600 trees will be planted at the very spot where nearly 300 trees had got uprooted during the cyclone. About 750 trees were damaged due to strong wind in the cyclone last month. At places where the entire tree was uprooted, the garden department of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will plant neem trees. The majority of trees that got uprooted were of different species and comparatively weaker when it comes to withstanding heavy gusts. “We will be planting neem or ficus trees at most places. At each spot where one tree was uprooted, we will plant two trees,” said S J Gautam, superintendent, garden department of SMC. Most of the trees uprooted in the city were near the footpaths. “Native species are stronger compared to other trees and it has many benefits. The damage to green cover can be reduced by planting native trees,” Gautam added. Meanwhile, environmental activists appreciated SMC’s initiative but suggested that planting only native trees was not a solution for better survival rate of trees. “Fresh plantation in place of uprooted trees is a good initiative. But neem requires soil where its roots can go deep and it is also a type of tree that grows on comparatively dry area,” said Darshan Desai, a volunteer of Prayas Team Environment (PTE). “The ground is harder due to multiple layers of stone and other material. This will hamper the growth of native trees like neem,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-trees-replace-each-uprooted-one/articleshow/83246486.cms||---

On Thursday, carcasses of a female leopard and her four-month-old cub were found in Mohgaon in dry Pendhri nullah. A post-mortem conducted by livestock development officer (LDO) Dr Rohini Bawaskar prima facie revealed that the animals died due to dehydration. “However, though the post-mortem was conducted by Dr Bawaskar alone, the press release issued by Khapa range forest officer (RFO) Pravin Naik falsely stated that Dr Syed Bilal of Transit Treatment Centre (TTC), Seminary Hills, was also present,” said newly-appointed district honorary wildlife warden Avinash Londhe. Londhe alleged the two leopards died of thirst. “It is the complete failure of the RFO concerned that no artificial drinking water sources have been created for wildlife during peak summer,” he said. He said, “Leopard being Schedule-I animal under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, no senior officers reached the spot as per protocol. Of the four honorary wardens for Nagpur district, not one was invited during post-mortem as representatives of PCCF (wildlife) and NTCA. Ashish Kohale from a local NGO was called.” RFO Naik admits, “Dr Bilal’s name in the press release was mentioned by mistake. Kohale was called as NTCA representative with prior permission from AIG Hemant Kamdi. It’s true that there was no PCCF representative.” On not calling honorary wardens for post-mortem, Naik said, “Ajinkya Bhatkar was unavailable as he was out of Nagpur. Another warden Roheet Karu is based in Umred and it was not possible for him to come. I have not heard about one more warden Uddhamsingh Yadav and, moreover, I was also not aware that Londhe being appointed warden two days ago.” “There is no intentional goof up. Senior officials could not reach the spot as they were busy guiding monitoring teams to check the leopard problem in Nagpur. The post-mortem was conducted in a transparent manner and there is no poaching as all the body parts were intact,” said RFO Naik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/row-over-not-calling-wardens-for-post-mortem-of-2-leopards/articleshow/83245902.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The first batch of the six-month course will commence on June 17.  “Despite a big hype created, CSR is slowly losing its sheen because it has failed to satisfy stakeholders, especially communities and civil society. Although several factors are responsible for this, one of the leading reasons is the professional competence of CSR managers and executives,” said professor Sudhir Kumar Sinha, chair, MDP at IRMA and course coordinator.  “We will engage with companies to build and strengthen professional capacity of CSR managers/executives. This is custom-designed to train them and provide them with adequate subject knowledge and managerial skills to enrich their knowledge base,” he said.  IRMA is also extending the scope of this course to working professionals in NGOs as well as armed forces. “Through the course, the participants will learn to strategize CSR to create shared value, they will be introduced to concepts and approaches of social development. Also, they learn how CSR can be structured, strategic and measurable philanthropy,” he said.

These lines from the popular song in JP Dutta’s film ‘Refugee’ ring true for winged creatures. In times of Covid-19, when there are air travel restrictions to several countries due to Covid-19 pandemic, many birds ringed by Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) are flying across countries. Most recently, a Terek Sandpiper that was ringed in the Gulf of Kutch in February 2017 was re-sighted at Jandola, Pakistan in May 2021. Since 2017, BNHS has tagged more than 700 birds in Gujarat in a collaborative project with the state forest department.  The tagging programme was halted in March 2020 due to the coronavirus but re-sighting of tagged birds even at the height of the second wave of the pandemic in April and May have bird lovers excited. “An isolated re-sighting does not tell us much because the tags are not like radio collars which allow us to track the journey of the bird. But it is still exciting because of how rarely it happens. Taken together, re-sightings provide important insights into the political boundaries that birds may cross, and potential hurdles they face on their often long migratory routes,” said Bivash Panday, director, BNHS. For instance, the great knot, a shore bird tagged in Kamchatka in Russia was last seen on April 7, 2021 at Balachadi near Jamnagar. Yashodhan Bhatia, an avid birder from Jamnagar who first spotted and documented the bird in Gujarat, said the tagged bird code-named ‘6 Z’ was first sighted by him and a few other birdwatchers on October 6, 2019 and then again three months later on January 2020 at Balachadi. “The great knot is commonly seen in Balachadi along with bar-tailed godwits and crab plovers. The fact that they migrate from Russia, flying 7,700km across the continent was confirmed with the ‘6-Z’ sighting,” said Bhatia. He said the bird uses the East Asian-Australasian flyway and the Central Asia flyway. Other birds tagged by BNHS in India and which have been sighted in other countries in the current migratory season are a curlew sandpiper (a medium-sized wader bird native to Russia’s Arctic tundra), which was tagged in Navi Mumbai over two years ago and was seen again over 4,500km away, in China’s Tianjin province recently. “The bird was seen in the Tangu Saltpans on May 7, marking the first international re-sighting of a bird tagged on the Mumbai coast,” BNHS officials said. A northern shoveler tagged at Odisha’s Chilika lake in February 2018 was re-sighted by birders in Uzbekistan in April this year. Similarly, a broad-billed sandpiper tagged in Tamil Nadu in October 2019 was spotted in Hong Kong in the same month. A similar re-sighting of an Indian skimmer tagged in Chambal, Madhya Pradesh, in June 2019 happened in Bangladesh this January. “Gujarat is blessed with coastal wetlands which attract millions of migratory shorebirds. It is important to document such large migratory shorebird populations at the national and global levels. There are several potential sites which though unprotected qualify as Ramsar sites, based on criteria of population of these migratory birds. The bird ringing programme by BNHS across the country, will definitely help unravel several mysteries of these migratory birds,” Dishant Parashariya, scientist, BNHS. In May last year, an Amur falcon, satellite tagged by the Wildlife Institute of India, arrived in Gir after flying over African lions while crossing Africa. The state seems to be emerging as a gateway for migratory birds covering the longest distances. Amur falcons are known to have among the longest migration routes in birds, up to 22,000km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujaratis-grounded-in-pandemic-birds-fly-across-countries/articleshow/83245894.cms||Maulik Pathak

Residents at Lake Town were surprised to find a six-month-old puppy that was buckled and was straying in the road a few days ago. “Some of the locals suspected that the puppy might have been someone’s pet and have accidentally come out of a house. It was not seen in the road the next day,” said Sudhir Maheswari, a local. However, the puppy was seen on the footpath after a few days and it was being shooed away by the guard of a medical establishment there. Locals alleged that the guard was also trying to beat it. “Some of the locals resisted and started questioning the guard. He said that the woman, who had adopted the puppy, was no longer interested in keeping it as she was shifting to her home in Nagaland. We decided to write the matter to Gandhi,” said Chirashri Ghosh, a pet lover and resident of Salt Lake. “We lodged a complaint with the police,” said Maheswari.  “I spoke to the owner of the medical establishment.

Tender conditions were tweaked and designed to favour a cartel of companies and to eliminate competition, the NGO said. The prices finalised for supplying thousands of tonnes of essentials were way above even retail prices prevailing at that time, it said. For instance, according to Arappor, for a tender (cancelled by the present DMK government) on May 5, 2021, for procurement of pulses, a company quoted around Rs 145 per kg. But after Arappor flagged it, the tender norms were corrected and re-floated 10 days later. This time more companies participated and the same company quoted around Rs 80 as price for pulses. Tamil Nadu saved Rs 120 crore in this single tender alone. Similarly, for sugar tenders, prior to 2019, sugar manufacturers participated directly in tender which kept the procurement price at Rs 37 a kg. However, after tender conditions were modified in July 2019, the price went up to Rs 47 a kg. Jayaram Venkatesan, convenor of the NGO, said, “When the same tender was re-floated a few months later, the same company, which had originally quoted Rs 32.9, submitted a rate of Rs 49.9 and all competing bidders had been rendered ineligible to bid.” Arappor’s complaint pertains to tenders for supply of 2.7 lakh tonnes of sugar from January 2019 to 2021, 56.56 crore one-litre pouches of palm oil from 2017-2021 and 5 lakh tonnes of pulses (dhal) from 2015-2021. According to the complaint, Tamil Nadu government paid a premium of Rs 10 per kg for sugar, Rs 15.95 per pouch for palm oil and Rs 15 per kg for dhal over and above the wholesale rate. To buttress their complaint, Arappor has also attached wholesale as well as retail rates of commodities obtained from the government-run Amudham stores. Though the government procurement was in bulk, the final rates were higher than even the retail rates in almost all cases. Arappor’s evidence also shows that the cartel, led allegedly by Christy Freidgram group in Tiruchengode, also enrolled themselves as buyback suppliers for central government trading agencies like MSTC and Kendriya Bhandar. These agencies participated in TNCSC tenders and quoted the rates given to them by the cartel led by Christy Freidgram. “This is violative of STC tender clauses which disallow buyback suppliers and STC participating in the same tender,” Arappor said in its complaint. Information obtained by Arappor through RTI shows that the STCs got only 1% of the earning, while the rest went to the buyback supplier. When contacted, a company official of Christy Freidgram said: “The allegations are completely false. We supply at prices lower than those quoted in the tender after negotiation with the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-lost-rs-2000cr-in-pds-tenders-in-5-yrs-says-ngo-in-graft-plaint/articleshow/83245890.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

A division bench of justices I P Mukerji and Moushumi Bhattacharya in their order said, “As far as the case made out in the writ application is concerned, this is a fit case, considering the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, to be entertained as public interest litigation.” On October 13, 2020, a HC division bench of which Justice Bhattacharya was a member, had passed an order that there will be no increase in school fees during 2020-21. In the case before the HC on Friday, it was said some parents had not abided by the HC order to clear fees and the school was thinking of considering debarring those students from online classes. The HC in an interim order said the parents will have to clear fees by June 15 or pay in four equal instalments. The school will charge 80% fees for 2021-22 and can debar students from classes only if payments are not made by July 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-hears-school-fee-revision-plea/articleshow/83245887.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

On Thursday, Air Vice-Marshal Alok Sharma along with senior IAF officials took stock of the selected site and checked helicopter and flight landing status at the site. After inspection, it was decided that the airport should be developed in an area of 50 hectares against the earlier decided 43 hectares. The airstrip is expected to be 2.5 kilometres long and 200 metres wide. The IAF has been planning to set up an airport at Chaukhutia for almost a decade to bolster its defence preparedness along the India-China border in Uttarakhand. The survey of the land was initially done in 2017 after which multiple site visits have been carried out by IAF personnel. Currently, IAF uses its airbase in Izzatnagar near Bareilly (Uttar Pradesh), to respond to any situation along the India-China border. Speaking to TOI about the project, RK Pandey, SDM Dwarahat (Almora), said, “The land selected for the project belongs to the irrigation department. DM Almora will soon send a proposal to the state government for its approval.” The official added that once constructed, the facility will serve as an Advanced Landing Ground for the IAF, helping in the quick mobilisation of troops and equipment to the borders during a crisis situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/indian-air-force-gives-its-go-ahead-for-chaukhutia-airstrip-along-india-china-border-clearances-awaited-from-state/articleshow/83241446.cms||---
---||Lucknow||All is not lost: Better traffic management, hygiene has made a difference over the years||LUCKNOW: Although a decline in air pollution levels has been recorded in the last two years in April and May due to Covid-19 restrictions but even without restrictions, there has been an overall decreasing trend in air pollution levels in the city, according to an IITR report. Terming it to be a positive sign, scientists at the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) said the decline might be due to an efficient traffic management system and Lucknow Metro. “There is a decreasing trend in air pollution levels from 2017 to 2020 in ambient air indicating that the city’s air pollution in the past was more than the current levels. This decrease may be attributed to significant improvements in traffic management like installation of traffic signals, widening and making of paved/concrete road that has led to fewer traffic jams. Also, sweeping of road dust, ban on trash burning and proper disposal of municipal solid waste has improved air quality,” said chief scientist GC Kisku. Also, the report highlighted that more diesel automobiles were used, hence increasing consumption of diesel by 13.5% as compared to last year, while CNG and petrol consumption witnessed a drop of 65.5% and 3.8%, respectively. To cover longer distances, people prefer diesel vehicles hence the rise in diesel consumption may be due to coming up of cab services and use of commercial vehicle for transportation, experts said. They added that petrol and CNG drop showed that people were venturing out less in public transports as well as personal vehicles due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/all-is-not-lost-better-traffic-management-hygiene-has-made-a-difference-over-the-yrs/articleshow/83247668.cms||---
---||Delhi||Man held for cheating Covid patients gets bail||New Delhi: A man arrested for allegedly cheating people on the pretext of selling them Covid-19 resources such as oxygen cylinders, concentrators and medicines was on Friday allowed bail by a city court, which noted that he had no antecedents and that his being from another state couldn’t be a ground to refuse him the reprieve. “No purpose would be served by keeping him behind bars during the pendency of investigation. Accused is accordingly admitted to bail on furnishing a personal bond and one surety bond in the sum of Rs 25,000 each,” chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg said. Police alleged that the cell phones recovered from the accused, Dipak Prasad, revealed “suspicious” WhatsApp chats. It also pointed out that similar complaints relating to the allegations against Prasad had been registered in other police stations with the current one being investigated by the crime branch. Opposing bail, it was argued that the applicant hailed from Bihar and the investigation was at a nascent stage with other accused persons yet to be arrested. Appearing for Prasad, his counsel submitted that he had a clean record and was willing to furnish a “sound” surety and abide by all conditions imposed on him if granted bail. It also came on record of the court that the man had been in custody since May 22, 2021 with the police obtaining four days of police custody remand earlier. “Merely because he is a permanent resident of Bihar, and the other accused are yet to be arrested, cannot be a ground for denial of bail,” the court noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-held-for-cheating-covid-patients-gets-bail/articleshow/83245944.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Committee set up to probe Acharya Nagarjuna University V-C||AMARAVATI: The state government has appointed a high-level committee to probe allegations against Dr P Rajasekhar, vice-chancellor of Acharya Nagarjuna University (ANU). Dr K Nirupama Rani, former vice-chancellor, Adikavi Nannayya University, will act as chairperson of the committee. A Ananda Rao, vice-chancellor of Rayalaseema University and Dr G Kannamadas, former joint secretary to the state government (higher education) are the members of the committee. The secretary of the AP State Council for Higher Education (APSCHE) would coordinate with the probe committee. The government has asked the committee to submit its findings within 90 days. Satish Chandra, special chief secretary, the higher education department, has noted that the allegations against Rajasekhar were serious in nature. The decision to constitute the committee was taken after the University Arts and Commerce College principal and executive council member Dr Ratna Sheila Mani submitted a complaint to governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan. She alleged that several irregularities had taken place in the university when Rajasekhar was the university registrar. She also questioned how Rajasekhar was appointed as vice-chancellor even after the probe committee appointed by the previous government confirmed the charges against him. She said that a committee headed by former principal secretary Dr Chakrapani conducted enquiry into the allegations against Rajasekhar in the past and confirmed several charges. Sources said Raj Bhavan directed the higher education department to look into the issue and submit a report about the allegations. Meanwhile, a YSRC legislator said it was unfortunate to constitute yet another committee to probe into the allegations instead of sacking him based on the previous enquiry committee report. Sources said that a few activists from ANU are likely to file a petition in the high court seeking action based on Chakrapani committee report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/committee-set-up-to-probe-anu-v-c/articleshow/83213925.cms||Samdani MN

Coming to the rescue of the slum dwellers, Good Samaritans have not only rebuilt 53 shanties, the slum dwellers have also been provide ration and utensils.  Zubin Ashara, who heads a team of about 150 volunteers who call themselves `Team Seva Yagna’, said that 48 of the 53 shanties and every item inside were completely burnt down in the fire on May 26 at the slum. “We have set up the shanties again with tarpaulin and bamboos. In addition, we have also provided ration and utensils to all those who were affected,” said Ashara,who deals in real estate. When the second wave of Covid-19 was at its peak, volunteers of `Team Seva Yagna’ provided 250 to 300 oxygen cylinders free of cost to needy Covid-19 patients. A gas cylinder blast at Suryanagar slum in Vejalpur on May 26 destroyed several shanties with the slum dwellers losing all their belongings in the blaze.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/good-samaritans-rebuild-burned-down-shanties/articleshow/83245953.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Cost of delay: Centre declines air ambulance project re-proposed by Uttarakhand to enhance emergency medical services in hills||DEHRADUN: Days after TOI reported how Uttarakhand failed to start an air ambulance project which had got Centre’s approval (from financial year 2018-19 to 2020-21), the Centre has now declined the state’s request of running the project during this financial year (2021-22). The health department said that the reason for declining the proposal was not specifically mentioned in the letter from the Centre. The Uttarakhand government, in the tenure of former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, had announced plans to start an air ambulance for addressing medical emergencies in the hills. The project also received an in-principle approval from the Centre in 2018 but it did not take off in the time period sanctioned by the Centre. The project, if functional, would have been the first of its kind initiative of providing air ambulance services in the hills. According to sources, the ambulance service should have started in 2019 as the National Health Mission (NHM) initiated the tender processes for the project twice in the last three years. “The project couldn't take off due to the casual approach of authorities towards such an important project. The NHM director, responsible for executing the project, delayed it for three years. Now, when the state needs the service the most in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Centre has declined to go ahead with the project,” said a senior NHM official. Kestrel Aviation, the company which bagged the tender for running an air ambulance service in 2020, had set its base at the Sahastradhara helipad and claimed to be spending at least Rs 7-to-8 lakh per month on maintenance. “The delay in the air ambulance project is a huge loss for us. We have already spent around Rs 40 lakh and now, our services are no longer needed apparently,” said an official from Kestrel Aviation. While a private agency is running 108 emergency ambulance services in Uttarakhand, the cases of people losing their lives on way to hospitals continue to surface in the state, especially in hills where road connectivity is an issue. In fact, the Uttarakhand high court, in August 2018, had expressed its concern over poor road network in far-flung areas stating that lack of connectivity makes a person lose crucial time during health emergencies. When asked about the delay in starting the air ambulance service, Amit Negi, secretary (health), said that the Centre has declined giving its nod to the project but the state is committed to providing ‘best and quick healthcare to its people.’ “Even without an air ambulance project, we airlift patients after receiving SOS messages. We use state funds for this purpose. In a bid to provide people with timely treatment, the state will continue to provide air service in emergency cases,” said Negi. Meanwhile, Anoop Nautiyal, founder of the Social Development for Communities Foundation (an organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 scenario in Uttarakhand since its outbreak), said, “As per studies, 79% of deaths occur within four hours of the trauma. To save the lives of people, the government should operate at least two air ambulances from its resources.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cost-of-delay-centre-declines-air-ambulance-project-re-proposed-by-uttarakhand-to-enhance-emergency-medical-services-in-hills/articleshow/83241469.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Even Covid curfew failed to rein in air pollution||LUCKNOW: Despite restrictions on movement in April and partial curfew in May during the second Covid-19 wave, air pollution levels were above permissible limits in the city in both months, reveals a study by Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR). The ‘assessment of ambient air quality of Lucknow city: pre-monsoon 2021 report’ was released by the CSIR institute on the eve of World Environment Day. Track the pollution level in your cityThe reason is that while many preferred to stay indoors, vehicles continued to ply to provide health services. There was also a mad rush of people for hospital care, besides increase in crematorium fires due to surge in Covid-19 deaths. Other major contributors include domestic cooking, baking/firing in hotels, crop combustion and some industries which were operating, said the report prepared by a team of senior scientists. The monitoring of nine locations—four each residential and commercial and one industrial—by IITR found that concentration of fine and superfine pollutants PM10 and PM2.5 was higher than permissible limits, which are 100 micrograms for PM10 and 60 micrograms for PM2.5, set by National Ambient Air Quality Standard. “The mean values of PM10 and PM2.5 concentration in the air recorded at all locations increased by 26% and 16% respectively as compared to last year. The reason is that last year, it was a complete lockdown during the Covid-19 first wave, but this time, during the second wave, there were limited restrictions in movement in April and a partial curfew in May,” said chief scientist GC Kisku, who led the team. The report also found that Gomtinagar and Chargbagh were the most polluted localities in the city. Among residential areas, a 24-hour high PM10 concentration of 128.7 micrograms per cubic metre of air was recorded in Gomtinagar followed by Indiranagar (124.5), Vikasnagar (117.3) and Aliganj (111.9). Similarly, PM2.5 concentration was highest in Gomtinagar with 68.2 micrograms followed by Indiranagar (67.6), Vikasnagar (62.5) and Aliganj (60.7 micrograms). Among commercial areas, the highest average PM10 concentration of 143.8 micrograms was recorded in Charbagh followed by Alambagh (133.9), Chowk (121.1) and Aminabad (109.8 micrograms). Similarly, PM2.5 concentration was also highest in Charbagh, with 71.1 followed by Alambagh (64.5), Chowk (62.5) and Aminabad (62 micrograms). The industrial area of Amausi also recorded high PM10 and PM2.5 values of 152.5 and 61.5 micrograms respectively. The report said that the concentration of gaseous pollutants, SO2 and NO2, was well below the prescribed NAAQS limit (80mcg/m3) at all locations, but higher in comparison to last year. “High level of air pollutants and their effects on human health are serious issues. To resolve the issue, a comprehensive study is required with respect to present status of different pollutants and their trends, sources of pollutants and public health risk assessment for future planning on safer urban areas,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/air-pollution-remained-high-in-april-may-despite-partial-curfew/articleshow/83247704.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Were SC guidelines followed in judge’s arrest, HC asks Andhra Pradesh government||VIJAYAWADA: The AP high court on Thursday asked the state government whether it followed the directions of the Supreme Court during the arrest of judge S Ramakrishna on sedition charges.  The bench of justices K Vijaya Lakshmi and D Ramesh Kumar directed the state to file an affidavit specifying if the apex court guidelines were adhered to while arresting the judge. The HC took up the matter suo moto after the judge’s son S Vamsikrishna wrote a letter to the chief justice of AP high court raising concerns over the safety of his father in jail. On Wednesday, Ramakrishna was shifted from Chittoor sub-jail to Piler sub-jail as per his own request, the court was informed by government pleader Maheshwar Reddy. The bench then asked him if the Supreme Court’s guidelines were followed while arresting Ramakrishna. Reddy said as the judge was already under suspension at the time of his arrest, the SC guidelines do not apply in his case. The HC took objection to the reply, and stated that no such exemption is mentioned in the apex court’s orders and directing the state to file a counter, posted the next hearing of the matter to third week of June. Ramakrishna was arrested on April 15 on charges of sedition for allegedly making objectionable comments on chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. Meanwhile, Ramakrishna’s bail petition came up for hearing before the single judge bench of Justice M Ranga Rao on Thursday. Senior counsel Dammalapati Sridhar, appearing for the suspended judge, submitted before the court that the judge’s ‘objectionable’ comments do not come under sedition and sought bail. The counsel for the police requested the court for some time to file counters, following which the matter was posted for hearing to next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/were-sc-guidelines-followed-in-judges-arrest-hc-asks-state/articleshow/83213926.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Ahmedabad||N440K in Gujarat: The new super infective virus strain on the block||AHMEDABAD: An especially infective Covid variant known as N440K has a mutation in its spike protein and had lingered for quite a while in the southern states along with the now dominant double mutant B.1.617. It is B.1.617 that has wreaked havoc across the country during the second wave. But few know that the N440K variant was also seen in Gujarat in at least nine Covid samples of the 293 tested between January and April 24 this year. This fact was revealed in a research paper published recently by the Academy for Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), headquartered on the CSIR campus in Ghaziabad. “The N440K variant produces ten times higher infectious viral titers than a prevalent A2a strain,” says the paper. The authors of the paper are Dixit Tandel, Divya Gupta, and Krishnan Harinivas Harshan of AcSIR; and Vishal Sah, of the infectious disease department at Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad. Sah had explained in a tweet, “We did not compare the infective titer of N440K with the UK or the double mutant B.1.617 in this study.” He had gone on to say: “We compared it with its parent strain which did not have mutation and with another strain which is now almost lost among the population.” The AcSIR researchers had analyzed 1,555 genome sequencing entries on GISAID, a worldwide Covid information collaboration platform. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), a grouping of 10 national laboratories under the Union ministry of health, provides information to the platform. The researchers found that Maharashtra reported the highest number of samples, 91, consisting of the N440K mutant of the 772 Covid virus genes sequenced. Telangana reported 81 samples with the variant in the 773 samples sequenced. Karnataka reported 54 in the 339 samples sequenced. The AcSIR study says that Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Chhattisgarh together contribute to about 50% of the samples that showed the presence of the N440K spread in India. “Our data suggests that the proportion of N440K variant has been increasing gradually and suggesting its improved replicative fitness or increased infectivity,” the paper says. “Our studies unambiguously demonstrate that the N440K variant prototype has capacity to generate significantly higher titers of infectious virus in shorter duration and suggest that this feature could promote its faster spread among certain populations.” The paper was published on bioRxiv (pronounced “bio-archive”) which is an open-access preprint repository of research papers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/n440k-the-new-super-infective-virus-strain-on-the-block/articleshow/83245950.cms||Paul John
---||Chennai||NHAI lost Rs 200 crore in Tamil Nadu land scam||CHENNAI: A land acquisition scam, which caused about Rs 200 crore loss to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), has surfaced in Kancheepuram district. Based on a complaint from tahsildar G Venkatesan, Kancheepuram police have filed cases against a former Sriperumbudur tahsildar, an assistant settlement officer and a private landowner identified as Ashish Jain, also known as Ashish Mehta. While Rs 33 crore was paid to Mehta for a parcel of 7.67 acres of land for which fake patta was prepared, officials say the same modus operandi was used to create fake documents for at least 82 acres of land for which ₹200 crore was paid by NHAI as compensation. Given the size of the fraud and involvement of central funds, land administration commissioner Pankaj Kumar Bansal has recommended NHAI to hand over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Documents accessed by TOI showed how NHAI acquired 2.5 acres of the 7.67 acres of land owned by Ashish Mehta at Beemanthangal village near Sriperumbudur for six-laning of National Highway-4. This piece of land was originally classified as ‘anadeenam’ land, vested with the government. But Shanmugam, an assistant settlement officer, prepared fake documents using survey numbers of a different village from Poonamallee in Thiruvallur district to provide patta for 7.67 acres, an investigation by the director of survey in 2020 found. When a related case came up before the Madras high court, then tahsildar of Sriperumbudur G Radhakrishnan, the only respondent, failed to submit the fact that forged documents were used to get patta for the government land. Commissioner Bansal recommended the Kancheepuram district collector to book Ashish Mehta, the ASO and the ex-tahsildar for entering into a criminal conspiracy to defraud the exchequer. Based on this, G Venkatesan, the present tahsildar, filed a complaint, and the three have been booked for fraud, cheating and criminal conspiracy by use of forged documents. The district administration has now ordered an inquiry into pattas issued to all plots in the vicinity at Beemanthangal village. “We have found that pattas were issued to 82 acres of government (anadeenam and meikal poramboke) land in and around the village, and orders have been passed to cancel the patta,” said a revenue official. NHAI could have suffered close to ₹200 crore loss because of the fraud, he said. While patta was issued to Ashish Mehta in 2000, the NHAI awarded the compensation in July 2018. The land administration commissioner proceedings, recommending CBI probe, are dated March 17, 2021 The FIR was filed on April 23, 2020. The follow-up inspection by district revenue officials for the 82 acres started this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/nhai-lost-rs-200cr-in-tn-land-scam/articleshow/83245954.cms||Ram Sundaram

The noise pollution levels were monitored in nine areas and were found above the prescribed limit by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQs). “Like air, the noise pollution levels also witnessed an increasing trend as compared to the last year. Of the nine locations, only two commercial areas — Alambagh and Amindabd — had noise pollution levels during the night below the prescribed limit of 55 decibels,” said IITR chief scientist GC Kisku. Among the industrial areas, Amausi was the noisiest, both during the day and night. In residential areas, Gomtinagar was the most cacophonous during day, followed by Vikasnagar, Aliganj and Indiranagar, against the permissible limit of 55 decibels while during night, Vikasnagar was the noisiest with 60 decibels pollution levels recorded followed by Aliganj , Gomtinagar and Indiranagar. In commercial areas, Chowk with 79 decibels was the most noise polluted during day, followed by Charbagh (72.2dB), Aminabad (71.6dB) and Alambagh (67.2dB) against the prescribed limit of 65 decibels, while Charbagh was noisiest at night with 61.3 decibels, followed by Chowk (57.4dB), Aminabad (53.1dB) and Alambagh (52.3dB) against the prescribed limit of 55 decibels. Chief scientist GC Kisku suggested that lesser use of loudspeakers, horns and smooth traffic management should be ensured to reduce noise pollution levels in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/chowk-most-cacophonous-during-day-charbagh-at-night/articleshow/83247748.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Delhi government waiting for LG nod to panel on oxygen deaths: Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday said that a committee set up by the Delhi government to look into the deaths caused by shortage of oxygen during the recent spike in Covid-19 cases and provide financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh to victims’ families will start its work once the file is approved by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal. In a digital press conference, Sisodia said that the recent wave of Covid-19 had resulted in a massive oxygen crisis because of which many families had lost their loved ones. “Keeping this in mind, the Delhi government formed a four-member medical expert panel with the responsibility to inspect this issue and disburse Rs 5 lakh as medical assistance to all those families who lost a member due to the oxygen crisis,” he said. Sisodia added, “After the authorisation of this file by the panel, the Delhi government has sent the file to the LG office. The process of disbursal will begin immediately after the approval of the LG,” he said. The deputy CM said that the file was sent to the LG office after being passed by the four-member medical expert committee.  “When citizens across Delhi were heavily affected due to the latest deadly wave, many of them lost a family member due to the oxygen crisis that emerged in Delhi. Taking into account the seriousness of the matter, the Delhi government formed the committee. The panel will inspect claims of all those families who lost their loved ones due to oxygen scarcity twice a week and then start disbursing Rs 5 lakh financial assistance to each family,” he said. The committee was constituted as per an order issued on May 27, which stated that it will approve assistance of up to Rs 5 lakh. This amount would be over and above the amount of Rs 50,000 that is already supposed to be provided to families of those who succumbed to Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-waiting-for-lg-nod-to-panel-on-o2-deaths-sisodia/articleshow/83245962.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Two hospitals barred from providing Covid-19 treatment||COIMBATORE: In a stern action, health officials have banned the Dr Muthu’s Hospital at Saravanampatti in Coimbatore and the Sowmya Hospital in Tirupur from admitting or treating Covid-19 patients as they have been found to be overcharging the patients. While the order cancelling Dr Muthu’s permission to treat Covid-19 patients came on Thursday evening, the department of health services in Tirupur issued the order against the Sowmya Hospital on Friday. The move comes in the wake of growing complaints against both the hospitals to the medical and rural health services departments. Coimbatore medical services department said the Dr Muthu’s Hospital had not cooperated with the inquiry and audit that was conducted by the medical and rural health services department and failed to submit the required documents. However, patients already undergoing treatment at the facility could complete the hospitalization period. An official with the health services department said as per the complaints the hospitals were charging Covid-19 patients, including those on high-flow oxygen in intensive care units, up to Rs 1 lakh a day against the government fixed tariff of Rs 27,500. There were also complaints that the Dr Muthu’s Hospital was incompetent to treat Covid-19 patients, with some relatives stating that the condition of their loved ones, who were admitted with a lung CT severity score of 2/20, getting worse and succumbing to the virus in some cases. “Your facility, Dr Muthu’s Hospital Private Limited, Saravanampatti, has not cooperated for the inquiry and audit. Hence, under the Tamil Nadu Clinical Establishments Act, 1997, and rules 2018, your facility has been suspended from treating Covid-19 patients from now onwards,” said the notice issued to the hospital. TOI had on May 18 reported how several smaller private hospitals with less than 100 beds were charging Covid-19 patients to the tune of Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/two-hospitals-barred-from-providingcovid-19-treatment/articleshow/83246014.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lucknow University arts faculty also rejects common minimum syllabus||LUCKNOW: After facing rejection from the science faculty board of Lucknow University, the state government’s common minimum syllabus (CMS) claimed to be on a par with the New Education Policy (NEP 2020) faced stiff opposition and rejection from the university’s arts faculty during the faculty board meeting on Friday. All 26 departments of the arts faculty rejected CMS saying that the standard of the syllabus is much lower than what is being taught by the university at present. Senior teachers of the arts faculty said that course content that promises greater employability to students is missing from the syllabus, which is against NEP. The higher education department had drafted CMS for state universities last year after the central government issued NEP and uploaded it on its website. On April 20, it directed state universities to include 70% of the content prescribed in CMS in their syllabi and have 30% content of their own. “There is no consistency in the syllabus and it’s a very imbalanced one. For example, the syllabus is overburdening students with six papers in a semester while in others there are only three or two papers,” said head of the economics department Prof MK Agarwal. He also said that topics of specialization meant for PG level had been introduced at UG level. He further added that there was great monotony in the syllabus as CMS continues to teach Indian economy to students for many semesters whereas at present they are taught economic theories for 360-degree knowledge. Head of the sociology department Prof DR Sahu said important topics have been removed in CMS. “A very important portion of rural sociology about aspects of rural life, its problems, culture, religion, economic and political life has been removed,” said Prof Sahu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-arts-faculty-also-rejects-common-minimum-syllabus/articleshow/83247801.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nagpur Cops rescue 7 held captive by armed kidnapper||NAGPUR: In a scene straight out of a Bollywood potboiler, the city police rescued seven family members held captive by an armed kidnapper on Friday afternoon. Around 50 police personnel led by DCP (crime) Gajanan Rajmane descended on a house in Pipla Fata around 2.30pm after reports of a man pointing a Mauser gun at a builder’s family and demanding Rs50 lakh as ransom. Armed cops surrounded the house of builder Raju Vaidya. The entire drama lasted for about three hours with the kidnapper holding seven members of the Vaidya family captive. Roads leading to the locality were cordoned off while negotiations with the accused continued for around three hours. Eventually the accused, identified as Jitendra Bisen, was arrested and a pistol and a knife was seized. Hudkeshwar police station’s senior police inspector (PI) PV Bhosale said there were no reports of anyone being injured in the incident. The police were told that a man had entered Vaidya’s bungalow in Creative Cooperative Society near Pipla Fata, brandishing a pistol. There were three members of the family on the ground floor and four on the first floor when he entered. The man kept Vaidya’s mother, brother’s wife and daughter — who were at the ground floor — hostage. They shouted, which alerted Vaidya’s wife who was at the first floor. She then locked herself in with her son and nephew upstairs. Bhosale said, “I found all the windows of the multistorey house closed from inside and there was pin-drop silence. It was learnt that an armed youth held a girl and two other women members of the family hostage,” he said. The accused was repeatedly waving his gun and threatening to kill them. He also had a knife. He said that he would keep the entire family hostage till he got Rs50 lakh and would shoot everyone if Vaidya failed to do so. After this, Bisen spoke to the rest of the family members on the phone and asked for Rs50 lakh ransom. Meanwhile, the girl called her uncle Raju Vaidya. Bisen asked him to bring the money. He also threatened dire consequences if Vaidya failed to arrange the money. Vaidya informed the cops about the incident. Soon, a police team reached there. “We decided to lay a trap. First, the builder offered him Rs2 lakh from one of the ground floor windows. The accused was given Rs2 lakh thrice and we kept him busy, negotiating on the ransom money,” said Bhosale. As the city police continued to divert Bisen’s attention, Rajmane, along with his team, entered the house from the second floor and rescued the four family members cooped up on the first floor. Then the cops reached the ground floor, surrounded Bisen and rescued the hostage women. Police said Bisen has no criminal record, but his elder brother Ankit was a notorious goon and had committed several serious crimes. At present Ankit is lodged in Central Jail, police said. Police said the ‘pistol’ recovered from Bisen was actually a cigarette lighter, and added that Bisen used to work in a catering firm and was jobless for the last one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-foil-filmy-ransom-bid-rescue-7-held-captive/articleshow/83246006.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Delhi||HC seeks govts’ stand on plea for CBI probe||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Friday sought the response of the Centre and the AAP government on a plea seeking a CBI probe into the death of 21 Covid patients due to alleged oxygen shortage at Jaipur Golden Hospital. Justice Rekha Palli issued notices to Union ministries of home and health and Delhi government, seeking their reply by August 20 on the plea filed by the families of some patients who died on the intervening night of April 23 and 24. The petition, filed through advocate Utsav Bains, argued that the cause of death of the patients was respiratory failure due to insufficient supply of oxygen and not comorbidities, as stated by a Delhi government committee report. The plea claimed that the committee came out with an “erroneous” report that those who died did not suffer suffocation due to lack of oxygen supply. The petition therefore sought quashing of the report and sought direction for a CBI probe or investigation by an independent agency into the matter. It was also contended that the incident took place “due to deliberate inaction and failure of the respondents (Centre, Delhi government and the hospital) to provide adequate oxygen to the patients despite knowing that any shortage of oxygen supply would lead to their immediate death. Therefore, “the respondents herein have rendered themselves not only liable to pay compensation to the families of the deceased victims, but also for criminal prosecution” for culpable homicide, the petition stated. In April, 2021, when the patients died at Jaipur Golden Hospital allegedly because of oxygen shortage, the high court had said it would “hang” anyone who tried to obstruct the oxygen supply to the city that could prove fatal for patients in hospitals. Owing to the pandemic raging at that time, several city hospitals had faced an acute shortage of oxygen and pleaded before the court for replenishment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-govts-stand-on-plea-for-cbi-probe/articleshow/83246048.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||Time that survival of endangered plant species also gets highlighted and not just animal species||NAINITAL: Uttarakhand forest department has prepared an inventory of 1,576 flora species and conserved them through ex-situ and in-situ measures. The department said that the project is an effort to preserve and protect the plant species as survival of several of them is threatened. The researchers said it’s time that survival of endangered plant species also gets highlighted and not just animal species. According to the report prepared by the department's research wing, there are 73 species that are threatened, including 15 in the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). More than 50 of the preserved species are endemic to Uttarakhand and there are over 60 species which are yet to be identified. The list includes 415 tree species, 130 shrubs, 37 types of bamboo, 15 types of Tulsi, 87 orchid species, 96 ferns, 88 grasses, 45 aquatic, 30 moss species and 87 lichens. Around 500 of them are medicinal plants. Speaking to TOI, officials said that the compilation of this data is necessary because of changing climate trends and the threat posed to the survival of floral species. “We have been suffering from ‘plant blindness’. We have ignored and neglected the importance of plants while all the focus and funds have gone towards conservation of mega faunal species like tiger and elephants which may not be as important for our survival as plants,” said Sanjiv Chaturvedi, chief conservator of forests (research). “During our documentation, we found that barely a few dozen plants of snow orchid are left. The species is endemic to western Himalayas and was found near Kathgodam. The status of Trayaman is also similar. It is endemic to only a few locations in Uttarakhand and is found in high-sloped mountains. It is considered good for the liver and so, over-exploited. But now, we have conserved and grown several of them,” Chaturvedi further said. He added that not only smaller plants, but even tall trees like Van Palash are threatened as a result of which the forest department had to protect them at their centres. Van Palash has been categorised as a threatened species by the Uttarakhand biodiversity board as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/time-that-survival-of-endangered-plant-species-also-gets-highlighted-and-not-just-animal-species/articleshow/83241484.cms||Prashant Jha

To make matters worse, two of the eight children are cerebral palsy patients. With a salary of Rs 30,000 and the meagre income from the farmland the families own, Vikram Parmar says it will be next to impossible for him to care for eight children. “For the moment though, the family is staying together and supporting each other,” he says. Parmar says he is waiting for the death certificates of his brothers and sister-in-law, before applying for the benefits that the government has announced for children orphaned by the Covid-19 pandemic. “I have spoken to the taluka development officer (TDO) and he assured me that the government will provide assistance according to the norms announced. But the task of taking care of eight children is going to be overwhelming,” he said. His eldest brother, Bipin Parmar, 53, died on May 21 after being admitted to Bapunagar General Hospital with Covid-19. Bipin is survived by his wife Jyoti (42), daughters Dharti (22) and Hetal (21) and son Harsh (3), who is a cerebral palsy patient. Vikram’s younger brother Rajesh (46) and his wife Minakshi (37) succumbed to Covid-19 as well. While Rajesh died on May 10 at the Asarwa Civil Hospital, his wife Minakshi succumbed to the virus on May 29 at UN Mehta hospital. Their two orphaned children are Pratik (15) and Vishwa (3). Vikram and his wife Mina are now taking care of not their three children – Krishna (20), Kinjal (18) and Manan (15) — and those of Bipin and Rajesh as well. Vikram’s daughter Kinjal is also a cerebral palsy patient. The families of all three brothers live at Vahelal village on the outskirts of Ahmedabad city, about 10km from Naroda. Bipin and Rajesh were farmers, while Vikram Parmar works as a a bus conductor with the city bus service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-covid-kills-brothers-8-children-in-couples-care/articleshow/83246054.cms||---

They said the callers would often be introducing themselves as manager of certain banks to extract the valuable information from the senior citizens, who are their prime targets. “The callers normally take their targets into confidence by promising to issue a new debit card in a week after blocking the existing one. They then collect the details,” said a police officer. “Most of the senior citizens, who are receiving pensions from the state and Union governments, are using traditional mobile phones. Conmen collect their landline numbers from phone diaries and contact them, telling the government is planning to issue a single debit card for all the accounts. They then collect card details and CVV numbers from the targets, asking them to share the OTP received on their mobile phones,” the officer said. Sometimes, he said, the conmen would convince the senior citizens to share the sensitive banking details by promising them to activate all the banking related services online so that they need not visit the banks during the lockdown. “We request the senior citizens not to disclose their banking details to anyone over phone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dont-share-banking-details-over-phone-police-tell-senior-citizens/articleshow/83246068.cms||---

President of the association, S P Jeyapragasam said that the steps taken by the government to ensure that people had food and shelter during the pandemic was appreciable. But, there were also many hardships that the general public, traders, producers of essential commodities and farmers faced during this crisis. As of now, the government had identified about 100 shops to distribute groceries in Madurai. Residents have to call up the shops and place the supply and the goods are delivered at their doorsteps. But, 75% of the population still depend on daily wages and could not place orders for large quantities, hence when the lockdown is relaxed, grocery shops should be allowed to function for about four hours. Also, there was a large section of the population which purchased their goods from small shops on credit basis. As these shops are closed, many customers were finding it difficult to buy essentials. Wholesale traders are allowed to load and offload their goods from 10pm to 5am, this should be allowed throughout the state, he said. Another major issue is that farmers were not able to buy spare parts for pumps and other gadgets as shops selling these items are closed. Similar problems were faced by factories involved in processing and packaging essential commodities like rice, dhal and flour. Workers of factories, industries and farm workers should be allowed to travel in two-wheelers, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cm-urged-to-allow-grocery-hardware-stores-to-open/articleshow/83246047.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand mulls climate budget, to sanction separate funds for ‘environment-friendly activities’||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government is mulling to introduce the provision of climate budgeting from next financial year in order to counter adverse effects of global environmental changes in the Himalayan state. If the proposal — pitched by the forest and environment department — goes through, Uttarakhand will be among the first states to come up with separate funds for activities related to mitigation of adverse impact of climate change. Sources from the department told TOI that a detailed proposal related to climate budgeting has been shared with the state government which has several suggested measures to check adverse effects on the environment due to human activities. The funds, the sources added, will be utilised for getting manpower to ensure enforcement of environmental laws like polythene ban and check on pollution to name a few. “Apart from manpower, we have proposed incentives to motivate people to opt for environment-friendly activities. For instance, if anyone is using solar energy to generate power, they would be given a government subsidy. Big housing societies, government offices, residential areas etc will be motivated to ensure there is a mechanism for rainwater harvesting in their campuses and the government will also give incentives for this,” said an official involved in the process of drafting the detailed proposal. He added that “farmers who are doing organic farming will also be given subsidies and incentives to encourage more and more agriculturists to opt for ways which save the environment.” “They may look like small steps but will surely help the environment in the long run,” said the official. To recall, the Uttarakhand government in March this year had presented a Rs 57,400 crore budget for the 2021-22 fiscal in which Rs 455 crore had been earmarked for the environment. Anand Vardhan, principal secretary of the forest department, told TOI that it has been suggested that all the departments can give some amount for activities which will go towards climate impact mitigation, and a final decision on the proposal will be taken by the government. Notably, on the eve of World Environment Day on Friday, Kerala had announced a Rs 500 crore environment package to promote sustainable development and conserving ecology in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-mulls-climate-budget-to-sanction-separate-funds-for-environment-friendly-activities/articleshow/83241499.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Coimbatore||Scramble for vaccination in rural areas of Coimbatore||COIMBATORE: After initial slackness, the scramble for vaccination has grown among the rural population in the district of late. The surge in toll due to Covid-19 in the second wave has also pushed people to get vaccinated as early as possible. Most of the vaccination centres in the district were crowded and people were found standing in long queues to get tokens from 4am even though the vaccination drive starts only around 11am. But despite waiting for hours, people, at times, had to return without taking the jab due to the lack of sufficient quantities of vaccines at the centres. Since 4am on Friday, many villagers waited at the primary health centre (PHC) at Arisipalayam on the outskirts of Coimbatore to take the jabs. Around 9am, staff at the PHC insisted that they would issue tokens based on the number of vaccines they would receive. However, more than 50 villagers insisted that all those waiting should be given the tokens. They even went on protest blocking the road in front of the PHC. Eventually, the Madukkarai police pacified the protesters and ensured that the vaccination drive was carried out peacefully. Meanwhile, members of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK) staged a protest at Gandhipuram condemning the Union government for not distributing sufficient quantities of vaccines to the state and demanding the government to increase the supply. TPDK general secretary K Ramakrishnan said, “The central government is neither distributing sufficient quantities nor allowing the states to procure from foreign countries. The Centre has been levying Goods and Service Tax (GST) for the Covid vaccine. How fair is it to levy tax on life-saving medicines especially when the state government is distributing it to the public free of cost.” Pointing out that the integrated vaccine complex at Chengalpattu remains unused for years, he said that either the Union government should take steps to make it operational or allow the state government to operate it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/scramble-for-vaccination-in-rural-areas/articleshow/83246109.cms||---

According to the police, Sindhu Sree was the daughter of couple P Ramesh Kumar and P Varalakshmi. The couple had separated a month ago and Varalakshmi went to live with her paramour B Jagadeesh Reddy along with her daughter. On June 1, Sindhu Sree had fever and was hospitalised as a private hospital in Madhurawada where she passed away.

The water will irrigate 45,000 acres of agricultural land in Madurai and Dindigul districts. It may be recalled that water was released from the Mullaperiyar dam too for the first time in 14 years on June 1. Cooperatives minister I Periyasamy told reporters that it was in 2008 that water was released from Vaigai in the first week of June. He said 900 cusecs would be released for 45 days and then through the turn system for the remaining 75 days. The minister said he was confident that water would also be released for the tailend districts of Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram soon.

The minister said the state government led by M K Stalin was meeting the demands of farmers and also attending to their other needs. The longpending demand to desilt Vaigai dam would be considered as it would raise the dam’s capacity considerably and help farmers in Madurai, Dindigul, Theni, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram districts. The Mullaperiyar dam shutters were opened by Periyasamy on June 1 for irrigation of 14,707 acres of land in Theni district for the first crop of the double crop area. Water is released from the Mullaperiyar dam if the level crosses 120 feet. The last time the water level crossed the mark in June was on the first of the month in 2006, when it rose to 124.4 feet.

The official reports of the three municipal corporations reported 90 such incidents. North Delhi Municipal Corporation registered 67 tree felling complaints and the south corporation 11, while the east corporation removed trees from 12 locations. In central Delhi, several cases of uprooting of large trees were reported near Broadcasting House close to Parliament Street and National Stadium, and on Tilak Marg, Akbar Road and Copernicus Marg. Around 11pm, Delhi Traffic Police announced that tree felling had affected traffic at 54 locations. The sites included Teen Murti Marg, NSP to Shalimar Road, Narela Sabzi Mandi, Janpath, Ashoka Road, near PM’s house, Copernicus Marg, Idgah Road, Lodhi Colony DM’s office, JLN Stadium, CGO Road and Naraina-Dhaula Kuan stretch. North corporation areas had 38 tree felling cases in Rohini zone, eight in Keshavpuram zone, nine in Karol Bagh zone, six in Civil Lines, five in City Sadar-Paharganj and one complaint from Narela. The impacted areas included Flag Staff Road, Civic Centre, Mata Sundri Road and Vidhan Sabha.

But the states are not getting the injections on time which is causing a lot of trouble to the patients," he said in a tweet in Hindi."If this injection is given to the patient in time, his/her life can be saved," he added.

---||Lucknow||‘BJP busy placating warring factions as Covid hits people’||Lucknow: Describing the recent visit of BJP’s national leadership as a desperate but failed attempt to placate warring factions within the party’s state unit, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said more concerning is the fact that it is happening at the expense of people suffering from Covid-19 and black fungus infection. “At a time when the government should be looking after the medical needs of the people suffering from Covid-19 and black fungus infection, the BJP leadership is confined to air-conditioned luxuries to settle infighting between warring factions. The problem is, by the time senior leaders from Delhi manage to placate one side, the other becomes unhappy,” Akhilesh said. The former UP CM said the delegation of senior leaders, which camped in Lucknow to ‘settle’ differences that have cropped up at various levels within the party, could not find a solution as the BJP cadre and RSS, who have been neglected and ignored despite the party being in power, are unwilling to listen to any explanation. “The BJP leadership is worried by the rebellion in the cadre,” he said, adding that senior leaders from Delhi apparently got the real picture of ground realities within the party and concluded their trip with tweets to end the crisis, but in vain. The SP national president said the BJP leadership was adopting age-old tactics of trying to keep the flock together by selectively leaking reports of cabinet reshuffle and changes in the organisational hierarchy. “Such things will not work as there is hardly any time left for elections,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-busy-placating-warring-factions-as-covid-hits-people/articleshow/83247918.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 5-year fissure culminates in Eatala Rajender’s exit||HYDERABAD: Former minister Eatala Rajender’s exit from the TRS was not sudden as his relationship with chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had soured in the last few years and culminated in his ouster from the ministry and later from the party itself. The Huzurabad legislator was a close aide of KCR since Telangana movement days and was touted as a good orator in the party after KCR. Party sources said it was not clear how and when the fissures started. The chasm between the two leaders, which roughly began five years ago, widened further in the past two years. There was a speculation in 2018 that Eatala may not make it to the cabinet and his name was included at the last minute. The ex-minister was not particularly happy when Gangula Kamalakar from Karimnagar district was inducted into the cabinet by KCR, mainly to checkmate him. Both KCR and Eatala have been making statements against each other on various occasions. The TRS leadership was ill at ease with some of Eatala’s comments in public domain and TRS working president KT Rama Rao took the former minister in his car to Pragathi Bhavan a few months ago seeking the latter’s clarification on his comments made in Veenavanka in Karimnagar district. During inauguration of a Rythu Vedika at Veenavanka, Eatala said: “Not money, caste or party, only good deeds and humanism are important.” He said he was upset, hurt and disappointed, but never left the right path. He also spoke about farmers’ agitation in Delhi and against the Centre’s farm bills. At one of the party workers’ meeting in Kamalapur in his constituency in 2019, Eatala said “minister’s post is not alms of anybody”, taking an indirect dig at KCR. At another meeting, he made sensational remarks, “we are the owners of the party flag (TRS) and my minister post is not anybody’s pittance on me.” Not one to take the comments lightly, KCR said at a party MLAs and MPs’ meeting that floating a party is not any easy task like “opening a pan dabba (pan shop)”. His comments were directed towards Eatala as reports emerged that he was planning to float a new party. There were reports that the CM did not take Eatala into confidence and invite him during meetings with ministers. The party leadership believed that Eatala held meetings with some leaders and employees’ unions leaders at his Shamirpet residence and Bengaluru against the party and tried to float a political party. Admitting that he had no good relationship with KCR, Eatala said the ties between them started straining in the past five years. He, however, said he had never crossed the party’s ‘Lakshman rekha’. “I said for achieving a ‘bangaru Telangana’, there was a need to continue IKP centres to procure paddy as rice mills are not capable of doing it. There was nothing wrong in it,” he said. He aid situation is such that opposition party MLAs cannot meet the ruling party elected representatives for getting works done. “During the Congress government in united AP, we (TRS MLAs) used to go to ministers and get the work done for our constituencies. Do we have such a situation in the TRS government,” he wondered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/5-year-fissure-culminates-in-eatalas-exit/articleshow/83246134.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Shopkeepers irked by barricaded Sitabuldi main road that turns away customers||NAGPUR: After hawkers on Thursday, Sitabuldi shopkeepers objected to steps taken by Sitabuldi police station on Friday. The hawkers protested against city police and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) for not allowing them to put up stalls, while shopkeepers have objected to blocking the Sitabuldi main road, which prevents customers from coming to their shops. “The idea of unlock is to open and allow people to visit the market during the allowed period of 7am to 2pm. Since unlock began, the road has been barricaded, stopping flow of traffic on the main road,” said Parag Thakkar, a shopkeeper on Sitabuldi main road. As our customers visit either on two or four-wheelers, they are confused when they reach Variety Square and turn back, pointed out Thakkar. All the markets in Nagpur are freely doing business between 7am and 2pm barring Sitabuldi, said shopkeepers. Hussain Noorallah Ajani, another shopkeeper and secretary of Sitabuldi Merchants Association, said due to barricading of the main road, traders here are not getting any customers as motorists cannot enter Sitabuldi main road. “Nagpur has been the worst-hit due to the longest lockdown in the country. Shops are open now, but there is no business due to the illogical decisions by authorities,” he pointed out. It’s the first week of the month and time for salaries, rents, EMIs, electricity and telephone bills. “How are traders supposed to pay all this if they have to suffer illogical decisions?” shopkeepers asked. The association members also met mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, urging him to issue directives to city police to remove the barricades. Senior PI from Sitabuldi police station Atul Sabnis justified the move to barricade the main road. He said it has been blocked to prevent congestion of vehicles at the busy Variety Square. He further pointed out there are several internal lanes to visit shops in Sitabuldi. Customers who intend to shop are using these roads, he said. “Our intention is clear that we won’t allow crowding on this road, and barricading the road from either side will help contain the spread of coronavirus,” he explained. The decisions since start of the lockdown, partial lockdown, lockdown type restrictions have been stupid and laughable, shopkeepers said. “We expect serious governance and not decisions like in gully cricket, where rules are bent and changed at everyone’s whims and fancy,” said Thakkar. Meanwhile, hawkers returned to Sitabuldi main road on Friday and were found hawking their wares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/buldi-shopkeepers-irked-by-barricaded-main-road-that-turns-away-shoppers/articleshow/83246154.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

According to forest department officials, a lone elephant roaming near the estate trampled him to death around 4am.

Emphasizing the importance of recruiting a younger person for night duty and providing torchlight, umbrella and jacket, the union leader said that estate workers would often work as watchman at night after working in the estate. “The estate management would give them just Rs 2,000 as monthly salary against the minimum wage of Rs 300 – Rs 315 per day,” he said. Paramasivam requested the forest department to take steps to prevent such incidents in future. “The estate management should also take responsibility for the incident and provide a relief fund to the victim’s family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/elephant-tramples-watchman-to-death/articleshow/83246171.cms||---

But as we race for materiality, we have started inviting natural and biological disasters.Consumerist thinking of development has been at the core of Covid. Whenever efforts have been made to boost development by neglecting nature, humans had to bear the brunt of it.We need to rethink our eternal Indian vision of conservation of nature in the light of environment friendly policies along with development. Environment means surrounding conditions in which a human being lives. This circle becomes unbalanced when we have to face Covid and cyclones such as Tauktae and Yaas.Indian eternal vision has been nature worshiping.

What is the reason? Trees and plants are a big source of oxygen, but those are being cut and attempts being made to bring beauty to houses through construction. Fewer trees would deepen the crisis of life. It is a fact that trees prevent soil erosion, recharge underground water reservoirs and also create favorable conditions for sustainable agricultural production.That is why in our culture, there is a tradition of worshiping trees. In Skanda, Padma Purana and other ancient books, Brahma is said to be seated at the origin of the Peepal tree, Vishnu in the middle and lord Shiva in the front. Lord Buddha attained enlightenment under the sacred Peepal tree. Khejri is the state tree of Rajasthan. It is said to be a ‘Kalp Vriksha’, which is always helpful for people in the desert. Our earlier generations have been more intelligent than us who sacrificed their lives to prevent khejri from being cut. The sacrifices made for trees in Khejarli under the leadership of Amrita Devi is one of the greatest proofs of nature-related thinking in our culture.KM Munshi was the first to start the Van Mahotsav here. He was the food and agriculture minister after the country got Independence. Realising the importance of trees, he first started the Van Mahotsav by planting saplings in Nainital in 1950.In 1951, he came to Rajasthan and inaugurated a nursery in Jodhpur to prevent desertification. The tradition of Van Mahotsav is still going on even today, but it is not enough. Come, let us not celebrate the environment just for a day, instead let us resolve to work with our eternal Indian vision of nature conservation all 365 days a year.(The writer is governor of Rajasthan.)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/planting-more-trees-key-to-avert-future-pandemics-calamities/articleshow/83247964.cms||---
---||Lucknow||BJP knows UP failed in Covid handling: AAP||Lucknow: Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh has alleged that even BJP has acknowledged the state government’s failure in handling the Covid pandemic, which is why senior leaders were recently sent to Lucknow who held closed door meetings with party functionaries and ministers to get a feedback about the government. “Earlier when I made charges against chief minister Yogi Adityanath, he had cases filed against me. Now BL Santosh, in charge of BJP’s national organisation, and other office bearers, sent by the BJP leadership to Lucknow, reviewed the working of the state government and have accepted that it has failed,” Singh said. He alleged that holding closed door meetings with ministers, MLAs and office bearers was an indication that the party was not happy with the CM’s work. Singh said that at a time when the government should be focussing on pulling the state out of the Covid crisis, it seemed more worried about the upcoming assembly election. Saying that by conducting panchayat elections in the middle of the pandemic the government was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of officials on duty, Singh added: “After the Covid pandemic, UP has created a huge unemployment problem, businessmen have been ruined and all kinds of businesses have been affected. There have been deaths in every village.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-knows-up-failed-in-covid-handling-aap/articleshow/83247958.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Karimnagar back in focus as TRS, BJP eye Huzurabad||HYDERABAD: Karimnagar district, home to Telangana sentiment and statehood movement, is back in sharp focus with recent political developments involving ousted health minister Eatala Rajender vis-a-vis TRS as byelection for Huzurabad assembly constituency in the district looks imminent with Eatala resigning as an MLA on Friday. While Eatala is set to come out with all guns blazing and win the bypoll at all costs, the TRS will go at full throttle to defeat the former minister who has been winning the seat since 2009. Karimnagar gave a rude jolt to the TRS in 2019 general elections when BJP’s Bandi Sanjay Kumar, who is now state party president, won the Lok Sabha seat against then sitting MP B Vinod Kumar. Analysts said the district had several leaders who were vocal during the statehood movement and Huzurabad bypoll will be seen as a battle between the ideologues. “The BJP deployed another Telangana ideologue Swamy Goud, former legislative council chairman, to woo Eatala into the saffron party sums up everything as to which way the wind is blowing,” an analyst said. The Karimnagar parliamentary seat was once represented by K Chandrasekhar Rao. The forthcoming bypoll assumes significance for the BJP as well since its chief Sanjay represents the Lok Sabha seat now. Ever since Eatala was dropped from the KCR cabinet, Huzurabad became a focal point for both the TRS and the BJP. Though Eatala was supposed to join the BJP much earlier, there was some hesitancy in both camps over the byelection result.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/karimnagar-back-in-focus-as-trs-bjp-eye-huzurabad/articleshow/83246180.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Markapur DSP Kishore Kumar said the two instances of kidnapping came to light on May 18 when the second victim lodged a complaint against main accused Mudragadda Janardhan. Janardhan, who is a real estate broker, kidnapped J Narsireddy on May 11 and extorted Rs 5 lakh at knife point from him. They came to know each other while holding discussions to sell some properties in the vicinity. Narsireddy, however, did not approach the police fearing for his life. On May 18 at around 2 in the afternoon, Janardhan contacted Rangaiah to discuss the sale of a plot. He then kidnapped him and took him to an isolated place at Nalaguntla village and extorted Rs 16 lakh from him. Based on Rangaiah’s complaint, police managed to trace all the 13 accused. Rs 18 lakh in cash, two cars, four bikes, two knives and eight cell phones were also seized from them.

---||Ahmedabad||Class 10 results: Why did Gujarat ignore CBSE model?||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat education department has not followed the CBSE model for tabulating marks for Class 10, based on the internal assessment by schools. According to the state government guidelines, schools are to evaluate students based on Class 10 and Class 9 results. In the case of the CBSE, only Class 10 internal exams’ marks are to be considered for evaluation. “One of the reasons for this decision is that many Class 10 students in rural areas would have missed online education,” said a source in the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB). “As a result, they would not have been able to take the unit tests or internal exams during the past year.” State education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama recently said in a statement that the state government will follow the central government’s guidelines. He said this while declaring the government’s decision to cancel Class 12 state board exams. The CBSE’s tabulation policy was released last month. Under it, the internal assessment of 20 marks will be done in line with the existing policy of the board. The assessment of the remaining 80 marks for each subject will be done by the schools, the CBSE said. Each school will have to form a results committee consisting of the principal and seven teachers for finalizing the results. “According to the information collected from the schools through the regional offices of the CBSE, schools have conducted different types and number of tests/exams,” the CBSE said. It added that periodic or unit tests, half-yearly or mid-term exams, and pre-board exams will be used for school-based assessment. If schools have conducted more than one test, the results committee may fix the weightage to be given to each exam, it said. The committee will also take the final decision if exams for any or all the categories were not conducted. According to the GSHSEB’s tabulation policy, the Class 10 results will be prepared out of 100 marks for each subject.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/class-10-results-why-did-state-ignore-cbse-model/articleshow/83246176.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Patna||Bihar: BJP suspends MLC Tunna Ji Pandey for criticising CM Nitish Kumar||PATNA: State BJP president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal on Friday suspended MLC Tunna Ji Pandey from the party for his repeated statements against CM Nitish Kumar. Pandey had described Nitish as a “circumstantial CM” and threatened to “expose” the latter’s involvement in the 2009 liquor scam even if he had to go to jail. The BJP’s action against Pandey came 48 hours after JD(U) parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha had reminded Jaiswal of the statements made by the BJP MLC. Kushwaha, through his tweet, had warned the state BJP of taking action against Pandey. “BJP disciplinary committee chairman Vinay Singh had served show-cause notice on you for issuing statements against the CM. In spite of this, you continued issuing the statements violating the party lines. Therefore, you are suspended from the party with immediate effect,” the suspension letter issued by Jaiswal read. BJP spokesman and former MLA Prem Ranjan Patel said Pandey’s statements criticising CM Nitish Kumar amounted to violation of party rules. “What shocked the BJP leadership was that Pandey held a press conference on Thursday at a venue whose backdrop showed the lantern symbol of the RJD. This happened after the show-cause notice had been served on him by the state BJP disciplinary committee,” Patel said. Patel added Pandey had been showing his growing proximity to the RJD for the last couple of years by praising Lalu Prasad, Rabri Devi and Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. “He had also praised former RJD MP from Siwan late Mohammad Shahabuddin,” Patel said Reacting to the suspension of Pandey, ostensibly under pressure from the JD(U), RJD spokesman Chitranjan Gagan said, “The BJP claims to be the largest party within the NDA, but it has chosen to surrender before the JD(U).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-suspends-mlc-for-criticising-nitish/articleshow/83244036.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Forest minister Sukhram Vishnoi skips CM Ashok Gehlot events||JAISALMER: Forest and environment minister Sukhram Vishnoi appears to be annoyed with chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Congressmen in Barmer and Jaisalmer, the two districts of which the minister is incharge, have been discussing it for some time. Vishnoi set the tongues wagging again during his visit to the twin districts on Friday. Chief minister Gehlot virtually inaugurated a new oxygen plant in Jaisalmer’s Jawahar hospital set up by the power grid corporation from its CSR fund and a 100-bed covid hospital in Barmer set up by the Cairn India. Minister Vishnoi did not attend the inauguration programmes despite being in the districts. Sources said, district administration officials in neither of the two districts were aware of the minister’s movement details in their areas. The minister, though, participated in the Congress campaign to demand free vaccines for all from the Centre and submitted a memorandum to the Barmer district collector. During his visit to the two districts, he was without the government security men and was not travelling in his official car. Instead of using the car allotted for ministers, Vishnoi came to Jaisalmer and Barmer in a government vehicle from the Jalore district pool. When reporters at Jaisalmer and Barmer asked if he was annoyed with the CM, Vishnoi denied but left Barmer around 12pm without waiting for the virtual inauguration of the Covid hospital. On being asked about using the Jalore district pool vehicle, the minister said his official car was sent for servicing. He said his security personnel had gone to their villages. Despite his refusal about annoyance with Gehlot, his behaviour in Jaisalmer and Barmer on Friday clearly showed all was not well between him and the government. At the press conference too, the minister was unable to properly reply to questions related to his department. Vishnoi avoided many questions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/minister-vishnoi-skips-cm-programmes-travels-sans-security/articleshow/83246220.cms||Vimal Bhatia

---||Lucknow||Dudhwa gets 2 newborn one-horned Rhino calves||Lucknow: The birth of two rhino calves at Dudhwa National Park has sparked the hope of a new bloodline of one-horned rhinos in Uttar Pradesh after more than three decades. Napolean, a free-ranging rhino, is the father of the two calves born to Kalpana and Rohini. While Kalpana and Rohini are part of Dudhwa’s existing herd of rhinos, Napolean is said to have strayed from Nepal and stayed back in Dudhwa. It was translocated to the second Rhino Rehabilitation Area (RRA) in Bilrayen range of the park in April 2018 along with three females — Kalpana, Rohini and Subhadra. Napolean is a new blood because, unlike other rhinos, he was born outside Dudhwa. Most among the current population of rhinos in Dudhwa are the offsprings of a single dominant rhino, Banke. The newborn calves are currently staying with their mothers and the park administration is ensuring their security as tigers can attack young rhinos. “There are chances of predation. Though the rhinos are under a fenced area, the fence mostly works as a deterrent for rhinos but not for other big animals like tigers or elephants,” said Dudhwa Park director Sanjay Pathak. Calves are counted in the population only after they grow more than a year old. The one-horned rhino, the only rhino species found in India and also known as Indian rhino, is critically endangered and protected under Schedule (I) of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act. Dudhwa National Park was chosen by the Union government for Rhino Rehabilitation Programme (RRP) in 1984. Started with half a dozen rhinos, the number has now increased to 42 in the state. Only Napolean is an outsider in the lot. The rhinos were re-introduced in Dudhwa within a 27 sq km fenced area in Sonaripur range. Banke, who was brought in 1984, was the most dominant male in the herd. The rhino patriarch, who died in 2016 at the age of 49, was the father to most of the current population of rhinos in Dudhwa. Nakul, Sahdev and Bhimsen were other males who fought for dominance after Banke became reclusive. Raghu is the most dominant male in the pack in the first RRA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dudhwa-gets-2-newborn-one-horned-rhino-calves/articleshow/83247992.cms||Neha Shukla

The decommissioning ceremony at the naval dockyard will be a low-key event and would be attended only by in-station officers and sailors with strict observance of Covid-19 protocols, a Navy release said. Sandhayak was conceptualised by Padma Shri Rear Adm F L Fraser, the then chief hydrographer to the government of India. The construction began in Kolkata (then Calcutta) by laying the keel in 1978. The ship was commissioned to the Indian Navy on February 26, 1981.  Since then, the ship has undertaken approximately 200 major hydrographic surveys and numerous minor surveys in the Eastern and Western coasts of the country, the Andaman seas and neighbouring countries too. In its glorious 40 years, the ship saw 22 commanding officers at the helm, with the last CO taking charge of the ship on June 17, 2019. At sunset on Friday, the naval ensign and commissioning pennant will be hauled down for the last time onboard INS Sandhayak, in the presence of Vice Adm Ajendra Bahadur Singh, flag officer commanding-in-chief of Eastern Naval Command, symbolising the decommissioning. Meanwhile, as part of Operation Samudra Setu II, INS Airavat reached the port city on Thursday with Covid relief stores including cryogenic oxygen tanks, oxygen cylinders and ventilators from Vietnam and Singapore. Op SS-II was launched by Indian Navy for shipment of Covid relief material from various countries to boost the nation’s fight against the dreaded virus. INS Airavat embarked 158 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen in seven cryogenic oxygen tanks, 2,722 oxygen cylinders and other relief material, including 10 ventilators, which were facilitated by the Indian missions in Vietnam and Singapore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ins-sandhayak-to-be-decommissioned-today/articleshow/83214091.cms||---

Dotasra, nevertheless, played down the incident saying Dhariwal followed protocol in leaving the charge to the PCC chief and the CM present in the state capital.After the All India Congress Committee’s (AICC) online campaign for "universal free vaccination" on Wednesday, the Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee (RPCC) submitted memorandums addressed to the President through Governor Kalraj Mishra and all district collectors demanding the same on Friday.Except Dhariwal, all ministers in-charge travelled to the districts assigned to them and submitted the memos to the collectors. Dhariwal was said to be in Kota. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot addressed other government events virtually, but the party said he was unwell to accompany Dotasra to the governor house for giving the memorandum.In the state capital, RPCC chief and school education minister Govind Singh Dotasra gave the memo to the governor, while four MLAs—two from Jaipur city and two from Jaipur rural—gave it to the district collector. Minister in-charge for Jaipur, Shanti Dhariwal skipped the event but Dotasra said it was in keeping with the protocol."Since the chief minister and the PCC chief were in Jaipur to give the memo and address the press, he (Dhariwal) just followed the protocol to let us take the charge," Dotasra replied, while addressing a press conference at the PCC headquarters.Dotasra claimed Dhariwal’s absence had nothing to do with the verbal spat between the two over whether the memos should be submitted to the district collectors or the governor. Both ministers had heated arguments over the issue during a cabinet meeting virtually attended by Gehlot on Wednesday.On being asked about the squabble, Dotasra said, "No one’s authority was challenged. In our party, we all respect each other. Infighting happens only in BJP where a single term MLA is projected as CM and a two-term CM is sidelined, while the deputy leader of opposition, who has no existence outside the assembly, keeps issuing statements."Targeting the Centre government on covid-19 vaccination, Dotasra asked, "Why is the Modi-govt not fulling its election promise of free vaccination for all? Why 90% of the country’s vaccine was exported?" The PCC chief dismissed reports of vaccine wastage by the state. "Vaccine wastage in the country is 6%, while in Rajasthan it is just 2%."GFXPoints in Cong memo addressed to PrezOther countries placed vaccine orders by May 2020, why Modi-govt waited till Jan 2021Why different price slabs of vaccines for Centre, states and pvt hospitalsWhy just 39-cr vaccines ordered for a population of 140-crWhy just 3.17% of the country’s population vaccinated so farCentre deliberately created ‘digital division’ to slow down the pace of vaccinationAt the present pace of 16-lakh doses/day, all adults will be vaccinated in more than 3yearsModi-govt be directed to vaccinate 1-cr people/day for freeModi-govt’s vaccine policy a ‘dangerous cocktail’ of big mistakes||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dotasra-dhariwal-rift-continues-over-vax-memo/articleshow/83246206.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||‘Committee had little role in policy’||Ahmedabad: The committee set up to look into issues arising from the mass promotion of Class X students, had reportedly a very small role in the decision-making process for the Class X marking policy which was released recently. According to Jatin Bharad, vice president of Gujarat Self-Financed School Management Association, the committee met only once since its formation. “The committee hasn’t played much role in framing the guidelines for Class X. It was all done by members of the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (GSHSEB) without proper consultations with the committee,” said Bharad, a member of the committee. The committee includes DEOs, retired DEOs, officials of Gujarat Secondary and Higher Education Board and representatives of the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), among others. The committee was to identify various issues and submit its findings along with recommendations to the state government in a few days, said sources. The state government had last month announced mass promotions for Class X students of GSHSEB. The state education board’s policy for Class X regular students is to tabulate marks by giving 40% weight to academic performance in last year’s Class IX exams, and 40% to the Class X exams this year. The remaining 20% will be according to the internal evaluation of the Class X performance by schools. No student will be failed. According to the guidelines, if a student fails to achieve passing marks, s/he will still be promoted to the next class. The performance of students in the first and second unit tests for Class IX last year will have 20% weight each. Schools held internal exams in offline and online formats from March 19 to March 27. The marks scored by students in these exams will have 30% weight. Ten per cent weight will be given to unit tests conducted by schools for Class X students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/committee-had-little-role-in-policy/articleshow/83246241.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad’s first footpath was laid in 1925||AHMEDABAD: When did Ahmedabad get its first footpath? Even as 75% of our footpaths today are either encroached or unwalkable, according to a UNDP study, the seed of road safety — the concept of making roads safer for road minorities was sown on December 16, 1925. The general board of the Ahmedabad municipality, that’s when Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was it’s president, proposed a traffic plan. More importantly, a plan for a footpath to safeguard road minorities in Ahmedabad was also tabled. The then managing committee or today’s standing committee had proposed to lay the footpath between Pankor Naka and Teen Darwaza for a cost of Rs 10,135. This was mainly to safeguard pedestrians from heavily laden vehicles like horse or bullock carts and a few motor cars that occasionally stuttered past Relief Road towards Kalupur station. “This was the time when Sardar Patel was trying to introduce the electric tram and more modern system of town planning schemes, after an electricity station was set up in Ahmedabad in 1915,” says city-based historian Rizwan Kadri. An interesting aspect of the city’s traffic plan history has been that in 1915 Amdavadis paid a congestion tax apart from the octroi fee that was levied on goods. The tax was introduced by the collector, Mr Merhams, to control traffic towards Oliphant Road, now called Astodia Road, and Ritchie road, which is now called Relief Road. To complement this new tax, Merhams first devised a parking policy for the city. People who brought bicycles, cars, bullocks via Ellisbridge were asked where they were heading and then charged a congestion tax. This tax was paid at the booth exactly where the police chowki stands today — at the entrance of Ellisbridge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abads-first-footpath-was-laid-in-1925/articleshow/83246286.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Reimagine water mgmt to cut environmental degradation||For the second year in a row, ‘World Environment Day’ will be shorn of the usual razzmatazz due to Covid-induced lockdown. But the concerns, thoughts for innovative strategies, and policy tweaks for a better planet cannot be banished. In the age of the Anthropocene, the inextricably connected environmental degradation and climate change are threatening the survival of the earth and humanity. At the root of protecting and preserving the planet lies our endeavors towards the goal of ‘sustainable development’, and nurturing a vital nexus of water-food-energy-climate nexus. An integral part of the urban development process, water has sadly become the weakest link in the chain putting the whole nexus under threat.According to a UN report in 2014, the share of urban population in the world will rise to 66% by 2050, reaching 9.3 billion, while countries like China, India, and Nigeria will witness the highest growth, collectively accounting for 37% of this global surge. With growing urbanization, affordable access to quality water will become the most critical issue for humanity.In many Indian cities, the urban water crisis is hurtling from bad to worse because of the fragmented approach of management. Sprawling urban areas with burgeoning population, insatiable groundwater extraction, shortage of sewerage systems, inefficient solid waste management, unplanned urban-land development, poor stormwater management, stretched and ageing infrastructure, impact of climate change and inadequate investment stand out as potential hurdles. Most water utilities in India are trapped in traditional linear approach that focuses more on supply, distribution, usage, onward treatment, and subsequent discharge of water into the ecosystem, while the merits of circular management still remain unheeded.In this context, the role of Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM) cannot be over-emphasized. While the IUWM model excels in supply-side management, wastewater treatment, sanitation services, solid waste disposal and environmental protection, its ascent on aquifer recharging, watershed management, storm-water conservation, urban landscaping, urban flood plain zoning, and constructed watersheds gives sustainability a chance to survive. This is where the prime minister’s ‘catch the rain’ slogan can turn into a reality.Urban land zoning is another key to strengthen sustainable planning. Capturing rain and stormwater, keeping drainage basins uninterrupted to mitigate flood situations, and reducing pollution load to the water reservoirs are central to it. There is a strong possibility of many Indian cities are either slipping into a ‘Day Zero’ situation similar to Cape Town as they face urban floods like Mumbai, Gurugram, Chennai and Hyderabad or encounter Bengaluru’s toxic lake froth situations in future. We can avoid the dreadful consequences, but the clarion call has to come now.(The writer is principal secretary to govt. of Rajasthan.

---||Kolkata||Now showing on big screen: Shots of hope at Kolkata cinemas||KOLKATA: An iconic cinema hall in central Kolkata that had downed its shutter three years ago has reopened its doors as a Covid combat centre. Elite is the new venue for city’s hawkers to get the jab before they resume their business after the restrictions are lifted. Hawkers from different central and north Kolkata streets are taking the advantage of a KMC-run vaccination drive at the auditorium. Apart from Elite, two other heritage halls — Roxy Cinema and Star Theatre — have also been converted into vaccination centres to accelerate the inoculation drive. While the Elite vaccination camp has been exclusively planned for hawkers, both Roxy and Star Theatre are arranging vaccination for 45-plus population who are registering for the service through a KMC WhatsApp chatbot. Apart from catering to the vaccination needs of the 45-plus population, the Star Theatre centre is also supposed to vaccinate those from the priority group. Star TheatreOn Friday, around 200 hawkers were given the jab at the Elite vaccination camp. Hawkers had gathered from Burrabazar, Bowbazar and New Market areas. They had queued up from early in the morning to get an on-the-spot booking slot. Shiba Khatick (43), one the hawkers who was inoculated, had come to the centre from Burrabazar. Khatick looked happy after taking the jab. “Initially, I was suffering from indecision whether to get the jab. But watching the rapid spread of the infection and fatality associated with it, I made up my mind and decided to get inoculated at the Elite camp,” Khatick said. Mohhamed Akram (35), a ready-made garment seller at Bertram Street, who had queued up at the Elite vaccination camp, said he was reluctant to enrol even a month ago. However, he changed his mind when he watched a few of his relations and friends succumb to the deadly virus. “I helplessly watched them dying. Many of them were young and chose not to go for the vaccination. I was really shocked and frightened. Their deaths taught me a lesson and I changed my mind. I shall now make other hawkers in Chowringhee to take the opportunity at the earliest,” Akram said on Friday. At Roxy, 200 citizens (45-59 age group) received the first dose of Covishield. Aparna Niyogi, a resident of Bhowanipore who had booked her slot through the KMC chatbot service, was satisfied with the arrangement as there was ample space for the recipients to maintain Covid protocol. A KMC health department senior official conceded that the reason for selecting the cinema halls and auditoriums was the space available that allows them to maintain a safe distance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/now-showing-on-big-screen-shots-of-hope-at-kol-cinemas/articleshow/83244078.cms||Saikat Ray

When the first study was conducted in 2018, UP scored 42 which went up to 55 in 2019-20. In 2020-21, it improved its aggregate to 60 against the national average of 66. Based on the score, UP has been ranked as a ‘performer’ state, ahead of Bihar, Jharkhand and Assam. The state’s best performance comes in the seventh sustainable goal of affordable and clean energy. UP, along with 14 other states, has scored a perfect 100 for this goal. Niti Aayog looked at the coverage under household electrification, for which UP scored 100% and the percentage of LPG and PNG connections against the number of households for which the state recorded 106.83%. In 2019-20 index, UP scored 63 under this SDG. The state has also registered improvement in five other SDGs where its ranking has changed. This includes SDG 3, ‘Good Health and Well Being’, in which the state’s score of 60 against last year’s 34 took it from ‘aspirant’ category to ‘performer’. Similarly, from 48 in SDG 4 of ‘Quality Education’ last year, it went up to 51 moving the state to ‘performer’ category. UP also jumped to ‘performer’ category in SGD 5, ‘Gender Equality’, where it recorded a score of 50. In SDG 11 of ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’ and SDG 12, ‘Responsible Consumption and Production’, the state jumped from ‘performer’ category to ‘frontrunner’ with scores of 77 and 79, respectively. However, the state saw its score drop in SDG 1 of ‘Reduced Inequality’ in which it came last. The score also dipped in SDG 1 ‘No Poverty’, SDG 2 ‘Zero Hunger’, SDG 9 ‘Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure’ and SDG 13 ‘Climate Action’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-improves-in-niti-aayogs-sustainable-devpt-goal-index/articleshow/83248032.cms||---

Palam recorded hailstorms as well. At least three flights bound for Delhi had to be diverted to Jaipur due to the bad weather, airport officials said. Met officials said the sudden change in weather came about as a result of a combination of two factors, an active western disturbance across Jammu and Kashmir and a cyclonic circulation in southwest Uttar Pradesh “The temperature during the day was high and there was enough moisture in the air too. The combination of this cyclonic circulation and the western disturbance led to a short, but intense spell,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD. The Met official added that such activity is likely in the next three to four days as well. “With high temperature and adequate moisture, there is a possibility of such spells during this time of the year,” said Srivastava. “There may be very light ran on Saturday and again from Monday onwards as well.” IMD data showed Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, received 3.2mm of rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm. Palam, Lodhi Road and Najafgarh recorded 9.4, 1.6 and 7.5mm of rainfall, respectively during the same period. Delhi recorded a maximum of 39.5 degrees C during the day. The relative humidity meanwhile oscillated between 39% and 84% in the last 24 hours. An airport official said three flights were diverted to Jaipur on Friday evening on account of bad weather, but no cancellations were reported. However, flight delays were seen at the Delhi airport in the evening. The Met department forecasts the possibility of very light rain and thundershowers on Saturday, with the maximum and minimum expected to be around 39 and 24 degrees Celsius, respectively. Meanwhile, SAFAR, a central forecasting body, said that the air quality will stay in the ‘moderate’ category for the next two days. “Surface winds are strong and east-northeasterly and local dust uplifting is likely. AQI is forecast to stay in the ‘moderate’ category with PM10 as the lead pollutant for Friday and Saturday,” said SAFAR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-hail-cool-down-city-as-it-finds-itself-in-eye-of-a-storm/articleshow/83246264.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

There are no human settlements in them. Why was the entire mangrove belt of Navi Mumbai excluded from being notified as a sanctuary, but has been included inside ESZ,” said Stalin. He said water bodies at Kanjurmarg dumping ground have been reclaimed and garbage dumped there. “ESZ boundaries run along Eastern Express Highway and have not included the large perennial salt lakes on the landward side of the highway at Bhandup-Nahur. The ‘unconstructed’ marshy land is owned by the government and there was no reason why the CRZ area salt water bodies have been excluded,” said Stalin. He said, “Recreational spaces in ESZ, marked in the development plan, means that if the land is reserved for residential or commercial purposes, it can proceed unhindered. This clause does not inspires confidence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-why-are-reserve-forests-left-out-of-flamingo-sanctuary/articleshow/83249001.cms||Vijay Singh

Those who cannot take care of their own family are now talking about taking over the state,” Singh said, in an apparent reference to the rift in the Yadav family between patriarch Mulayan Singh Yadav and his younger brother Shivpal Yadav. He said that when Yadav was in government, his party had masterminded the PF scam in UPPCL. “The successful management of Covid-19 by the Yogi Adityanath-led government is being discussed all over the world. The state has set a record by doing more than five crore Covid tests, the highest in the country. UP has also administered more than 1.94 crore vaccine doses so far. The BJP government gave 30 medical colleges to the state, equipped it with five expressways and made a record payment of Rs 1.38 lakh crore to sugarcane farmers,” added Singh, questioning Yadav on what his government had achieved when it was in power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-akhilesh-following-politics-of-parivarvad/articleshow/83248052.cms||---

---||Delhi||Cameras up at Chhatarpur after leopard ‘sightings’||New Delhi: After receiving complaints from locals about the presence of suspected leopard sighting at a farm in Chhatarpur, the forest and wildlife department on Friday installed two camera traps in the area and deployed a team. Though no pugmarks have been found, forest officials said they were scanning the area. According to an official, the department first received a complaint on Wednesday about an alleged sighting near Sultanpur Metro depot. “A team inspected the site, but found no pugmarks. After we received a fresh complaint on Friday, we installed two camera traps at a Chhatarpur farm.Our team is on the spot, but leopard or its pugmarks are yet to be spotted.” The forest department also took assistance from NGO Wildlife SOS, which has been involved with animal rescues in the region. A team was called to scout the area and look for signs of the big cat. “We were called in on Friday evening. The area will be scanned for possible signs of the leopard,” said an NGO official. The NGO also installed a trap cage in the area on Friday. The complainants provided a video claiming that a leopard strayed there, but the forest department said the animal could not be identified in the video, which was shot from a distance. Rajesh Kataria, general manager, DLF Chattarpur Farms, said, “A few residents spotted the leopard and also managed to shoot a video. I lodged the complaint with the forest department and shared the clip. A team of experts arrived and are combing the area.” Delhi is no stranger to leopard sightings. In the last week of January, the forest department had confirmed the presence of a leopard in Najafgarh after its pugmarks were spotted at a village and near the drain. Even a cage was placed. However, the officials said the leopard returned to the place from where it came. In December 2016, a leopard was spotted at Yamuna Biodiversity Park in north Delhi. The animal was captured by the wildlife department and released in another state. A leopard family is also said to be living currently in the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cameras-up-at-chhatarpur-after-leopard-sightings/articleshow/83246376.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Vaccine on wheels, drive-in vaccination runaway hits among recipients in Kolkata||KOLKATA: More than 200 Kolkatans drove into the car park of a south Kolkata mall and got vaccinated on Friday, seated inside their vehicles. ‘Drive-in vaccination’, the unique initiative flagged off at Quest Mall on Friday, is being supported by KMC, which is providing the vaccines and the vaccinators. Thirty-year-old Avik Mondal drove his parents — 67-year-old Amal Kumar and 62-year-old Lipika — for the jab at Quest on Friday. “I had been wary of taking them to a crowded hospital or a government clinic. A friend told me about it and I immediately got my parents registered. It was very smooth and professionally arranged,” said Avik, adding he wished he could get the jab, too. But the Quest programme is only for the 45-plus age-group. Schoolteacher Joy Banerjee and his wife Anindita Mukherjee drove to Quest at around 11 am and within the next half-an-hour, they had reached the vaccination corner on the ground floor. “I was, in fact, the first recipient followed by my husband. It was quick and safe,” said Anindita. As many as 210 received the jab at Quest on Friday. Meanwhile, on the second day under the ‘vaccination on wheels’ drive, an AC bus reached Lake Mall to vaccinate the priority group members who have not been able to go to KMC vaccination clinics. There was marked enthusiasm among hawkers, vegetable sellers, fish vendors and grocers who made a beeline for taking the jab. Kajal Das, a vegetable seller at Lake Market, said he was feeling confident after taking the jab. “I didn’t go to a KMC vaccination clinic to avoid a crowd. Now that the KMC mobile clinic has reached our place, I decided not to miss this golden opportunity,” Das said. According to a KMC health department official, around 350 were administered the first dose of Covishield on Friday. “Watching a jostle to reach our mobile clinic, we decided to extend vaccination hours and by 3pm, we could attend 350 recipients,” the civic official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccine-on-wheels-drive-in-vax-runaway-hits-among-recipients/articleshow/83244169.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Many turned to social media to boost their knowledge and find a community of other home gardeners. “We tried to take it a step further when we realized that there were so many like-minded people,” said Shailya Shah, an Ambawadi resident. “We created groups on social media where we encouraged exchange of plants, seeds, and saplings. We provided each other with tips on taking care of plants. We learnt from others’ mistakes and connected with like-minded people.” The group has so far exchanged hundreds of plants during the pandemic, said volunteers. Dr Sushma Shah, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at NHL Municipal Medical College who is part of the group, said that sharing plants spreads positivity among members. “In a way, it encourages friends to grow plants.

He directed officials to make the 340km Poorvanchal Expressway linking Lucknow with Ghazipur operational in next two months, pitched for opening the 296km Bundelkhand expressway by October-November and set a timeframe for the Gorakhpur link expressway. Taking stock of construction of expressways, the chief minister sought expediting construction of Poorvanchal Expressway to make it operational as soon as possible.

Officials said, opening of expressways would help ramp up industrial development in its hinterland. The CM said, public utilities and other facilities along with security arrangements like patrolling and ambulance services should be in place along the expressways immediately.

In a World Environment Day caution, activists said indiscriminate destruction of wetlands and mangroves in Uran under the guise of development had begun to create a tussle among hundreds of thousands of migratory birds, forcing them to land on the upcoming NMIA area.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: ‘Congress, BSP move to prop up Muslim faces can hurt Samajwadi Party’||LUCKNOW: Two key political parties in Uttar Pradesh catapulting twin Muslim faces to centrestage within 24 hours — Congress’ Imran Masood elevated as AICC secretary and BSP’s Shah Alam promoted as legislative party leader in UP assembly — has again trained the spotlight on consolidation of the minority vote in run-up to assembly polls. Experts, however, view this as a potential trigger to divide Muslim votes between Samajwadi Party, BSP and Congress, much to the benefit of BJP which faces an aggressive opposition, primarily in Samajwadi Party. Both Masood and Shah Alam were delegated bigger responsibilities by Congress and BSP respectively on Thursday. BSP chief Mayawati’s move on Thursday to sack its veteran OBC leaders — Lalji Verma and Ram Achal Rajbhar — who managed to win Katehari and Akbarpur assembly seats in Kanshi Ram’s political crucible, Ambedkarnagar, defying the 2017 BJP wave is being viewed with curiosity in saffron ranks, which is working overtime to retain its OBC vote-bank. BJP is particularly wooing the influential OBC group, Rajbhar, to blunt a belligerent ally-turned-rebel, Suhaildev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar, who has been hobnobbing with Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia) president Shivpal Yadav for quite some time. Imran Masood on the other hand happens to be a key Muslim face of Congress, essentially in communally sensitive west UP. A former vice-president of UP Congress Committee, Masood contested from Nakur assembly seat in Saharanpur in 2017, but lost to BJP’s Dharam Singh Saini by a narrow margin of 4,000 votes. He was again given a ticket by Congress to contest from Saharanpur in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Masood, however, lost to SP-backed BSP candidate Haji Fazlur Rehman. Masood’s promotion as Congress national secretary, unsurprisingly, prompted a sharp response from BJP quarters with state president Swatantra Dev Singh accusing the grand old party of showcasing it “real ideology” by elevating a leader who had once threatened to kill PM Narendra Modi at a rally during 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Likewise, BSP leader Shah Alam aka Guddu Jamali is also a prominent Muslim leader hailing from Azamgarh, parliamentary seat of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav. A two-time lawmaker from Mubarakpur assembly constituency, Alam had contested from Azamgarh in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but lost to SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. Muslim voters have traditionally sided with a political party which potentially poses a formidable challenge to BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cong-bsp-move-to-prop-up-muslim-faces-can-hurt-sp/articleshow/83248098.cms||Pankaj Shah

Lodha, who was talking to mediapersons in Sirohi on Friday, did not mince words in stating that he has seen in his political career spanning 22 years that the officers in all the police stations bordering Gujarat were appointed on the recommendation of the officers in PHQ and patronised by them. “So the first thing needed to stop this was to cut the roots of these criminal police officers in PHQ,” Lodha said. Claiming this liquor smuggling taking place through these police stations to Gujarat, he said that there were over 25 such personnel in these border police stations, whose work was to facilitate the illegal work and liquor smuggling, not discharge duties as policemen. Referring to the growing involvement of policemen in crime, Lodha said that those who passed the exams through unfair means and got jobs in police are criminals and now part of the system. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sirohi-mla-lodha-alleges-cops-liquor-mafia-nexus/articleshow/83246410.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Yogi has asked the departments concerned to remain in constant touch with investors and extend all possible help, subsidies to them as per the policy pertaining to their sector of investment. The CM also discussed the UP Oxygen Production Promotion Policy, 2021, to make the state self-sufficient in oxygen production for medical and industrial use. “Many companies have expressed interest in setting up oxygen production plants in the state and the CM has asked officials to remain in touch with the top management of these companies to provide them with all possible help,” the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-got-rs-66k-cr-investment-proposals-during-pandemic/articleshow/83248119.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Why doctors delaying vaccination? Fear of cancer||LUCKNOW: It’s not only the illiterate population which is showing large-scale vaccine hesitancy, a latest survey conducted by a group of doctors has surprisingly revealed that even senior most among them are not willing to get vaccinated. A total of 343 doctors participated in the survey, which was conducted in four days by Professor Prabhat Agrawal, who was earlier associated with SNMC, Agra and is now a member of American Diabetic Association, Dr Ruchika Garg, associate professor of SNMC gynaecology department and Dr Akhil Pratap Singh of ENT department of the same government hospital. As per the survey, 13 doctors preferred to stay away from corona inoculation citing various reasons, most startling of these being 'it might lead to cancer in later stages'. Other reasons were waiting for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine, recent recovery from corona infection, having confidence of 'no comorbidities', etc. “We were a bit surprised by the response of the 13 doctors, mostly seniors. A 52-year-old physician argued that he was scared of contracting cancer after inoculation, but there is no research to back this claim. Some gave the excuse of not having any kind of co-morbidity or have developed antibodies following covid recovery,” said Professor Prabhat. He said, “There were a couple of doctors who wanted to be inoculated with the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine and not the current available in India.” The survey further revealed that 92 doctors got infected after vaccination, while 85 were infected prior to vaccination. There were nine doctors who were hospitalized for oxygen support after they contracted corona infection post inoculation. Survey found that five doctors who received the first dose of vaccine and later contracted infection were hospitalized for oxygen support, while four doctors claimed that they had to be hospitalized even after taking the second dose. Also, there were 10 doctors who were infected with coronavirus before and after the vaccination. But, none were admitted for oxygen support in hospital. Member of Association of physicians of India, Dr Agrawal said, “Though a vaccine helps produce antibodies to fight against the virus, yet every individual doesn't develop the same number of antibodies after vaccination. The number of antibodies that vaccination will produce in an individual depends on his or her immune system. The quantity of antibody is measured in humans by its levels of titres and a higher titre value means more antibodies in that person. But Unfortunately, a higher titre value doesn't always guarantee complete protection and that's the reason why a fully vaccinated person contracts the disease.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/docs-not-willing-to-take-jab-give-funny-excuses/articleshow/83248176.cms||Arvind Chauhan

While the committees were formed in March there has not been any progress in the inquiry. According to Murugesan, a total of 40 assistant professors, associate professors and professors were appointed in 2017-18 in the university. “While latest UGC regulations were not followed in the evaluation of applications, it was found that a candidate rejected for a post in one department was selected in another department. Further, teaching experience gained under temporary, part-time and consolidated appointment were considered for appointment,” he said. Another complaint says that a few non-academic staff acquired technical qualification of typewriting in a fraudulent manner without attending the course. It was based on these complaints that the governor directed the university to probe the alleged irregularities. A senior official from the university told TOI that two three-member committees were formed for both the cases in March. The committee to check the alleged irregularities. “Members of the committee have to attend the meeting in person to verify the allegations, but they could not convene a meeting because of the pandemic,” he said. However, advocate M Nedunchezhian said colleges were open in March and April, but the committee didn’t convene meetings despite the seriousness of the allegations. He has urged the governor to expedite the inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/panels-sit-on-probe-into-tamil-univ-irregularities/articleshow/83246508.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Pune||Pune: Organ donation, transplant numbers stay on the ascent||PUNE: The city has recorded the second-highest number of cadaver organ donations even as the pandemic rages on this year in Maharashtra. The relatives of 10 persons, who were declared brain-dead, agreed to donate vital organs that went on to benefit 19 patients of end-stage liver, kidney, and pancreas disease over the last five months, between January 1 and June 2 this year. A city hospital carried out a combined kidney-pancreas transplant in April, at a time when the second surge in Covid-19 cases was at its peak in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). “The second surge of the pandemic has definitely hit organ donation, but it could not halt it altogether. Of 10 brain-dead donors, four donated their vital organs between March and April when the pandemic was raging. This clearly shows the spirit of the citizens,” said Aarti Gokhale, transplant coordinator with the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC) that oversees the allocation of donated organs. There are four ZTCCs in Maharashtra that supervise donations across Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, and Nagpur regions. Mumbai has recorded the highest number of organ donations this year as well. The relatives of 15 brain-dead donors donated their vital organs until May 31 this year in Mumbai. The Nagpur ZTCC recorded organ donations from four brain-dead donors while the Aurangabad unit has recorded zero donations so far. “Citizens, who are driven and understand the importance of organ donation, along with an equally motivated set of doctors, counsellors, and social workers are the force behind the numbers,” said liver transplant physician and secretary of Pune region ZTCC Sheetal Mahajani-Dhadphale. Doctors said organ donation during the pandemic faced the risk of severe setbacks but credited families for their resolve. Pune’s first vital organ transplant during peak pandemic curbs last year was on May 15. It was performed by a team of doctors at Sahyadri Hospital. It was a cadaver liver transplant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/organ-donation-transplant-numbers-stay-on-the-ascent/articleshow/83246491.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||Risk of flooding in Mumbai city up due to siltation: Sat data||Navi Mumbai: Satellite imagery data study from 1990 to 2019 has established that coastal creeks in the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR) have narrowed down due to siltation and other factors, leading to the risk of flooding in many areas such as Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Uran and parts of Konkan. Former BNHS director Dr Deepak Apte, who is now executive director of the non-profit organization Srushti Conservation Foundation (SCF), has come up with the findings. Siltation at the mouth is causing the width of creeks and waterways along MMR, including Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Uran, to shrink. The volume of water in the estuary between high tide and low tide (tidal prism) during non-monsoon months is altered due to land use changes, and is putting coastal townships in MMR at risk of increased inundation, especially during monsoon. The study also points out that rising sea levels due to climate change add to the possibility of flooding in urban spaces, unless scientific steps are quickly taken to prevent it. Preliminary findings of the study indicate that 107.6 sq km of waterways and agricultural land has been lost and naturally converted into mudflats or mangrove areas in MMR due to rapid changes in the coastal ecosystem over the last 30 years. Apte stated, “Without policy and onsite interventions, such creek areas will over time be converted into mangrove forests, extremely shallow swamps or dry land in many parts, which will become unfit for navigation, reduce stormwater drainage capacity, and will render habitats unsuitable. It will especially affect the flamingo habitat in areas like Thane creek.”' He added, “The shrinking creek is not good for a city because the drainage capacity during monsoon will reduce significantly, leading to excessive flooding for the region. Once it becomes shallow the water carrying capacity of the creek will be reduced. As a result, during heavy rain and high tide water will enter city spaces even with a subtle increase in sea level rise scenario.” SCF has recommended building resilience of coastal communities, promoting nature based solutions, and preparing them for mitigating climate related risks to be of paramount importance for the resilience of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/risk-of-flooding-in-mumbai-city-up-due-to-siltation-sat-data/articleshow/83249250.cms||Vijay Singh

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh’s revenue up 42% in May despite corona curfew||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh earned Rs 8,272 crore in May this year, a jump of 42% over Rs 5,820 crore which it mopped up as tax and non-tax revenue in May 2020, when the entire state was under corona curfew. Interestingly, excise revenue fell by Rs 30 crore compared to May 2020, fetching the government Rs 2,138 crore this year while mining, too, reported a lower revenue of Rs 136 crore compared to Rs 242 crore for the same period. Finance minister Suresh Khanna said that the gains are due to a rise in GST, VAT, stamp duty and transport. “We have achieved 52.7% of our target for the month of May for tax and non-tax revenue. In light of the Corona curfew, this is a good achievement. It is also substantially more than the revenue in the same period last year, up by Rs 2,452 crore,” he said. The state’s revenue in April this year, by when the second Corona wave had picked up, was Rs 11,196 crore. However, Corona curfew which saw a near total closure of commercial activities, came into place only in the beginning of May and was lifted in most districts only from June 1. In May 2021, the tax revenue of the government was Rs 8,136 crore while in 2020, it was Rs 5,577 crore, an increase of Rs 2,558 crore. The government mopped up 53% of its tax revenue target for the month. Data shared by the finance department shows a GST revenue of Rs 2,771 crore, 48.1% of the target for the month. In VAT, the collection was 90.7% of the target at Rs 2,286 crore. Compared to May 2020, VAT collection was Rs 1,266 crore higher. Stamp duty also increased significantly over May 2020’s Rs 349.52 crore to touch Rs 625.03 crore though it was 28.5% of the target for the month. Transport saw a threefold rise over May 2020. From a collection of Rs 99.86 crore, it went up to Rs 314.62 crore which is almost 40% of the target. The only head under which revenue fell under the tax bracket was in excise even though with a collection of Rs 2,138.86 crore, the department met 52.5% of its target. Under the non-tax head, mining is the major source of income which saw a drop of Rs 105.91 crore over May 2020 collections. This month, the department saw collections of Rs 136.28 crore to meet 40% of its target for the month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ups-revenue-up-42-in-may-despite-corona-curfew/articleshow/83248210.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Trichy||Covaxin seekers make beeline for Trichy camps||Trichy: The growing awareness and surge in demand for vaccine against Covid-19 saw people assembling at vaccination camps in Trichy as early as 6.30 am on Friday. Though the two venues in the city administered only Covaxin for 18-44 age category, there was a big rush evoking fears of vaccination camps turning into hotspots. Several people said the short wait time for the second dose of Covaxin compared to Covishield prompted them to get their jab at the earliest. After vaccinating 1,971 people in the city on Thursday and exhausting its Covishield stock, Trichy corporation had announced that only the first dose of Covaxin will be administered on Friday. Instead of organising the camps as usual at six locations, the civic body preferred to conduct the camps only at two places, Kalaiarangam and Thevar hall. The serpentine queues saw men who were already vaccinated too standing in queue for their spouse or family members so as to protect them from the crowd. People assembled at the centres early in the morning and took the jab after waiting for hours. “My preference was Covaxin since the waiting period between two doses is only a month. Also, those who were vaccinated already and doctors opined that Covaxin has only mild side effects,” V Visodhan, 24, a resident of Puthur said. While those who have plans to go abroad prefer Covishield, locals and women were seen to be interested in Covaxin dose. The growing crowds saw the city police intervening forcibly. Although only 1,307 people were vaccinated on Friday against 1,971 on Thursday, the lack of adequate vaccine stocks saw many youngsters returning disappointed. Youths who waited for over 3 hours demanded more vaccine stocks saying people are desperate to get vaccinated. “We have planned a local level token system through website or similar mechanism to avoid crowding. Vaccination awareness among youth is high, we will request for more allotment of vaccines to continue the drive,” an officer managing the city corporation’s vaccination camps said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/covaxin-seekers-make-beeline-for-trichy-camps/articleshow/83246531.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Teacher dispels vaccine fears in tribals, conveys messages in their languages||PUNE: Ratan Chaudhary (48), a zilla parishad teacher from Umbarpada in Surgana taluka of Nashik district, was alarmed that hardly anyone from his hamlet had taken the Covid shot even five months after the vaccination drive had begun in the country. Chaudhary found out that the tribals of his hamlet would flee to the hills or hide when government vehicles did the rounds announcing in Marathi about the registration for the vaccination. It all boiled down to fear, reluctance, a heavy dose of misinformation about the vaccine combined with a language and trust barrier. The tribals felt they would be vaccinated forcefully and admitted to Covid wards, he said. Chaudhary then rolled up his sleeves to start an awareness drive. “Most people in Surgana speak Dangi and Konkani. The announcements and awareness campaigns are in Marathi, and there is a disconnect,” he told TOI. Chaudhary translated the Marathi Covid and vaccine-related messages into Dangi and Konkani, and included simpler words. Now, every weekend, Chaudhary buys face masks and rides along the dusty and wooded roads to remote hamlets to spread the word. Mostly, it is an attempt to spot people and get them to listen. When he sees a group of people, whether on a farm, a village chowk, outside a temple, at a bus stop or under a tree, he strikes up a conversation in Dangi. “I talk to them about the virus and the need for vaccination in their language like a neighbour would,” he said. Chaudhary engages with youngsters about studies and work and then leads the conversation to vaccination. With older men, asking about their joint pains is the ice breaker, and with the women, it is about their grandchildren. “Their misconceptions ran so deep that any talk about the vaccination would get them agitated. But I pacify them by giving examples of people in nearby villages who have taken the vaccine,” he said. At a wedding last week, Chaudhary took the mic from the priest as soon as the rituals were over and started his awareness speech. “I had sought permission from the groom’s father. A week before that I spoke at two funerals. I don’t miss any opportunity,” he said. It is progress if people don’t run into the forest and instead listen to his message. “It’s a beginning, and eventually people will come forward for the vaccination,” he said. Chaudhary had to start from home where his father opposed the vaccine because of his belief that one dies after the shot. “I told him I had taken both the doses, and he came around after two days of convincing. When the hamlet realised that my father was well after vaccination, others began to take the shots. I then realised that formal announcements from government vehicles wouldn’t work. If I could convince one person from each hamlet, he will be an example to 10 others and the message would spread,” an optimistic Chaudhary said. Looking at how well his effort is paying off, the Nashik ZP and the block development officers from the neighbouring talukas have started campaigning in tribal languages. Nashik ZP’s CEO Leena Bansod said, “Chaudhary and many such teachers are a great help in our vaccine campaign. Recently, on a visit to a remote vaccination centre in Jambhulpada village, I realised that the local language is key to make people understand better. I have also recorded messages in Dangi, Konkani and Ahirani languages and begun broadcasting them through our teams in tribal areas. It is getting a good response and more people are coming to the centres.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teacher-dispels-vax-fears-in-tribals-conveys-messages-in-their-languages/articleshow/83246525.cms||Aditya Waikul

Cantonment police arrested S Gopinath, 39, of Edamalaipattipudhur, and K Muniyappan, 43, of Thiruverkadu in Chennai on charges of kidnapping for ransom, wrongful confinement, voluntarily causing hurt, threatening with dire consequences and attempting to murder N Mithul Shah, 38, of Mumbai. Preliminary inquiries by police revealed that Mithul Shah was an investment banker running a financial services company in Mumbai. Gopinath had invested Rs 20 lakh as share in the business. Police said Shah failed to repay the amount to Gopinath. In April, the Mumbai-based man visited Chennai and stayed at a hotel. Muniyappan, a friend of Gopinath, met Shah at the hotel to settle the financial dispute. As they could not resolve it, the duo asked Shah to visit Trichy to have further talks. He visited Trichy on May 7 and stayed at a hotel near the central bus stand. During their interaction, Gopinath and Muniyappan physically assaulted Shah and set him on fire by pouring kerosene on him on May 14. Shah sustained injuries on his stomach, right hand and on both the thighs. The duo kept him in the hotel room and provided some medication to cure the burn injuries. On Thursday evening, the duo forcibly took away Shah by car when he shouted for help. The accused pushed him out of the vehicle and escaped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/two-held-for-kidnapping-trying-to-murder-biz-man/articleshow/83246529.cms||---
---||Trichy||Parents told to report if private schools hold excess online classes||Trichy: While many private schools have started online academic sessions after summer vacations, schools were found to be engaging students for more hours than stipulated by state government last year. As the health of children is being affected due to this, the district chief education office is expected to issue a direction to all schools to adhere to the norms. While school students except class 12 were promoted without exams to their successive classes due to Covid-19, private schools have started online classes to start academic activity.As per the direction from state government last year, schools were instructed to take a maximum of two sessions each of 30-45 minutes for students from class 1-8. For students of class 9-12, four online sessions were allowed. However, parents say that students have been engaged up to 6 hours in some schools. One of the parents of a class X student from a private school in Trichy S Jayanthi said teachers are citing board exam as a reason for the additional classes. While we are not allowing our children outside to play, we are concerned if such exposure to electronic gadgets would affect their health, she said. It is unfortunate that schools are engaging in such practices this year as well defying goverment norms laid down following last year’s classes overload, V Baskaran an educationist from Trichy said. Speaking to TOI, Trichy district chief education officer R Arivalagan said schools will be instructed to ensure that they don’t engage students for hours longer than stipulated by the state government. He asked parents to report such incidents to the school principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/parents-told-to-report-if-private-schools-hold-excess-online-classes/articleshow/83246521.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt caps rates of 28 operations to treat black fungus||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government on Friday capped the charges of surgical treatment of mucormycosis or black fungus after reports of patients having to spend lakhs at private hospitals came to light. In a circular issued by the public health department, the cost of 28 surgical procedures that patients of mucormycosis normally require has been fixed. The charges are graded and have been classified into three categories for Class A, B and C cities. They range from a minimum of Rs 6,000 in a Class C city to a maximum of Rs 1 lakh in a Class A city. A senior official pointed at instances of patients shelling out up to Rs 39 lakh in Mumbai, prompting the government to regulate the treatment cost. Mucor lobectomy to cost Rs 1L in city, 40% less in small townsThe government on Friday capped the cost of 28 surgeries that are usually needed in the treatment of mucormycosis, including 11 ENT surgeries, five neurological, two ophthalmological, two orthopaedic and five surgical oncology procedures. Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal disease, now seen among many recovering from Covid treatment, which needs extensive medical and surgical management. A patient could need multiple surgeries, involving ENT, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, to arrest the spread of the infection that usually starts from the sinuses and can spread into surrounding areas around the eye and brain. In rare cases, it could also travel down to the lung. For those not requiring surgery but only medical intervention, the hospitalisation rates laid down under the 80:20 scheme would be applicable. Over 511 people have lost their lives while 6,133 have been affected by the fungal infection that is increasingly being seen among people who have had Covid treatment in the second wave in Maharashtra. More than 4,041 people are undergoing treatment and1,543 have recovered, according to state’s latest figures. Dr Sudhakar Shinde, who was instrumental in fixing the rates, said they studied the surgery packages from two leading hospitals each in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur to reach an average. A formula has been worked out even for situations where a patient undergoes multiple surgeries in a single sitting. Here, the patient will be charged 100% for the highest costing surgery, 50% for the second highest and 25% for any subsequent surgery as specified on the list. Hospitals can charge up to 110% of net procurement cost for devices and prosthesis used during surgery. Commonly performed procedures such as debridement of the wound, lobectomy (removal of an organ lobe), pneumonectomy (removal of a lung), skull base surgery, maxillofacial reconstruction, excision of tumour, among others, feature on the capped list. Lobectomy, for instance, will cost Rs1 lakh in a Class A city hospital, Rs 75,000 in a Class B city and Rs 60,000 in a Class C city. A large wound debridement will cost Rs 38,000 in a Class A city and Rs 22,800 in a Class C city. Treatment for mucormycosis is free at 132 of the 1,000-odd hospitals empanelled under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana. But people not covered under any health insurance scheme or those who have exhausted their cover are being charged exorbitantly by private healthcare providers causing hardships, the state official said. The state order also mandates hospitals to prominently display the details of rates. Local authorities such as collectors and municipal commissioners have been asked to appoint auditors to review bills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mucor-lobectomy-to-cost-rs-1l-in-city-40-less-in-small-towns/articleshow/83246562.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Kolkata||New therapy: Four in Kolkata get antibody cocktail to fight Covid||KOLKATA: At least four patients infected with Covid-19 in Kolkata have been administered the much talked about antibody cocktail — a combination of Casirivimab and Imdevimab. This therapy, meant specially for mild to moderately infected patients, has brought hope for patients with co-morbid conditions. A 62-year-old Kolkata resident who has been given this antibody cocktail had survived colon cancer a few years ago but is now battling prostate cancer. The patient was found infected a few days ago. “This drug is best suited for patients who have mild to moderate symptoms, but fall in the high-risk Covid patient category because they have certain co-morbidities. So far, the 62-year-old’s infection has not progressed and he is recuperating at home. His fever is gone and he is maintaining a good oxygen saturation level,” said Raja Dhar, director and head of the pulmonology department at CMRI. Two patients given the medication at CMRI are back home and the disease has not progressed. Two others are admitted in another hospital off Bypass and are doing well. One of them needs a small quantity of oxygen as the patient complains of slight breathing distress while walking. The four, including three men, have conditions like diabetes, hypertension, asthma. Antibodies are proteins that the body generates to defend itself against infection. But these monoclonal antibodies are artificially created to fight a particular disease. Casirivimab and Imdevimab, which form the antibody cocktail, are produced by Switzerland-based Roche. The drug cocktail is expected to block the virus’s entry into cells, preventing its replication. “There is no point administering the drug to a patient who is under ventilation or needs high oxygen support. It should be given within day one and 10 of the onset of symptoms, the earlier — within three days — the better,” said Dhar. This antibody cocktail came into the limelight after it was used to treat former US President Donald Trump during the first wave. This can be given to a patient and s/he can be discharged after an hour’s observation to detect adverse effects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-therapy-four-in-city-get-antibody-cocktail-to-fight-covid/articleshow/83244442.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Trichy||Now, small stores mull e-commerce options||Trichy: As the complete lockdown has increased demand for door-delivery of essential commodities, neighbourhood stores are considering having their e-commerce platform to manage the demand and keep their business afloat. The demand for outsourcing work on website and database maintenance from commercial outlets has paved way for software as a service (SaaS) start-ups to mushroom and cash in by offering e-commerce support.As the government has banned all shops from doing direct sales during the lockdown, even small outlets are forced to do door deliveries. Although they receive orders through phone calls, social media and even third-party delivery partners, shopkeepers said it is less lucrative as delivery partners charge an additional sum while customers are opting for other cheap modes. As there is no direct interaction between sellers and customers when orders are placed through a third-party delivery agency, shopkeepers said there is no scope for retaining the customers. With shops opting to outsource e-commerce management, startups are gaining ground in Trichy. “Even departmental stores and meat stalls are looking for an online presence. They are enquiring for exclusive and independent system at an affordable price as lockdowns may recur,” said R Venugopal, project manager, TrichyShop, a startup that manages e-commerce applications. The startups provide e-commerce support by charging Rs 3,000 per month with a separate website domain and server to store customer database. Door delivery management has to be taken care of by the shops individually. “If we have the database of customers, we can retain them by engaging with text messages periodically,” R Ramesh, a grocery shop owner in Rockfort said. Meat stalls are the most interested in the e-commerce system followed by bakeries and vegetable shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/now-small-stores-mull-e-commerce-options/articleshow/83246532.cms||Deepak Karthik

Thapa missed Thursday’s clash against Qatar after his test result showed he was “reactive” or in the words of health officials, “borderline positive.” According to sources, Thapa’s CT value was 35. Directives issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) state that all patients with a CT value less than 35 may be considered as positive, while those with a CT value above 35 may be considered as negative. “Thapa has been tested twice in the last two days (Friday and Saturday) but we have not been informed about the results. Since the test was done for two consecutive days, we are assuming that the first result (on Friday) was negative. At this stage, this is only an assumption since we do not have a confirmation,” a team source told TOI on Saturday. Thapa is asymptomatic and will need two negative test results to join the team again. He is now isolating in a different hotel, away from the Indian team. The Chennaiyin FC midfielder was missing from the India squad for the clash against Qatar. The Asian champions dominated from start to finish but managed to get the better of goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu just once. India have two games left to be played in the World Cup qualifiers against Bangladesh (June 7) and Afghanistan (June 15). They must win both games to finish third in the group for a direct spot in the third round of the Asian Cup 2019 qualifiers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/india-wait-for-thapas-covid-19-test-results-in-borderline-case/articleshow/83267443.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Mumbai||Mumbai hits single-day record for jabs at over 88k, wastage below 1% for 3 months||MUMBAI: The unique strategies used by vaccination centres in the city to ensure minimal vaccine wastage seem to have paid off. Civic numbers show wastage has remained below 1% in the past three months. The city on Friday also hit a record of highest single-day vaccinations at 88,527. Over 35 lakh people have now received at least one dose. The jabs given on Friday include 69,228 in the private sector and 18,389 in the public sector. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the erratic supply of doses has hit the drive in the public sector. Private hospitals are now getting tranches of nearly 30,000-50,000 doses each. On Saturday, vaccination will be only through online appointments. Achieving optimum utilisation of vaccines has included novel methods such as reducing the number of counters after the crowd starts thinning and calling up social workers and local activists to rope in people from their areas in case of spare doses. Recently, office-bearers of a Shiv Sena leader in Jogeshwari got a call from the Nesco vaccination centre that they had 20 doses of Covaxin to spare for second shot seekers. The volunteers got active on messaging groups and, within an hour, people started showing up. A nurse who works at a vaccination centre in the suburbs said in case of spare doses, they ask people who have accompanied the seniors if they want to take the shot, if they are eligible. “On days when walk-ins are allowed, we have even asked the security guards to ask the rickshaw drivers standing near the centre if they want to get vaccinated. If they are eligible and have ID proof, we register and vaccinate them,” said the nurse. Centres have observed wastage is minimal when jabs are given through online appointments as against ‘walk-in’ only days. Dr Prerna Kadam, who handles vaccination at the Dahisar jumbo centre, said on days vaccination is based on appointment, they open slots in multiples of 10, so chances of wastage are slim. “During walk-ins we try to reduce the number of vaccination counters post lunch,” said Kadam. She said in case of Covaxin, which is in short supply, if there are less than eight people on a particular day, they ask them to come the next day. Dean of Nesco Dr Neelam Andrade said roping in local leaders has helped since they have a list of vaccine-seekers. Close coordination within booths in a single centre has also worked. Wastage is minimal at the housing society sites too, said Dr Prince Surana, CEO of Surana Group. Recently, a housing society was left with eight doses to spare. “Calls were made to drivers and maids who willingly came and got vaccinated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hits-single-day-record-for-jabs-at-over-88k-wastage-lt1-for-3-mths/articleshow/83246566.cms||Bhavika Jain

For the quarter ending March 2021, the city-based auto components giant reported a profit of around Rs 212 crore against a consolidated loss of Rs 68.6 crore in the corresponding quarter the previous fiscal. Its year-on-year (YoY) revenues also increased, standing at Rs 2083 crore, against Rs 1742 crore in Q4 2020. Against a consolidated profit of Rs 349 crore in FY20, Bharat Forge reported a net loss of around Rs 127 crore in FY21. Its revenue declined from Rs 8,056 crore in FY20 to Rs 6,336 crore in FY21. The firm said in an analyst’s note that it was confident of growth in India with gradual normalization, as well as optimism from robust exports and government orders. “The year has ended on a strong note with sharp recovery visible in all our end markets. We recently secured an order from the Government of India for development & supply of components/products. As we enter FY22, we are seeing robust demand continue in major segments in the export business. The lockdown ... has clearly had an impact on demand & production in the automotive sector. We are optimistic that this weakness is temporary,” Baba Kalyani, CMD of Bharat Forge, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/q4-revenue-profit-up-for-bharat-forge/articleshow/83246567.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Justice J R Midha slammed Chawla and her co-plaintiffs for filing a “defective” plea and for wasting the court’s time and said the cost will be used to help road accident victims. The HC also took a dim view of Chawla’s conduct to gain publicity where she posted the link for online hearing of court proceedings on her social media profiles, saying it resulted in repeated interruptions by unknown persons. On Wednesday, during the first hearing an anonymous intruder had disturbed court proceedings by singing some of the songs of the actress thrice after some interval. When the court staff removed the person he kept joining under different ID to interrupt till the time the proceedings were locked. The court issued contempt notices against the unknown person/persons and asked the Delhi Police to identify them. It faulted Chawla’s suit on alleged health hazards due to the 5G technology for being “stuffed with unnecessary, scandalous and frivolous averments”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-high-court-dismisses-juhi-chawlas-lawsuit-against-5g-slaps-20-lakh-fine/articleshow/83251123.cms||Abhinav Garg

Another 12 workers were rushed to a hospital in serious condition. A chunk of liquor consignment, which had allegedly claimed 99 lives in the district last week, was dumped into the canal by the criminals who feared that it would be confiscated by police. On Wednesday, a group of 30 villagers had consumed the dumped liquor in Rohera village leading to six deaths. Another four succumbed on Friday. Giving details of Sisroi village in Akrabad area, sub-divisional magistrate Ranjeet Singh said that a bunch of brick kiln workers had consumed the liquor after stumbling on it near the canal on Thursday night. Chief medical officer Dr BP Kalyani said, “Two deaths have been reported in Akrabad incident and their post-mortems are yet to be conducted.” He said 31 people, including 12 from Sisroi village, are still hospitalized and eight of them are under dialysis. Earlier in the day, district magistrate CB Singh said that water flow in the Ganga canal, where 20-odd cartons of liquor were found on Thursday morning, will be stopped to search for any more dumped consignment. He said that liquor mafias had apparently dumped these cartons of spurious liquor to evade their seizure. The DM also said that all the 10 victims of Rohera village tragedy are labourers from Bihar and their respective districts have been informed about the tragedy. He, however, clarified that the Aligarh administration will only pay compensation to those who hail from the district. Meanwhile, police have issued an alert in the neighbouring districts of Etah, Kasganj and Mathura to launch a search operation for dumped liquor stocks on both sides of the canal. Police have also requested the irrigation department to activate their inspection team in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/toxic-liquor-dumped-by-criminals-claims-2-more-lives-in-aligarh-another-12-in-hospital/articleshow/83242331.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The 6.5-meter-high pier has been constructed near the upcoming New Ashok Nagar RRTS station, one of the three stations in Delhi. The other two are Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan terminal stations. The average height of the piers on the stretch varies from 5.6m to 17m, a spokesperson of National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) said. “The Delhi section starts from Sarai Kale Khan and passes above the existing Barapullah flyover in the way of crossing the Yamuna to reach New Ashok Nagar station. An RRTS Yamuna bridge is also under construction for crossing the river almost parallel to DND Flyway,” he said. The 1.3km bridge will be the 17th bridge to come up on the river in Delhi. He said the foundation work, including piling and pile caps, was in full swing between New Ashok Nagar and Kondli and the same on around 2km of the 9.2km stretch in Delhi had been completed. “The NCRTC team is keeping the pace of the project intact to meet the stringent timelines despite the unprecedented challenges faced due to Covid-19,” he said. “Construction is in progress on the entire corridor with the help of 12 launching gantries, probably the most in any urban infrastructure project, for making the viaduct.” While the corridor is scheduled to open by 2025, a 17km priority section between Sahibabad and Duhai in Uttar Pradesh is targeted to be commissioned by 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/first-pier-of-delhi-section-of-rrts-corridor-erected/articleshow/83244588.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Conduct third-party audit of plantations, Rai tells agencies||New Delhi: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Friday directed Delhi’s greening agencies to complete third-party audits of plantation work carried out over the last few years in order to assess survival rate of the plants and ensure transparency. Addressing a press conference, Rai said while Forest Research Institute in Dehradun had already carried out audits of plantation work undertaken by the forest and wildlife department between 2016 and 2019, other agencies had also been asked to complete their audits soon. Rai said the report for the third-party audit for the forest and wildlife department was expected to be submitted to him by July. He added that Delhi’s other green agencies, including DMRC, NDMC, DUSIB, DDA, Delhi Cantonment, DJB, EDMC, PWD, North DMC and South DMC, were all conducting independent audits of the plantation work. “The Delhi government is serious about monitoring and transparency of the plantation work. In a bid to ensure this, I have ordered a strict independent third-party audit of the plantation work across Delhi. The report of the audit should be submitted by July. Various organisations and respected institutions are working on the third-party audit,” Rai said. Delhi’s green cover has been gradually increasing over the years and currently stands at 21.9%. This year, the Delhi government plans to plant 33 lakh saplings, beginning from June 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/conduct-third-party-audit-of-plantations-rai-tells-agencies/articleshow/83244634.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bandra locals want tree expert for a green backyard, MLA writes to BMC||Mumbai: To help protect what remains of the city’s green cover, Bandra residents want the BMC to bring in a tree expert to conserve trees in their backyard. Lending a voice to their demand, local MLA Ashish Shelar has dashed off a letter to the civic body to appoint an arborist — or a tree expert — before the monsoon to protect trees around the queen of the suburbs and elsewhere in the city. This demand comes in the wake of the fact that 140 trees had been uprooted in Bandra (west) and around last month due to cyclone Tauktae. Vidya Vaidya of the Bandra Reclamation Area Volunteers Organisation (BRAVO) said that a scientific tree assessment was most needed. “H-West is one of the greenest wards. We have lost many trees due to the cyclone and they can’t be replanted in a random manner. There must be a scientific audit of all trees that still intact, ahead of the monsoon. Appointing an arborist is a welcome move, and must be extended to all wards,” said Vaidya. As a pilot project, BMC has appointed an arborist to scientifically assess risk of trees that could fall, and to help salvage them in south Mumbai’s D ward. BMC is enrolling arborist Vaibhav Raje for the pilot project which is slated to take off soon. The survey will take around two weeks once it starts and will cover around 100-150 trees in the D Ward. Shelar’s letter to BMC chief Iqbal Chahal states that BMC must appoint an arborist to survey trees in H-West ward which includes Bandra. Shelar’s letter states: “The appointment of a tree expert... is a must for all 24 wards... Given the huge damage to tree cover in the H-West ward and impending monsoon season, I demand that a tree export or arborist be appointed for H-West ward or urgent basis...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bandra-locals-want-tree-expert-for-a-green-backyard-mla-writes-to-bmc/articleshow/83249285.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

NMMC will pay Rs1,000 to every student in two installments for the first semester. Teachers will also be engaged to hand deliver printed home-work assignments to students for periodic assessment every fortnight. NMMC also plans to help students who do not have smartphones with required gadgets to access online classes. But residents expressed resentment over the inordinate delay in offering such benefits to students. “NMMC should have initiated this scheme last year, soon after the pandemic stalled offline classes,” said activist Rajeev Mishra. There are 75 civic schools under NMMC (55 primary, and 18 secondary and two CBSE). NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “We had almost decided to offer financial assistance to students for data packages last October but by the time Covid cases started reducing, giving a ray of hope for reopening schools, which did not happen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/navi-mumbai-municipal-corporation-to-pay-rs-1k-to-each-civic-student-for-internet/articleshow/83246634.cms||B B Nayak
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Nanded traffic cops become first in region to get body-worn cameras||AURANGABAD: To bring a check on incidents of friction between traffic violators and police on duty as well as to ensure transparency in day-to-day affairs, Nanded traffic police have been equipped with body-worn cameras while manning important areas. With this initiative, Nanded has become the third police unit in the state to get body cameras after Mumbai and Pune. Superintendent of police Pramod Kumar Shewale told TOI, “Whenever policemen try to strictly implement traffic norms, there are allegations and counter complaints. These body cameras will not only bring a check on the violators, but will also help us ensure more transparency in day-to-day functioning of traffic branch.” The officer said that even in incidents involving use of criminal force or assault to deter public servants from performing official duties, footages recorded from these cameras are set to act as irrefutable evidence against the suspects. “Though there are not high number of cases of attacking or assaulting traffic police, but definitely the numbers of attacks on government employees during the pandemic period have definitely registered a surge. Footages captured by these body-worn cameras will definitely help us take such cases to logical ends,” said Shewale. Authorities maintained that these cameras have been purchased from the funds granted by Nanded-Waghala Municipal Corporation headed by commissioner Sunil Lahane. On priority, they will put on by the traffic police deployed in important areas of the city which, each year, witnesses tens of thousands of domestic and foreign travellers. Traffic police inspector Chandrashekhar Kadam said, “These body cameras have 10-hour long battery back-up with 128 GB of memory. The cameras are capable of capturing high resolution pictures from a distance of over 15 meters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nanded-traffic-cops-become-first-in-region-to-get-body-worn-cameras/articleshow/83240259.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kolkata||West Bengal government proposes green lanes for e-vehicles||KOLKATA: The Bengal government has proposed a special inter-city corridor, which can be used only by electric vehicles, with charging stations every 25km. This is an attempt to phase out fossil-fuel vehicles and encourage more and more people to use battery-driven cars, the state’s target being 10 lakh battery-powered vehicles by 2030. The environment-friendly lanes will be along two popular routes, one from Kolkata to Asansol and the other from Kolkata to Digha. Along these routes, electric vehicles are planned to have priority movement channels, and rapid charging stations will be set up every 25km. There will also be green zones—which might be developed into parking areas or other facilities—where, only battery-powered vehicles will be allowed. “The policy will take forward our fledgling dream of zero-emission transportation. E-vehicles will give us immunity from the ever rising fuel prices, which are pushing up prices of every commodity. This is the future of vehicles. We all must work together to achieve this common goal at the earliest,” said state transport minister Firhad Hakim. The government expects the environment-friendly policy to pave the way for faster adoption of electric vehicles across categories to cut down on pollution as well as to reduce the dependence on fossil fuel. Currently, the price escalation of fossil fuel has almost crippled the transport sector. The tariff for charging or input electricity tariff for public charging stations could be kept low to restrict operating costs and more people could go for such cars, an official said. The policy identified Kolkata, Howrah, Asansol and Darjeeling as model e-mobility cities, New Town being the pilot city for all the initiatives, said an officer of Bengal’s power department, the project nodal body that drafted the policy. WBSEDCL is the state-level nodal agency for charging infrastructure. At present, stated the electric vehicle policy, 2021, the number of such vehicles in Bengal was 37,400, of which 36,000 were e-rickshaws or totos. The state aimed at setting up one lakh public or semi-public charging stations while implementing the policy. Bengal, the policy document stated, aimed to be among the top three states in India in having electric mobility penetration by the end of FAME II implementation year 2022. The state also targets to be the best in electric mobility penetration by 2030. The policy also emphasised the use of other renewable energy sources, like hydrogen generation and refuelling stations, the first few to be developed by the government. Private developers will also be allowed to set up hydrogen stations in coordination with central guidelines and adhering to state safety standards. Developers will be eligible for 100% net SGST, accrued to the state, as reimbursement for purchase of machinery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-proposes-green-lanes-for-e-vehicles/articleshow/83244631.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC’s global tender for vaccine a flop, all nine bids junked||MUMBAI: With none of the nine bidders for supplying vaccines to the city able to establish any direct connection with manufacturers, the BMC on Friday rejected all the bids, and its global expression of interest (EoI) closed without any success. Civic officials said they rejected all the nine proposals for supply of one crore vaccine doses. A senior civic official said the suppliers could not submit the required documents, especially to establish any direct connection with manufacturers. “As on June 4, all nine bidders have been disqualified,” a senior civic official said. The BMC, though, said in a statement it held talks with Dr Reddy’s Laboratory that has the sole distribution rights for the Russian Sputnik vaccine in India. The company has agreed to supply it on an “experimental basis” to the BMC by June-end. “More discussions to procure a large stockpile of Sputnik vaccine are being carried out. This process will go on for the next eight to 10 days,” said a senior civic official. The official said since the cold storage facility of Sputnik is not the same as that required for Covaxin and Covishield, it will first procure a small quantity of doses on an experimental basis. Later, a large stockpile may be bought. “Since Dr Reddy’s Laboratory has the sole distribution rights of Sputnik in India, we have gotten in touch with them. We will find out how many vaccines they can sell to us and in how much time. Once this is clear, we will place an order. For now, we will not get in touch with any other company,” the official said. The BMC had received 10 bids. One bidder who had offered to supply Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines backed out. Of the nine bidders, seven had offered to give the BMC Sputnik V, one Sputnik Light and one said the company will supply any approved vaccine that becomes available. With the Russian Development Investment Fund (RDIF) and Dr Reddy’s clarifying they have not entered into a partnership with any firm to supply Sputnik V or Sputnik Light in India, the BMC had said if they weren’t able to establish any direct connection of the suppliers with manufacturers, they would stop processing the offers.

But cops have sent out a warning: anyone misusing the relaxation and auto drivers plying for regular commute will be penalised. There have been reports of autos resuming operations in some parts of the city. An officer said while bus drivers and conductors had returned to their homes in the districts, auto drivers were still in Kolkata. “If they get genuine calls from healthcare workers to drop them off to their hospitals and workplaces, we will be considerate. They can also take patients to hospitals in emergencies or vaccine recipients to the centres as public transport is unavailable. But if they are seen plying on scheduled routes, we will seize the vehicles,” he said. Police said James Long Sarani traffic guard and Jorabagan traffic guard on Friday seized a few autos plying at Taratala crossing and on B K Pal Avenue. Autos operating in Tangra-Topsia and Ultadanga have been reported. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha reiterated autos had not been permitted to ply regular routes. “We have asked our men to act against anyone violating the restrictions without valid reason,” he said. Auto operators said the enhanced restrictions had hit their business, especially when they were already dealing with increased gas prices and the closure of offices, schools and colleges. Police are considering a change in their inspection schedule at check-posts following the easing of time restrictions on retail shops from June 1. “We might put more importance on night nakas as there has been no concession in that. We will also begin random checking at nakas instead of checking every motorist as this is leading to jams. We might also choose areas,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/autos-get-nod-to-ferry-vaccine-recipients-to-centres-healthcare-workers-to-hosps/articleshow/83244660.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Bridges to help decongest R G Kar hospital vicinity||Kolkata: The Kolkata traffic police has sent two separate proposals to KMDA for constructing bridges that they believe will decongest Rabindra Sarani, Khirod Vidya Vinod (KVV) Avenue and RG Kar Hospital area, where ambulances get caught in traffic snarls due to the heavy traffic load following the demolition of Tala bridge. The bridges will come in handy to take the load of Kolkata railway terminal when the Covid situation passes. The first proposal is to construct a bridge over Circular Canal on the western side of Chitpur Bridge to connect Rabindra Sarani and the Railway service road. The other proposed bridge will connect Canal West Road and Raicharan Sadhukhan road to ease traffic heading to Kolkata station. The proposal was sent to KMDA in early March after a joint inspection where the senior executive engineers of the civic agency had agreed with police plans. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha confirmed the proposals. “The Tala bridge work has put spotlight on the importance of Cossipore Road and KVV Avenue. North-bound vehicles, especially trucks that avail Rabindra Sarani take a left turn to proceed further north from the crossing of Rabindra Sarani-KVV Avenue. This creates an extra pressure on the Lock Gate flyover. Construction of a bridge over the Circular Canal on the western side of Chitpur Bridge will ease this pressure,” the cops stated in their letter. KMDA said topographical studies and soil surveys had been conducted for the second bridge. “The bridge will help divert vehicles across the canal to Shyambazar or Belgachia, It would reduce load on RG Kar bridge,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bridges-to-help-decongest-r-g-kar-hospital-vicinity/articleshow/83244712.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

On Friday, 1,088 ‘old’ deaths were added, bringing the data up to date till May 31. In all, 1,358 deaths occurred in June so far, and the remaining 2,069 took place more than a week ago, said state health officials. “Many of these deaths are old as many districts are finding it difficult to feed mortality data in real time,” said Dr Avinash Supe, a member of the state government’s task force on Covid mortality. Supe reassured that the state’s weekly death rate is still around 1% and he expects the number of deaths to drop drastically in the next 10 days. “The number of ICU admissions is dropping, but there are still a significant number of patients who are critical and have been there for weeks. This could explain the ‘thick tail’ that Maharashtra has both in terms of cases and deaths,” said Supe. The state added 14,152 cases and 289 deaths on Friday, taking the total caseload to 58 lakh and the toll to 98,771, including the 1,088 ‘old’ deaths. In Mumbai, the daily caseload stayed under 1,000 for the fifth day in a row. While 968 cases were registered in Mumbai on Friday, the total caseload increased to 7.1 lakh since March 2020. The number of deaths in Mumbai dropped, with 24 deaths recorded on Friday. The toll since the pandemic began stands at 14,922 so far. On Friday, once again, Dharavi reported one Covid case. The total active cases now stand at 20 from the slum cluster. The test positivity rate in Mumbai dropped further to 3.5% with 27,351 tests conducted in a 24-hour period. The overall growth rate of Covid cases in Mumbai between May 28 and June 3 dropped to 0.13% and the doubling rate has increased to 515 days. Echoing Supe, state government officials said the number of critical patients has dropped significantly across the state and daily deaths will see a drop in the next few days. “There are a few districts like Satara, Kolhapur, Ratnagiri where cases are on the rise and they are being closely monitored and strict containment measures are being put in place,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-3427-past-deaths-added-to-toll-in-4-days-of-june-fatalities-to-fall-in-10-days-says-doc/articleshow/83251258.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Delhi||Court says robberies give bad name to city, denies bail to accused||New Delhi: Incidents of robbery are on rise in the capital, thereby giving it a bad name of “crime capital” of the country, said a Delhi court on Friday, as it refused to give bail to a man accused of robbing a person in January this year. Additional sessions judge Anuj Aggrwal observed that the allegations against Vinay were grave and investigation into the case was still at a nascent stage. According to police, on January 2, Vinay and an associate robbed the complainant of his mobile phone after assaulting him. Seeking bail, the accused’s counsel argued that he was innocent and has been implicated in the case. The counsel submitted that his client had been in custody since February 26 and pointed out that the associate Vikash was granted bail by the court on March 27. He, therefore, sought bail on the ground of parity. The additional public prosecutor, however, opposed the bail application on the ground that the allegations against applicant/accused were grave, submitting Vinay had refused to join the test identification proceedings. The court observed that the applicant couldn’t claim any parity with a co-accused Vikash as the complainant in the case had failed to identify the latter during TIP whereas Vinay had refused to join it. “Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the present case , I am not inclined to release the applicant on bail at this stage,” held the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-says-robberies-give-bad-name-to-city-denies-bail-to-accused/articleshow/83244736.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thane||Maharashtra: 3,427 past deaths added to toll in 4 days of June; fatalities to fall in 10 days, says doctor||MUMBAI: In the first four days of June, though the daily Covid caseload as well as deaths dropped significantly, the state has added 3,427 past fatalities due to the ongoing data reconciliation exercise. On Friday, 1,088 ‘old’ deaths were added, bringing the data up to date till May 31. In all, 1,358 deaths occurred in June so far, and the remaining 2,069 took place more than a week ago, said state health officials. “Many of these deaths are old as many districts are finding it difficult to feed mortality data in real time,” said Dr Avinash Supe, a member of the state government’s task force on Covid mortality. Supe reassured that the state’s weekly death rate is still around 1% and he expects the number of deaths to drop drastically in the next 10 days. “The number of ICU admissions is dropping, but there are still a significant number of patients who are critical and have been there for weeks. This could explain the ‘thick tail’ that Maharashtra has both in terms of cases and deaths,” said Supe. The state added 14,152 cases and 289 deaths on Friday, taking the total caseload to 58 lakh and the toll to 98,771, including the 1,088 ‘old’ deaths. In Mumbai, the daily caseload stayed under 1,000 for the fifth day in a row. While 968 cases were registered in Mumbai on Friday, the total caseload increased to 7.1 lakh since March 2020. The number of deaths in Mumbai dropped, with 24 deaths recorded on Friday. The toll since the pandemic began stands at 14,922 so far. On Friday, once again, Dharavi reported one Covid case. The total active cases now stand at 20 from the slum cluster. The test positivity rate in Mumbai dropped further to 3.5% with 27,351 tests conducted in a 24-hour period. The overall growth rate of Covid cases in Mumbai between May 28 and June 3 dropped to 0.13% and the doubling rate has increased to 515 days. Echoing Supe, state government officials said the number of critical patients has dropped significantly across the state and daily deaths will see a drop in the next few days. “There are a few districts like Satara, Kolhapur, Ratnagiri where cases are on the rise and they are being closely monitored and strict containment measures are being put in place,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-3427-past-deaths-added-to-toll-in-4-days-of-june-fatalities-to-fall-in-10-days-says-doc/articleshow/83251257.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Aaditya ends meetings as lobby false ceiling crashes at Sahyadri||A massive false ceiling along with a huge chandelier collapsed at Sahyadri guest house at Malabar Hill on Friday. No one was injured in the incident around 4pm in the lobby that leads from the entrance to meeting halls on the ground floor. The collapse created panic among staff and cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray, who was holding meetings in one room since afternoon, was advised to end them and leave the premises along with other officials, an official said. Officials said that a structural audit of the building was done three months ago. Senior PWD officials said that the false ceiling was fitted 25 years ago. “The portion that collapsed was an add-on structure, and was not part of the main RCC structure,” said a senior official. The incident has raised serious concern regarding safety of ministers and officials, who use the premises for official meetings regularly. On a normal day, the guest house is filled with people as many ministers use the halls to conduct meetings. But as it was the end of the week, and most ministers were in their constituencies, and also with Covid-19 physical meetings were limited, the area was not crowded. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-aaditya-ends-meetings-as-lobby-false-ceiling-crashes-at-sahyadri/articleshow/83249328.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi to create 36,000 Covid beds to tackle third wave||NEW DELHI: Delhi government will have 36,000 hospital beds for the exclusive use of Covid-19 patients before the expected new surge in infections. The city’s healthcare manpower will also be honed to handle the possible wave. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held meetings with the expert and preparation committees on Friday to review the arrangements that began immediately upon the current surge of Covid infections ebbing. Currently, Delhi has around 24,500 Covid beds, which is many times more what was available around the same time last year. Experts have suggested that despite the fall in daily Covid cases, development of medical infrastructure should not be allowed to de-escalate. “The experience of other countries teaches that we should be careful about the probable third Covid wave and make advance preparations. In the wake of it, CM Arvind Kejriwal held a meeting with an experts committee where many important issues were discussed,” the office of the CM tweeted. Kejriwal is likely to address a press conference on Saturday to share details of the preparations being made to meet a resurgence in the pandemic. In another tweet, the CM’s office said, “CM met the preparation committee after meeting the expert committee on the probable third Covid wave. The preparations have begun on all fronts be that oxygen management or ICU beds.” The preparation committee consists of bureaucrats and is headed by additional chief secretary Satya Gopal, while the expert committee comprises medical professionals and government officials. In the latest wave of infection, Delhi was shaken by a high toll and a massive hike in percentage of infection. The preparations for the third Covid wave, therefore, hold great significance. There is a need for the government to fine-tune the preparations because the resources are limited and it is within these limits that Delhi has to create the most efficient medical infrastructure that will support a maximum number of people in distress. A government source said separate presentations were made on the number of required beds, human resources, oxygen, Covid drugs and also on the status of vaccination coverage and how it can be augmented. Delhi has just recently weathered a killing shortage of oxygen and drugs. Kejriwal also listened to the presentation on the existing and ongoing preparations and experts gave inputs on how to check the spread of the coronavirus spread and bring down mortality. The state government is already halfway through its plan to ensure availability of medical oxygen to meet increased demands during a possible resurgence. It will have 57 PSA oxygen plants by August. It has garnered 9,700 oxygen cylinders from domestic sources and from China, while 4600 oxygen concentrators have already been procured and 3,300 more will be brought to Delhi by the end of this month.  The government is also creating a buffer stock of liquid medical oxygen and boosting paediatric infrastructure in case the third wave proves detrimental to children’s health. In Friday’s vaccination bulletin, AAP MLA Atishi said that over 55 lakh individuals have been given the Covid vaccine in Delhi, 12 lakh who have received both doses.  She, however, said that there was no Covaxin to give the 45+ their second dose or 18-44-year-olds their first. Covishield doses were available for those above 45 years. Atishi said, “5.9 lakh doses of Covishield are available for the 45+, enough for 28 days of vaccination. But there has been no vaccine for the youth in Delhi for 12 days.” Saying 50 lakh vaccines were needed and only 5 lakh sanctioned, the MLA urged the Centre to provide the required number of doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-to-create-36k-covid-beds-to-tackle-third-wave/articleshow/83246846.cms||AlokKNMishra

Environmentalist Somendra Mohan Ghosh, a regular at the lake, said that the green belt and waterbodies of Rabindra Sarobar are help them breathe fresh air. “Many senior citizens suffer from COPD, diabetes or hypertension and for them morning walk is highly beneficial in this eco-friendly zone. We are requesting the authorities to permit only three hours for the Sarobar to remain open from 5am to 8am for morning walk till the strict Covid restrictions are over. We assure that social distancing norms during our walk inside the Sarobar will be thoroughly maintained,” Ghosh said, adding, that the same request have also been sent addressing to the state chief secretary. Ghosh said that there were around 7,000 regular morning walkers at the Lake and almost half of them now took their walks on the main Southern Avenue. “Morning walkers will be benefited if the authorities allow at least a few hours for the Lake to open,” said Santanu Chatterjee, a regular morning walker. KMDA officials said that they are strictly following the instructions of the state government. “The Sarobar gates will be opened according to the instructions that we will receive from the government,” said a KMDA official. Last year, the Sarobar premises were opened gradually after the restrictions, with the authorities giving a three hour window for morning walkers to have their daily stroll. The sarobar was again fully closed from last month following the strict Covid restrictions that will continue till June 15 as of now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/morning-walkers-request-civic-body-to-open-rabindra-sarobar-gates-for-3-hours/articleshow/83244737.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No tech to ascertain which variant will trigger new wave, says scientist||Mumbai: From February onwards, B.1.617 spread rapidly, with five-digit cases reported from Mumbai and Delhi every day. B.1.617 was initially called the Indian variant until the WHO promoted an unbiased nomenclature, naming its sub-lineages 1 and 2 are named as Kappa and Delta, respectively. In December, no scientist in the country or the world (as genetic sequences are shared by most scientists in open source format in real time) could predict that Delta would emerge as the variant of concern that managed to infect vaccinated peop-le. “The emergence of Delta proves that we need to study the virus closely...Before planning for the third wave or looking for ot-her variants, we need to understand what made Delta more tr-ansmissible,” Dr Anurag Agrawal, director of IGIB, told TOI. On Friday, a pre-print study by scientists of India’s INSACOG consortium of labs said th-at “surge of SARS-CoV2 infections in Delhi is best explained by the introduction of a highly transmissible VOC, B.1.617.2, with likely immune-evasion pr-operties; insufficient neutralizing immunity, despite high ser-opositivity; and social behavior that promoted transmission’’. In January, it was believed that the ‘UK variant’ B.1.1.7 was the most common variant in circulation in Delhi. “This was followed by seeding of the B.1.617 VOC, which too is highly transmissible, with rapid expansion of B.1.617.2 sub-lineage outpacing all other lineages. This unprecedented growth of cases occurred in the background of high seropositivity,” said the study. Dr Agrawal said at present there is no technology to ascertain which mutation or variant would trigger a new wave. “Analytics and genome sequencing will only take you so far. Sequencing cannot figure out what the emergence of a new variant means. We can only tie it to an outbreak later. We are in that sense always behind the curve. Hence, we need to learn more about the virus so that we can sequence better and forecast better.” There is a need to develop more tests, plan more sequencing and adopt promising new technologies, including low-cost CRISPR diagnostics for places with limited resources, said the scientist. Dr Nerges Mistry of Foundation for Medical Research, which has sequenced B.1.617 variants, said there is an urgent need to scale up genomic sequencing. Dr Kayzad Nilgiriwala said sequencing is low in India as compared to European nations such as the UK and Denmark which sequence about 5% of the positive samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-tech-to-ascertain-which-variant-will-trigger-new-wave-says-scientist/articleshow/83246746.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand Congress demands universal free vaccination policy, writes to President||RANCHI: Congress’s Jharkhand unit on Friday sought President Ram Nath Kovind's intervention in setting up a universal free vaccination policy in the country. State finance minister Rameshwar Oraon and rural development minister Alamgir Alam sought an audience with Jharkhand governor Droupadi Murmi at Raj Bhavan on Friday morning and handed her a memorandum addressed to Kovind in this regard. On behalf of the party, JPCC president Oraon and legislative party leader Alam criticised the different prices of the Covishield and Covaxin and said the current scheme of things was slowing down the inoculation drive across the country. “The Union government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has created a digital divide which has slowed down the vaccination drive. Various price slabs were made for the vaccines so that the common people can be robbed off their money during the time of such a disaster," the memorandum alleged. The ministers accused the Centre of ordering just 39 crore vaccine doses so far for the country's 140 crore population. "At present, India is vaccinating close to 16 lakh people each day. At this pace, it will take three years to vaccinate the entire population and we will not be able to tackle a possible third wave," the ministers wrote. Oraon and Alam also criticized the Centre for placing delayed orders with the vaccine makers. “While other nations started placing orders in August last year, the Centre placed its first order of vaccines in January this year,” the memorandum read. Congress also claimed that only 3.17% (4.45 crore) of the country’s population have been given both the doses. “While Covishield is priced at Rs 150 for the Centre, Rs 300 for the states and Rs 600 for private hospitals. Covaxin is charging Rs 150 from the Center, Rs 600 from the states and Rs 1,200 from private hospitals. Each dose is being priced at Rs 1,500 at private hospitals. This disparity in pricing is nothing but a way to maximize the profits,” the party claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-demands-universal-free-vax-policy-writes-to-president/articleshow/83244845.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: IMA serves legal notice to Ramdev||RANCHI: The Indian Medical Association (IMA)’s Jharkhand chapter on Friday sent a legal notice to yoga guru Ramdev for his remarks against allopathy and “defaming” modern medical practitioners. The notice said Ramdev has created confusion over the efficacy of vaccines among patients and public in large. In a strongly worded letter sent through its lawyer Bed Prakash, the state chapter of IMA demanded an unconditional public apology from Ramdev within 14 days, failing which all possible legal remedies will be explored against him. Talking to TOI, state IMA secretary Dr Pradeep Kumar Singh said: “We had convened a state executive meeting four days ago in which it was unanimously decided to send a legal notice to Ramdev, who has not only discredited modern medicine but has also made a mockery of doctors who laid their lives in the line of duty.” Singh said Ramdev has been making derogatory statements against allopathy and saying that lakhs of Covid patients died due to wrong lines of treatment. According to the legal notice, Ramdev in videos has been heard discrediting allopathic medication part of the treatment protocol issued by the Union health ministry. There are also audio clips of him questioning the efficacy of the vaccines. Singh said Ramdev’s statement has contributed to vaccine hesitancy and that is in direct conflict with the health ministry’s programme. “The whole world’s focus is on inoculating their population as fast as possible to protect them from the virus. If someone of Ramdev’s stature makes such comments, it not only hurts the vaccination drive but it also the families of those who lost their lives serving patients,” said Dr Shambhu Prasad, President, IMA Ranchi chapter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-ima-serves-legal-notice-to-ramdev/articleshow/83244539.cms||Gaurav Pandey

When commissioned, it will be a one-of-its-kind solar power generation plant in the state. The cabinet gave a post facto approval to the state health department’s proposal to provide an additional monthly honorarium to doctors, nurses and health workers who are involved in Covid-19 duty. Contrary to expectations, however, the cabinet did not take up the proposal to notify Mucormycosis as an epidemic disease. The cabinet also approved the state energy department’s proposal for a one-time settlement of the outstanding power bills of Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited’s (JBVNL) domestic customers in rural areas. The approval of the proposal will now allow the rural users to pay their outstanding electricity bills in four monthly instalments. However, they will be exempted from paying the delayed payment surcharge (DPS). In another decision, the ministerial council approved the state department of school education and literacy’s proposal to raise the monthly remuneration of cooks and sahayikas involved with the Centre’s mid-day meal programme at the state-run schools to Rs 2,000. Earlier, the cooks and sahayikas were paid a monthly remuneration of Rs 1,500. The ministerial council also approved a proposal to levy a token stamp duty of Re 1 from street vendors who intend to avail affordable loans under the Centre’s PM-Svanidhi Scheme. The cabinet approved the state excise department’s proposal which will allow private players in stocking and wholesale of licensed country liquor, IMFL, imported liquor, wine and beer alongside the state-owned and operated Jharkhand State Beverage Corporation Limited (JSBCL). JSBCL was into stocking and wholesale of liquor since its formation in 2010.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-cabinet-approves-floating-solar-panel-in-getalsud-reservoir/articleshow/83244423.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand's Tana Bhagats manage to stay protected even during 2nd wave||RANCHI/GUMLA: Tana Bhagats — a small but distinct tribal community in Jharkhand — is potentially a subject matter of in-depth study for their ability to remain largely protected from the wrath of Coronavirus once again during the second wave, barring very few cases. Though no separate study has been conducted by any government agency, leaders within the sect claim none have been infected till date. One among the five state members of the Tana Bhagat Development Authority, Sarita Tana Bhagat of Lohardaga, members of the community remain in touch with each other for socio-political reasons. “Till date, we have no information about any member being infected,” she said. Another state member of the authority, Ganga Tana Bhagat, an ex-MLA, corroborated her claim. “I am 82-years-old and have been moving around to attend meetings and know whereabouts of community members but I have not been sick till date,” he said. Tana Bhagats are followers of Gandhian principles and the sect was set up in 1914 by Jatra Tana Bhagat, a resident of Chingri village of Bishunpur block of Gumla district, to take part in the freedom movement. Hundreds of people joined the movement. Tana Bhagats worship the Tricolour every day and believe in non-violence. The members, originally hailing from the Oraon, tribe are pure vegetarians and do not consume liquor and eat only self-cooked food. They don’t eat or drink water at restaurants, wear only white clothes and wash them daily. In-charge of primary health centre in Bishunpur, Dr Asutosh Singh said the Covid care centre at the PHC treated about 100 patients during the second wave. “We also extended medical help to a few families in home isolation but none among them were from the Tana Bhagat community,” he said. Bishunpur block in Gumla has the highest concentration of Tana Bhagats in the state. Gumla civil surgeon Vijaya Bhengra also admitted that he has not witnessed any Covid case among Tana Bhagats. “We have conducted a survey, report of which is likely to be compiled within a couple of days but prima facie we have not seen any case of infection among them,” she said. Although safe from the virus, the community is not averse to vaccination. Sarita said most of the members have received at least the first dose of the vaccine by now. “We all know that the virus has not invaded our community but instead of taking a chance, we are following government guidelines and taking vaccine,” she said. On Friday, a meeting was held at Senha Panchayat of Lohardaga district in which as many as 30 Tana Bhagat families had gathered. Sarita said barring one or two members, everyone who attended the meeting had taken their first dose. She gives credit to the “obedient” nature of the community members towards adhering to whatever is told by the government. “We have also conducted awareness drives within the community members,” she said, underlining that simple living, high standards of hygiene, vegetarian food habits and social distancing is cardinal to the Tana Bhagat lifestyle. Lately, a few instances of illnesses and fatality within the community are triggering fear about the vaccine though. The community, which boasts of being protected against the virus, witnessed a few cases of illness, allegedly after vaccination. “Our block president of Lapung, Mangra Tana Bhagat (65) took the shot and fell ill and weak. Although he tested negative for the virus, while at home, he had to be admitted to Rims where he tested positive after 8-10 days and later died,” said Ganga. Another similar incident was reported in Kairo block of Lohardaga district where Madan Tana Bhagat (55) had to be admitted to the hospital after he fell ill, coincidently after taking the first dose of vaccine. “He tested negative for Covid but his complications of malaria and typhoid aggravated,” said Sarita. Phupendra Tana Bhagat, a member of Gau Rakshini Thakurbari Vanvas Patrakot, a social outfit of the community, said Kartik Tana Bhagat, working with a private firm in Jamshedpur, died of Covid mid-May. “Though he was a Tana Bhagat, he had given up our traditional way of living and had adopted urban culture,” he said. Another community member Bali Tana Bhagat, who retired from CCL also succumbed to Covid-19 almost 15 days ago but community members believe that he too had embraced the city lifestyle because of his work environment. Ganga says immunity levels of Tana Bhagats should be scientifically studied to see if it can be of help for the rest of society. “I had personally appealed to Ranchi deputy commissioner to conduct a targeted survey of prevalence of the virus or its anti-bodies among community members. Once established through a survey, some good practices can be replicated by others too,” he added. As of date, the eight districts in which 21,783 members of the 3,481 Tana Bhagat families reside, the number of active cases is still high. While Ranchi has the maximum 1,993 active cases (total 84,687), Gumla has 369 active cases (total 9,547) and Lohargada has 176 active cases (total 6,552). They have substantial population in Chatra, Simdega and Latehar whereas a few families reside in Khunti and Palamu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tana-bhagats-manage-to-stay-protected-even-during-2nd-wave/articleshow/83244806.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Doctors at the zoo have sent nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples of Shiva (a 10-year-old male) for RT-PCR tests to Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, to confirm if he was infected with coronavirus. Shiva, one of the 10 tigers at the zoo, had developed fever on May 31. “Though the fever subsided, he had lost appetite over the course of the next two days. He did not eat at all on Thursday and died later in the night," Dr OP Sahu, the zoo vet, told TOI. The zoo management procured rapid antigen kits from a medical store in Ranchi and screened the dead big cat. "The RAT returned a negative result, but we decided to send his samples to Indian Veterinary Research Institute laboratory in Bareilly for confirmatory tests and histopathological examinations," Sahu said. The park management has sent the tiger's corpse to the Ranchi Veterinary College for an autopsy, where preliminary reports suggested that Shiva died of liver and kidney failure. The Central Zoo Authority guidelines mandate all zoos in the country conduct autopsies of all their dead animals. The zoo authorities claimed all the remaining tigers -- six female and three male -- have been put under observation and their enclosures are being sanitized. Though the zoo is closed for visitors, sources said four zookeepers have tested positive for Covid recently and are in home isolation. "However, none of them were working at the tiger enclosures when they were tested,” an official said. Brought from Karnataka's Banerghatta Biological Park in November 2014, Shiva was reluctant to mate with the two tigresses Laxmi and Durga despite best efforts of the zookeepers and the doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tiger-with-fever-dies-at-ranchi-zoo-samples-sent-for-cov-test/articleshow/83244485.cms||Dhritiman Ray

State Congress president Girish Chodankar said that the petition was filed earlier in the week. “The disqualification order has already been challenged before the high court last week,” Chodankar told reporters. More than 18 months after Congress and MGP filed disqualification petitions seeking the disqualification of 12 MLAs who switched over from Congress and MGP to BJP, Patnekar dismissed the petitions. The speaker said that there was no merit in the claims raised by either the Congres or MGP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/disqualification-plea-congress-moves-high-court/articleshow/83246788.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, police are trying to ascertain whether the metal was imported or the miscreants have used a counterfeit stamp. Meanwhile, based on the revelations made by the arrested accused, the district police on Friday started conducting raids to nab the other criminals involved in the smuggling of uranium. Sources said that police have got a lead about smugglers based in Giridih and in the Purulia district of West Bengal. Police will send the samples of the seized uranium to the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) for testing. Bokaro SP Chandan Kumar Jha said: “We are sending the uranium to UCIL, Jaduguda. Meanwhile, we are also trying to nab the other members of the gang.” A special police team on Thursday had arrested seven persons and seized six kilograms of uranium from different locations in the district. Jharkhand is among the few states in the country that have uranium mines. The UCIL also has a uranium processing plant at Jaduguda, about 150 km from Bokaro Steel city. Police are yet to find out how the accused got hold of the uranium packets and where the consignment was headed to. There are also lots of other missing links in the uranium seizure case. Incidentally, a kilogram of uranium costs nearly Rs 3 crore. Sources said that the test report from UCIL will confirm the grade of the seized uranium. They added that there was a possibility that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) would take over the case, as it happened in Maharashtra where two persons were caught with seven kilograms of uranium on May 5. When asked about the speculation of NIA taking over the case, the SP said: “We are conducting our investigation, if the NIA is interested, we will hand over the case to them.” Meanwhile, Pakistan has demanded a thorough investigation into the reports of illegal uranium trade in India after the Bokaro incident was highlighted in the media. “Pakistan is deeply concerned at yet another incident of attempted illegal sale of 6 kg of #Uranium in #India. Such incidents point to lax controls, poor regulatory & enforcement mechanisms, & existence of a black market for nuclear materials in India,” tweeted Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/uranium-packets-seized-from-bokaro-have-made-in-usa-stamp/articleshow/83244409.cms||Divy Khare

A social media campaign he had initiated in 2018 flooded him with nearly five lakh pens, of which over 90% have been refilled and distributed to students. Dumped pens as they cause considerable damage to the land and water both. While those made from plastic are non-biodegradable, the ink, lead and other chemicals percolate into the soil and underground water. “One day, while searching for something in my office, I was startled to see 118 used pens dumped in a corner. So, I decided to refill and distribute them among the needy students. I also put up a message on social media asking people to send me used and unused pens from their homes and offices,” the physician told TOI. In the last three years, Dr Doshi has received 4.88 lakh such pens out of which he distributed 4.68 lakh to school children in Gujarat, Mumbai, Nagpur, Pune, Bengaluru, Nashik, Udaipur, Delhi. The campaign gathered such steam that he started receiving parcels of pens from Washington, Virginia and Australia too. As he started getting thousands of pens daily, students of scout joined him in the tedious process of refilling the pens and dispatching them to various schools. Teachers there took up the responsibility of distribution. The cost of a refill is almost the same as a new pen and that’s why people prefer to buy a new one rather than refill. But a Mumbai-based company, which got to know about this campaign, volunteered to provide him with master refills that can be used in any pen for just 40 paisa each. A voluntary organization - Shishu Vihar - also lent its helping hand by finding needy schools and students as well as manpower to refill the pens. Ajay Bhatt, who runs scout activity said, “Sixty students have joined the activity of refilling the used pens. We call the students in the group of 20 to 30 at some school and they prepare a bunch of 50 and 100 pens ready to use.” In fact, a pen making company in Mumbai which had closed its business for a long time approached Dr Doshi and provided him 25,000 unused pens in their factory. Environment activist, Mahesh Pandya, said, “The ball pens which we dump has leads to pollution because they are make of plastic. The ink also contains some toxic chemicals. The more pens we throw, the more we have to produce and the cycle goes on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/dumped-pens-write-green-chapter/articleshow/83246600.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Vijayawada||CM launches Amul ops in West Godavari dist||Vijayawada: The state government has extended the operations of Gujarat-based milk producers’ cooperative, Amul, in the state. Amul will begin milk collection in West Godavari district. It was launched in the state in December 2020 with operations in Kadapa, Chittoor and Prakasam districts. Amul later extended to Guntur district. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy virtually launched Amul in West Godavari on Friday, from his Tadepalli camp office. With its extension to West Godavari, Amul is dealing with 13,000 women farmers collecting 52.93 lakh litres of milk per day. Amul acquires milk from these dairy farmers through milk collection centres, the quality of milk is tested in front of the farmers, and they are provided with a slip on the spot, this slip shows the grade of the milk and how much it will cost, this helps eliminate any discrepancies in payments to the farmers. The milk is collected and stored through the assistance of bulk milk cooling units (BMCU) and automatic milk collection units (AMCU). The AP government is placing these AMCUs at all milk collection centres at an estimated cost of Rs 218.99 crore. Similarly, BMCUs are being positioned at 9,899 villages, costing about Rs 1088.89 crore. After launching Amul in West Godavari district, the chief minister interacted with milk producers, particularly women, who were given buffaloes under various government schemes. He said that Amul tests the milk at the farmers’ doorsteps and gives them machine-generated slip on the quality and the price. He said that after the Amul’s entry, the milk producers in the state were getting more than Rs 5 per litre than what they were paid earlier. He further said that the government was planning to extend Amul’s reach to 9,899 villages in the next two years. Amul managing director R S Sodhi, who was also present on the occasion, said that AP stands fourth in the country in milk production. “The chief minister had recognised the potential in the dairy and agriculture industry especially in rural areas and is doing the needful to ensure that the farmers in the state flourish,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-launches-amul-ops-in-west-godavari-dist/articleshow/83242858.cms||Gopi Dara

Initiated by the Conference of Catholic Bishops of India’s (CCBI) commission for ecology, the movement will be unveiled on Saturday by CCBI president Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao. The launch will coincide with the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the commission’s chairperson Bishop Allwyn D’Silva said. The commission will hold an open discussion at the launch and develop a roadmap for the next six months. D’Silva said the movement is inspired by the launch of the Laudato Si Action platform last month where Pope Francis highlighted the need for a new ecological approach: an integral human ecology…that becomes capable of listening to the cry of the poor and of being a leaven for a new society. A steering committee with gender and geographic representation will animate the movement. It will involve people of all faiths and will engage with different sectors including the medical fraternity, business, economists and media persons. “Right now we only have a central commission. Each diocese will be starting commissions for ecology too. Soon our archdiocese will have a branch of the ecology commission in Goa,” Chicalim parish priest Fr Bolmax Pereira told TOI. At launch of the movement on Saturday, D’Silva will set out its objectives, while Ferrao will deliver the inaugural address.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/church-to-set-up-prithvi-parivar-eco-movement/articleshow/83247055.cms||---

Lockdown restrictions in the city have forced consular offices to remain shut or operate with limited staff, thereby slowing down the visa issuance process. Students, especially the ones aspiring to fly to the US, are anxious that they will not make it to their universities on time. Many of these students had already deferred their admissions by a year. A parent from south Mumbai said that the US student visas (F1) fall under the emergency visa category. Students can book the earliest date available for their visa and then use the emergency appointment to move up the slot. “But most students are unable to get the first appointment date,” said the parent.

---||Goa||Netravali’s Myristica swamp forests await protection||Keri: Few people in Goa, even among naturalists, are aware that the Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary at Sanguem is home to three areas with the unique Myristica swamp forest ecosystem. Myristica swamps are rare and primeval ecosystems, with an age of 140 million years, and are rich in biodiversity. They are characterised by their roots, which can withstand perennially water-logged conditions. The Western Ghats of Southern India are known for Myristica swamps, which play a pivotal role in maintaining the perennial water flow of streams and possess higher potential to store carbon. First reported in 1960 from the Travancore region of Kerala, Myristica swamps are a relic tropical ecosystem. Netravali Sanctuary range forest officer Prakash Salelkar spotted these forests at Vaghaped and Suryagal in Bhati. “The Myristica swamp forest of Vaghaped is spread across one hectare area, whereas in Suryagal it covers an area of around 500 sqm. The trees of the swamps can potentially hold water year-round and help in quenching the thirst of wild animals during the summer,” Salelkar told TOI. Biologists who have studied this ecosystem want the swamp forests to be accorded protection as they retain water of the monsoonal rain and then gradually release it to the streams during the lean season. Sanket Naik, a naturalist who visited these swamps, said, “The ability of the swamp forests to sequester carbon helps in minimising the threat posed by global warming.” Besides, Bhati, on the way to the Savari waterfalls there lies a small patch of the Myristica swamp forests. However, presently, this is highly vulnerable to human exploitation as the waterfall is frequented by crowds. With World Environment Day, June 5, being dedicated to the theme ‘ecosystem restoration’ this year, the role of Myristica swamp forests gain special importance.  When TOI contacted Netravali RFO Bipin Phaldessai, he said, “Though no scientific study has been conducted on these ecosystems, I am aware about the ecological role of these forests. As work of compiling a management plan for the sanctuary is currently on, we have included them in the compilation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/netravalis-myristica-swamp-forests-await-protection/articleshow/83247151.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

The move has brought relief to 726 persons who were named in these cases, a public relations department official said. After coming to power in December 2018, CM Bhupesh Baghel decided to review police cases against tribal people in insurgency-hit areas, particularly Bastar, so that innocent persons do not face harassment, he said. A seven-member review committee headed by Justice (retd) A K Patnaik was constituted for this purpose in March 2019. District officials and the police were also asked to examine such cases against tribals, the official said. The review was part of the state’s three-pronged strategy of building ‘trust, development and security’ to bring development to tribal areas and free them of Leftwing extremism, he said. The Patnaik committee recommended withdrawal of as many as 627 cases, of which 594 were withdrawn from courts as of May 31 this year, giving relief to 726 persons, the official said. Other cases are still pending in court for withdrawal. The police department too identified 365 cases against tribals for speedy trial. As many as 124 such cases were disposed of by courts and 218 accused persons were acquitted, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chhattisgarh-drops-594-cases-against-tribals-in-maoist-hit-areas/articleshow/83251202.cms||---

Rama Rao was born at Murapaka village of Laveru mandal in Srikakulam district on November, 1924. A writer and a school teacher, Rama Rao’s stories dealt with the complexity of human emotions within rural spaces. Rao rose to prominence in 1964 for his story ‘Yagnam’— where the protagonist kills his young son to finish an endless cycle of debt. In 1997, Rama Rao set up a unique library called ‘Kathanilayam’, a place where one can find nearly every single Telugu short story published since 1930. As a policy, the library has no fee. Kathanilayam has served as an immense resource for scholars and teachers of Telugu literature for decades. The library has over 450 anthologies, 2,600 collections and books on critical appraisals of short stories and writers. The Telugu Academy published ‘Katha Kosam’ in 2005, providing details of over 2,000 writers with the support of Katha Nilayam. Upon his demise, several poets and writers recalled the contributions of Kara Master to Telugu literature. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy expressed grief at the passing away of the veteran author. "He was one of the literary luminaries of north Andhra," the chief minister said and conveyed his condolences to the bereaved family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/writer-kathanilayam-founder-kara-master-no-more/articleshow/83243138.cms||Nalla.Babu

In a bid to turn the tide, zoo officials have come up with an idea to raise money for the zoo through adoption and outreach programmes. Just like other zoos across the country, the IGZP was closed a few weeks ago. Before this, the zoo was closed for four months from March during the first wave of the pandemic. Summer, April through June, is the peak season for zoos and IGZP lost out on all the revenue to be earned from tickets during this period. Last year, the zoo incurred a loss of around Rs 4 crore, and this year too, losses only seem to mount. According to zoo curator Nandani Salaria, the zoo mainly depends on tickets for revenue. “Which is not there in lockdown period(s), so it definitely makes it challenging for the zoo management as we are left with limited funds which are mostly used for feeding animals, maintaining their enclosures and payment of staff salaries. Any improvements in the zoo depends on funds available.” “For animal lovers, this is the best time to exhibit their love. We also have many privileges for them when they become adopters. Adoption does not necessarily mean that you have to donate large amounts of money, it can be a few hundreds, thousands or lakhs, whatever you think is right,” says Salaria. In a bid to encourage children to take up adoption, the zoo also allows adoption for one or two days. Spread across 625 acres of natural forest, IGZP is Asia’s only zoo that boundaries the Bay of Bengal. "Wild animals are struggling across the world because of habitat destruction and illegal poaching. We realised during this pandemic that protecting and conserving our environment is our responsibility. It’s time we realise that wildlife needs to be protected, conserved and given its space," Salaria said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-zoo-puts-animals-up-for-adoption-to-raise-funds/articleshow/83243164.cms||Nalla.Babu

Roughly, there has been a 37% decline in the GST collection of Madhya Pradesh in the month of April, when lockdown was imposed from the middle of the month. State’s other sources of revenue including income from liquor sales and petrol and diesel also dried up during the lockdown. While the liquor shops were completely shut down, petrol diesel sales went down by about 30% compared to the previous month. The GST collection including, the cess dropped from Rs 3,050 crore in March to Rs 1,928 crore in April. “This is a consumption based tax and as all the trades– shops, cinema halls, hotels, restaurant and tourism activities- were shut, there was hardly any consumption leading to the decline in tax collection,” state finance department sources said. “However, during the same period consumption of medicines and hospital-related services was on the rise because of pandemic,” sources said. Government sources also said that there was a major dent in the revenue accrued to the state as settlement of the State GST (SGST) and the Integrated GST (IGST) of the state.

While Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh each recorded a drop of 36% from April to May, Uttar Pradesh came third with 31% and Gujarat fourth with 17%. Gujarat had recorded 2.73 lakh Covid cases in April – the highest ever monthly cases in the pandemic with an average daily 9,131 positive patients recorded. In comparison, May started showing the signs of slowdown with 2.27 lakh cases at the average of 7,340 daily cases. On April 30, Gujarat had recorded its highest daily tally of 14,605. Likewise, the state also recorded a major drop in its active cases – the number rose eleven-fold from 12,996 on April 1 to 1.45 lakh on May 1. ‘Virus wave receded sharply’ In a month’s time, the number dropped by 88% at 29,015 on June 1. As of June 4 evening, the state had 22,110 active cases, the lowest in 56 days. “Out of 15 states with the highest active cases, ten have shown a downward trend whereas five are still showing an upward trend. Gujarat is 15th among Indian states when it comes to active cases. If one looks at the graph of the second wave, it rose and fell with almost equal sharpness. Only a few other states have shown the similar trend,” said a city-based epidemiologist. In terms of deaths, the month of April had recorded 2,664 deaths of Covid positive patients. In comparison, May recorded only a slight drop at 2,650 – increasing the mortality rate from 1% to 1.2%. Experts pointed out that the second wave has major learning for the state. They pointed out that the share of areas outside of major cities got one of the highest in both cases and deaths. “The rural areas hold the key in deciding the scope of the third wave – there must be aggressive testing and vaccination in rural areas to ensure that the cases are found early,” said a public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-reduces-active-covid-cases-by-88-within-a-month/articleshow/83251238.cms||Parth Shastri

Thick dense forest covered the hilly terrains surrounding his house, while Periyar – the southern state’s longest river – cut across his village. But the green couldn’t charm him much then, as did the glitter of high-rise buildings in the cities. That fascination, however, faded when father Jolly Nadukudiyal stepped into the concrete jungle. “Initially, when I came to Gujarat, I was amazed by the number of multi-storied buildings and tar roads which I had not seen in my village. But soon, I realised that it is very important to plant trees. As time passed, I realised the urgency of doing something for the environment as it is the only way we can have sufficient oxygen,” father Jolly told TOI. Twenty years to that, he has single-handedly converted a barren stretch spread across 40 acres into a mini forest where more than 70,000 trees, mostly medicinal ones, have been planted. The centre that he runs also has made four artificial lakes, long stretches of inroads with canopy, which form the boundary of the green environs near the crossroads of Waghodiya highway in Vadodara. “In 2001, there was nothing but ‘gando bawal’ here. They were 40 to 45 years thick. The first big challenge was to pull them out which was done with JCB machines and clear the land,” said the founder of Xavier centre for eco harmony. The centre also houses a small school – Xavier Green School – for education of children of migrant workers. The centre has rainwater harvesting sheds. “Since, the underground water in this area was saline, I started creating this artificial lakes that collect rainwater during monsoon. We use this water for drinking purpose at the school and also watering the plants and trees throughout the year,” he said. The centre has around 160 species of trees including neem, arjun, jambu, chiko, rose wood, papaya among others. “Jambu trees alone cover nearly 10 acre land. And we have plenty of Krishna Tulsi as well,” said father, adding, “I am not looking at commercial value. Every tree, every leaf, has a medicinal value. It is just that we don’t know all of them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/40-acre-jungle-in-city-sings-for-hes-a-jolly-good-fellow/articleshow/83246343.cms||Prashant Rupera

The town municipality had taken up the project of laying the line under a special scheme of the gover nment. Manjunath, 29, Rajesh, 40 and Manjunath, 32 — all residents of Kamalanagar in Basaveshwaranagar, Bengaluru — were brought to the site by contractor Harish Kumar around 8am. “No safety gear was provided to the workers. Harish was so negligent that he assigned the responsibilities to his assistant and left. Usually, a lamp is placed at the bottom of the manhole to ascertain the oxygen level. Even that procedure was not followed here,” police said. “Before the fire and emergency officials could arrive at the spot, they died,” police said.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu government in favour of phased relaxation of curbs||CHENNAI: After a two-week long intense lockdown in the state to bring the surge in Covid-19 cases under control, the Tamil Nadu government is mulling over phased unlocking, with measured relaxations. The state is considering the suggestions of health experts that relaxations could be introduced in the districts that have brought the pandemic under control. Chief minister M K Stalin on Friday held a meeting with bureaucrats to take stock of the prevailing situation. As of now, only those shops selling essential commodities are allowed to function. “District-wise analysis was done on the total positivity rate and the availability of health infrastructure to handle the situation. Health and revenue departments are jointly working on the relaxations and a call will be taken on Friday night and an announcement will be made on Saturday morning,” said a top official. The government also took note of Chennai's sharp declining trend from 7,564 daily cases on May 12 to 1,971 on June 4 after a series of intense interventions by the administrative machinery, including adequate supply of oxygen. The availability of oxygen beds also increased considerably across the state. While the active cases have fallen to 2.68 lakh as of Friday, the high number of cases in Coimbatore, Chennai, Tiruppur, Erode, Madurai, Trichy, and Salem remain a cause of concern. “Most of the districts have reached a peak and have started to decline while some have reached the peak only in the recent days and the declining rate is not as fast as we expected. Each district or region behaves in a certain way. Not all are uniform. We are looking at various factors before taking a call,” a senior official said, hinting at the possibility of grouping of districts that behave in a similar pattern. The state witnessed its highest number of active cases (3.13 lakh) on May 27, keeping the administration on toes resulting in intense lockdown being extended for a week ending June 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-government-in-favour-of-phased-relaxation-of-curbs/articleshow/83251319.cms||Julie Mariappan

While for the first time farmers in Punjab have received more than Rs 26,000 crore in their accounts directly, Rs 16,700 crore has been transferred to farmers’ accounts in Haryana. Punjab and Haryana are the last two states to implement direct cash transfer of the minimum support price and with this now the online payment system has become universal across the country. The government has termed it “One Nation, One MSP, One DBT”. According to food ministry, about 44.4 lakh farmers have benefitted from the RMS procurement operations with MSP value of nearly Rs 81,200 crore. “It takes two to three days to transfer the amount to farmers’ account since there are so many transactions in a day. The amount released or paid is reconciled within a couple of days,” said an official. The government has also revised the current wheat procurement target to 433 lakh tonnes, an increase of six lakh tonnes, as almost every state is reporting highest ever procurement.

---||Nagpur||Tree cutting is injurious to health||In school, we were taught the critical importance of trees for the physical and mental health of everyone. Climate scientists taught us that trees should not be destroyed for the sake of development as they can solve some of the world’s thorniest problems. Why is it then that our policymakers are continuously underestimating the power of trees and treating them as disposable? Trees transplanted for the sake of ‘modernization’ are not growing any faster but definitely dying younger. On World Environment Day, top doctors of the city remind ‘those in power to save lives’ how killing thousands of age-old trees at Ajni will eventually lead to severe respiratory ailments, mental health disorders and various other health issues. Ironically, the policymakers who are manufacturing and buying artificial oxygen in this pandemic are mass killing natural oxygen generators with disdainNagpur: While the government plans to go ahead with its ambitious project of building an inter-modal station (IMS) at Ajni, top doctors in the city have come forward to warn that such large-scale destruction of green cover will be a death knell for public health. As is being reported by TOI, thousands of age-old trees planted during the British era are facing axe for the IMS project. For phase-1, over 5,000 trees will be chopped off. The lush green area, one of the few remaining green patches in the city, is a thriving biodiversity habitat. According to medical experts, such kind of deforestation will lead to health-endangering pollution in the city. Interventional pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat says, “Trees have the ability to take in carbon dioxide and generate oxygen, fairly opposite to what the human body does. The presence of trees gives us the advantage of having more oxygen in our surroundings. Also, when it comes to particulate matter, the presence of trees leads to accumulation of dust around them and they act like air-filters, thus controlling air pollution.” The recent Covid-19 pandemic has exposed a lot of chinks in our armour when it comes to development and growth, the doctor adds. “India as a country talks about development in terms of road transport, communications sector, economic growth etc but where we failed miserably was healthcare. The fact that the entire country was gasping for oxygen shows our apathy towards basic resources. This was a wake-up call on the importance of oxygen. Since we are short on artificial sources of oxygen, cutting down the natural sources is nothing but a big joke,” says Dr Arbat. Pulmonologist and director of Respira Chest and Critical Care Hospital, Dr Vikrant Deshmukh, warns that cutting thousands of trees at Ajni will affect the air quality and will lead to a rise in lung-related problems. “The number of trees that needs to be sacrificed is huge. Rather than unilateral planning, policymakers need to involve citizens and environmental groups,” he says. Chopping off an urban forest will lead to an exponential rise in various non-communicable diseases, says Dr Jerryl Banait. “Ailments like hypertension, diabetes, asthma and other pulmonary diseases have been on a drastic rise. This is due to changes in lifestyle, which is directly linked with environmental degradation. Pulmonary infections are on the higher side at places having less green cover as the air pollution levels are high,” explains the young doctor who is also an environment activist. Apart from respiratory issues, cutting trees at Ajni may lead to other health problems too. Dr Banait further says, “It will cause a decline in groundwater table which will further bring up diseases like fluorosis. Also, trees are biodiversity in itself as they are home to not just birds and insects but also microbes. These microorganisms feed on the dead flesh. If trees are cut, the microbes will stop functioning which will be a starting point for severe diseases.” For Dr Anup Marar, convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA), it was catastrophic to hear about the forthcoming mass removal of “over 30,000 lungs and kidneys of our city”. Calling it a sheer carnage, Dr Marar says, “Trees are recognized as lungs because they exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the atmosphere. But, trees are also kidneys as they regulate the flow and use of water by intercepting rain and releasing it slowly to the ground, which is then absorbed by plants for use in photosynthesis.” Dr Marar adds that it is ironical of policymakers to buy artificial oxygen concentrators and promote bulk construction of oxygen plants but gleefully join hands for this mass killing of the biggest natural source of oxygen. Just like doctors, the policymakers should weigh risk and benefits of a project before coming to any decision, suggests consultant pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar. Recently, Dr Swarnakar, who heads Get Well Hospital, had appealed to all the Covid-19 recovered patients to plant 10 trees to give the oxygen back to nature. “A least now we should realize the importance of oxygen. Bringing up this project in Ajni will lead to major air and sound pollution. Is the project need-based? It is a big threat to age-old greenery and the planning authorities need to consider this,” adds the secretary of the Indian Chest Society. In the opinion of Dr Sushrut Babhulkar, director of Sushrut Hospital, trees more than 75 years should be declared as national heritage and permission to cut or translocate them shouldn’t be given. “Cutting these trees will adversely affect the senior citizens whose lung capacity has naturally reduced with age. Due to lack of fresh air there is bound to be a steep increase in respiratory disorder,” he says. Highlighting the public health benefits, Dr Babhulkar says, “Approximately, 7-8 trees produce oxygen required for one person. Trees like Banyan and Neem give large amount of oxygen due to their vast foliage. Development projects should be planned in a manner so as to cut minimal trees as possible.” Not just respiratory problems, air pollution also has effects on the brain. “The Global Burden of Disease study, carried out by an international team using data from 188 countries, found that up to 30% of the stroke cases in the world are due to pollutants in the air. In addition to stroke, initial findings suggest it could play a role in autism, attention deficit disorders and memory impairment in children, dementia and the development of Parkinson’s disease in adults,” says Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram, President of Tropical Neurology and member of Environmental Neurology group of World federation of neurology. DOCTORS’ VOICES* Large-scale destruction of green cover at Ajni is a big threat for public health * Trees act as air purifiers, chopping them will increase air pollution * This will lead to respiratory ailments, mental health problems * Can also have effects on brain and cause strokes, autism, attention deficit disorders, dementia and memory impairment in children * Non-communicable diseases like diabetes, asthma, hypertension etc might also rise * Learn lessons from the pandemic, value resources of natural oxygen||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tree-cutting-is-injurious-to-health/articleshow/83257001.cms||Manka Behl
---||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Punjab readies to neutralize threat to children in possible third wave||CHANDIGARH: Following experts' predictions of a third Covid wave that is expected to impact children the most, the Punjab government has set the ball rolling for shielding the young vulnerable population from the threat. Punjab has been one of the worst-hit states during both waves, but in which children were least affected. The analysis of the state health department reveals that about 2% of the total cases reported in both the waves were in the 0-14 age group while the death rate was below one. However, experts fear that those below 18 will be at greater risk during the third wave. Since the beginning of the pandemic, a 10-day-old male infant has been the youngest victim of Covid in Punjab. To safeguard children, Punjab has started assessing the impact of the possible third wave for better preparedness and ramping up paediatric health infrastructure by fill the gaps in existing infrastructure. As the clinical requirement of children is different from adults, the plan includes setting up paediatric intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators, ensuring the availability of required equipment and drugs in the districts. Dr KK Talwar, Punjab government’s adviser on health issues, maintained that the government is looking to increase paediatric ICU facilities and ventilators so that children who develop severe complications can be treated. Besides this, the government has prepared a training module for doctors and medical staff and is also working on updating the treatment protocol. The government has also started procuring fingertip paediatric pulse oximeters that will be distributed along with free Covid Fateh kits containing medicine. So far it has purchased about 1,000 such devices. Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said, “Experts have put in place a plan keeping in mind the worst case scenario. We just need to finalise the numbers of ICU beds, ventilators and other equipment required. The decision is likely to be taken in a meeting to be chaired by the chief minister in the coming days.” Experts and various reports have opined that the intensity of the third wave will be like the second wave. However, damage can be controlled if proper preparations – ramping up of infrastructure and rigorous vaccination -- are done. The latest research report of State Bank of India has held that vaccination should be the key priority, especially for the children who could be the next vulnerable group. The report recommended that the central government should go for an advanced procurement strategy like that adopted by developed nations to vaccinate this age group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-readies-to-neutralize-threat-to-kids-in-possible-third-wave/articleshow/83248212.cms||Vinod Kumar

Some of major measures would include a three-layered system to ensure 24x7 uninterrupted oxygen supply in hospitals, medical colleges and community health centres, provision of 100-bed ICU-equipped wards in medical colleges and adequate number of beds and ventilators in colleges and hospitals of the state. Oxygen shortage, staff shortage and non-availability of ventilator beds were some of the issues, which had not only embarrassed the BJP-JJP government but had also put the government on the firing line of opposition parties. Besides updating the existing staff with the knowledge to deal with emergent situations during the anticipated third wave of Covid, the state government would hire dedicated lab technicians, OT staff, para medicos and nursing staff. Digitization of entire real-time minute-to-minute record of patients admitted to healthcare centres, hospitals and medical colleges will be done so that entire record is available on dashboard screens in the offices of ACS (health), director general of health services (DGHS), health minister and heads of IDSP and NHM. Haryana health minister Anil Vij said a blueprint of the entire plan has been finalised and is ready for a roll out this month. Vij said the health infrastructure will be created on the lines of guidelines issued by World Health Organisation (WHO) for improvement of healthcare institutions at all levels. “As far as shortage of staff for handling equipment is concerned, we are in the process of taking recruitment of staff out of the purview of Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC). At the same time, regular training sessions of nurses, para medicos, technicians will be conducted and the training sessions will be linked with annual appraisals of the employees,” he said. As far as digitization is concerned, we shall ensure that the entire record of patients, clinical and administrative activities of the hospitals is available with one click on dashboards, he added. Meanwhile, senior officials in the Haryana Medical Services Corporation Limited said the tier system of oxygen arrangement work has already begun. “We have set up oxygen manufacturing plants in district hospitals and medical colleges. We will take this to the CHC level. Besides setting up plants, we will have stocks of liquid medical oxygen and adequate quantity of D-type cylinders,” an official said. Similarly, dedicated 100 oxygen beds and ICU convertible beds in medical colleges and district hospitals would be set up with adequate percentage of ICU beds and ventilator-equipped beds, he added. “As far as the third wave is concerned, there is no such official alert, but we will equip ourselves to deal with any kind of emergent situation,” said Vij.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hit-by-shortcomings-haryana-to-update-health-infra-to-get-ready-for-3rd-wave/articleshow/83248244.cms||Manvir Saini

The life of people in Himachal is majorly influenced by local deities who hold sway over their social, cultural, personal and professional lives. In Kullu district, each village has a temple and people generally seek permission of the deities through the oracle before taking any important decision. People believe the deities are their protectors and will save them from all adversities, even the Covid-19 pandemic. “Our deity told us last year that coronavirus will come and go, but it will not harm its followers and devotees. Deity also asked us not to use face mask. Look at me. I do not cover my face, still Covid could not touch me,” a follower of a prominent deity, Ravi Thakur said. According to officials, most of the villagers are not following any safety guidelines and use a face mask only in cities to avoid challan. People, having trust in deities, continued to hold large weddings, religious ceremonies and other events and police had to impose fines on the offenders. The fallout has come by way of a surge in rural areas. While some deities directed people to follow the government guidelines, others assured their followers not to worry. Seeing this trend, some religious heads have advised caution. Kullu Devi Devta Kardar Sangh president Jai Ram Thakur recently requested all priests and kardars (caretakers) of the deities to cancel all fairs and religious events where there is possibility of large gathering. “I have requested all to organise small pujas for the peace and safety from the Covid-19,” he said. Last month, a few dozen devotees brought the palanquin of a deity to Kullu deputy commissioner office as “the deity was upset with the administration and government over various restrictions on religious ceremonies”. Villagers are falling sick in rural areas with Covid-like symptoms, yet they are not seeking medical help. MLA Sunder Singh Thakur said, “Unfortunately, many misconceptions among people are leading to spread of infection. Sick people who are positive are visiting hospitals only when their health deteriorates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/misconceptions-aid-covid-spread-in-hp-villages/articleshow/83248365.cms||Suresh Sharma

---||Goa||Govt initiates e-registration for commercial trees on private land||Panaji: In a bid to liberalise the permit raj governing growing and felling of trees on private lands, the state government has prepared an online portal to allow individuals to register trees that are planted for timber or other commercial purposes.  Chief minister Pramod Sawant, who launched the online service, said that the registration of the sapling, when it is planted itself , will ease the process of obtaining permission to cut the tree at a later stage. Sawant, who was present at a meeting at Campal on Fiday, on the eve of ‘World Environment Day’, also launched an e-pass service for the forest department for transportation of logs. For the ease of doing business, registered commercial tree plantation have been exempted from Goa Tree Preservation Act, 1984. “For the first time we have started a portal to register those trees that have been planted for commercial purposes. Many people worry that after planting whether they will be allowed to cut them later. Getting permissions is very difficult at a later stage,” Sawant said. The chief minister also flagged off a three-month long program to distribute saplings. He said that people can register and take as many plants as they want for free and plant them at home. Lauding the forest department for various initiatives to preserve the environment and to bring in reforms, Sawant said that the forest department has come up with advance reforms. “We let you register the sapling when you plant it. In five years or so, when the tree has to be cut, you can produce the permission and registration and cut the tree. This will make it commercially viable to plant trees,” he said. This is expected to begin the process of easing the existing set of rules that govern felling of fast-growing species such as poplar, teak and bamboo. “In order to facilitate tree plantation, the government has exempted registered new commercial tree plantation areas and all trees raised henceforth on private non-forest land from provisions of the Goa (Preservation of Trees) Act, 1984. This will encourage farmers and other landowners to take up commercial tree plantations for economic benefits,” officers from the forest department said. They further stated that plantations on commercial scale on farm land/other private lands will provide multiple benefits including sustained supply of raw materials for wood-based industries, an additional source of income for farmers, self-sufficiency in wood-based products and reduction in import of wood products while also mitigating climate change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-initiates-e-registration-for-commercial-trees-on-private-land/articleshow/83246651.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Overcharging: Haryana plans surgical strike on hospitals||CHANDIGARH: Alarmed by complaints of overcharging by private hospitals, Haryana government has asked deputy commissioners to compile a list of hospitals that have been given land at subsidised rates or have been given change of land use with conditions. Sources said hospitals set up by change of land use (CLU) as well as those which have been allotted land at subsidised rates are supposed to provide free services to at least 25% of their indoor or outdoor clinical patients. During his meeting with deputy commissioners, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar expressed keenness to ensure implementation of this system, which was actually part of the terms and conditions at the time of allotment or signing of letter of intent in case of CLU cases in private hospitals. “The DCs have been told to prepare an action plan in addition to compilation of data on hospitals. This proposal has come at a time when complaints of exorbitant billing started coming in. Some complaints have even come from the kin of those covered under the Ayushmann Scheme,’’ a CMO official said. The government has already announced financial assistance of up to Rs 35,000 for patients from BPL and poor families for treatment in private hospitals. During his interaction with media persons last week, CM Manohar Lal Khattar indicated that action would be taken to ensure that private hospitals did not harass locals. He cited the example of a complaint received by him about new ways devised by hospitals to charge money from patients by declaring them Covid negative just two days after the patient was declared Covid positive in the RT-PCR test. He alleged that this was done to avoid billing in accordance with the rates fixed by health authorities. Box: CM on ambulance use The CM suggested rationalisation of use of ambulances, at least those equipped with advanced equipment. Sources said there are around 400 such ambulances. The CM has asked deputy commissioners to provide one high-tech ambulance at 120 community health centres across the state. Remaining deployment would be done according to the status of the district hospital and its distance from the nearest tertiary care hospital. This suggestion was made after a few deputy commissioners asked for ventilator beds in CHCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/overcharging-hry-plans-surgical-strike-on-hospitals/articleshow/83248383.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Chandigarh||Under fire, Punjab stops sale of Centre-allocated vaccines||CHANDIGARH: Under fire from opposition and Centre on the charge of profiteering amid a pandemic, the Punjab government on Friday withdrew its order on selling Centre-allocated Covid-19 vaccine to private hospitals. The Congress government said the decision had not been taken in the “right spirit”. The CM Amarinder Singh-led government has been at the receiving end for diverting vaccine doses allocated by the central government to private hospitals in the state and earning a profit. The government is said to have sold doses of Covaxin, procured for Rs 400, to private health facilities for Rs 1,060. The private hospitals further charged Rs 1,560 from people. According to government, about 42,000 doses were allotted to the private hospitals. Of these, it claimed, only 600 doses were administered to people in the age group of 18-44. The government has directed private hospitals to return all vaccine doses available with them, while the doses which they have utilised are to be returned back once they get direct supplies from manufacturers. The government will refund the amount deposited by the private hospitals in the vaccine fund. Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said instruction of providing one-time limited vaccine doses to private hospitals has been withdrawn on the direction of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. He said instructions had been issued to all civil surgeons not to make a fresh allotment to private hospitals. Sidhu said as Punjab government was committed to providing all treatment services to Covid patients without any discrimination at government hospitals, vaccination will also be administered free of cost to all beneficiaries. He said the state government had already declared in budget 2021-22 that vaccination will be provided free of cost to each eligible beneficiary and the state would bear all expenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/under-fire-for-profiteering-amid-pandemic-pb-withdraws-order-on-vax-to-private-hospitals/articleshow/83248388.cms||---

The state clinical team drew this conclusion on the basis of death audit. It has also been observed that Covid patients are taking steroids indiscriminately without consulting competent medical personnel, which may result in delayed clearance of the virus from the body and adverse outcomes like suppression of immunity and precipitation of diabetes mellitus as well as uncontrolled blood sugar level. The state clinical team warned that such indiscriminate use of steroids could increase susceptibility to various infections, including mucormycosis. It has been advised that steroids should be used only in Covid patients with low oxygen levels and under strict medical guidance. The team members said that the medical practitioner should prescribe steroids only in moderate and severe Covid infection, in accordance with protocol laid down by the Union ministry of health and family welfare. Health department officials have requested people with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection to get tested for Covid-19 at the earliest and avoid self medication with steroids. They said that comorbid patients should be admitted in the dedicated Covid care centre (controlled comorbidities) and dedicated Covid health centre (uncontrolled comorbidities) with intense monitoring and early recognition of a dip in oxygen saturation and/or breathing problems. To avoid exposure of comorbid patients during their routine hospital visits, it is advised that the comorbid and aged population use tele-consultation services by e-sanjeevani OPD. If such patients come to hospitals, they should be prescribed medicines for underlying comorbidities for at least three months. All comorbid Covid positive patients insisting on home isolation should monitor their medical parameters frequently and diligently, experts said. Officials said directions have been issued to address delayed presentation of Covid patients to healthcare facilities. It has also been directed to establish a dedicated central desk manned 24 × 7 with dedicated personnel for timely referral. Doctors involved in care of Covid patients have been directed to attend regular updates by the state Covid clinical team, State Institute of Health and Family Welfare, Parimahal, Himachal Pradesh and AIIMS. All doctors have been asked to follow treatment protocol issued by the MOHFW, GOI, AIIMS/ICMR and state treatment guidelines. It has been directed that patients suspected to be suffering from Covid-19 like symptoms and whose RT-PCR test report is negative but who show features of SARI (fall in oxygen saturation, tachypnoea), should be admitted in triage area of the hospital and presumptive therapy recommended for Covid management must be started till the RT-PCR report is available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/delayed-referral-of-covid-patients-steroid-overuse-red-flagged-in-hp/articleshow/83248393.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Borders blur as Balurghat boy delivers life-saving drugs for FB pal’s mom in Dhaka||MALDA: For millions of Bengalis on either side of the India-Bangladesh border, the dividing fence evokes as many sentiments. But, for college teacher Saikat Morshed, it never caused as much agony as it did over the past month. Morshed, like most Bangladeshis, depends largely on Kolkata for medical facilities. His anxiety knew no bounds when he realised that some lifesaving drugs for his ailing mother were unavailable in Bangladesh and that enhanced restrictions wouldn’t allow him to cross the border. Luckily for him, a Facebook pal played good Samaritan and took the trouble to ensure he got what he needed to save his mother. Saleha Khatun (66) has heart problems. Last December, Morshed brought her to a private hospital off EM Bypass in Kolkata. The consulting physician prescribed some drugs, which Morshed bought before leaving the city. Saleha was due for a review by the same doctor this April, but the Covid second wave and following restrictions imposed by both countries made travel impossible. Morshed’s worst nightmare came true when the prescribed drugs went out of stock in Bangladesh. Frustrated, he posted a message on social media, which drew the attention of Balurghat resident Tuhin Subhra Mandal. Also a teacher by profession, Mandal has many friends in Bangladesh. He contacted Morshed and asked for the prescription. The drugs were bought at Balurghat and Malda, after which Mandal contacted immigration officers and BSF. “It was not very difficult to convince them of the situation and they agreed to help me help Morshed,” Mandal said. According to plan, Mandal reached the Indo-Bangla border at Hili on Thursday. Morshed too reached the other side of the border from his Dhaka residence. The Border Guard of Bangaldesh (BGB) was contacted by BSF and the former agreed at once to aid delivery of the medicines. During the handover, Mandal and Morshed managed to exchange pleasantries across the fence. “The country was divided in 1947, but Tuhin bhai today proved that our bond wasn’t. I can’t express my gratitude enough,” Morshed said. Mandal echoed similar sentiments and added: “We could have done nothing had the BSF and BGB not been so helpful.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/borders-blur-as-balurghat-boy-delivers-life-saving-drugs-for-fb-pals-mom-in-dhaka/articleshow/83246003.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Post-Covid setbacks prolonging hospital stay for young patients in second wave||KOLKATA: Around a fourth of Kolkata’s young Covid patients admitted in private hospitals are suffering from post-Covid complications that are prolonging their hospital stay and more than 10% of those already released are being forced to seek readmission, say city hospitals. Across all age groups, around a third of Covid patients are being forced to stay back in hospitals even after turning negative due to post-viral ailments. Post-Covid fibrosis and lingering pneumonia are the two most common factors behind this, say doctors. According to CMRI’s director of pulmonology Raja Dhar, at least 25% of the Covid patients admitted under him in the second wave have suffered from some post-Covid complication. “Of the 64 admitted under me currently, 19 are non-Covid but 60% of them are in ICU due to post-disease complications. Despite recovering from the virus, they have high oxygen requirement. Of the remaining 45, 30 are in ICU with around 65% on the verge of a lung fibrosis. These are young patients aged between 25-45 and have a severe disease,” said Dhar. A substantial number of these patients will actually end up with fibrosis and will have lingering oxygen requirement that could prolong their hospital stay, he added. According to RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) interventionist Souren Panja, many young Covid patients have been struck by pulmonary fibrosis, which wasn’t the case during the first wave. “These patients have more oxygen requirement that keeps them in hospital longer and the residual damage, too, takes time to heal,” he said. Even after recovery from Covid, the residual damage to their lungs brings down the ‘oxygen reserve’ of the organ, reducing the lungs’ ability to take load. “This affects the young more since they are more active and need a higher oxygen level to maintain their normal activities,” Panja explained. Around 2-3 patients have been seeking re-admission daily due to post-Covid complications across the three units of AMRI Hospitals. “These patients suffer from a range of post-Covid ailments varying from hypoxia, recurrent fever, lingering pneumonia in case of younger patients and lung fibrosis. In the case of the elderly and the middle-aged, it’s mostly cardiac ailments,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Peerless Hospital now has 7-8 such patients who have turned negative but continue to suffer from post-Covid complications. Around 15% have sought re-admission. “Around 20% of our Covid survivors have suffered from post-Covid pneumonia, low oxygen saturation and heart ailments and sought treatment either through admission or consultations,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Another reason behind re-admission of young patients is secondary infection, according to Panja. “Covid-induced low immunity is making patients vulnerable to these. There have also been cases of recurring lung inflammation after a sudden withdrawal of steroids. So, it’s important to taper them off carefully,” said Panja. Dhar agreed. “There are very few medicines for patients at this stage, other than steroids and anti-fibrotic drugs that take a long time to work. So, the challenge for us is to keep these patients alive till the symptoms start receding. Sadly, a large number of such patients are young this time,” said Dhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/post-covid-setbacks-prolonging-hosp-stay-for-young-patients-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/83247877.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Certificate with CM picture for 18-44 age group getting free jabs from West Bengal government||KOLKATA: The Bengal health department is issuing its own vaccination certificates, featuring chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s photograph, to the below-45 age group who are opting for free jabs. All vaccine doses procured for this section have been directly procured by the state government, not the Centre. The move comes in the backdrop of controversy over PM Narendra Modi’s image issued via Co-Win even after the Centre made states responsible for vaccinating the 18-44 age group. The Bengal government has moved Supreme Court demanding an end to the Centre’s differential vaccine pricing policy, and free jabs for all eligible citizens. Those being issued certificates featuring the CM’s image are also free to get certificates from Co-Win with the PM’s photo. Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Punjab — all opposition-governed states — have been issuing vaccination certificates with their respective CMs’ photos to those getting their jabs bought by the state. The Bengal government has procured vaccines worth Rs 150 crore, which it is giving for free to the 18-44 age group at state-run Covid vaccination centres. Around 29 lakh people in this age category have been inoculated in the state. The phase-III vaccination policy had made states and private hospitals responsible for inoculating the 18-44 age group. Under the circumstances, the use of the PM’s image has raised eyebrows. Bengal has not only moved the apex court demanding free jabs for all and an end to the pricing policy, CM Banerjee had even written several letters to Modi about this since February. Ahead of the elections, Trinamool had moved the EC, alleging the PM’s photos on vaccine certificates violated the model code of conduct. Modi’s images were removed on the certificates as long as the election code was in effect in all five states where polls were held, and reappeared only after results were declared in each state. State sources said Bengal has rolled out its own Covid Vaccination System, like Co-Win. This software, unlike Co-Win, is password-protected, and can be used only by persons authorised by the health and family welfare department. The system, the sources said, had been developed to track the procurement, allocation and roll-out modalities of the vaccines that are being procured directly by Bengal. Recipients are getting text messages that provide a link to their vaccination certificate in English and Bengali. This certificate mirrors the Co-Win certificate data without the reference ID. It carries there an image of Banerjee, with a message: “Be Alert, Be Safe”. It also provides the state Covid helpline (1800313444222) for reporting adverse effects. Senior state officials remained unavailable for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cert-with-cm-pic-for-18-44-age-grp-getting-free-jabs-from-state/articleshow/83247661.cms||---

The development will take similar initiatives of the high court in the past a step forward. In 2016, then Chief Justice Manjula Chellur had announced the constitution of a special bench for speedy disposal of chit fund-related cases in the wake of 150 pending petitions. In 2020, then Chief Justice Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan set up a two-judge bench to exclusively hear chit fund petitions. Now, acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal has taken up the responsibility of hearing such petitions every Friday along with public interest litigations. Additional solicitor-general Y J Dastoor objected to the proposal, saying how the court could hear PILs and also bail pleas by those arrested in chit fund cases at the same time. The acting chief justice turned down the objection and held that he would hear a couple of chit fund petitions from now on. Senior lawyers have welcomed the move because they feel that adjudication of chit fund matters under “one umbrella” will ensure speedy disposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/acting-cj-to-hear-chit-fund-cases-every-friday/articleshow/83246291.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||Amid Centre-Bengal face-off, Dilip walks state tightrope||Kolkata: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh and chief minister Mamata Banerjee have one thing in common — both have been facing a high-handed Centre: Banerjee at the administrative level and Ghosh at the party level. This is one reason why Ghosh didn’t join the debate on the Centre’s “administrative action” against the top state official. “This is an administrative decision. We are not always kept in the loop on organizational decisions even,” a senior Bengal BJP leader said, giving vent to frustration over party brass’ “domineering role”. State BJP leaders didn’t like the way party seniors Ghosh and Mukul Roy were “elbowed out” of the decision-making process during assembly polls, right from candidate selection to finetuning organizational nitty gritty. There is a contrary view as well that puts the debacle blame on a coterie, of which Ghosh was a part. The perception gap between BJP brass and state-level leadership is growing because the former hasn’t yet undertaken a formal stocktaking of Bengal polls. BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, the Bengal minder, is busy holding virtual meetings with party office-bearers in Punjab, Chandigarh, Bihar and Uttarakhand over the post-poll situation in Bengal. Party’s think tank and prospective chief ministerial candidate Swapan Dasgupta, who lost the polls from Tarakeswar, is back to the Rajya Sabha while Union junior minister Babul Supriyo is back to Asansol, his parliamentary constituency. The central BJP mandarins’ apparent withdrawal, followed by the pandemic and cyclone, has bared BJP’s inherent organizational gaps that the party wanted to make up with ‘dal badlus’. Vast stretches of South 24 Parganas, for instance, remain unattended while state BJP leaders are reaching pockets elsewhere. BJP president J P Nadda visited Kolkata days after election results in May and promised to take the battle to a “conclusive end”. Soon after, a Union home ministry team visited Bengal followed by a host of national commission teams reaching out to violence-hit areas. But there was hardly any back-up from state BJP. “Leaders met the members in Kolkata but had no clue when and where these teams were visiting,” said a BJP organizer from Diamond Harbour. A host of Trinamool Congress-turned-BJP leaders such as Sabyasachi Dutta and Rajib Banerjee have gone into virtual mode. Sovan Chatterjee has left BJP while Sonali Guha and Subhrangshu Roy have started tracing their way back to Trinamool. The sudden surge in the organization is already heading for the ebb, with a handful of BJP leaders facing the anger and frustration of party ranks. “Many party workers are being asked to pay a hefty sum for coming back home,” alleged Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu. Ghosh had been to trouble-torn villages in East and West Midnapore. But such efforts were far short of BJP workers’ expectations. For Ghosh, it is back to square one. He can’t pass on the electoral defeat to somebody else and he can’t see eye to eye with BJP brass either.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/amid-centre-bengal-face-off-dilip-walks-state-tightrope/articleshow/83246217.cms||Saugata Roy

They are being brutalised or killed. Thousands are now homeless and we stand by them. This is happening across the state,” Ghosh said after the meeting. He pegged the number of people forced out of their homes since the May 2 assembly poll results at over 50,000. The BJP leader urged party workers to have confidence in the party. “You have to keep faith in us. We will stand by every party worker who is facing political violence,” Ghosh said in his bid to pacify the agitated crowd. Veteran BJP leader and former Meghalaya governor Tathagata Roy had earlier criticised party leaders, saying that they were incommunicado. “He (Roy) should arrange the return of those displaced by violence (instead of criticising others). Our party leaders are dedicated and are in constant touch with workers in their respective areas,” Ghosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-workers-mob-state-party-chief-in-chinsurah-over-violence/articleshow/83246159.cms||Falguni Banerjee

District officials will make a presentation on the ground reality as all 25 blocks of East Midnapore had been affected by Yaas. Digha and Mandarmani, the two tourist destinations, had been the worst hit in the cyclone. The team will also meet finance officials at Nabanna on Tuesday. Earlier chief minister Mamata Banerjee had claimed that a damage of over Rs 20,000 crore had been caused due to the cyclone. The CM during her meeting with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 28 had handed over a report on the damage in Bengal. The CM also wanted a package of Rs 20,000 for restructuring Digha and Sunderbans from the PM. The PM had made an aerial survey of the damaged areas of East Midnapore. However, the Centre had claimed that no presentation was made to the PM when he held a meeting at Kalaikunda. Already a fund of Rs 400 crore was released by the centre for Bengal a day before the Yaas hit the coasts of Bengal and Odisha. However, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh were granted Rs 600 crore each, for which the Bengal CM had expressed her displeasure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/central-team-to-assess-yaas-damage-in-bengal/articleshow/83246349.cms||---

The Class 10 exams will be held over two days in the third week of July. Hours later, in Belagavi, CM BS Yediyurappa sounded a note of caution, saying SSLC exams too will be scrapped if the Covid situation does not improve. Over 8 lakh students are expected to appear for the SSLC exams this year. Primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar said SSLC exams were necessitated as unlike II PUC, there are no objective parameters for alternative assessment. Exams for Class 9 were not held last year. Amid mixed reactions relief from II PUC students and their parents and disappointment and anxiety among the SSLC lot — the minister said, “We are not holding the exams to fail anyone. All students, in II PUC and SSLC, will be promoted.” Kumar said the government had arrived at the decision after brainstorming with educationists, officials, parents, teachers and students. “We also got in touch with other states which have cancelled their board exams to understand their strategy of evaluating and promoting students without exams,” he said. The state government has decided to postpone reopening of schools from June 15 to July 1 and hold admissions from June 15 to August 31. II PUC RESULTS Grading guidelines to be issued soon The minister explained that II PUC students would be graded based on their performance in their I PUC exams, held in February last year. Nearly 7 lakh students were expected to appear for the exam this year. “The I PUC exams were held on a district level. Based on that performance, students will be graded,” he said. If any student is dissatisfied with the grades, they will be given an opportunity to appear for the exam, which will be conducted after the Covid situation comes under control. Private candidates and repeaters are also required to appear for the exam held at that time. It will be considered the first attempt for everyone, he clarified. II PUC results will be announced by July-end. The education department clarified that no ranks will awarded. Grades like A, B, B+ will be given to students as their previous marks will help decide the range, and not an exact percentage of marks. The grading guidelines will be issued soon. “Students will have to appear for two examinations on two different days with a gap of three-four days. The first exam will be held for core subjects like science, mathematics and social science. Each subject will be assessed for 40 marks and the total will be 120 marks. The second exam will be for the three languages. The three-hour-long paper will have questions that are simple and straightforward,” the minister said. The OMR based examinations will also help in announcing the results within 10-15 days of the exams, Kumar said. Students unable to appear for the examinations due to Covid will be given another chance to do so. There will be no supplementary exams this year for SSLC students. No. of centres doubled Explaining Covid protocol measures, Kumar said the number of exam centres have been doubled and only one student will be seated on each desk. He said only vaccinated teachers will be assigned invigilation duties. The government has assured that exam dates will be announced at least 20 days before and hostellers and migrant students will be allowed to change exam centres. N95 masks will be provided to all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-cancels-ii-puc-exam-plans-two-day-sslc-exam-in-july/articleshow/83251391.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court in ‘rape’ case: When woman and man are in room...||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain the plea of a woman who has alleged sexual assault by TV anchor Varun Hiremath seeking cancellation of anticipatory bail granted to him by the Delhi high court. A bench of Justices Navin Sinha and Ajay Rastogi said the woman’s statement recorded under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code before a magistrate clearly did not warrant the apex court to interfere with the relief granted to the anchor by the HC. The petitioner’s counsel, senior advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan, said the woman had honestly recorded her statement that she had disrobed voluntarily but had objected to Hiremath forcing himself on her despite repeated refusals. “Disrobing does not mean she consented to sexual activity and that clearly made out an offence of rape given the statutory changes effected after the Nirbhaya gang rapecum-murder case,” she said. Ramakrishnan said the conduct of the accused also needed to be considered by the apex court as he had absconded after registration of the FIR and evaded arrest warrants. “The woman’s Section 164 statement clearly shows that she had indicated to him that she did not want to go beyond a certain point. It is a settled law that consent of the woman is necessary for every part of the sexual act. Since the consent was refused at a certain point, the offence clearly would be categorised as rape,” she said. The bench made the senior advocate read certain portions of the Section 164 statement and said, “When a man and a woman are in a room, and the man makes a request and the woman complies with it, do we need to say anything more?” The bench rejected the petition saying it was not inclined to interfere with the Delhi HC order granting pre-arrest bail to Hiremath. The woman had accused Hiremath of sexually assaulting her in a hotel in Delhi in February. The trial court had rejected his anticipatory bail plea in March. The HC granted him relief on May 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-in-rape-case-when-woman-and-man-are-in-room-/articleshow/83251415.cms||---
