---||Mumbai||#FathersDay: Mumbai’s frontline doctors plan to spend quality-time with family||We are into 15 months of the pandemic already and our frontline workers have been working relentlessly. With the city taking all stipulated precautions and following mandatory protocols, there are people who want to make the most of whatever little time they have by spending it with their families. On the occasion of Father’s Day, we spoke to a few city doctors who after working hard for months want to spend time with their children. Dr Rahul Pandit the director of Critical Care at a hospital chain in Mumbai and Member of Maharashtra COVID Task Force told us, “I am really looking forward to spending some quality time with my family. I have already made my plans. In the past 1.5yrs I have spent most of my time at the hospital and being at the forefront of tackling COVID19. I have missed many family functions and festivals. So, this Sunday I first visit my patients at the hospitals since they too are like family to me, and then the rest of the day I will be home being a family man. I plan to share household chores with my wife, watch a movie with my kids and my mom. The evening will be spent having a fam-jam session-playing some karaoke and we will all sing our favorite songs.” Doctors have been craving family time during the pandemic and Dr Mohammed Shakeel Ahmed, consultant and head of the emergency department at a hospital chain in Vashi said,” I have spent a lot of time away from them during the pandemic. But this Father’s Day I am going to make up for all the lost time. I feel like unwinding and reliving my childhood with my kids. It’s the monsoon season, my kids love to play in the rain, I thought it would be the perfect time to become a kid again and enjoy the rain with my kids, with all the COVID precautions of course! After which, I have planned a surprise for my kids. I am going to prepare a special cake for them, with the help of my wife. Also, we plan to prepare a special meal for our kids, which includes their favorite dishes.” Dr Anil Heroor, head of Surgical Oncology at a hospital chain in Mulund and Vashi has two sons and he has some special plans for them. “One of my sons is a doctor, and the other is taking his MBBS exams, and so we plan to celebrate this differently. We plan to get together and do some community outreach. We plan to share food with the poor and after that, we have enrolled ourselves in a gardening workshop - since gardening is said to be a good exercise and a fun activity. The past 1.5yrs have been really tough for us as a family, and this is a perfect time to get together, share our experiences and catch up on some father-sons time. Me and my sons are more like friends, and we wish to make the most of this day in a very fun and loving way.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fathers-day-mumbais-frontline-doctors-plan-to-spend-quality-time-with-family/articleshow/83667709.cms||Debarati S Sen

The Games will be held from July 26 to August 8 with strict protocols due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Goa Boxing Association vice-president was also part of the technical committee for the 2012 London Olympics. “I’ll have to be very cautious when travelling, but this is a memorable achievement. Everybody looks at the Olympics as the ultimate sporting event. And to reach the ultimate is not easy. The competition is tough,” Lenny told TOI on Saturday. Lenny is the only Asian evaluator/observer among the four who will keep a close eye on the referees and judges at the Games. Two other officials have been appointed from Europe while one official from Africa will complete the lineup. “I worked sincerely,” said Lenny. “I have been to World Championships and two Olympic Qualifiers as evaluator and observer but never dreamed I would be selected (for the Olympics). It is a very emotional and big achievement for me.” The 67-year-old will be closer to the action, assessing every bout. His job will be to decide whether the referees and judges are up to the mark. If the officials are found manipulating, they can be removed or suspended by the official team. “At the Rio Olympics, we had some issues. Since then they have introduced the evaluation team,” said Lenny. Lenny will reach Tokyo on July 18, but the journey will not be easy. He will have to undergo RT-PCR tests for seven days before leaving and then undergo the same process when he lands in Japan. The boxing championships will start from July 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lenny-to-officiate-at-tokyo-olympics/articleshow/83674323.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||India||Speaker or Lokpal to allow MPs’ prosecution? LS seeks legal view||NEW DELHI: In what may change the established system of sanctioning prosecution of arraigned parliamentarians, Lok Sabha has sought legal opinion on who - the Speaker or Lokpal - should be the competent authority for green-signalling chargesheeting of MPs in a corruption case. Approached by TOI, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla confirmed the development, while adding that the issue is tricky. The subject of "sanction for prosecution" hit the headlines recently over pending CBI pleas for chargesheeting of Lok Sabha MPs from West Bengal in the Narada-Sarada cases. While three of them belong to the Trinamool, one is a former TMC MP - Suvendu Adhikari - who is now BJP's leader of opposition in West Bengal. The CBI had earlier sent reminders on its pending requests. As per the norm settled by the Supreme Court, the Speaker of Lok Sabha is treated as the appointing authority whose nod is a must for an investigating agency to prosecute a member of Parliament. The chairman of Rajya Sabha occupies the same position in case of the upper House. The jurisdiction pertains to corruption cases which fall under the ambit of Prevention of Corruption Act where sanction for prosecution from the appointing authority is considered a must for public servants. However, the situation appears to have changed in the minds of parliamentary authorities following the enactment and appointment of the anti-corruption ombudsman, Lokpal. Speaker Om Birla told that the issue is contentious and keeps surfacing at regular intervals. However, after the appointment of Lokpal, the matter was under study about who is the competent authority, Lokpal or the Speaker. "We have already taken the legal opinion from two prominent luminaries. However, both had varied views, due to which the matter has been referred to experts to study more about it," Birla said. Lok Sabha sources said the authorities were exercising utmost caution since the decision will have far-reaching consequences. "It may take some time," a source said. Explaining the matter, former Lok Sabha secretary general PDT Achary said the issue was settled by the apex court that the Speaker would be the appointing authority for Lok Sabha MPs and such sanction was only necessary in corruption cases. He added that the Lokpal Act did not change the situation. In March 2019, after years of vacancy over procedural issues, former Supreme Court judge Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose was appointed the first Lokpal of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/speaker-or-lokpal-to-allow-mps-prosecution-ls-seeks-legal-view/articleshow/83674095.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||India||PM’s J&K meeting plan gets cautious reception||NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR: There is a cautious reception to plans for Prime Minister Narendra Modi meeting political leaders from Jammu and Kashmir later this month amid expectations that the consultations may be the first step towards holding of assembly elections in the state. At this point, regional parties including PDP, National Conference and People's Conference are careful in assessing the implications of the initiative and highlight the centrality of their demands like restoration of statehood. Some parties want complete restoration of pre-August 5, 2019 status of J&K. At any rate the statehood demand is expected to be a key element of any election campaign. Any discussion on elections is currently a future scenario as the delimitation commission must first submit its recommendations for new MLA and Lok Sabha constituencies. The commission has sought inputs of district officials on any demographic and geographical inconsistencies in the delimitation process. Political parties had previously kept away and will now be given another chance to engage with the commission. Political parties and leaders in J&K continue to debate whether “restoration” of statehood will mean full-state status or Centre will keep the UT’s home department (law & order) under its control. CPM and Apni Party were the first to come forward hailing the Centre’s decision. In the two years after Article 370 was scrapped, alternatives to PDP, NC and Congress have gained some traction in Muslim-majority Kashmir, particularly after the recent panchayat polls. “People at the grassroots have tasted real power for the first time and now have a say in determining their own development agenda,” said Apni Party chief Altaf Bukhari. Sajjad Lone of People’s Conference and Yousuf Tarigami of CPM, also the convenor of Gupkar Alliance, confirmed they received calls for the PM’s meet in New Delhi at 3pm on June 24. Bukhari, Congress and CPM said the talks were an encouraging move to open up the stalled political discourse with the Centre. PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti said she got a call about the all-party meet on J&K next week. She said her party’s political affairs committee will deliberate on the issue on Sunday. Sources in PDP said Mehbooba has reservations on joining the all-party meet as according to them it is an exercise to show to international opinion that the political discourse with local parties has begun. PDP’s demand has been the restoration of Article 370. NC patron Farooq Abdullah said, “So far, we haven’t received any formal invite for talks. If we get any invitation, we will first sit and discuss the strategy to be adopted for the meeting.” Yonus Tarigami of CPM, Congress state chief GA Mir and Bukhari of Apni Party are keen on talks. “Solutions to J&K’s problems lie at New Delhi, not Islamabad or London. Delhi’s invitation is a welcome development,” Bukhari said. “This is a chance to restore statehood,” he said, hoping an announcement for an early poll will follow the PM’s meeting. Meanwhile, the Centre on Saturday released Mufti’s uncle Sartaj Madni from detention. This came soon after MHA officials called Mufti inviting her for PM’s meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pms-jk-meeting-plan-gets-cautious-reception/articleshow/83676314.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Business||UN report: India's IT rules don't conform to global rights norms||NEW DELHI: UN Special Rapporteurs have written to the Indian government saying that India's Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, in their current form, do not conform with international human rights norms. They also "recalled" in a report that restrictions to freedom of expression must never be invoked as a justification for the muzzling of any advocacy of multi-party democracy, democratic tenets and human rights. The report also said consultations with relevant stakeholders on the issue are essential in order to ensure the "final text is compatible with India's international legal obligations". The observations were made in Mandates of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association and the Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy. The report said as a global leader in technology innovation, India has the potential to develop a legislation that can place it at the forefront of efforts to protect digital rights. However, the substantially broadened scope of the Rules is likely to do just the opposite, it said. "We would therefore encourage the government to take all necessary steps to carry out a detailed review of the Rules and to consult with all relevant stakeholders, including civil society dealing with human rights, freedom of expression, privacy rights and digital rights", the report said. "We understand the new Rules were issued under the Information Technology Act of 2000 and therefore, were not subject to parliamentary review or open for consultation with stakeholders. We believe such consultations with relevant stakeholders are essential in order to ensure the final text is compatible with India's international legal obligations, in particular with Articles 17 and 19 of the ICCPR," it added. Don’t need lectures from US cos on free speech: PrasadUnion law and telecommunications minister Ravi Shankar Prasad reiterated at an online lecture on Saturday that the guidelines issued by the Centre for social media companies came after a direction from the Supreme Court, adding that the instructions were essential to stop “misuse” of social media. He also warned Twitter that India “does not need lectures on freedom of expression” from profitable American corporations and operating in India implies obeying Indian law.

---||India||India abstains from voting on UN's Myanmar resolution||NEW DELHI: India joined China and Russia in abstaining from a vote on a UNGA resolution seeking to delegitimise the Myanmar military junta and to prevent flow of arms into the country. Justifying its decision to abstain, the government said the resolution, which was adopted with 119 votes in favour, was introduced hastily and without enough consultations with Myanmar's neighbours and regional countries. India said the resolution, described by many as the strongest condemnation of Myanmar's military commanders since the coup, didn't reflect its views and that it didn't believe the resolution was going to aid the joint efforts towards strengthening the democratic process. "This resolution was tabled in the UN General Assembly without adequate consultations with neighbours and regional countries. This is not only unhelpful but may also prove counter-productive to the efforts of the Asean to find a solution to the current situation in Myanmar," India's permanent representative to the UN, TS Tirumurti, said. India's neighbours like Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan were also among the 36 countries to abstain. In the explanation of the vote in the General Assembly hall, Tirumurti said as Myanmar's immediate neighbour and close friend of its people, India is cognisant of the "serious impact of political instability" and the potential of its spillover beyond Myanmar's borders. India has been calling for greater engagement with the objective of peacefully resolving all issues. "We already have such an ongoing initiative under the aegis of Asean. It is important that we extend support to the Asean efforts," Tirumurti said. Mindful of Myanmar's ties with China and its own security interests in the northeast, India has walked the diplomatic tightrope on Myanmar since the military coup earlier this year. "During the discussions on this resolution, we had engaged in a spirit of finding a constructive and pragmatic way forward and had accordingly shared our suggestions to those who piloted this resolution," he said. "However, we find that our views have not been reflected in the draft being considered for adoption today. We would like to reiterate that a consultative and constructive approach involving the neighbouring countries and the region remains important as the international community strives for the peaceful resolution of the issue," Tirumurti said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-abstains-from-voting-on-uns-myanmar-resolution/articleshow/83678458.cms||---

Speaking to reporters in Kochi on Saturday before leaving for Lakshadweep to appear before the police, Sultana said she will “fully cooperate” with the investigation. “I have not done anything against the nation. The allegation is based on a word that I said. It is my responsibility to prove my case,” she said. During a debate on a TV channel on the ongoing protests by the islanders against a set of proposed laws and actions of the administration, Sultana had said a ‘bio-weapon’ was being used against the islanders. An FIR was registered against her for sedition. The activist had later clarified that she compared the administrator Praful Khoda Patel with a bio-weapon and not the government or the country. Sultana said she will continue to oppose the anti-people activities of the administration and fight until the islanders get justice. The Kerala HC had on Thursday granted interim anticipatory bail to Sultana in the case. She said she has not done anything wrong and is sure that justice will prevail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sedition-case-cops-to-quiz-lakshadweep-activist-today/articleshow/83678945.cms||---

The ministry was reacting to reports which suggested funds of Indians in Swiss banks have risen to over Rs 20,700 crore at the end of 2020 from Rs 6,625 crore at the end of 2019, reversing a two-year decline. It said exchange of financial information have taken place between both countries in 2019 and 2020. In view of existing legal arrangement for exchange of information of financial accounts, there does not appear to be any significant possibility for increase of deposits in Swiss banks which is out of undeclared incomes of Indian residents. It said Swiss authorities have been requested to provide possible reasons for increase/decrease. "Media reports allude to the fact that the figures reported are official figures reported by banks to Swiss National Bank and do not indicate the quantum of alleged black money... these statistics do not include the money that Indians, NRIs or others might have in Swiss banks in the names of third-country entities," the statement said. It said customer deposits and fund held through fiduciaries have actually fallen from the end of 2019. The ministry listed factors that could explain the increase. These include rise in deposits held by Indian firms in Switzerland, increase in deposits owing to business of Swiss bank branches in India, rise in transactions between Swiss and Indian banks, a capital increase for a subsidiary of a Swiss company in India and increase in liabilities connected with outstanding derivative financial instruments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-questions-reports-on-rise-in-indians-swiss-bank-black-stash/articleshow/83679139.cms||---
---||India||AstraZeneca top expert backs India on widening Covishield dose gap||NEW DELHI: Backing the 12-16 weeks gap between the two doses of Covishield in the country, the chief investigator of the AstraZeneca vaccine clinical trials on Friday said that the level of protection provided by one dose of the preventive significantly increases in the second and third months after the jab. Professor Andrew Pollard told a media outlet that the immunization policy in Britain and India should not be compared because of the different circumstances in the two countries. "An immunization policy that aims to vaccinate the largest number of people in the quickest possible time with at least one dose makes sense in the present circumstances in India," Pollard, who is also the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said. The scientist noted that in India, the vast majority of the population is unvaccinated and, therefore, unprotected at a time when the Delta variant is "a widely spreading and increasing threat". In India, the gap between two Covishield doses was four to six weeks, then increased to six to eight and is now 12-16. Referring to the UK reducing its Covishield doses gap just as India increased its, Pollard said Britain reduced the gap at a time when a substantial proportion of its population was already vaccinated. "In India, the converse is the case. The vast majority of people are unvaccinated and unprotected. Therefore, you need to ensure that as many as possible are protected against serious illness and hospitalisation, even if that means a large number will have lower levels of protection against symptomatic infection," the scientist explained. Pollard said another sensible reason for extending the gap in circumstances where the supply of vaccine is short is that the level of the protection provided by one dose of AstraZeneca significantly increases in the second and third months after the jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/astrazeneca-top-expert-backs-india-on-widening-covishield-dose-gap/articleshow/83679361.cms||---

The association’s president, Yogesh Chandra Verma, has written a letter to the Chief Justice as the normal working of the high court and subordinate courts has been badly affected since March last year when the Covid-19 pandemic gripped the state as well as the country. Courts had to switch to virtual hearing mode to avoid congregations and the count of cases taken up on normal days dropped exponentially, increasing pendency. Verma, a senior lawyer, has sent the letter to the Chief Justice via email on Friday, urging that the normal functioning of court hours, which is from 10.30am to 4.15pm, be restored, may be via virtual or physical mode when the high court reopens after summer vacation on June 21. “Some new mechanism may be evolved that substantial number of cases are heard every day and even by sitting on Saturday or by extending court hours,” Verma has urged. He has also urged that physical functioning of the subordinate courts be permitted as 50-60% lawyers have started coming to the court premises and hearing via videoconferencing is not proving to be sufficient and it is also creating inequality among the lawyers. Verma has also highlighted the plight of the lawyers in the state due to the situation arising from the pandemic, which badly affected the normal hearings in the high court as well as the subordinate courts. “Majority of the lawyers are facing extreme financial crisis. Approximately 25,000 to 30,000 lawyers in Bihar have shifted to villages in order to maintain their families. Young lawyers are running away from the profession,” he apprised the CJ. He has also highlighted the problem of the lawyers getting humiliated and taunted by the clients, who insist on returning their files and fees. “The preceding 15 months have brought functioning of the Patna high court virtually to a grinding halt. Altogether 62% of the total strength of the high court judges is lying vacant for considerable time. Patna high court probably tops so far as vacancies are concerned. This has worsened the situation,” he wrote. Verma on Saturday said most of the judges and lawyers in the subordinate courts have been vaccinated. “In such a scenario, the district judges may be given discretion to interact with the bar association concerned and take up physical hearing if agreed by everyone,” he said. Verma also said the high court can also function in whatever way deemed fit but at least the count of cases being heard every day be increased as a limited number of cases are getting listed for hearing at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cj-urged-to-devise-ways-for-hearing-substantial-number-of-cases-per-day/articleshow/83672399.cms||---

Qureshi, his relatives and friends were booked under the newly amended Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act that deals with forcible or fraudulent religious conversion by marriage, also termed ‘love jihad’ by its proponents. According to the police, Qureshi’s RT-PCR test for Covid-19 had turned out negative and he would be taken into custody. An official added that attempts were also being made to locate the family, but the priority was gathering evidence. The offence is the first of its kind to be registered under provisions of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. Assistant commissioner of police of the SC/ST cell D K Rathod said that the family had left their home. “We will now request for a remand for Qureshi’s interrogation to gather further evidence,” he said. Sources pointed out that given the sensitive nature of the case, the police were treading carefully and not rushing with arrests. Qureshi had created a fake identity on a social media platform using the name Sam Martin. He met the woman in 2019 and got married to her this year. The woman’s name and religion were allegedly changed at the time of the marriage. The woman has alleged that before her marriage she was taken to different places and raped by Sameer. He allegedly clicked objectionable pictures of the woman too. She even claimed that Sameer forced her to undergo abortions on three occasions before their wedding. Sameer’s father Abdul, mother Farida and sister Rukhsar have been accused of troubling the woman after marriage and using casteist slur. Three others including a cousin of Sameer and two of his friends have been named as accused in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/family-friends-of-accused-become-untraceable-after-fir/articleshow/83672209.cms||---

Altogether 78 patients sought medical help in OPD on Saturday. The treatment of non-Covid patients was suspended following the surge in the Covid cases, after which the institute was designated as a dedicated Covid facility on April 15 and a centre of excellence for treatment of mucormycosis (black fungus) on May 20, said IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal. Before the Covid pandemic, average 2,500 to 3,000 patients used to get medical help through OPD at IGIMS per day. Now, a person needs to download the Android mobile app of the institute from the Google play store. The page opens up with four options of lab report, OPD schedule, pathfinder and online consultation. For registration, one needs to click on online consultation, Mandal said, adding the telemedicine facility was also available through online registration. However, the IGIMS has also made arrangements for people finding it difficult to get registered online. “Such persons need to visit the Ayushman counter number 17 of the institute with their mobile phones for getting registered,” Mandal said. Though the number of Covid cases are on decline, patients of the mucormycosis continue to reach there for treatment. With four new admissions, the number of black fungus patients admitted there reached 97. With the rise in black fungus cases, the IGIMS has set up a separate department comprising doctors of the ENT, eye, maxillofacial surgery, neurosurgery and anaesthesia, who have successfully performed over 100 surgeries in less than a month. “On Saturday we got a call from an attendant of a 26 years’ old mucormycosis patient admitted in a Meerut hospital. Even after undergoing two surgeries, the patient continued to suffer from the black fungus infection which extended to a large area of his brain and now he wanted treatment at the IGIMS. After studying the CT scan and other tests, we only suggested medication, including administration of Amphotericin B injections,” Mandal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/igims-resumes-opd-for-non-covid-patients/articleshow/83673015.cms||VK Tripathi

Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said the advertisement on behalf of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) empowered standing committee was the misuse of funds, which should have otherwise been used on development work. “Why have the photos of her son, daughter-in-law, grandchildren and her Holi party been shown in the advertisement. Is this what she did in four years? This needs to be investigated as PMC’s money has been wasted in her private advertisement. Everyone is aware of the work done during her tenure and even now there is no relief from waterlogging,” said Mishra. He demanded deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, who also holds the charge of urban development and housing department, to probe it and recover the money from Sahu’s personal account. “Both deputy CM and Sahu are associated with the same party and should sort out this mistake,” Mishra said. Ward 28 councillor and Sahu’s opponent Vinay Kumar Pappu also criticized the mayor for wasting money. “All the main roads and crossings have big hoardings depicting the mayor and her son. While PMC is not earning a single penny from hoardings, the mayor in collaboration with advertisement mafias has put her personal hoarding everywhere,” he alleged. However, Sahu denied the use of PMC money on any advertisement. She said the expenditure was borne by her and some councilors. “I am ready for any probe. I must tell you that PMC money has not been wasted anywhere. We have done a lot of works for people, be it door-to-door garbage collection, construction of drains and roads. Since our opponents have no issue to talk about, they are raising a useless topic,” said Sahu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mayor-denies-opposition-charge-on-advertisement/articleshow/83672654.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The government clarified that the new system would end corruption in urban local bodies and strengthen their finances. The government carried out a study on apprehensions raised by opposition parties and found these to be false. The municipal administration and urban development department released the study paper on the proposed reforms in the property tax system in urban local bodies. Stating that property tax constitutes the single largest source of revenue to the ULBs, the government said that Capital Value Based tax system would help reduce complexity among staffers and enhance transparency in levy of taxes. It said that prevailing Annual Rental Value (ARV) based system was only helping the influential meddle with taxation. In the existing tax system, property tax on building is levied based on the Annual Rental Value of the building, which will be fixed based on the location of the building, type of construction, plinth area, age of the building and nature of usage. The council of respective municipal body will determine percentage of tax on ARV of the building. Similarly, property tax on lands will be fixed with reference to the Capital Value of the land (market value as fixed by the stamps and registration department). It is 0.20% of the capital value in municipalities and 0.50% in municipal corporations. “This means that vacant land tax is being levied on capital value basis even prior to the amendments proposed to the existing property tax regime,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/reforms-to-lower-urban-property-tax-rates-govt/articleshow/83673284.cms||Samdani MN

The small tanks which temporarily hold them are no substitute for their bigger habitat, the ancient tank or pond on which the iconic two-storeyed, rectangular Juma Masjid near Crawford Market stands. The 222-year-old, 8 ft deep talao, accessed by masonry steps and used for ritual wazu or ablutions before the namaz, has been cleaned of its water, fish and turtles for the first time in three decades. “As the second wave of pandemic hit and places of worship were ordered to be shut, we thought to clean up the pond and check if the 13 springs that feed the 150 feet long, 90 feet wide and 8 feet deep pond are fine,” said Shoeb Khatib, chairman of Jumar Masjid Bombay Trust which manages the mosque, Bada Kabrastan at Marine Lines and a few other properties in the city. “It took three pumps and eight days to suck out the waters and remove 20 trucks of slush from the pond’s cemented floor.” A Konkani Muslim merchant owned the large pond amidst gardens and agreed to construction of the mosque with a condition that the pond would be retained eternally. Construction work began in 1775 and seven arches and 49 stone pillars were erected to support the mosque’s fabric. Two dozen iron pillars were erected to hold the ground floor’s massive prayer hall’s ceiling decorated with beautiful motifs and engraving. Stained glass decorates the large window panes, making the prayer hall airy. Its first-floor prayer hall has just six pillars at corners with its pillar-less roof held by a scissors-like rooftop suspension. “In 1835, Khadija the only daughter of famous philanthropist Nakhuda Mohammed Ali Roghe, died. He constructed the first floor in Khadija’s memory” said Mohammed Ashfaque Kazi, chief Qazi or judge at Darul Ifta or the Shariah Court being run from the mosque. He added that in 1850 a library was also opened here. It has 16353 books, including 1610 rare manuscripts (1000 Arabic, 473 Persian and 137 Urdu). A 700-year-old Hadith book (sayings of the Prophet) and 300-year-old copy of the holy Quran are part of the collection. In 1912, a Turkish king, then custodian of the holy Kaaba in Mecca, donated Kaaba’s kiswa or cover to the Juma Mosque in Bombay. The Kaaba’s cover changed annually is made by stitching together 47 strips of cloth embroidered with Quranic verses, each strip being approximately 14 cm long and 101 cm in width. A Turkish king also donated a piece of the cloth from the cover that kept a kurta of the Prophet at an Istanbul museauim. “This historic mosque can attract lots of national and international tourists, students and scholars researching heritage sites. We will consult the state tourism deppartment to promote it also through heritage walks,” said Mumbadevi MLA Amin Patel who, along with corporator Javed Juneja, facilitated the cleaning of the ancient tank.

According to the researchers, the methodologies used yielded significant results, providing fuel savings up to 29.86%. The researchers at the hydropower simulation laboratory of the department of water resources development and management at IIT-Roorkee adjusted the functioning of power sources of the tugboats so the load demand could be met while consuming the lowest possible amount of fuel. Variable speed power-generating units were used in the tugboats, which means the units could operate over a wider range of rotor speeds. Such variable speed offers an additional degree of freedom to the generation system as compared to a fixed speed system where the rotor speed is nearly constant. A coordinated control strategy, based on a state machine control algorithm for real-time tugboat operational cycle, has also been incorporated. The researchers managed to successfully improve fuel efficiency of diesel-electric tugboats. The fuel savings obtained by these methods were 29.86% and 26.42%, respectively, as against the traditional diesel-mechanical tugboat propulsion system. While the research was funded by the Union ministry of ports, shipping and waterways, Visakhapatnam Port Trust provided information related to types of marine vessels, their operational schedules and expected design feasibilities. “This collaborative research on the design and experimental validation of short endurance marine vessels has shown promising results. We intend to make it stronger so that it can empower our marine industry,” IIT Roorkee director Prof Ajit Kumar Chaturvedi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/imu-vizag-iit-roorkee-develop-fuel-efficient-maritime-transport/articleshow/83673351.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Delhi||Delhi girl dies days after jab, organ donation without autopsy barred||NEW DELHI: A 22-year-old girl with no history of any serious illness suffered from neurological complications and was declared brain dead at a private hospital in Delhi recently. Her family wanted to donate her organs so that the lives of other patients requiring a transplant could be saved. However, this wasn’t allowed because National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation (NOTTO), which is the nodal agency for allocation and distribution of organs and tissues in the country, insisted that a postmortem examination was needed to rule out if or not the complication was caused due to vaccination. The family didn’t agree. The girl, a resident of Agra, took the Covishield vaccine on June 2. After that, she developed a fever and a persistent headache. Tests conducted at a local hospital showed she had blood clots in the brain's venous sinuses and her platelet count was extremely low. On June 14, she was referred to Max Super Speciality Hospital Saket where, despite all efforts, her condition deteriorated. The 22-year-old was declared brain dead on June 18 at 5 am. The family was keen to donate her organs. But, sources in NOTTO said, because the neurological complications she presented with were seen post-vaccination, they insisted on a postmortem. It was not clear whether the complications in her case were vaccine-induced. “Postmortem is necessary in cases of suspected or confirmed Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) to know how vaccine related side-effects affect organs. Also, if the neurological complications were indeed vaccine-induced, there is a likelihood that the side-effect may have damaged other organs as well and the recipient would be at the risk of developing complications following a transplant,” a NOTTO official, who did not want to be quoted, said. The girl who was brain dead was finally taken home by the family with Leave Against Medical Advice (LAMA) because they did not want a postmortem done. Her last rites were performed in Agra. The incident has led to serious questions about the lack of guidelines for organ transplantation in cases of suspected or confirmed cases of deaths caused post-vaccination. “I am appalled by the decision of NOTTO to insist on a postmortem just for the purpose of organ donation. Actually, if multi-organ donation would have happened, it would have been a de-facto postmortem,” said Dr Subhash Gupta, chief liver transplant surgeon at Max Saket, where the girl was admitted. Dr A S Soin, chairman of Institute of Liver Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine at Medanta – The Medicity, said postmortem should ideally be done in deaths due to AEFI, including suspected or confirmed cases of vaccine-induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia – meaning blood clots in the brain’s venous sinuses and extremely low platelet count. “However, going for a postmortem is up to the treating team, hospital, family, health authorities and the police. NOTTO is not the right authority to insist on the same. In fact, no postmortem was eventually done in this case. In this confusion, we have lost precious organs that could have saved the lives of many. Also, the wishes of a family that was willing to donate their young daughter’s organs who had just been declared brain dead went unfulfilled. This is unfortunate,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/girl-dies-days-afterjab-organ-donation-without-autopsy-barred/articleshow/83675584.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The locals spotted his body on the veranda when they reached the temple to worship the deities. Eyewitnesses told police that blood was oozing out of Surendra’s mouth and he had injury marks on his face and neck. The SHO of the Mufassil police station, Praveen Kumar Mishra, told this newspaper that the postmortem report would clarify if the priest was murdered or he died naturally. “Surendra’s son, Shambhu Kumar, has claimed that he had a fight with his nephew, Anil Rai, over a piece of land on Friday evening. He, therefore, suspects Anil’s involvement in the alleged murder,” he added. A resident of Mohanpur, Surendra had reportedly spent a lot of money on the construction of the temple by selling a part of his land. He used to sleep in a room built on the premises of the temple every night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/priests-body-found-at-temple-in-samastipur/articleshow/83672909.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar last in infrastructure, facilities in school education||PATNA: Bihar has scored the lowest in terms of infrastructure and facilities with a total 81 points out of 150 in the Performance Grading Index (PGI) 2019-20 for states/UTs in the field of school education, the report of which was released by the Ministry of Education recently. However, the state saw a marginal improvement in its overall PGI score between 5 to 10%, when compared to the figures of 2018-19. The overall score of Bihar was 747 out of 1,000, landing the state at the bottom 8th position (with grade III) among 37 states and UTs. The top-performing state was Punjab with 929 points. The PGI is a set of 70 parameters to catalyse transformational changes in the field of school education. “Bihar (81) and Meghalaya (87) recorded lowest scores in infrastructure and facilities domain. This is a cause for concern as a proper school building with adequate facilities is a must to improve the overall quality of school education. Indicators like availability of ICT facilities and timely availability of textbooks and uniform, which are critical inputs for better performance of students, are measured in the infrastructure and facilities domain,” the report stated while reasoning the weak performances in the domain. In learning outcome and quality, the state secured 17th position with 140 points out of 180 while it scored 62 out of 80 in access with 30th position. The access domain was based on several parameters, including net enrolment ratio at elementary and secondary levels, retention rate at primary, elementary and secondary levels and transition rate from primary to upper-primary levels and from upper-primary to secondary level and mainstreaming of out-of-school children. The state was 20th in equity domain (ratio between girls and boys) with a score of 214 out of 230. It got 250 out of 360 score in governance process (management and administration of school education). Sanjay Kumar, principal secretary of education department, said in the last three PGIs, Bihar performance in infrastructure and facilities has been declining, which was worrisome for the state. “In 2018-19, the overall point in this domain was 84 while 86 in 2017-18. We have to look into the different parameters of this domain to improve the performance,” he said. He also said the overall points in governance process have marginally improved, but the state could not implement a few things like centralised online system for recruitment of teachers and online system for teachers’ transfer. “Both the systems have been introduced this year and we will be able to claim 20 marks each on these two parameters. The department has been working on every domain to improve the overall points and rank. We have set the target to get more than 850 points. As we look at the overall points, we are indeed improving,” he said. Noted academician NK Choudhary said inspite of so much hallabaloo about education, the state has still fallen short in providing better infractructure and facilities. “No doubt we are improving in enrolment with decrease in dropout, but in relation to requirements, the state falls short. I am expecting the state government to take this report seriously and work on it, especially when the state has an education minister who is highly educated and very sensitive towards these issues,” he said. He added: “It is not enough to allocate certain funds for education sector, but it is also important that this amount should be well spent on the infrastructure and to improve quality education.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-last-in-infrastructure-facilities-in-school-education/articleshow/83672968.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Fake versions of herbal drug flood market||VIJAYAWADA: With rising demand for Bonigi Anandaiah’s herbal concoction that purportedly cures Covid-19, some miscreants are trying to capitalise on the situation by selling fake versions across the state. According to police sources, ever since police restricted entry into Krishnapatnam village, people desperately looking for the herbal medicine have been trying to sneak in. Further, many people are reported to have visited Anandaiah’s place only to see how the medicine is being made and set up their own shops. “We have found many people coming up with the concept of ‘Anandaiah Mandu’ which they are either selling or distributing for free. These are not something that Ayush officials have had tested. They were prepared merely after taking a glance at the concoction,” said a senior police official. Police have already busted eight such centres in the state. On May 28, police arrested a Yedavalli Venkatesh, a resident of Varakavipudi village of Nellore district, for selling a homemade concoction in the name of ‘Krishnapatnam medicine’. On June 13, police arrested another person in Guntur district’s Tadikonda for selling ‘Anandaiah’s Covid medicine’ and seized 150 packets of the said medicine along with Rs 1.5 lakh cash. Investigation revealed that the accused, A Kantha Rao, had sold 750 packets of the concoction for Rs 200 each. Police officials pointed out that some people are even distributing their concoctions for free thinking that the ingredients used in them are harmless and may work. So far, eight such cases have been registered in connection with the sale of fake herbal concoctions. Police further say that black marketing of the actual Anandaiah medicine has become a menace in Krishnapatnam and adjoining villages where the herbal concoction is selling for Rs 3,000 to Rs 10,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fake-versions-of-herbal-drug-flood-market/articleshow/83673557.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

He also criticized Chirag’s uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras and other LJP MPs, saying the step taken by them was wrong and to serve personal interest. Das said Chirag is young and had his father’s blessings. “He understands politics well and it is up to him to take the right decision,” Das told the media at the Congress state headquarters on the occasion of the birthday of the party’s former president Rahul Gandhi. When asked what would be the right decision for Chirag to take and whether he will welcome him in Congress, Das replied, “I cannot say what is right or wrong. Congress is open to all, be it Dalits, backwards or people of any caste or religion. People have been coming and going. However, I cannot comment unless Chirag’s opinion is known.” Das even denied any division in state Congress, saying all its MLAs were intact and would remain with the party. Sources said Das later met all the MLAs. Seventeen out of the 19 MLAs were present and two are expected to meet Das on Sunday. Das reached Patna on Saturday to participate in the Covid-related relief programme on the occasion of Rahul’s birthday, which was celebrated as Sewa Diwas. “Rahul Gandhi’s life is devoted to poor, labourers and common people. Taking a cue from his devotion, Covid kits have been distributed among the needy people. On Rahul’s instruction, each and every Congress worker has extended all possible help during the Covid,” Das said. State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha, CLP leader Ajit Shrama and other party leaders were also present on the occasion. State Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre said similar relief works were initiated in all the districts of Bihar. The youth wing of state Congress distributed ration and organized blood donation camps on the occasion. Youth wing president Gunjan Patel said they will be carrying out an awareness programme regarding Covid-19 vaccination and help people in getting vaccine shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congs-das-praises-chirag-denies-any-division-in-party/articleshow/83672420.cms||Sheezan Nezami

She also alleged that her son’s kidney was taken out, too. The woman has also alleged that the incident was reported to the DM, but no action was taken. The commission has directed the DM to submit the inquiry report within ten days for hearing the matter again on July 14. The woman, Mita Vishwakarma of Dariyapur Gola in Patna, lost her only son Piyush Vishwakarma, a probationary officer in Canara Bank at Pune. His father Virendra Vishwakarma is a senior photo journalist with a Hindi daily. The BHRC has asked the DM to inquire into her complaint lodged on May 25 this year that her son died at the hospital due to negligence despite paying a bill of Rs7.23 lakh through medical insurance. As per the complaint, Piyush was admitted to the hospital on April 27 and died on May 7 night. Mita alleged that her son had informed over the phone that his treatment was not being done properly. Later, his cellphone charger and vaporising machine were also misplaced by the hospital staff. She also alleged that a doctor attending on him didn’t reply properly when contacted over the phone and another one misbehaved with her husband when he tried to seek details after Piyush was shifted to the ICU on May 1. When asked what was the basis of the allegations that his kidney was taken out, Vishwakarma’s counsel Dr SK Jha said large amount of clotted blood was present in the urine bag and his parents suspected foul play. “The body was packed. They were only allowed to see the face. They had urged for postmortem, which was not conducted and they were forced to cremate the body,” he said. “We have been informed by media sources that a complaint has been raised in the state human rights commission. The allegations of removal of kidney and negligence in treatment are completely baseless. We will support the authorities concerned in the investigation,” the management team of the private hospital said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dm-to-probe-into-complaint-of-death-due-to-medical-negligence/articleshow/83672433.cms||Debashish Karmakar

ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said railway permanent ways inspector (PWI) took notice of the landslide and heaps of boulders scattered on the railway tracks around 5:17am. “Acting swiftly, he immediately informed the railway control room of Dhanbad division about the landslide. The incoming Rajdhani Express special train was stopped in time to avert any possible mishap on the tracks,” he said. He added: “The battery box of the locomotive was partly damaged as it dashed against the boulders. The damaged locomotive was replaced soon and the train carried on its onward journey for Ranchi around 8.05am. The rescue team rushed to the spot and removed the boulders from the tracks after three hours of traffic operation detention on the section.” According to Kumar, operations of nine special passenger trains, including eight mail and express trains, were affected due to the landslide. “Railways has adopted all precautionary measures on this route, following the landslide. All passenger trains are passing with full caution while railway safety staff are still on the job to repair the damages, if any, on the tracks as well as ensure foolproof safety to each passing special passenger or goods train on this particular route,” the CPRO said, adding the Baskatwa Block Hut-Nathganj Ghat section is the most vulnerable stretch due to mountain terrains. Meanwhile, railways has started special patrolling of the tracks on this route and put its safety staff on high alert at a time when landslide and intermittent rain lashed the areas during the past 24 hours. Besides, railways has set up an emergency control room at booth ECR headquarters in Hajipur and Dhanbad control room to keep a close watch on traffic movements on this route, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/close-shave-for-delhi-ranchi-rajdhani-express-due-to-landslide/articleshow/83673060.cms||Kumod Verma

They say it is a sheer waste of money as no conclusive results are achieved. A paediatrician, Dr Arun Shah, observes that the antibodies present in individuals after infection or vaccination are not true indicators of the level of their immunity. “Pathological lab reports can often be misleading and give a false sense of security to people,” he adds. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P), also advises people not to take antibody tests unnecessarily as “they are required only in some special cases”. “The results are only indicative, not conclusive,” he says. The AIIMS-P doctor, however, points out that people may have to undergo the test before taking the booster dose after a year in order to ascertain whether they have developed antibodies or not. Echoing similar views, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, the dean of the School of Health and Medicine in Aryabhatta Knowledge University, asks people not to rush for antibody tests as they serve a limited purpose. “A lack of antibodies does not mean that people’s natural immune system cannot fight the virus. Similarly, their presence does not mean that they can provide protection from reinfection,” he claims. A biotechnology teacher in Patna University, Birendra Prasad, also feels that antibody tests serve little purpose. “What will a person do if he finds out that he does not have sufficient antibodies even after taking both the doses of vaccines? What will he do if he knows that a good number of antibodies have not developed in his body after recovering from Covid?,” he asks. Prasad, however, asserts that antibody tests provide information that helps scientists predict future transmission of the virus by determining what proportion of the population is still at risk and identify environments where transmission is particularly high. “The test may also help identify the people, who can donate their blood with antibodies for treating Covid positive patients,” he adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/undergoing-antibody-test-sheer-waste-of-money-advise-doctors/articleshow/83672992.cms||B K Mishra

LJP MP from Jamui, Chirag Paswan, has called a meeting of his faction’s national executive in New Delhi on Sunday. Paras named Khagaria MP Choudhary Mehboob Ali Kaiser and Vaishali MP Veena Devi besides Sunita Sharma as the party’s national vice-presidents. Similarly, Nawada MP Chandan Singh and Samastipur MP Prince Raj besides Sanjay Saraf and Ramji Singh have been made the national general secretaries. Vinod Nagar has been named the national treasurer. Sanjay and Vinod have also been named the national spokespersons of the party. “Different cells and committees at the national and the state levels will be formed soon,” Paras said. The development comes a day after both warring factions staked their claim over the party with the Election Commission of India (ECI). The ECI is yet to come to any conclusion on the issue. In the memorandum submitted to the commission, the Paras group had claimed that he was elected as the party president by 75 members of the national executive committee during a meeting in Patna on June 17. In addition, a new working committee had been formed. “Both are valid as per the constitution of the party,” the Paras-led faction said in the memorandum submitted to the commission on Friday evening. On the other hand, the Chirag-led faction pointed out that the election of Paras as the new LJP president was “unconstitutional”. “The rebel group led by Paras is working against the party’s constitution,” Abdul Khalid, a close confidante of Chirag, told this reporter.

The stamps and registration department, which collects a percentage for registration of properties, is one of the top revenue contributors, is once again struggling to meet its targets. May, in particular, saw a drastic decrease in the registrations of properties in Vizag. Within Vizag urban limits, only 852 documents were registered in May 2021, against over 1,900 documents during the corresponding period in 2020. However, the eight sub-registrar offices in Vizag city raked in over Rs 654 crore in the 2020-21 financial year and achieved over 81% of its target. In 2019-20, this figure had stood at Rs 595 crore. K Manmadha Rao, Vizag district registrar, said the department generated revenue of over Rs 58 crore in April 2021. “The virus hit revenue in May 2021 as people stopped registering properties due to the curfew and restrictions on transport,” he said. Vizianagaram district witnessed similar low registration rates and could only generate a revenue of over Rs 8 crore in May 2021. The district generated revenue of Rs s240 crore through property registrations in 2020-21 against its target of Rs 241.8 crore. Of this, Bhogapuram office generated revenue of Rs 37 crore amid the buzz of the greenfield airport and the area’s proximity to the proposed executive capital in Vizag. Speaking to STOI, president of Credai, B Raja Srinivas, said the second wave dealt a blow to the real estate sector with several flats going unsold in Vizag city and in Vizianagaram. “We are expecting sale of flats to commence after a few months as the pandemic has created fear among people. If things get better soon, the region will witness massive growth in the sector,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-slows-down-property-registrations/articleshow/83673216.cms||Nalla.Babu

The woman, a native of Awadhpur village under Punpun block in Patna district, had gone to take the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine at a camp organized at Beldarichak Utkramit Madhya Vidyalaya on Wednesday. However, she took one dose of Covaxin and was given Covishield after a gap of a few minutes. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Singh said vaccination was going on in different rooms of that school. “As per the information given by the centre in-charge, due to heavy rainfall, the queue had dispersed and this elderly woman after taking one vaccine stood in another queue where another vaccine was being given,” said Dr Singh. However, neither the administration nor the woman herself is aware of which vaccine she got first. The incident came into light after she told her family members about it. The civil surgeon said they were closely monitoring her health status every day and there was no issue. She further said to deputed ANM there. State health department additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit said he has asked for a detailed report and action will be taken against those found negligent towards their duty. Pratyaya said a clear instruction had already been given to all the districts not to send two different vaccines to one centre the same day, to avoid any confusion. He further said the woman was fit and fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-given-2-different-vaccines-same-day-is-fine/articleshow/83672875.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Vijayawada||More IAS officers in Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation shuffled||VIJAYAWADA: The shuffling of IAS officers in the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is adding more fuel to the speculation that chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy is likely to shift is base to the port city by end of July. Last week the government shuffled close to a dozen senior officers in the civic body, shifting some officers, repatriating some, and posting some new officers to bolster the GVMC administration, which would have a big role to play once the coastal city becomes the executive capital of the state. On Saturday, the government withdrew the services of GVMC additional commissioner Tameem Ansaria, a 2015 batch IAS officer, and posted her as special officer in charge of Srisailam project and for the MIG housing programme in Rayalaseema. Additional commissioner-1, P Ashajyothi, was transferred and posted as additional director in the office of the commissioner and director of municipal administration (CDMA). The civic body’s zonal commissioner-3 was also transferred and asked to report to the CDMA for further posting. Bobbili municipal commissioner Mallayya Naidu was transferred and posted as zonal commissioner of GVMC. Similarly, Srikakulam additional commissioner K Siva Prasad has also been transferred and posted as zonal commissioner in the GVMC. The government has also repatriated GVMC urban community development project officer B Sanyasi Naidu to his parent cooperative department. Meanwhile, the state government has accepted the inter-state transfer of IAS officer S Ilakkiya, of the 2017 batch Kerala cadre, to the AP cadre. After her admission into the AP cadre, the government has posted her as Rajamahendravaram sub-collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/more-ias-officers-in-gvmc-shuffled/articleshow/83673502.cms||Gopi Dara

The two hospitals have been declared centres of excellence for the treatment and effective management of the deadly disease. According to doctors, around 60% of the mucormycosis patients undergoing treatment at the AIIMS-P and the IGIMS are either diabetic or suffering from comorbidities. The remaining are infected due to immunosuppression as a result of Covid-19 and the unwarranted use of steroids. Reiterating the doctors’ claim, an official of the health department pointed out that most mucormycosis cases were being diagnosed in people, who belonged to the age group of 40 to 59 years. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the AIIMS-P, told this reporter on Saturday that mucormycosis was primarily affecting men in the age group of 40 to 59 years. “All those who had received high doses of steroids during Covid treatment are suffering from the disease,” he added. Of the 119 mucormycosis patients admitted to the AIIMS-P so far, 37 were discharged and 19 died. Those being treated at the hospital also included three kids from Begusarai, Siwan and Buxar, who were below the age of 12 years. Dr Manish Mandal, the superintendent of the IGIMS, said, “The fungal infection is mostly attacking diabetics in the age group of 40 to 59 years. It has also claimed the lives of patients above the age of 45.” Of the 100 mucormycosis patients, who had been admitted to the IGIMS for treatment, 63 were discharged and 40 died. While 38% of the mucormycosis patients at the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital are in the age group of 40 to 55 years, 37% are in the 30-39 age group. The hospital’s nodal officer for Covid, Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, pointed out, “People above the age of 40 years usually have low immunity, which dips further when they contract Covid-19.” The Patna Medical College and Hospital, on the other hand, is treating 21 mucormycosis patients at present. Six people have succumbed to the fungal infection so far. Mucormycosis affects the facial area, including the mouth, sinus, face and eyes. In severe cases, it can attack the central nervous system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/52-of-black-fungus-patients-fall-in-40-59-age-group-hosps/articleshow/83671995.cms||Faryal Rumi

They are at their wits’ end as they are finding it difficult to run their families with a limited income. Talking to this reporter on Thursday, former JD (U) MLC, Ranbir Nandan, said, “With a steep rise in the prices of diesel and petrol, the cost of several items like vegetables and foodgrains has also gone up. The abnormal increase in the prices of fuels has also led to a rise in the cost of transportation, construction, fertilizers, and education.” Nandan urged the Union government to check the rising cost of fuels for the sake of the people belonging to the lower strata of the society. N K Chaudhary, the former head of the economics department in Patna University, observed that poor families had been badly affected by the spiralling prices of essential commodities like cooking oil and pulses. “The economically weaker sections that cover a large part of the state’s population are burdened by the hike in prices of vegetables, oils, cereals and pulses. The government should, therefore, take immediate steps to control price rise,” he demanded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rising-prices-hit-people-many-at-their-wits-end/articleshow/83672533.cms||B K Mishra

A two-hour event will be beamed live by the State Ayush Society of the health department from 7am to 9am on the occasion. The Ayush Society has appealed to people to register themselves on its website ayush.bihar.gov.in for the event. “The ministry of Ayush will carry out one-hour yoga session from 7-8am, which will be participated by PM Narendra Modi as well. The session would be streamed live on all Ayush Bihar platforms,” Arvinder Singh, executive director of State Ayush Society, said. “Besides, the society will carry out another one-hour yoga session from 8 to 9am. Qualified yoga instructors from across Bihar have been roped in to show different exercises, which people can follow from the comfort of their homes. Senior officers of Ayush Bihar would also be present in the session,” he said. The theme set by the United Nations (UN) for the seventh Yoga Day this year is ‘Yoga for well-being’. A message for Yoga Day by the UN states that beyond its immediate impact on physical health, the Covid-19 pandemic has also exacerbated psychological suffering and mental health problems, including depression and anxiety, as pandemic-related restrictions continue in various forms in many countries. “The message of yoga in promoting both the physical and mental well-being of humanity has never been more relevant...Yoga is also playing a significant role in the psycho-social care and rehabilitation of Covid-19 patients in quarantine and isolation. It is particularly helpful in allaying their fears and anxiety,” the UN message reads. Dr Ratnesh Chaudhary, in-charge of physiotherapy and yoga at Indira Gandhi institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), said yoga targets diseases through prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. “It would be very limiting to call yoga an exercise because it is not just that but a lifestyle. It has therapeutic values and can help people with hypertension, stress, cancer and even Covid amongst many other issues,” he said. Dr Ratnesh said people who practises yoga would be better protected from Covid. “Certain breathing exercises help in keeping away the virus and the chances of contracting it are reduced exponentially. It strengthens the immune system, so even if a person contracts Covid, s/he would better respond to the treatment. Pranayama is an extremely good exercise for lungs,” he said, adding that post-Covid symptoms like loss of alertness, breathlessness etc can also be combated with yogic exercises. Yoga enthusiasts echoed similar claims about its benefits. “I had a hard time concentrating and my attention span was becoming shorter by the day due to which I had become very irritable. I have been practising yoga for more than three months and I can already feel a huge difference in myself. I have seen a lot of positive changes and calmness is one of them,” said Riddhi Anand, who is a full-time working professional hailing from Darbhanga and presently staying at Patna. “I was diagnosed with high blood pressure issue five years ago. For the last one year, I have been practising yoga religiously since it was highly recommended by my instructor. This has not only helped me in keeping my blood pressure levels balanced but has also become my favourite part of the day,” said Himanshu Pandey, a resident of Kankarbagh Colony, Patna. “As a student, I have to sit for long hours in online classes. From studies to entertainment, everything is happening through a screen which undoubtedly affects my sleep-schedule, resulting into laziness. I am making conscious efforts to practise yoga which helps me feel fresh all day long,” said Tanuja Kashyap, a college student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/yoga-day-events-to-be-online-for-the-2nd-consecutive-year/articleshow/83672706.cms||---

Two ponds which were in shambles and being used by the residents to throw garbage have been developed into beautiful water bodies where rohu, katla, mrigal and grass carp are cultured. Dilnawaz Ahmad, assistant commandant of the battalion and the brain behind the project, said, “Earlier, the place was a big eyesore, where residents of the nearby area used to dump garbage. The pond was dug up and beautified in an area of 0.4 acres of land. Around 1,000 fingerlings were dropped for culturing rohu, katla, mrigal and grass carp. These fish species have gained a weight of around 1kg.” Ahmad said an ornamental fish aquarium has also been constructed with household scrap material like worn-out septic tank pipes for giving support to roof made of fiber, auctioned helmets which jawans used to wear for making flower pots and other items. “Jugaad method was adopted for making this fish aquarium. We have 50 doctor fish, which are also known as spa fish. The aquarium is 15ft long and 12ft wide and has a depth of three feet. It was constructed at a bare minimum cost with the help of scrap material,” he said. Elaborating on spa or doctor fish, Shambhu Prasad Nayak, district fisheries officer, said, “If someone puts his legs in the water, these fish species will kiss them (legs). It gives a therapeutic effect. Besides, we have 50 gold fish besides molly and black carp also. The black carp is the scavenger, which eats waste material generated by other ornamental fish,” he added. Talking about the third pond, where the renovation and beautification work is going on, Ahmad said, “The pond is being developed in one acre of land with five feet pathway for devotees to offer arghya during Chhath Puja. It has staircases on the four sides with boating facilities. Apart from culturing fish, the pond will be used for other purposes. Our jawans and personnel from SDRF will also be provided training here for diving.” Ahmad said concrete chunks, debris of a demolished houses and other materials were used in making the pond, the sideways and embankments. “Officials from the fisheries department, building construction department and municipal corporation helped us beautify the area,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/once-dumping-grounds-two-katihar-ponds-beautified-to-rear-fish/articleshow/83673119.cms||---

Delhi government’s Women and Child Development has issued a standard operating procedure for foster care. Children, who have been orphaned or surrendered by their parents as they are either unfit or economically weak to take care of their wards, will be considered for foster care. The coronavirus pandemic gave birth to this idea, but other children who might be in a similar situation will also be eligible for foster care. According to an official, it is for the first time that they are initiating the system of foster care. While group foster care has been there with certain NGOs being part of it, the concept of a foster family is being started for the first time. The situation has been necessitated by the current pandemic as many children have been affected by it. The guidelines issued by the department state that “any individual who is fit to temporarily receive a child for care, protection or treatment, for a period as may be necessary, may be recognised by the Juvenile Justice Board or the Child Welfare Committee as a fit person and foster family”. For identifying a foster family, the board or the committee will consider their credentials, respectability, expertise, professional qualifications, experience of dealing with children and their willingness to receive the child. Other criterion that will be considered for the identification of foster families will be that they should not have been accused of an offence under the Juvenile Justice Act or involved in any immoral act or in act of child abuse or employment of child labour or in an offence involving moral turpitude. The duration of short term foster care shall be for a period of not more than one year. Long term foster care shall be for a period exceeding one year, it said.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Police case against woman for misuse of Pocso provisions||IDUKKI: In a bizarre case, police in the district have registered an FIR against a 39-year-old woman for misusing the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and influencing a 14-year-old girl to make false rape accusations against her brother and six others. Police had registered a Pocso case against the youth and six others last month after the girl raised rape allegations against them. The girl’s statement, given in the woman’s presence, was recorded and a medical examination had confirmed sexual abuse. “The girl said she was gangraped by her brother and his friends at her home between 10am and 1pm on May 15 and 16. But her parents said they were away from home only for 45 minutes on both days and that there was no chance that such an incident could have taken place. This raised our suspicion,” said DSP Francis Shelby. “After recording the girl's statement we shifted her to a shelter home. But in the record book kept at the shelter home, while filling in details, she wrote that she was not raped and that she raised the complaint based on the instructions of the woman,” said the officer. “So, we recorded her statement again and she revealed that she acted upon the woman’s words. When a medical examination was conducted on her again, this time under the guidance of a forensic surgeon, it ruled out rape or sexual abuse,” said Shelby. “We have provided a counselling to the girl and family. The woman was close to the girl’s family and used to regularly visit them. Later she had a fallout with the girl’s brother and we suspect that is why she used her influence on the girl and forced her to raise a fake complaint against her brother,” he added. “We have registered a case against the woman under Section 21 (1, 2) of Pocso Act. We will record her arrest after conducting a detailed probe. Steps will soon be taken to withdraw the complaint against the youths,” said Shelby, adding that it was a clear misuse of Pocso charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-case-against-woman-for-misuse-of-pocso-provisions/articleshow/83672123.cms||Sandeep Thomas

This is probably the first-of-its-kind initiative in the state. The century-old educational institution’s inoculation programme is being held at the Orange City Hospital and Research Institute (OCHRI) in city and the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (MGIMS) at Sewagram in Wardha district — both private organisations. Sanjay Bhargava, the chairman and trustee of Shiksha Mandal, said that though online classes were held, the “education of children has suffered greatly during the pandemic. “Regular classes need to resume for proper teaching and learning. Since vaccination is the key to tackle Covid, we started the drive for staff and students on June 10. The second dose will be in August,” he said. Saying that the Mandal is the first educational institution in the state to take up such a programme, Bhargava said, “After the second dose, we will seek government permission for physical classes.” In November last year, the Mandal had urged the state to allow resumption of offline classes. Founded by industrialist Jamnalal Bajaj, the Mandal is providing the vaccines under the Bajaj CSR programme. The institution, presided by Rahul Bajaj, runs one college in city and seven in Wardha. Totally, there are around 11,000 students — 3,000 in city and 8,000 in Wardha. Bhargava said that around 1,500 from city and 5,500 from Wardha are above 18 years of age. “Around 3,000 have been vaccinated (1,000 in city and 2,000 in Wardha) till Saturday. The remaining students will be inoculated by June 25,” he said, adding that consent was taken from the parents. After permitting vaccination of 18+ from May 1, the Centre had allowed industries and corporates to procure doses directly from manufacturers to inoculate staff and their family members in association with its own hospital, dispensary or any private hospital. The Mandal has bought 14,000 doses of Covishield from the Serum Institute of India and this includes the booster dose. OCHRI director Dr Anup Marar hoped that Bajaj Group’s social activity will inspire other industrial groups, educational and financial institutions. “Vaccination is the only key to control this pandemic,” he said.

---||Kochi||Kerala government to seek centre’s nod again||KOCHI: Months after the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) rejected its demand to declare wild boar as vermin, the state government will approach the ministry again with the same request. Coming under pressure from farmers who face wild boar attacks on their farmlands, the forest department has sent a letter to the state government demanding that the animal be declared a vermin. If the ministry issues a notification declaring the animal as vermin, it will allow its culling during the specified period without one getting entangled in the clutches of law. The vermin tag will rob the wild boars of the protection it currently gets under schedule 4 of wildlife protection act. “Many other states had approached the MoEF with the same request. The ministry declares wild animals as vermin only for a certain specific period and that too in selected regions,” said an official with the forest department. Our request is to make it applicable across the state, he said. Presently, wild boars, which pose a threat to crops and humans, can be killed but only with the permission of the forest department. As many as 173 wild boars were killed from May last year to June this year. “We have extended the validity of the order allowing the killing of wild boars to one more year. Instead of extending the order every time, our request is to declare the animal as vermin. Many cases filed by farmers are under the consideration of various courts. But the fact is that humans encroach forest land which leads to conflicts with wildlife,” said the officer.A licenced person, approved by the divisional forest officers can kill the wild boar. As per an earlier order, only DFOs were allowed to give the permission to shoot the wild boars. Lately, range officers have also been allowed to give the approval. Of the 173 wild boars killed, 70 were in Kozhikode division alone. “We give permission to those who come with a panchayat resolution letter and a recommendation of the panchayat president. When they do not get food, they enter human habitations,” said Kozhikode DFO M Rajeevan. The forest department spends around Rs 10 crore annually to provide compensation to farmers for crop and property damage, and for deaths and injuries suffered due to wild animal attacks in human habitations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-to-seek-centres-nod-again/articleshow/83672139.cms||T C Sreemol

---||Mumbai||Sleep comes easily lying next to my son, says nocturnal father||Salil Ansari (name changed), a 47-year-old pharma consultant with high metabolism, has stopped munching on raw sugar throughout the day as he used to. This is among the side-effects of living with his 15-year-old son, who ran away from his mother’s house in September last year, hopped into a rickshaw straight to Ansari’s house and never went back. Since then, besides asking his father to go easy on his sugar intake, the teen also filled his father’s house with verbal confections: “Dad, did you have food?”  The “beautiful feeling” of “being cared for” is an unprecedented experience for Ansari, an estranged father whose battle for the custody of his son began in 2009 when he started referring to his wife as “the mother of my child”. His wife had served him a separation notice which, he says, gave him custody of their three-year-old son. “In 2010, a few goons came home and took my son away,” says Ansari, after which his life became a blur of contempt notices, writ petitions, court dates and bitter exchanges with the estranged wife who had, by then, remarried. “Yes sir, I am in contempt of court,” Ansari told a judge one day in 2015 while righteously representing himself in a contempt of court case filed by the mother when her son did not return home after the stipulated access time had passed. The judge had then asked Ansari to find a lawyer. Years whizzed past as Ansari played father in installments, meeting his son for two hours a fortnight in court and on house visits.  “I may not be a great person or even a great dad but the advantage I have over other dads is that I come from a broken family,” says Ansari, a science graduate and language teacher.  Two and a half years ago, he took his son for an outstation trip for the first time to a school in his native town. “When he saw the activities and the educational trips that students undertake, he started nurturing the idea of joining that school,” says Ansari, adding that the son was to undergo a test in March 2020 to ascertain if he was fit to enter standard nine. After a lull during which Ansari says he couldn’t reach his son, he would get a call from the boy saying: “Dad, I don’t want to go anywhere,” says Ansari.  “He was standing outside my colony. He said it was one of those rare times when he was alone at home and decided that he didn’t want to stay there,” says Ansari, who has befriended his son over movies, games and the quirks of his English teacher during online school. At night, sleep came easily to the formerly-nocturnal Ansari while lying next to his son who would say: “Dad, run your fingers through my hair.”At other times, the son became the father. “Dad, it’s time. You should get married again,” the 15-year-old recently said to Ansari, for whom this was less a suggestion and more a verdict from the boy who wants to become a judge “because of all that he has seen”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sleep-comes-easily-lying-next-to-my-son-says-nocturnal-father/articleshow/83673895.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

Malkajgiri resident, Susheel Kumar Gaikwad, who has represented Telangana in multiple competitions, developed Covid-19 symptoms in the last week of April and was subsequently admitted to a local hospital in early May. Since his condition steadily started deteriorating, he was rushed to Yashoda Hospital on May 19 where a multidisciplinary team including pulmonologists, intensive care specialists, respiratory therapy, physiotherapy and allied specialists attended to him. Doctors treating Susheel said that his dramatic recovery is rooted in various reasons: underlying fitness, positive attitude, determination and willingness to face the odds. They said, the young body builder has now become a role model for critically-ill patients. “He has completely recovered now from being almost on the verge of death. He still requires oxygen, around one to two liters, when walking but is mostly comfortable without oxygen otherwise. We can’t say anything about his latest CT score as there were coexisting bacterial and fungal lung infection too,” said Dr Vishveshwaran Balasubramanian, senior pulmonologist, Yashoda Hospitals, Malakpet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-body-builder-makes-miraculous-recovery-from-covid/articleshow/83675712.cms||---

Senior congress leader and MLA K Babu took to Facebook to condemn the development and said that the action bares the level of cruelty the Left and Pinarayi Vijayan can live with. “Providing jobs to the wives of the accused who are in judicial custody for brutally killing our brothers Kripesh and Sarath Lal, with the recommendation of the CPM is highly condemnable and cruel,” said Babu. He said the Pinarayi government has been trying to derail the investigations into the Periye double murder case from the beginning and that it tried to prevent a CBI investigation by spending a lot of money from the public exchequer. “By offering government jobs to the wives of the accused they are ridiculing the public. Is this the welfare model of the Left government?” Babu said, adding that the government should immediately reconsider its decision. Kripesh and Sarath Lal were murdered on February 17, 2019. All the accused are either CPM members or sympathisers. Meanwhile, the CPM district committee has dismissed the involvement of the party in the appointments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/protest-over-jobs-to-wives-of-accused-in-periye-case/articleshow/83672274.cms||---

The 51-year-old undertrial, who was facing six cases, including one under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and was arrested on February 1, was found hanging inside the toilet on Friday night. His brother Badan Singh said he could not believe that Bhure killed himself as he knew that he was granted bail by court and would have been out of jail soon. Jail superintendent Vijay Vikram Singh said, “Forensic team didn’t find any injury marks on the body and there was no evidence of foul play. A magisterial probe has been ordered.” Bhure, a resident of Bhadkara village in Sirauli area of Bareilly, was first booked under section 8/15 of the NDPS Act in 2001. He is survived by 43-year-old wife and three minor children, a daughter and two sons. One of his sons is disabled. His brother Badan Singh told TOI, “I got a missed call from the jailor and when I called back, I was told that my brother had killed himself. I cannot believe that my brother has killed himself as I spoke to him four days ago when he called me from the jail. I had told him that he had been granted bail and the formalities would be completed soon. I had told him that he would be out of jail either on Monday or Tuesday. We have not got any satisfactory response from the officials. Police brought him alive from home and his safety was their responsibility.” Jail superintendent Vijay Vikram Singh replied, “We didn’t know what was going in Bhure’s mind that he took such a step and ended his life. At 7 pm, the barrack was closed. He went to the toilet to relieve himself nearly at 1.15 am and didn’t return. Nearly at 2 am, he was found hanging with a towel by another inmate. He was immediately brought down and the emergency medical officer in the jail examined him and found him dead. There were no signs of injury or force used on him. It appears to be a case of suicide. The autopsy report will clear the doubts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/undertrial-granted-bail-by-court-found-hanging-inside-toilet-of-bareilly-dist-jail/articleshow/83670947.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Speaking about the deployment of the Indian air force (IAF) at the Galwan valley, Bhadauria said: “During the diplomatic talks, we would go for disengagement at balance friction points and follow it up with de-escalation at Eastern Ladakh borders. There has definitely been an increase in the deployment at key positions.” While the 11th round of talks recently took place between India and China, the next round of talks are set to take place soon. “There is a proposal to conduct commander-level talks. While the diplomatic talks are on, we are parallelly monitoring the ground realities closely,” said Bhadauria, adding that there is no question of letting the guard down at the borders. As far as the IAF was concerned, Bhadauria assured that it had the capability to deploy at a short notice as per ground realities and requirements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/forces-deployment-upped-at-borders-iaf-chief/articleshow/83675780.cms||---
---||Kochi||Study predicts rise in sea level in Lakshadweep||KOCHI: Sea levels will rise around the Lakshadweep Islands in the range between 0.4 mm/year and 0.9 mm/year in the coming years. The study by researchers from IIT Kharagpur comes at a time when there is an ongoing debate on the several proposed constructions in the islands. One of the major threats in the coming years is rising sea level and its significant impact on small islands and this is for the first time that climate model projections were used to assess the potential areas of inundation in Lakshadweep islands in the Arabian Sea. The research published in the journal ‘Regional Studies in Marine Science, Elsevier, showed that the coastal inundation could have wide socio-economic impact. The scientists said that the projected inundation due to sea-level rise can impact the islanders as residential areas are quite close to the present coastline. Also, the only airport in the archipelago is located at the southern tip of Agatti island and has a high likelihood of damage due to inundation from sea-level rise. A team of scientists, including Aysha Jennath, Athira Krishnan, Saikat Kumar Paul and Prasad K Bhaskaran jointly from the department of architecture and regional planning and department of ocean engineering and naval architecture, IIT Kharagpur, with the support science and technology ministry under the climate change programme, conducted the study. They had studied the climate projections of sea-level rise and associated coastal inundation in the atolls, a ring-shaped coral reef or island. It estimated that smaller islands Chetlat and Amini are expected to have major land loss. Projection mapping indicated that about 60-70% of the existing shoreline would experience land loss in Amini and about 70-80% in Chetlat. The present work highlights that larger islands Minicoy and the capital Kavaratti are also vulnerable to sea-level rise and expected to experience land-loss along 60% of the existing shoreline. The researchers suggested that it is necessary to have appropriate coastal protection measures in the wake of changes in the Arabian Sea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/study-predicts-rise-in-sea-level-in-dweep/articleshow/83672257.cms||---

It is practised due to lack of awareness on CWC and its role. Police take a written consent from the victims and send them without addressing their psychological issues. Parents are made to submit an undertaking that they will not conduct the marriage until the girl turns 18. But, they not followed up thereafter.Recently, a 17-year-old girl stopped her marriage organised against her wishes by her parents by sending a message to the police officials. The Anna Nagar police conducted an inquiry and allowed the girl to go with her relatives after getting her consent. However, the girl committed suicide.“A child whose marriage is stopped should be considered as a victim and produced before the CWC, which is the competent body to decide on her safety. It has to be done within 24 hours. CWC should conduct an inquiry with parents and the situation leading to organizing the marriage,” A Narayanan, a child rights activist from Chennai said. Officials from the Madurai CWC said that the death of the17-year-old is very unfortunate. She would not have died if she was produced before the CWC. “We have a female member. We would have given counselling and brought out what really was in the girl’s mind. She would not have taken the extreme step had she been sent to a home. When victims spend some time with fellow children away from their parents it would bring about a change,” said a member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/concern-as-victims-of-child-marriage-are-not-produced-before-cwc/articleshow/83675759.cms||V Devanathan

The CM congratulated IFFCO scientists for the feat, stating that the eco-friendly, effective and sustainable nano liquid urea fertilizer will prove to be a boon to farmers and usher in a change in the traditional methods of farming. He said this nano urea liquid will be sold to the farmers at 10 per cent less cost than subsidized urea. The nano urea liquid grains are far smaller in size and volume than conventional granular urea and is absorbed by plants more effectively when sprayed, causing less wastage. Greater use of conventional urea causing damage to soil is a matter of concern all over the world, Rupani said, and added that liquid nano urea will be the solution, preserving nutrients in the soil, saving water, electricity, costs and the environment. The nano urea (liquid) has been developed and tested according to the guidelines of the central government’s biotechnology department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cm-launches-nano-urea-liquid-fertilizer/articleshow/83673930.cms||---

Thousands of them who were job providers are today job seekers still searching for jobs. What is really prevailing is tax terrorism, as far as this new system is concerned, he said. Hence, he urged the minister to constitute a high level committees at the state and Union levels to make the tax system simplified. Traders who pay more than Rs1 lakh crore as tax, have to spend a lot to file their taxes. Earlier, they were able to file the TNGST and VAT without the help of an auditor.A long pending demand that has not been addressed by the GST council till date is the taxing for essential commodities like rice, wheat and dhal if they are sold under a brand name. This is forcing many companies which established a brand name after a lot of efforts to give up the same. This would also mean giving up the move to promote quality products. Hence, the tax should be the same essential commodities whether they are branded or not.In another representation to the minister, the Tamil Nadu Foodgrains Merchants Association urged that the government should implement the Samadhan scheme as already announced in the assembly for pending taxes, without penalty or interest. This would benefit the traders immensely. Kerala, Karnataka and some others states have got relief by implementing the Samadhan scheme after the GST came into effect from July 1, 2017, president of the association, S P Jeyapragasam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/trade-bodies-seek-relief-in-gst-system/articleshow/83675793.cms||---

All sections of the society including the government, law enforcing authorities and politicians have to be sensitized on the need to put an end to custodial deaths and torture, she said adding that many such tortures and murders continue without our knowledge or media attention.The Sathankulam Declaration stated that there should be no detention without lawful arrests. Executive director Henry Tiphagne said it was common for a person to be taken into custody without arrest and motored around the highway evading CCTVs, till an investigating officer interrogated him. Arrest and detention should be exercised judiciously and the rights of the arrested person included knowing the name and identification of the person who was arresting him.Medical examination should be conducted on people immediately after arrest and medical officers before whom they are produced should subject them to a series of tests. No interrogation should take place in the night. These were some of the important highlights of the 14-point declaration. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/end-custodial-deaths-through-cultural-change-kanimozhi/articleshow/83675816.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Turnout poor in Mumbai on Day 1 of vax drive for 30-44 group||MUMBAI: The first day of free Covid-19 vaccination for the 30-44 age-group got a lukewarm response, with only 1,778 Mumbaikars turning up for the shot. In contrast, the neighbouring NMMC managed to vaccinate 6,058 people in the same age-group on Saturday. BMC officials said they didn’t get time to spread the word about slots becoming available for the 30-44 age-group. “We got the state’s directive on the 30-44 age-group late in the evening on Friday. Moreover, due to technical issues, we could only make Covishield vaccines for this age-group available at only 10 of our 267 centres. This may have led to the poor turnout,” said a senior BMC official. On Saturday, 74,630 people got vaccinated in Mumbai; 72% got the shot in private centres. However, the BMC expects better response from Monday, when the youngsters will be allowed to walk in at most centres -- barring those meant for international travellers and those offering Covaxin shots. “Software inputs are such that we cannot mix the 30-44 age-group with international travellers, who could be students who are 18. Also, the gap between two Covaxin shots is lower than the gap for Covishield shots. Hence, we have decided to keep these groups separate,” the official said. Additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said BMC would on Monday discuss the feasibility of opening up vaccination for the entire 18-44 age-group. “Opening up would require a lot of arrangements, especially since we want to avoid crowding at the centres, but we will discuss the possibility,” he said. On May 1, as per the union government’s directive, BMC started free vaccination for the 18-44 age-group but had to discontinue it due to shortage of vaccines. With vaccine availability likely to improve for public centres, the BMC hopes the numbers of recipients will be bigger from Monday onwards. In Navi Mumbai, the response was better as 25 centres were given the target of vaccinating at least 100 people each and the four civic hospitals were asked to immunize 300 each. The jumbo centre at ESIC hospital was asked to vaccinate 1,000 beneficiaries. Long queues were seen at all centres, and NMMC hopes to get a similar response in coming days. NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar has appealed to residents to come forward to get the jab. The state vaccinated 2,23,748 people on Friday. The total number of vaccine doses given out in Maharashtra is 2.7 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/turnout-poor-in-mumbai-city-on-day-1-of-vax-drive-for-30-44-group/articleshow/83677964.cms||---

By then, stealth mode had become second nature for Patil who quietly placed chocolates inside plastic bags attached to a rope lowered by the twins from the balcony of their mother’s home in Thane in the past. Today, the banker merely has to step into his bedroom to hand them goodies and proudly shows off his face to their teachers at virtual parent-teacher meetings. Patil’s girls have been staying with him since September 2020 after a six-year-long separation. It was in 2014 when his wife took off for her maternal home in Thane with the kids that the banker found himself evicted from fatherhood. Soon, Patil was staring at a separation notice. After shedding daily paternal tears, watching his mother sink into depression and pulling over his car outside his daughters’ Thane school for months, Patil says he managed to seek a “parental plan” through legal intervention. According to the plan, he was allowed to meet the kids for an hour every fortnight in the premises of the Thane court where he bumped into many men in similar shoes. They slipped him the numbers of a support group that Patil could not join because he was transferred to Assam on account of his slacking performance. “I was not able to focus on work. I was an emotional wreck,” recalls Patil, who not only had to seek leave but also had to spend Rs 12,000 every fortnight to fly down to see his kids during the stipulated hours. Eventually, he quit, found a job close to home and following a year of “struggles, debates and fights” with his wife, watched his kids grow in spurts between October 2015 and January 2020 when he was allowed to take them home on the first and fourth Saturdays of every month. Patil finds it unfair that the law deems the mother as the “natural custodian” in divorce cases even though society was growing “unisexual” in other ways. It was when he heard the wife had enrolled one of his daughters in a military school in Pune “because she was growing aggressive” that he sought intervention and “got possession” of the kids in September 2020. Today, the father in him is making up for lost time. While he is unable to take them out to theatres for movies as he used to during their brief meetings, the trio simulate their pre-lockdown camaraderie by pairing popcorn and cold drinks with animated flicks at home. “It was all goody-goody earlier,” says Patil who’s now learning to “assert” his authority when the girls refuse to attend classes and accuse him of favouritism during a bout of sibling fights. “Whatever I missed out on, I’m getting everything back in multiple folds,” says the banker who also teaches his daughters maths and science in his free time. “They’re good girls,” he says about the teens. Though he feels awkward hugging the teen daughters, he receives their hugs when he returns home. Patil works from the office to focus. “I can’t let go of this job,” he says. “I have to take care of them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-i-am-getting-back-everything-i-missed-out-on-gushes-twins-dad/articleshow/83673945.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||India||Stick to 5-fold Covid norms as curbs are relaxed, states told||NEW DELHI: Asking all states and Union Territories to stick to the five-fold strategy of Covid-appropriate behaviour, test-track-treat and vaccination while easing restrictions imposed in view of second Covid wave, the Centre on Saturday said any rise in cases should be prevented at the micro-level itself with local containment measures. "Regular monitoring of Covid appropriate behaviour is required to prevent relapse. However, easing of restrictions in some states has led to resumption of crowding of people in markets etc. without adherence to the norms. It is, therefore essential to ensure that complacency does not set in, and there is no let-up in adhering to Covid appropriate behaviour, while opening up activities," home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said in a letter sent to all state chief secretaries and UT administrators. While noting that relaxation of curbs and opening of normal activities was essential in the wake of decline in cases, Bhalla said the whole process must be carefully calibrated. Emphasising on carrying forward the test-track-treat strategy to contain the spread of infection on a sustainable basis, the home ministry asked the states to ensure that testing rates are kept up. "As the situation is dynamic, a close watch needs to be kept on early signs of a surge in active cases or high positivity rates. A system should be in place at the micro-level to ensure that whenever cases rise in a smaller place, it gets checked there itself, through local containment measures as per the existing guidelines issued by ministry of health and family welfare," said Bhalla. Adding that vaccination against Covid-19 was critical to breaking the chain of transmission, the Centre directed the state and UT governments to step up the pace of vaccination, covering the maximum number of people in an expeditious manner. The home secretary urged the states/UTs to issue directions to district and all other authorities concerned, to keep a close watch on the situation, as activities are opened in a cautious manner, and to scrupulously ensure that there is no complacency in adhering to Covid appropriate behaviour and in the test-track-treat-vaccinate policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stick-to-5-fold-covid-norms-as-curbs-are-relaxed-states-told/articleshow/83679442.cms||---

Police have found that the man was in touch with some international groups through WhatsApp. A fake Army ID card was also recovered from him. The man was identified as Dilip Kumar, a resident of Sainik Enclave in Mohan Garden. Police said around 3pm, they received information about a man impersonating an Army officer near Archana Red Light in Greater Kailash 1. “The accused was wearing an Army uniform when he was apprehended. On searching him, a fake ID card in the name of Dilip Kumar Rank (NK) was recovered from his pocket. A mobile phone was also seized,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur. Further probe also revealed that he is also member of several groups and also in contact with international WhatsApp numbers from several other nations. “He disclosed that he poses as Captain Shekhar of Indian Army to attract women on social media on the pretext of being an Army officer. Today also he had called a girl to meet him at GK for a date,” the DCP said. The man also disclosed that he has interacted with some foreign nationals too and has shared with them some videos and pictures. He has been arrested and further investigation is in progress. “His international links are being examined,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/40-year-old-man-posing-as-army-captain-arrested-in-gk/articleshow/83675853.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Why do Gir lions prefer open forest?||AHMEDABAD: Many lion experts and wildlife lovers are of the view that due to better protection, the forests of Gir are becoming dense and turning into non-typical lion habitat, as lions are believed to prefer open forests or savanna-type habitat. The state forest department had in 2015 included thinning of the Gir sanctuary in its forest management plan. The department had begun work in this direction a few years ago but had to discontinue it in 2019 due to Covid-19. The felling of trees by Cyclone Tauktae could be a blessing in disguise for lions, as it will open up spaces and the fallen trees will offer easy access to food to herbivores including the deer population, an important prey base for lions. The lion is a species of open scrub in flat forests, preferring dry deciduous to the thorny scrub and savannah woodland, the management plan states. “Conservation of key protected areas with the lion as the key species is one of the prime objectives of the plan. Looking to the dynamic and uncertain nature of the complex system, it seems desirable to put in the idea of habitat manipulation in favour of the lion,” the management plan states, which suggests conducting trials and research initially. Observations indicating greater use of dense forest by lions appear to be based on the lion’s habit to seek cool and shady riverine zones for rest during the daytime in summer, it said. Initial habitat condition and use pattern will be recorded properly before and after thinning and changes will be recorded in a prescribed proforma, the 2015 plan states. “If the trees that are lying in the jungle and blocking paths of the lions are not cleared, there is a possibility of more lions venturing outside the sanctuary,” said a forest official. An estimated 30-40 lakh trees were uprooted in the recent cyclone. The overall increase in the population of the Asiatic lion from 2010 to 2015 was 27% but that within the Gir protected areas it was only 3%. “Outside the protected areas the satellite population increased by 97%. The population of herbivores increased by 51% in five years, which shows that the habitat is suitable for herbivores. Therefore, habitat intervention and manipulation is required to increase the carrying capacity of Asiatic lion in Gir protected areas and for subsequent control of herbivores for future management,” according to a 2018 research paper by A P Singh, additional principal chief conservator of forests, monitoring and evaluation. The increase in population of herbivores and the lion population which has more or less stabilized in the Gir sanctuary from the past many years could be a strong indicator that Asiatic lions prefer open spaces, said a retired forest official. Many trees that have fallen due to the cyclone are likely to regenerate and the forest department may allow these trees to remain in their present condition, not touching them at all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/why-do-gir-lions-prefer-open-forest/articleshow/83673954.cms||Maulik Pathak

Speaking to media in Kochi on Saturday before leaving for Lakshadweep to appear before the police, Sultana said she will fully cooperate with the investigation. During a debate on a TV channel on the ongoing protests by the islanders against a set of proposed laws and actions of the administration, Sultana had said a ‘bio-weapon’ was being used against the islanders. “I have not done anything against the nation. The allegation is based on a word that I said. It is my responsibility to prove my case,” Sultana said. She said she will continue to oppose the anti-people activities of the administration and would fight until the islanders get justice. Kerala high court had on Thursday granted interim anticipatory bail to Sultana in the sedition case filed against her. She said she has not done anything wrong and is sure that justice will prevail. “They have told me to appear before the police at around 4.30pm. So, I would go there and cooperate with them and decide on what to do next,” she said. The court had on Thursday directed her to appear before the investigating officer and cooperate with the probe. If she is to be arrested after interrogation, she should be released on interim anticipatory bail for a week upon executing a bond with sureties, the court had said. In response to Sultana’s plea, the Lakshadweep administration had filed a statement before the high court alleging that her comments during a TV channel discussion that the Central government relaxed quarantine restrictions for visitors to Lakshadweep so as to use Covid as a bioweapon against the islanders, is sufficient to arouse hatred or contempt among the people of Lakshadweep towards the government of India. It can be prima facie considered as an attempt to excite disaffection among the people towards the government of India, the statement had said. Meanwhile, administer Praful Khoda Patel, who has been on a visit to the UT for the past few days, returned on Saturday morning. Islanders continued registering their protest against the proposed reforms on Friday night by switching off lights and banging utensils at their homes. A group of protestors at Kavaratti staged a demonstration on Saturday as well by removing flags placed by the administration to demarcate land for various projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sultana-to-appear-before-dweep-police-today/articleshow/83672287.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Biker death: BEST must pay Rs 12 lakh for 70% fault in mishap||MUMBAI: Holding that driving close to the middle of the road is highly unacceptable, especially at night, a Motor Accident Claims Tribunal has held a BEST driver and a bike rider responsible for a collision in which the latter died in 2015. Fixing 70% of the liability on the bus driver, the tribunal has directed BEST to pay a total compensation of Rs 12 lakh to the mother of the 22-year-old victim from Malad (W), a hospital sweeper who was earning Rs 8,500 at the time of his death. While the compensation amount calculated by the tribunal was Rs 15.60 lakh, Rs 3.60 lakh was deducted towards the deceased biker’s contributory negligence. “Undisputedly, it was night time when the accident occurred. The road was zigzag. There was a curve at the accident spot. Therefore, it was the duty of the bus driver and deceased to drive their respective vehicles at controlled and moderate speed, which they omitted.... All this is nothing but a clear case of rash and negligent driving on part of both. The offending vehicle being heavy class, its contributory negligence is more,” the tribunal said. Among the compensation components considered was Rs 40,000 for loss of a child suffered by the victim, Raju Atwal’s mother Suman. An accident leading to the death of a child causes great shock and agony to the parents and family of the deceased. The greatest agony of parents is to lose their child during their lifetime. Children are valued for their love, affection, companionship and their role in the family unit..,,” the order said, citing an apex court judgement. Suman Atwal moved the tribunal in January 2016. It was submitted that on December 27, 2015, around 9 pm Raju was riding his motorcycle near Madh. Suman alleged that when the bike reached INS Hamla, the bus came at high speed, and rammed into the bike. Raju sustained serious injuries, and was rushed to hospital where he died. The Malvani police registered an FIR against the bus driver for causing death by negligence. BEST denied the allegations and claimed Raju was under influence of alcohol. The tribunal, however, held that this was not proved. “No doubt, in the FIR it is stated that deceased had consumed some intoxicated drink. But there is no specific mention that it was alcohol. The opposite party (BEST) has not clarified as how deceased could ride the motor cycle up to the accident spot safely though he was under influence of alcohol,” the tribunal said. It also said neither party had attempted to summon the pillion as witness or produced the postmortem report.

---||Kochi||Kerala: ‘Nothing remains to be saved, except memories’||KOCHI: Amid the damaged furniture, heaps of clothes and broken utensils inside a ruined house near to the sea in Chellanam, a framed photograph of an old woman lay covered in sand and sea water which seeped in through the broken sea wall. The photo of Mary Kaliparambil, who died nine years ago that hung on the wall of her son Jude Kaliparambil’s house was one among the numerous valuables, Jude and his family had to leave behind while running for their lives when the angry sea partially pulled down their house on May 14, the day Chellanam witnessed one of the most ferocious sea erosions in the recent past. The house was destroyed in sea erosion last month and the family had to run for their lives leaving several valuables behind. Though the government has announced several projects, residents say development can wait but coastal protection cannot. Right: A man walks among the ruins“Building our house cost me the prime of my life and now we are staying like refugees at the house of a relative. The authorities keep promising of new projects to protect the coast, but now nothing remains to be protected, except some old memories,” Jude said. Jude’s house is one among the six in Chellanam Bazaar that suffered 75-100% damage in the sea erosion, as per the irrigation department. The department’s initial survey found that around 21 houses in Bazaar alone suffered damages between 15-100% but none of the victims are yet to receive any sort of help, except mere promises. There are numerous other damaged houses in other parts of Chellanam coast and many are on the verge of collapse. Though the government has announced a special package, including its plan to implement its model fishing village project for the first time in Chellanam, the residents are neither ready to believe it nor stay hopeful that their miseries will end anytime soon. They said development projects are most welcome but there would not be any land to implement the projects if the coast is not protected from the sea, which has been slowly carving out the coastal land each day. “Last year, there was a 50-meter gap between the sea and our house, now it has reduced to 20. Our house will not survive the next sea erosion, which is very likely in July. Despite our protests for saving our lives, even those plans and packages announced years back are still remaining in paper. Now, a few more projects were announced and we have lost all hopes that anything will change here,” said Jinson Veluthamannungal, secretary of Care Chellanam. Model fishing village project aims at the comprehensive development of coastal villages through the coordinated efforts of various departments. The project also envisages the construction of houses, provision of drinking water, sanitation, provision for health facilities, setting up of fish marketing centers, construction of fisheries schools, etc. A report by Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies is expected to be ready within a week. Fr. John Kandathilparambil, vicar of Velankanni Church and coordinator of Care Chellanam said the residents were not against projects but the government must give priority to coastal protection than development. “Construction of a seawall and breakwaters is the ideal solution but it is not happening though the authorities announce various packages,” he said. Earlier on May 24, the government decided to allot Rs.2 crore for implementing emergency coastal protection measures in the Chellanam coast before the monsoons. The monsoon has arrived but, according to the irrigation department, nothing except ‘tendering’ of projects has happened so far. “We cannot do anything until the funds are allocated. We cannot rush to complete the works without following the official procedure. The works will start soon,” said a senior irrigation department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nothing-remains-to-be-saved-except-memories/articleshow/83673983.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Out of 124 forest plantation sites, not one found successful||NAGPUR: Even as the forest department makes tall claims about plantation scheme a great success, evaluation of 10-year-old plantations has shown a dismal rate of survival and glaring lapses by the officials concerned. According to the evaluation report conducted during 2018-19 & 2019-20 on the plantation done in 2008, only 66 plantation sites shown a partial successful report. Out of 124 plantation sites, not a single plantation site was found to be successful. While 66 sites were partially successful, the remaining 58 sites failed completely due to irregularities. The latest report (510) on the 10-year plantations of the forest department has pointed out many glaring lapses by the officials concerned. Yet, no one has been held accountable. The evaluation was conducted during 2018-19 & 2019-20. The evaluation involves growth and survival of seedlings, nalabund works, protection, record keeping, expenditure, etc. Out of 1,500 plantations covering 43,281 hectares in 11 forest circles, 124 plantation units in 3,608 hectares (8%) area was randomly selected for evaluation. The exercise was conducted by six evaluation divisions in the state. The report sought under the RTI Act shows that out of 124 sites evaluated, 26 sites (20%) have survival below 5%, 46 plantations (36%) have survival rate between 6-20%, 50 plantations (43%) have survival of 21-40% and 2 plantation (1%) have survival of 41-60% survival. No plantations have a survival rate of more than 61%. As per the Evaluation Code 1969, plantations surviving above 60% are only called successful plantations. Evaluation wing of the forest department carries out regular evaluation of 3-year-old and 10-year-old plantations to assess the status. Besides, the standard of works, quality of operations, deficiencies, and expenditure are also assessed in this second stage evaluation. The prime objective is to ensure implementation and safeguard against infructuous expenditure. The report states that the target was to evaluate 165 plantation sites but at 41 it could not be achieved as records were made available and the staff neither produced any documents nor could show the site of plantations. Of the 124 sites in 11 divisions, Nagpur had 4, Chandrapur 7, Gadchiroli 13, Yavatmal 7, Amaravati 4, Aurangabad 7, Dhule 15, Nashik 16, Thane 25, Pune 8 and Kolhapur 18. SP Wadaskar, CF (evaluation), said: “Records of old plantations are not kept and maintained properly in the territorial divisions, which created the problem in getting basic data. The delay in providing requisite records also affected the timely completion of the evaluation. In 37 units, RFOs were conspicuous by their absence during the site inspection.” “The success of plantations is not encouraging. The intensity of supervision declines substantially from the third year after planting and hence the plantations face the threat of failure,” added Wadaskar. The report has recommended disciplinary action against the RFOs who could not trace the plantation sites and did not produce the record and remained absent during evaluation but to date not one RFO has been held accountable. The report has also pointed out that measurement books (MBs), which contain details of all works executed, quantity, period of execution and amount disbursed had flaws. Of the 93, MBs of only 35 plantations contained RFO signatures. “This shows callousness on part of RFOs. Out of 124 plantations, ACFs applied quantitative checks only in 6, while no DyCF applied quantitative checks and signed on MB. There was a lack of checking, guidance, supervision & control over the execution and record-keeping,” the report said. MONEY GROWS ON TREES * Out of 124 plantations, not a single site found successful * Reasons for failure: Improper site selection, refractive soils, planting under the existing vegetation, wrong species selection, poor planting stock, poor protection, grazing, fire, and roads passing through plantations * Lack of involvement of JFMC in the plantation activities * No supervision by RFOs, ACFs, & DyCFs * No accountability fixed for wrongdoing * State of record-keeping found to be pathetic||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/out-of-124-forest-plantation-sites-not-one-found-successful/articleshow/83675862.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Covid centre shut in Sangli, owner held after 77 die in a month||MUMBAI: The Sangli police on Friday sealed a private Covid care centre and arrested its owner following the death of 77 people there over one month owing to medical negligence and lack of infrastructure. Sangli is the hometown of NCP leader and water resources minister Jayant Patil. Sangli-Kupwad civic chief Nitin Kapadnis confirmed to TOI that out of 205 patients admitted in the hospital over a period of time, 77 had died. “Police have sealed the hospital, arrested its owner and the recognition of the hospital has been withdrawn with immediate effect,” he said. Times ViewAction taken by the authorities appears to have been necessary. But there remains the question of how the hospital was given permission to function as a private Covid care centre in the first place when even basic requirements of infrastructure and staff, including qualified doctors, were not met. Were no checks conducted? In case they weren’t, and even if they were, should not action be initiated against the officials who granted it the status of a Covid care centre?Sangli’s Apex Hospital, owned and run by Mahesh Jadhav, was granted approval to run a Covid care centre three months ago. After a local court rejected Jadhav’s anticipatory bail plea, he was arrested and an offence for culpable homicide registered against him. Sangli centre doctors trainees, not qualified for Covid careThe Sangli police on Friday sealed a private Covid care centre and arrested its owner following the death of 77 persons. Sangli-Kupwad civic chief NitinKapadnis said there was lack of basic infrastructure and manpower for treatment of Covid-19 patients. “We will take stern action against the hospital owner,” he said. While the administration found that there was either shortage of ventilators at the hospital or there were no ventilators at all, most of the doctors at the centre too were not qualified to treat Covid-19 patients. “Our information is that most of the doctors were trainees, and even the medical and paramedical staff had no experience in treatment of Covid-19 patients,” a senior official said. The official said that when permission is given for a Covid care centre, it is normally ensured that it meets norms prescribed by the public health department. “We ensure there are an adequate number of ventilators, oxygen beds and basic infrastructure, particularly manpower, doctors and paramedical staff,” he said. In the wake of a series of complaints, including about inflated bills, the civic chief visited the hospital and found several lacunae. A team of doctors, including the civic body’s chief medical officer, and dean of Miraj Government Medical College, then visited the hospital for verification. “We registered an FIR on May 31,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-centre-shut-owner-held-after-77-die-in-a-mth/articleshow/83677943.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Delhi||Man booked under MCOCA granted bail||New Delhi: A Delhi court has granted bail to a man who was booked under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act eight years after he was arrested in connection with murder, robbery, snatching and extortion cases. Additional Sessions Judge Kiran Gupta granted bail to Surender Bhatt subject to furnishing of a personal bond and two sureties of Rs 1 lakh each. The accused was arrested in March this year under section 3 (punishment for organised crimes) and 4 (punishment for possessing unaccountable wealth on behalf of a member of organised crime syndicate) of the MCOCA.Seeking dismissal of his bail, Additional Public Prosecutor Shiv Kumar apprised the court that allegations against the accused are “serious” as he is involved in more than three cases involving punishment of more than three years.“He is part of a syndicate of organised crime and his name is specifically mentioned in the FIR. He was absconding and has been arrested after much effort. He is involved in 17 cases,” the prosecutor said.Taking note of the prosecutor's submissions, the court said his involvement in the 17 matters were prior to 2009 and in most of the cases, he was either released by the investigating officer or discharged by the court.“In three cases, he has been acquitted. There is no case lodged against him after 2009. Even the present FIR is of 2013. The applicant has been arrested after almost eight years of lodging of the present FIR,” the sessions judge noted while granting bail on June 18. Advocate Ajay Kumar Pipaniya, representing the accused, sought bail on the ground that his client has been falsely implicated in the case and arrested almost eight years after the FIR was lodged. The FIR was registered against co-accused Satish and Surender's name was falsely dragged to complete the chain of events, he said, adding that there was no evidence that he was part of an organised crime syndicate. “He has not been involved in any offence for the past 11 years. In all the cases which were pending against him, he has either been released by the police,” Advocate Pipaniya said. According to the counsel of the accused, the police have not filed any charge sheet in the case. “In a rare order, first bail under the stringent law to curb organised crime was sought within 80 days without even filing of the charge sheet,” he said.

---||Goa||Goa: Pay up to Rs 74,000 more to register your property||PANAJI: With an intention to shore up its depleting revenue, the state government has increased the property registration fee by 0.5% to 1% in the affordable segment—Rs 50 lakh to Rs 75 lakh bracket.  Customers will now have to pay up to Rs 74,000 more, depending on the market value of the property, for registering their sale deeds. The notification issued by the law department requires customers to pay 3% of the market value of the property while registering the sale deed, where the value of the property does not exceed Rs 75 lakh. Currently, the rates for registration up to Rs 50 lakh is 2% and above Rs 50 lakh and up to Rs 75 lakh is 2.5%. “Effectively, it means that customers buying a flat valued below Rs 75 lakh will now pay an additional 1% towards registration,” Credai-Goa president Nilesh Salkar said. State government sources said this was done to rationalise the registration fee, but Credai said it would drastically affect sales. “This is counterproductive and comes as a complete surprise for us. The government thinks that it can mop up revenue but the world over it is well known that lower the taxes, higher the revenue mop-up. This will hit the industry and spoil the market for the next few years,” Salkar said. The state government’s move comes at a time when the real estate sector is facing a severe slump in demand for flats and apartments. Builders and developers in the state want the government to roll-back the registration fee and if possible, even reduce stamp duty to help boost property sales. Builders led by Credai will be meeting the law minister and submitting a representation to try and convince him of the need to roll-back this notification. Credai will try to build a case for Goa to take a cue from Maharashtra, which reduced registration fees for a short period to stimulate demand. Covid-19 has dealt a crushing blow to the real estate sector with apartments and homes becoming more expensive and running into delays. A study conducted by Credai found that construction activity has been affected and that customers have delayed purchases due to the second wave. Developers reckon that waiver of stamp duty or a reduction in stamp duty and registration fees will lead to demand creation. Interestingly, transport minister Mauvin Godinho, who had pushed for a 50% reduction in motor vehicle tax in 2019, has been appointed as a member of the GST council’s group of ministers for boosting the real estate sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pay-up-to-rs-74000-more-to-register-your-property/articleshow/83675927.cms||Newton Sequeira

We have already issued orders for sequential vaccination for this age group (18-44), in which we’ll start vaccination of the 30-44 group,” Pawar said. He added that if the vaccine supply from the Centre is streamlined, the state may scale up the drive in Pune district to vaccinate at least 1.5 lakh beneficiaries daily. Currently, shortages have limited daily coverage to 30,000 daily beneficiaries. On Friday, state government officials said they will start vaccinating people in the 30-44 age category from Saturday. Vaccination for the 18-44 group was limited to private hospitals after the government, on May 12, suspended drives for the category to focus on people over 45.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-yet-to-get-vaccine-volume-promised-by-pm/articleshow/83678096.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Goa||Kids set to trek for Net in rural Goa as classes start tomorrow||A year after they were forced to trek through remote forests to higher ground for network connectivity, students in rural Goa are set to reprise their role as a new academic year begins on Monday. With the state government putting no measures in place to enable easier access to education, students and parents will once again grapple with last year’s issues — patchy internet and a lack of multiple devices. The problem is exacerbated in remote areas, where it was a common sight last year to see students camping under temporary tarpaulin structures and making their way through dense jungle infested with wildlife, in rural Goa’s famously-intense monsoon — literally risking their lives to access their online classes Even when there's a whiff of network, it's often sporadic, with several disconnections every few minutes. In Gaondongrim, Canacona, high school student Ganesh Velip has to walk several miles a day in search of network. He shudders to think of the hardships awaiting him as classes resume on Monday. “Online classes are a total failure in remote places,” he told TOI. “We have to walk several kilometres to open spaces or hillocks and sit there for classes, which is even more challenging in the monsoon. Even after all this, we get network with very poor and slow connectivity, disconnecting us from the ongoing classes several times. So in the end, even after walking to far-off spots, we achieve nothing.” He isn’t the only one. In Sanguem’s Netravali, students Durva Velip and Pooja Velip said that the current situation is unfair to children residing in remote areas. “Students from remote areas miss their classes on a regular basis because of poor infrastructure,” said Durva. “The government should first make the needed infrastructure available in remote areas. The current system is a bit defective, and students miss classes in remote areas for absolutely no fault of their own.” But even in less remote areas, life is no joyride, as students are spotted sitting by the highways looking for internet networks. In urban areas, online classes come with their own struggles. Glancy Fernandes, a parent from South Goa, has to manage the online classes of two children on one mobile phone. With one child studying at the primary level and the second at the high school level, it is a challenging task to draw up a suitable schedule for the use of the phone. “Accessing online classes for two children on one phone is quite difficult, not only for students but also the parents,” she said. “In such a difficult situation, how much has the child learnt is a big question. During the pandemic, children cannot be sent for tuitions either. There are no PTA meetings either, to give suggestions to the school. We understand the situation, but only holding online classes is not a feasible solution.” Hemanth Kamat, principal of SS Angle higher secondary school, Dapot, Mashem, said that for many teachers too, it has been tough to learn online teaching softwares within a very short span of time. “If children take it seriously, they will surely benefit,” he said. “At times, they may not be motivated enough. I feel counselling in this regard is required for students and parents with the assistance of school management. Physical learning in a classroom and online learning both have their advantages and weak points. For teachers too, teaching online is a challenge. They need to equip themselves with new technology.” Effie Pereira, a working parent from Sadolxem, Canacona, said that parents who have a job find it difficult to monitor their children’s online classes as expected by schools. “Those parents who are office-goers are unable to monitor their children,” she said. “Devices can be misused by children in the parents’ absence. Even when parents are at home to monitor the child, some of us are not well-versed with technology. The system adopted during the pandemic has been unfair to studious students, and the marking schemes introduced have been beneficial to weak students.” Placy Colaco e Pereira, a high school teacher, said that though evaluations are carried out more frequently now, they see fewer students taking them seriously. “In the present situation, there is no better option available to transmit classes. Due to the no-fail policy, children upto Class VIII do not take things as seriously, while those in the higher classes like Class IX and X do because of the fear that they may not pass. We give tests after every unit, but 80% do not take it seriously,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kids-set-to-trek-for-net-as-classes-start-tomorrow/articleshow/83676024.cms||Albert Fernandes
---||Lucknow||For Uttar Pradesh police, ‘thanda matlab’ a cool take on Twitter trends to spread awareness||LUCKNOW: When football icon Cristiano Ronaldo unleashed a storm on the internet by an innocuous act of setting aside the bottles of Coca-Cola during a press conference, he gave fodder to the social media cell of the Uttar Pradesh police to uncork a “cool” message for the people urging them to shun vaccine hesitancy. Of late, the UP police has been grabbing eyeballs on social media with its cheeky takes on current events and Twitter trends to send across a message to the people on various issues. “In the image posted from the official twitter handle of UP police, the Coca-Cola logo was tweaked and replaced with the names of the two vaccines, Covaxin and Covishield. The implicit message was that the fortunes of the Coca-Cola brand are plummeting like our present day situation due to the pandemic but vaccines (Covaxin and Covishield) is the only hope. Hence, the message on the meme says, ‘A shot in the arm to prevent the harm’,” said additional superintendent of police, Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), Rahul Srivastava, the brain behind the UP police’s Twitter campaign. “Creative churning involves a lot of brainstorming and hard work but topical content is the only way to capture people’s imagination and convey our message on important issues effectively,” said ASP Srivastava, who is also in charge of the UP police’s twitter handle. Paying homage to nonagenarian sprinter Milkha Singh, who passed away on Friday at the age of 91, UP police tweeted a picture of the sporting legend with the message: “We inherit your passion to serve the country, precision in performance & pace to reach our destination in the quickest possible time!” In another meme, UP police used ‘Thums Up’, a cola brand, to post the message: “Mask Up –Beat the Covid Thunder”. The tweet also got a ‘thumbs up’ from the official twitter handle of the brand. Taking a cue from ‘Chellam Sir’, a character in the popular web series who is extremely cautious in his every move, ‘The Family Man-Season 2’, UP police shared a post: “Every ‘Family Man’ should safeguard their hard-earned money from scamster! #Chellam Sir is a ‘man for all seasons’. Even Sri ‘Can’t’!” Actor Manoj Bajpayee, who plays the lead role of an intelligence officer, Srikant Tiwari, liked the post and tweeted: “Hahahaha. Nice one @Uppolice.” “Recently, UP police’s spins on women issues and road safety campaign were also a big hit. A popular song from Bollywood flick ‘Darr’, ‘Tu haan kar ya naa kar, tu hai meri Kiran’, was used by UP police to drive home a very serious message. As the character of Rahul Mehra (played by Shahrukh Khan) is seen as trying to forcibly woo the heroine without her consent, a bold message is reflected after the clip which says ‘Kiran’s No is a NO,” Srivastava said, adding that such campaigns would continue to be a regular feature on UP police’s twitter handle. “In our social media campaigns, we try to stay in tune with the latest trends and focus our messaging around it. This has helped us widen our reach and connect with the people organically,” said ADG, law and order, Prashant Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/for-up-police-thanda-matlab-a-cool-take-on-twitter-trends-to-spread-awareness/articleshow/83678003.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

Among other appointments, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan state director P Bharati has been transferred as labour commissioner and Jamnagar collector Ravi Shanakar has been transferred as chief administrator, Statue of Unity. New collectors for 23 of 33 districts With an eye on assembly elections next year, the state government has moved field officers, including collectors, district development officers, and other lower-ranked IAS officers. These transfers were long overdue. In a major reshuffle, 23 of the 33 districts will have new collectors. Districts such as Surat, Rajkot, Vadodara, Kutch, and Anand will have new collectors. DDOs of 22 of the 33 districts have been replaced. R B Barad has been appointed as collector of Vadodara, while Ahmedabad DDO Arun Mahesh Babu has been transferred as Rajkot collector.

Wockhardt Hospital has become fourth in the city to start paid inoculation of 18-plus. As against daily vaccination of below 4,000, the numbers swelled to 15,243 in the district on Saturday. Around 10,000 people from 30-44 years age group took the jab in the district on the first day. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar told TOI, “The state government directed us to begin vaccination of 30-44 years age group on Friday evening. We started opening slots of centres on Co-Win application from 8.30pm onwards. We made slots available at all centres by 2am. The slots were booked in no time. It helped in a large number of people getting vaccinated on Saturday. There was no crowding at centres due to online appointment. People cooperated too,” he said. The civic body conducted inoculation of 30-44 years age group at 81 of the 105 centres. A total of 100 slots were made available online at each centre. Vaccination of 45-plus was done at the remaining 24 centres. Dr Chilkar said, “Vaccination for 30-44 years age group and 45-plus will be done at all the 105 centres from Sunday onwards. A total of 200 slots online will be made available at majority of the centres, 100 at some centres for 30-44 years age group and there will be 50 offline slots for 45-plus,” he said. The NMC, in a press release, said vaccination of 30-plus will also start at two drive-in vaccination centres situated at Glocal Square Mall and VR mall. Dr Chilkar also said vaccination figures of 45-plus increased in the city on Saturday. The Zilla Parishad has started inoculation of 30-44 years age group at 66 of total 114 centres on Saturday. CEO of ZP Yogesh Kumbhejkar has set a target of vaccinating 1,000 persons per day for each of the 13 tehsils. Centre head of Wockhardt Hospital, Abhinandan Dastenavar, told TOI, “Vaccination was started for 18-plus from Friday. A total of 500 were administered the dose on Friday and over 300 on Saturday.” The hospital was first in Vidarbha to start corporate vaccination from June 3. It has administered doses to over 1,000 employees of four corporate companies. Dastenavar said corporate vaccination will restart soon. The centre had allowed vaccination of 18-44 years age group from May 1 but had placed responsibility of procuring doses from manufacturers. The state had commenced vaccination of this age group on May 1 with limited centres but stopped it on May 12 citing shortage of doses. The state has started free-of-cost inoculation of 30-44 years age group at government centres. Private hospitals can do paid vaccination for 18-plus by directly procuring doses from manufacturers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-increase-centres-slots-for-30-from-today/articleshow/83672324.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Chandigarh||Heat, paddy push power demand in Haryana to 12,000 MW||CHANDIGARH: With the mercury touching new highs, the number of power outages is increasing, particularly in rural belts. Power utilities in Haryana are gearing up to enhance infrastructure and arrange electricity supply for peak summer, that is in the first week of July, in time for paddy sowing season in the state. There are around 70.55 lakh electricity consumers of all categories, including domestic, non-domestic, agriculture, institutional and industrial. Uttar Haryana Bijli Vittran Nigam (UHBVN) has a total of 32.85 lakh while Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vittran Nigam (DHBVN) has around 37.71 lakh consumers. Peak supply is being counted on July 3. In 2019, Haryana consumed 2,330 lakh units while on July 3, 2020, peak consumption reached 2,358 lakh units. This translates into demand of 11,030 MW per day. During the current year, a peak of 1,932 lakh units was reported on June 9 and it is expected to rise further by July 3. As of now, the state has total arrangement of 11,838 MW, which is a little less than the actual requirement. The two distribution companies ie Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN) and Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) and transmission company Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (HVPNL) claimed to have augmented resources to ensure uninterrupted power supply in the state, especially in the paddy season. Authorities are also depending on good rain to ease the burden on power utilities and to ensure uninterrupted supply. ACS, Power P K Das said that the situation was under control. “This exercise of supply augmentation is being carried out every year on the basis of consumption trends seen in the past. We are all prepared for peak supplies. Besides, this special arrangement has been made for sowing season as well,’’ said Das. Sources claimed to have conducted work on maintenance of 33 KV and above sub-stations, 66KV and above transmission lines, 33/11 KV feeders and distribution transformers to ensure uninterrupted supply to all categories in the summer. For immediate restoration of supply due to damaged transformer, two mobile transformer trolleys will be maintained in each division. The transformer installed on the trolley will be temporarily energised in place of the damaged transformer and will remain in service till replacement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/heat-paddy-push-power-demand-in-hry-to-12k-mw/articleshow/83675971.cms||---
---||Delhi||Firemen turn rescuers for animals in distress in Jahangirpuri||NEW DELHI: There was help from unexpected quarters for an eagle struggling after being entangled in a cable passing through the branches of a tree in Jahangirpuri. Delhi Fire Service personnel arrived, stood up two ladders against the tree and worked rigorously for two hours to free the bird of prey. However, unknown to most people, firemen have been extending a helping hand to many winged creatures in distress and till Thursday had responded to 1,597 bird rescue calls. It’s not just the birds, even cows, buffaloes, cats and dogs have benefited from the fire dousers’ assistance. The fire service has a specialised vehicle to rescue birds, which proved handy in carrying out 3,691 bird rescues last year. The maximum cases involved birds entangled in synthetic kite string, or manjha. The major difficulty in the rescue act is the height. Sub-officer Manoj Tyagi at the Tahirpur fire station said, “Earlier, there were specific months like July, August and September when we received SOS calls. But since the synthetic manjha hit the markets, we have to rescue birds the year through.” Tyagi said that in situations where the bird rescue vehicle has easy access, the hydraulic platform is used. But in narrow lanes or in a huge park, the extension ladder reaching up to 35 feet has to be employed. At times, even this isn’t enough and the rescuers use bamboo poles to reach higher.” Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service, said, “Our aim is to save the bird or animal. If the bird is in good condition, we set it free. Injured birds are taken to the veterinary hospital and we get receipts for our records.” The fire brigade has also rescued cows from drains or pits as well as cats and dogs stuck in unusual places. Several firemen have been bitten by the animals during such rescues. While animal- and wildlife-related distress calls fall under the jurisdiction of the chief wildlife warden of Delhi government’s forest and wildlife department, forest officials are happy at the prompt action facilitated by several agencies working together. “Most birds and animals come under the Wildlife Protection Act and so by law, we have to take action. But the fire service responds to calls made to them too,” said a forest official, adding that this worked well because the forest department had a manpower shortage. The official went on, “Moreover, the fire service has the equipment required to climb tall structures as well as sufficient manpower. This may be one of the reasons why so many calls are received by them involving wildlife.” Verhaen Khanna, founder of NGO New Delhi Nature Society, reported taking the assistance of Delhi Fire Service numerous times to rescue birds and animals. “In two separate incidents, a dog and a cat stuck in a stormwater drain were retrieved by fire officers,” said Khanna. He, however added, “The forest department cites manpower shortage in not following many basic rules, including not checking for wildlife living in the trees that are permitted to be felled.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/firemen-turn-rescuers-for-animals-in-distress/articleshow/83675998.cms||Sakshi Chand

---||Delhi||Covid-19: At 7, deaths back in single digit in Delhi for the first time since April 1||NEW DELHI: The capital on Saturday recorded seven deaths due to Covid-19 — the lowest since April 1. A total of 135 fresh cases of Covid-19 were also recorded in the past 24 hours, even as the positivity rate dipped to 0.18%. Saturday’s seven deaths pushed the death toll in the city to 24,907. This was also the first time that daily fatality count slipped into single-digit since April 1, when Delhi had recorded nine deaths and 2,790 cases, officials said. The Covid-19 infection rate in the city, which had touched 36% in the last week of April, has come down to below 0.2% currently. Despite a fall in daily cases in the past several days, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had, last Saturday, cautioned that chances of a third wave of Covid-19 in the country was quite real, while asserting that his government was preparing on a “war-footing” to combat it. Delhi reeled under a brutal second wave of the pandemic, claiming a massive number of lives daily, with the recent oxygen supply shortage issue at various hospitals, adding to the woes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-7-deaths-back-in-single-digit-for-the-first-time-since-april-1/articleshow/83674104.cms||---
---||Delhi||Why crowded markets in Delhi not good sign for all||NEW DELHI: The first weekend of the markets being allowed to open fully after the lockdown saw people thronging the shopping hubs on Saturday. While this brought smiles on the faces of shopkeepers, it also worried the authorities who are hard-pressed to get people to abide by Covid-appropriate behaviour. At most markets on Saturday, TOI saw the shoppers wearing masks, but social distancing was a huge casualty everywhere. There were also some, including traders, who were wearing masks in a manner that left their noses exposed. This after health experts have consistently requested citizens to wear the mask properly to prevent the spread of infection. At Sarojini Nagar, hawkers, prohibited at the market by New Delhi Municipal Council, were present and some shop owners had put up wares on the space outside their stores, causing congestion at places. TOI tried to get a response from NDMC on this, but no one commented. Civic officials, however, took stock of the situation in the market in the morning, while Delhi Police undertook an aerial survey with drones in the evening. Surjeet Singh Arora, vice-president, Sarojini Market Shopkeepers’ Association, said, “From our side, we have deployed 40 volunteers to keep an eye on shoppers in addition to the Civil Defence Volunteers. We are requesting shopkeepers and visitors to avoid standing in groups and to wear masks, but it is not possible to be everywhere. People themselves need to behave responsibly.” Ashok Randhawa, president, Mini Market Traders’ Association, pointed out that people often shopped in groups and shop owners didn’t want to lose customers. At Lajpat Nagar, there was rush in the market as well as the parking area. Veer Savarkar Marg had minor jams throughout the day. This had its repercussions. As Ashwani Marwah, general secretary, Traders’ Association of Lajpat Nagar, said, “Social distancing was an issue due to the crowding, which was close to normal for Saturdays. From Tuesday, we will deploy our own staff to dissuade standing in groups. We are also sending repeated circulars to shopkeepers to follow Covid norms.” At Pushpa Market in Lajpat Nagar, autorickshaws and hawkers crowded the stretch. Civil Defence personnel were present there in strength and could be seen pulling up people, mostly those not wearing masks. After being deserted for a long time, business owners in Connaught Place and South Ex finally witnessed encouraging footfall on Saturday. In these places too, the parking lots were almost full and people were queued up outside takeaways. In CP, the innumerable restaurants too had sufficient customers. Amit Gupta, executive member, New Delhi Traders’ Association, claimed that shoppers were being informed through text messages and on social media that the market was safe and shopkeepers and their employees were vaccinated. “We had around 50% of the regular customers on Saturday,” said Gupta. “But we are concerned about hawkers returning here. As far as physical distancing is concerned, we are doing better than other markets because most shops are restricting the entry of customers while the Civic Defence staff are monitoring the corridors.” Similarly, Vijay Kumar, president, South Extension I Market Association, claimed that all anti-Covid arrangements had been made in the upmarket area. “The regular buyers have started coming back in good numbers,” said Kumar. “Our shops are spacious as are the corridors so social distance is not an issue. Only, we cannot ask people walking in groups in the corridors not to do so.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-crowded-markets-not-good-sign-for-all/articleshow/83674093.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Mumbai||Glitches likely as SSC marks to be uploaded tomorrow||MUMBAI: Teachers are giving finishing touches to class X students marks that will start getting uploaded on the system of the state education board, MSBSHSE, from Monday. Students are being evaluated on a 50% weightage scored in class IX and X. The SSC exam was cancelled in April due to the pandemic. The assessment work that began from June 4 has to be completed by Sunday. The marks are to be uploaded on the link provided to schools by June 30. Teachers said assessment work was tedious which is now on track. Schools and teachers were initially apprehensive about the marking formula, especially class X scores. “Putting together the 30 marks theory and 20 marks internal assignments for each subject was difficult in case of students who were not consistent in the academic year,” said a teacher. On Monday, when the link opens, schools will have to upload the total marks obtained by a class IX student in each subject. The link has been designed to automatically upload 50% of total class IX marks. The task of uploading the class X marks will be time-consuming, said teachers. Principals, who are the final signing authority for the tabulated marks of students, felt it would be an inflated SSC result this year. “The marks of some of our students look unrealistic. But going by the adopted methodology, there is little we can do,” said a school headmistress. Groups have been formed to verify and re-check marks allotted to students. “One teacher will enter marks of a student on the link. Another will dictate marks and a third will check marks entered in the system before they are uploaded,” explained a principal. Marks once uploaded cannot be changed by schools. With the board discontinuing revaluation of SSC marks this year, schools will be responsible for errors. Marks of over 16 lakhstudents to be uploaded, the possibility of the link crashing has not been ruled out. “As many schools will try to get onto the link at the same time, a technical glitch may occur. They need not panic,” said a state education officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-glitches-likely-as-ssc-marks-to-be-uploaded-tomorrow/articleshow/83676169.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Asha workers’ morcha on Monday, strike to continue||NAGPUR: Asha workers affiliated to Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) have announced plans for a morcha to zilla parishad office on Monday to press for their pending demands. All Asha workers, affiliated to five different big unions in Maharashtra, went on strike from June 15 and started negotiations with the government through an action committee. Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha) play a key role in the last-mile delivery of social health schemes, especially in rural or low income areas in urban places. During Covid-19 pandemic, many Asha workers would visit people under home quarantine and follow up on their health status and even distribute medicines. Even during the vaccination drive, some Asha workers were involved in collating data and coordinating with beneficiaries in rural areas. Rajendra Sathe, district head of CITU’s Asha Garpravartak Karmachari Union, said, “Our demands are to raise the remuneration given to our members from the meagre average of Rs5,000 per month to a fixed amount that’s acceptable to all. There are many other issues as well and we hope that the government understands the seriousness of it.” On Friday, the committee’s convenor MA Patil met NCP supremo Sharad Pawar to highlight Asha workers’ main issue of getting ‘decent’ remuneration. On his official Facebook page, Pawar shared a photo of the meeting and wrote that Patil responded positively to the request for taking back the strike. Sathe, however, denied that the strike had been called off. “We have spoken to Patil and nothing like that’s been done. The strike shall continue till the government gives us a written assurance that our demands will be met. There is no point in going by verbal commitments from which the government can backtrack easily,” said Sathe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/asha-workers-morcha-on-monday-strike-to-continue/articleshow/83672344.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Jaipur||Alwar recruitment scam: Rajasthan ACB files FIR against four||JAIPUR: Rajasthan ACB on Saturday filed an FIR against four persons in the Alwar ESIC Hospital recruitment scam. The FIR was registered against arrested officials of Gujarat-based company MJ Solanki Company, which was entrusted with the recruitment of contractual nursing staff, and an officer posted at AIIMS-Jodhpur. Manjal PatelThe accused named in the FIR are the company’s field in-charge, Bharat Poonia, supervisor Kana Ram Choudhary, partner Manjal Patel and AIIMS-Jodhpur nursing officer Mahipal Yadav. All four were arrested on Thursday after the ACB unearthed the arbitrary selection process following days of intelligence gathering and surveillance. The scam was unearthed when ACB’s special investigation wing (SIW) learned that the company was demanding Rs 2 lakh for a contractual nursing job at the hospital and Rs 80,000 for a nursing assistant. Mahipal YadavA team led by ASP (SIW) Bajrang Singh Shekhawat is currently camping in Alwar to probe the case. “Apart from the four named in the FIR, we have also mentioned other unnamed accused as their role is under investigation,” said DG (ACB) BL Soni, adding that the FIR was registered under multiple provisions of the prevention of corruption Act. Sources said that the role of Kuldeep Yadav, personal assistant to Alwar MP Balak Nath, is also under investigation for his alleged involvement in the case. While Yadav was not named in the FIR, ACB officials claimed probe against Yadav would continue. “When he (Yadav) learned that company officials were charging up to Rs 2 lakh from aspirants for a temporary nursing job, he also began demanding a share from officials involved in the recruitment process,” an official informed TOI. The ESIC Hospital has also issued an order terminating the contract it had signed with MJ Solanki Company. The order asked the company to withdraw “all the contractual manpower deployed” at the hospital. Investigators are also examining the alleged role of hospital officials, especially those who were responsible for vetting and approving documents of shortlisted candidates.“The company had shortlisted about 80 candidates for contractual employment. But we found that only 12 had submitted documents related to their nursing education and experience credentials. This raises suspicion,” said an official. The sources added that shortlisted candidates may also be quizzed soon in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/alwar-recruitment-scam-acb-files-fir-against-4/articleshow/83676019.cms||---

The Madhavpura police have registered a complaint against unidentified miscreants. Ashwin Maganbhai, head constable of L-division police station, in his complaint stated that he was on duty at Shahibaug underbridge on Friday. When he reached the chowky, he realized the door was ajar. On checking, he found the iron box containing two memo books, a walkie-talkie, a charger, and the log book of an official bike had gone missing. He then informed PSI V N Chauhan.

After the meeting, Patil said the Karnataka government has decided to set up a real-time data acquisition system (RTDAS) at its Almatti and Narayanpur dams to monitor water levels, which will help prevent 2019-like floods in Kolhapur and Sangli districts, in which 60 people lost their lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/karnataka-to-monitor-dam-water-levels-too-maharashtra-min/articleshow/83679245.cms||---
---||Goa||Slight uptick in passenger movement at Goa airport as 2nd wave ebbs||PANAJI: The decline in Covid-19 cases across the country, particularly in the metros, has given domestic airlines a breather as people are once again taking to the skies. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has seen a slight improvement in passenger footfalls and flights ever since Goa’s daily Covid caseload started to decline and as Maharashtra, Delhi and other states eased restrictions. Goa airport had recorded a near 90% drop in passenger footfalls from April 1 onwards, with airlines also cancelling daily flights. Over the last week, there has been a noticeable increase in passenger movement at the airport with around 26 flights operating on Saturday. Two of those flights — from Bengaluru and Delhi — were diverted to Mangaluru due to poor weather conditions. An IndiGo Delhi-Goa flight circled thrice before being diverted. “There have been 13 arrivals on Saturday. The passenger load factor has gone up slightly and flights are operating with 60-75 passengers, mainly on the weekends,” said Goa airport director, Gagan Malik. Stakeholders said the easing of restrictions has encouraged people who were fed up of staying at home, to travel. “They either come and stay in hotels for a break or just stay in hotels and work. Anyway, they have to work from home,” said a source. Currently, to enter Goa, a traveller needs to produce a Covid-19 negative certificate based on any of the ICMR-approved tests. International travel, except for repatriation flights, is not permitted. Even though the threat of the pandemic — particularly the third wave — remains, it has not stopped people from across the country from making travel plans for Goa. TOI reported on Saturday that the most popular question on social media appears to be, “Is Goa open?” Several resorts, standalone hotels and homestays remain open for business and travellers are free to enter the state. AAI data shows that passengers carried by domestic airlines during January-May were 3.1 crore as against 3.3 crore during the corresponding period in the previous year, thereby registering an annual decline of -5.9%. Data for Goa for that period is unavailable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/slight-uptick-in-passenger-movement-at-goa-airport-as-2nd-wave-ebbs/articleshow/83676059.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Delhi||Amid Covid, Delhi museum readies its rare Central Asian antiquities||NEW DELHI: While the city was inactive due to the Covid-19 lockdown, there were some people who continued to work. That is the reason why, now that Delhi has resumed normal life, the National Museum will be able to showcase its new Central Asian Antiquities gallery, making it only the fourth museum to exhibit such artifacts after the repositories in London, Berlin and Moscow. When the lockdown was announced mid-April, the work on the gallery was put on hold. “But we did not sit back idly,” said Subrata Nath, additional director general, National Museum. “We carried out the content work like creating catalogues and finished off the labelling though we could not carry out any physical work.” Nath informed TOI the three halls in the Central Asian Antiquities gallery should be ready to be opened to the public in a few months. He said it would be for the first time that these artifacts, which were acquired in India a century ago and had remained with the Archaeological Survey of India, would be on public display. “The gallery has nearly 200 artifacts, among them Central Asian terracotta figurines, metallic items, paintings and murals. According to the co-curator of the new gallery, the three halls are thematic. “In the first hall, visitors will get an idea of what they will see from a hologram of star objects,” the curator said. “These objects include a small 6th-7th century Buddha figure in Abhaya mudra, a wooden Buddha from Khotan, Xinjiang, China. These show clear Indian and Sarnath influence. The star objects also include a few terracotta figurines found buried in the Astana graves in China.” The curator informed that the theme of the first gallery was life and death, the first epitomised by the sculpture of Divine Buddha and the latter by the items buried in Astana graves such as sandals and terracotta figurines of patrons. The central gallery will have murals from the Bezeklik caves. “One such is the Prandihi scene where Buddha stands on a raft over a water body to signify how he is taking people across the river of life,” said the curator. The third gallery’s theme is Dunhuang and will exhibit paper and silk paintings from around 7th-10th century plus a large bronze Ming Buddha. The assistant curator said the idea behind the gallery was to find the Indian connection to these objects because the Buddhist sutras were taken to central Asia from India by travellers. “We are trying to showcase the amalgamation of Buddhist culture with the existing culture of different countries,” explained the curator. Some conservation works have also been done on the artefacts, mostly preventive to stop further deterioration of the objects. An effort has been made, for instance, to fill the cracks in artwork.

He said the state government would provide nearly 70-acre of land for setting up this plant and rail-fed POL terminal of higher capacity. CM Thakur said major raw materials for producing ethanol like rice and maize would be procured from Kangra, Hamirpur, Bilaspur and Una districts besides Hoshiarpur and Rupnagar districts of Punjab. He said these projects would be set up at a cost of Rs 400 crore and would provide direct and indirect employment to about 300 persons. Besides, it would also accelerate the pace of development in the state and earn annual revenue of Rs 20 crore to Rs 25 crore in the form of SGST.

Former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and senior Congress leader Oommen Chandy said that the chief minister should not have commented like this against Sudhakaran. “It was cheapness from the part of the chief minister that the press conference he calls for describing the pandemic situation in the state being used for settling political scores,’’ said Chennithala. However, opposition leader V D Satheesan said the attempt of the chief minister was to divert the attention from the tree felling controversy. He added that the CM’s response to the remarks appeared in the name of Sudhakaran in a local magazine does not suit his position. Sudhakaran has clarified that it was an off-the record remark and the CM should have given an explanatory note to the magazine rather than making such a long statement at the press conference, Satheesan said. “If at all Sudhakaran had said something about the college days in a magazine, the chief minister should not have reacted on the same lines. I am not sure whether Sudhakaran has said that in any interview since I have not seen it. Vijayan forgot the position he holds while reacting to it,’’ said Chennithala. Chandy also blamed the chief minister for flaring up the issue by reacting on the same lines ignoring the position held by Vijayan. “Such discussions will shift the focus from the real issues of the people. There are several issues which needs to be discussed,” he said. Senior party leader K V Thomas also came in support of Sudhakaran and said it was not proper for a chief minister to make such comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/congress-top-brass-rally-behind-kpcc-president/articleshow/83672356.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Tourism eyes high-value domestic visitors for reboot||PANAJI: The just-concluded tourist season barely lasted less than six months due to the second Covid wave. With the forthcoming season also looking bleak, Goa’s hospitality industry may have to be content with domestic visitors. As tourism stakeholders await the government to lift restrictions, they are worried considering that India received a lot of negative publicity over the past few months due to Covid-19. Goa also made headlines as its case positivity rate soared and at one point exceeded 50%. It remains to be seen if Goa can reclaim its lost foreign markets in the immediate future, said branding consultant Cajetan Vaz. “Goa has received negative word of mouth due to the exponential spike in infections and deaths,” Vaz said. Goa’s tourist industry has been in the throes of a crisis ever since the Covid-19 pandemic emerged. It was also for the first time in decades that the last season was bereft of foreign tourists. Ernest Dias, chief operating officer at Sita Travels, said the times ahead are difficult and challenging. “India has received bad publicity worldwide over the pandemic. If the season opens in December, there is some scope for revival, but we will have to aggressively promote Goa as a tourist destination,” said Dias. President of Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) Nilesh Shah has repeatedly emphasised the message has to be loud and clear that “Goa is safe” to regain the lost foothold. “The tourism market is now dictated by health, weather, safety, and value. We can’t compromise on any of these, especially value. Rival destinations like Thailand, Sri Lanka, Bali, and Malaysia are offering better value,” said Vaz. Even if international travel becomes easier, maybe in few months Goa will yet find it difficult to gain what is lost. “In the best-case scenario, Goa may receive about 3 lakh international tourists mostly from Russia and East European destinations,” de Souza said. Dias said they have been getting inquiries from their counterparts in foreign markets, including the UK but in the future, Goa will not have it easy. “We need to make Goa very attractive by giving free visas as well offer other incentives to compete with rival destinations,” he said. Till 2019-20, Goa’s international footfalls, including charter tourists, were in the range of 8 to 9 lakh, with travellers mostly arriving from Russia, CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries, the UK, and a few European nations. Goa’s European footfalls had shrunk even before the pandemic while there was a corresponding rise in domestic arrivals. Regular visitors from UK, France, and Germany, Vaz said, have found new destinations. Save for the Ukrainians, foreign markets shrunk even before the pandemic emerged. Immediately after the first wave, from November onwards domestic tourists made a beeline to Goa. “Goa is a preferred destination of India’s metros as it was widely evident after the first wave concluded. Also, we foresee desi tourists, who otherwise prefer foreign countries for holidaying, will likely pick Goa as many of them (foreign destinations) are yet to lift restrictions,” hotelier Ralf de Souza said. In the changed scenario, some feel the focus should shift towards attracting long-stay and high-value domestic tourists.“We should accept the fact that Goa is not attractive to foreign markets, so we should focus on maximising returns on domestic tourism,” said Vaz. To make that happen, Goa tourism will have to shift a few gears rather than making “the show must go on” its motto. Echoing this point, de Sousa said Goa should take a cue from Kerala and Diu. Both have been aesthetically marketing and promoting themselves to attract domestic tourists. “Goa tourism should judiciously select channels for its promotions that it attracts the best crowds. Or else, Goa will end up only getting low-budget tourists, while a greater portion of quality tourists will choose other destinations in the country,” he said. Goa Tourism should focus its attention on upgrading infrastructure and explore avenues to broaden its market share, Vaz suggested. “This includes safety, medical support, and rejuvenation. We have a great opportunity in medical tourism, both for treatment and recuperation. Such tourists are long haulers and find better value for dentistry, ophthalmology, minor surgeries, and wellness retreats based on ayurveda and holistic healing,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourism-eyes-high-value-domestic-visitors-for-reboot/articleshow/83676057.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Delhi||Delhi Police plan local health panels for Covid fight||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava on Saturday announced the formation of “district- and thana-level committees” for public health care management as an institutional arrangement, which he said was required to prevent and tackle any possible resurgence of next wave of Covid-19. It has also been decided that the Covid Cell at the police headquarters will be upgraded to a “public health emergency management cell,” which will coordinate with various stakeholders and function as the node for supervising these committees. Amid further unlocking of the capital in the last week with commerce, professional and recreational establishments coming back to business, Shrivastava held a Covid safety action and crime review meeting on Saturday to discuss execution of steps taken to implement Covid-appropriate behaviour in markets and populated spaces. During the meeting, the commissioner announced the formation of these committees, which will be meant for providing professional response to various situations arising out of public health emergencies. “They will facilitate movement of migrant labourers, care for the destitute, elderly citizens and women, food/ration for the needy and hungry, maintaining essential supplies, etc. One of the most important objectives of these committees will be to work towards public acceptance of Covid-appropriate behavior and placing measures for systemic and voluntary adoption, thus minimising the need for coercive enforcement,” Shrivastava said. The top cop asked field officers to enlist the cooperation of citizens in its implementation. The committees will also include the medical and paramedic establishments like hospitals, laboratories, nursing homes, ambulance service providers, etc. Trade associations, industrial area associations, public lodging facilities, health sector NGOs, educational institutions, residents’ welfare associations, individuals, creative audio/video media professionals, IT professionals, celebrities with public appeal, etc, will be a part of this too, besides civic agency officials and other government functionaries. The meetings will be held in accordance with the prevalent public health emergency norms for e.g. during the Covid-19 phase, preferably virtually. Discussing the implementation of Covid norms, the CP stressed upon enhanced police visibility in busy market places and areas. He again directed that market welfare associations and RWAs be involved proactively to ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is strictly adhered to in their respective places. “PA systems should be used to educate the public and there should be no margin for slackness in implementation of Covid guidelines in public places,” Shrivastava added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-plan-local-health-panels-for-covid-fight/articleshow/83674129.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Delhi||Delhi unlock: Vehicle curbs leave traders unhappy||NEW DELHI: Due to the traffic regulations imposed on the Chandni Chowk stretch from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Mosque and on the adjoining roads, the remaining thoroughfares in the area are seeing heavier than normal traffic, distressing the regular commuters on these roads. Business owners are anxious about what this will mean to their operations. A few segments like Shanti Desai Marg, Rai Kedarnath Marg, Netaji Subhash Marg and Chawri Bazar road, where motor vehicles are barred between 9am and 9pm, were choked during the peak and non-peak hours. A few traders at Chandni Chowk, who spoke to TOI, worried about the effect of the road restrictions on their business. “With the vehicular limitations, people will stop coming here altogether,” said Rajesh, a shop owner. “There are many elderly shoppers who are regulars here. Now they cannot walk all the way to our shops and have stopped coming. In a similar manner, most other people will also stop shopping here. This is not just my plight, but that of most other shop-keepers at Chandni Chowk.” Kamal Singh echoed the same anxieties. “We are facing a really hard time and now have given up hope that things will ever get back to how they were prior to the lockdown,” he muttered. After the traffic order was issued three days ago, the footfall at Chandni Chowk has declined rapidly as has the number of cars. Rickshaw puller Shahnawaz said due to cars not being allowed into the area, he has been able to pick up at least 30 shoppers and ferry them from the market to the metro stations and neighbouring localities. As advised by the transport department, the road-owning agencies have begun putting up sign boards with information about traffic timings. There are restrictions on north side of the main Chandni Chowk thoroughfare and no motor vehicles are allowed on any road leading to the main road between 9am and 9pm, However, these restrictions do not apply to roads like HC Sen Marg up to the Jubilee Cinema cut, Rai Kedarnath Marg towards the main Chandni Chowk road up to the T-point, the Kachha Bagh road, including Chandni Chowk metro station and Ramjas Senior Secondary School No. 3 up to main Chandni Chowk road, Shanti Desai Marg towards main Chandni Chowk Road up to the T-point (Town Hall exit road) and the road leading to Bagh Diwar Park up to main Chandni Chowk road behind Dangal Maidan parking. Likewise, there are restrictions on movement between 9am and 9pm on the south side of the main Chandni Chowk road on all roads leading to the main Chandni Chowk road. They don’t apply to Netaji Subhash Marg, Jama Masjid road up to Chawri Bazar Road crossing, Chawri Bazar Road up to Hauz Qazi Chowk, Lal Kuan Road up to T-point on Katra Bariyan Road and Katra Bariyan road up to Fatehpuri Mosque T-point.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vehicle-curbs-leave-traders-unhappy/articleshow/83674147.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Religious heads on board, doctors raise pitch for jab||NAGPUR: Doctors from the Muslim community have joined religious heads in encouraging members to get vaccinated through different social media posts. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had been reaching out to the community, which so far was averse to vaccination due to doubts and misconceptions. On Saturday, the NMC started a special camp at International Sunni Centre in Yashodhara Nagar where the institution head Maulana Sayyad Alamgir Ashraf took his first dose. The camp would be open for anyone above 45+ though NMC expects people from the locality to take benefit. On June 16, TOI had reported about the NMC’s move to reach out to the community. So far, doctors from the community too were not sure and had left it to individual choice citing lack of vaccine efficacy data and it still being in trial phase. After the second wave, religious heads are convinced that vaccination is the only protection against Covid-19. Jamaat Islami Hind (JIH) Shariah Council secretary Dr Raizul Islam Nadvi has deemed “vaccination permissible as per Islamic laws”. Dr Anwar Siddiqui, director of Pachpaoli DCHC, said the community must not trust conspiracy theories and rely only on scientific facts. “Community’s response to vaccination has been poor. We observed that 25% of Muslims needed hospitalization while the community forms just around 12% of Nagpur’s population. I have been advocating since beginning that vaccine can help reduce the risk of Covid-19,” said Dr Siddiqui, who is also president of Nagpur. Cardiologist Dr Shoeb Nadeem said, “That vaccine is safe has been proved as a large number of people have taken it. There is no evidence to prove any serious side effect due to vaccination in the form of heart attack or clotting in any part of the body.” According to Dr Nadeem, some HCWs were initially hesitant. “I was the first to take the vaccine at our hospital. It is only the vaccine which will protect us from all the waves,” he said. Cardiologist Dr Aziz Khan said he has not seen any patient with side effect of vaccine. “From our experience of Covid treatment, I can say that the infection will be mild, even if it happens, after vaccination. Mortality chance is also low among vaccinated population,” he said. Psychiatrist Dr Suleman Virani said around 70% of his OPD patients are yet to be vaccinated. “There were also some cases of vaccination anxiety. The patients were fearful of death from vaccination after watching some social media posts. We had to counsel such patients and provide them authentic information to allay their fears. Counselling and treatment help them overcome fears,” he said, appealing to community members not to fall prey to rumours.

According to the police, the boulder fell due to a rain-triggered landslide and broke the windshield of the truck, giving fatal injuries to the victim. “After administering him first- aid, we were taking the victim to a medical facility in Gangolihat as the roads leading to Almora and Tanakpur were blocked. However, the man succumbed to his injuries on the way,” said a police official. Meanwhile, in the Bhikiyasain town of Almora, a UCO Bank employee, Shankar Dutt Bhatt, had a narrow escape. He got trapped in floodwaters while coming back from Manila village on his scooter. While Bhatt was somehow saved by the people at the spot, his scooter got washed away. The heavy rainfall also caused damage to a few houses in Almora, Bageshwar and Pithoragarh districts. “Four families living in the Gharudi village of Munsyari tehsil (Pithoragarh) were shifted to a primary school building after their houses suffered damage in the rainfall,” Bhupendra Singh Mahar, district disaster management officer, told TOI. In Kapkot village of Bageshwar, the water pipeline broke due to incessant rainfall. This hit the supply of water in 32 households. Village head Ganga Singh Karki told TOI that the villagers tried to reconnect the pipeline but it broke again as debris and boulders kept falling on the road due to the rainfall. Meanwhile, the water level crossed the danger mark in Kali, Gori, Dhauli, Saryu, Kosi, Ramganga, Gomti and other rivers in the Kumaon region. The local administration has issued an alert for the people living along the banks of these rivers and has urged them to move to safer places. In a video being widely shared among locals in Pithoragarh, the strong current of a swollen-up river can be seen cutting soil along its banks, leading to the uprooting of fruit-bearing trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/52-yr-old-man-dies-in-pithoragarh-after-boulder-falls-on-truck-almora-man-has-close-shave/articleshow/83672359.cms||Prem Punetha

He said that the national leadership of Congress is heading towards a huge blunder. “Sudhakaran is giving protection to one of the accused in the case in which I was shot at. This person spent 17 years in jail. He is taking care of all his expenses. Contract killers were hired to kill me. It was not me but Pinarayi Vijayan who was first targeted to be shot and killed by Sudhakaran. So, a quotation gang was hired to do that. They had links with RSS. They were sent thinking that Pinarayi would be with me. They shot me as Pinarayi was not with me,” said Jayarajan. Jayarajan also attacked the KPCC president personally and said that he is a mentally unsound person and has an ugly mind-set. He said that an FIR was registered against Sudhakaran in the Nalpadi Vasu murder case but his name was later removed using influence.  “That FIR was altered to free Sudhakaran. Karunakaran was the then home minister and Sudhakaran escaped using that influence,” said Jayarajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/jayarajan-hits-out-at-kpcc-president/articleshow/83672364.cms||---

The case positivity rate remained below at 10%, while the recovery rate stands at 96%. The active caseload reduced to 3,473. Even bigger health centres now report fewer cases, and their daily average has gone below ten. Porvorim primary centre, that was reporting close to 80 to 100 fresh infections daily over the last two months, now sees less than five cases a day even as about 50 tests are done. Porvorim health centre had little over 100 active cases on Saturday. As many as 47 patients were hospitalised during the day, and 38 discharged. With the decline in new infections, the number of people placed in Covid care centres has reduced drastically. With nine mortalities, the toll reached 2,985, of which, five occurred at the Goa Medical College (GMC), two each reported by South Goa District Hospital (SGDH) and different private hospitals. A 42-year-old man from Quepem, who suffered from chronic kidney disease, died at GMC after two weeks of treatment.

The con men directed the victim to a dealer in Mumbai, who neither delivered the seeds nor returned his money. In a complaint registered with cybercrime police, Bhavdeep Goswami (35) said he got an email on April 20 from one Dr David Temp, asking him to send quotes and rate for ashwagandha seeds. He then received another email, asking him to get the seeds from Manoj Kumar. Temp offered to share the profit equally with Goswami. The 35-year-old got two packets of seeds allegedly for Rs 4.18 lakh. “When he spoke to Temp, he asked Goswami to get two more samples and deliver them to one Rolin Bowen in Delhi. Goswami and his friend drove to Delhi and gave the samples to Bowen, a Nigerian. Later, he got a call from Temp that his samples had been approved and he needed to procure 46 more samples,” the complaint stated. Goswami allegedly asked Kumar for 46 packets. “The distributors asked for 40% in advance.

---||Goa||Goa: Comorbid people shed hesitancy, give vax drive a shot in the arm||PANAJI: As the inoculation drive picks up pace, several people with comorbidities have been shedding their inhibitions and getting vaccinated against Covid-19 after consulting their doctors. Cancer survivor Simitra Rodrigues, for instance, got herself vaccinated as soon as her physician gave her the go-ahead. “I consulted my doctor who had administered chemotherapy drugs and he gave me a green signal. When I took the vaccine, it was five months since I completed my course of chemotherapy,” she told TOI. Rodrigues, a microbiologist, has been doing her bit to spread awareness about the vaccination drive and bust the myths around it. “After my first dose, I only had a mild body ache. One paracetamol and I was fine. When I took the second jab, I needed two doses of paracetamol and ever since I haven’t experienced any other side effects,” she said. Considering the highly infectious nature of the coronavirus, she advises people to get vaccinated to protect not only themselves but also those around them. “Once vaccinated, you no longer continue to be a host to the virus and don’t contribute to its spread. The healthcare system too will be in a better position to treat the few who are perhaps unvaccinated and turn serious, rather than being flooded with 100% demand for resources all at the same time,” Rodrigues said. Some lactating mothers like Mathilda Colaco jumped at the opportunity to protect themselves and their children when the government put them in the priority group. “Initially, there were all kinds of rumours, including that you won’t be able to breastfeed for 15 days post-vaccination, but later all this was found to be untrue after the government declared it safe for us to get the jab. I breastfed my child before taking the vaccine and immediately after returning from the vaccination centre and I had no problems except mild body ache,” she said. She took the vaccine during the second wave of the Covid-19to ensure her baby is safe ahead of the next wave as children aren't being vaccinated yet. “I feel lactating mothers are at an advantage compared to mothers who have stopped breastfeeding, as we can pass on the antibodies to our children. It's a vaccine for my baby,” she told TOI. Another lactating mother, Alba Miranda Dacosta from Margao, said she wouldn’t have risked getting out of the house during the second wave to get vaccinated if the government hadn’t given priority to lactating mothers. “It’s best for us to get vaccinated because there are so many times one has to leave the house and if you get infected, at least you won’t require hospitalisation and can be there for your baby when he/she requires you the most,” she added. In another case, a highly comorbid 85-year-old from Nuvem who has undergone two angioplasties, cancer treatment — with both her breasts removed — and has a compromised lung, got herself fully vaccinated in April. “There were so many rumours from anti-vaccination groups, but when I was reading the news, I found that everybody was advising people to take the vaccine as soon as possible. I said to myself why should I be left behind? I consulted my doctor and he told me not to wait. I tell all my relatives, children and grandchildren to get vaccinated,” Homai Dalal told TOI. Twenty-year-old Kunal Thakur, a law college student from Arambol with muscle dystrophy, had his initial doubts but checked with a couple of doctors and overcame vaccine hesitancy. He even managed to convince his parents that it was safe for him to take it. “I didn’t feel sick or have side effects after the jab. In fact, I answered an exam online the very next day. I posted my photo on social media and convinced many others to get vaccinated too,” he said. “People, however, cannot be forced. They just have to be reminded that they’re jeopardising others' lives by refusing to get inoculated. They may recover from Covid-19, but someone else they infect may not.” There have been instances of people who were reluctant to take the jab experiencing a change of heart only after getting infected with Covid-19 during the peak of the second wave. Elvis D’Costa was one of them. After being taken from one hospital to another at the end of April — a time when there were no beds available — he had to sleep on a bench outside the casualty section and await his turn. After seeing so many Covid-19 patients dying around him, he feels lucky to have survived. “I was not comfortable with taking the vaccine at the time and stepped back although my sister and others tried to convince me. I was worried about the side effects and my approach to the vaccine was very negative,” he told TOI. “I can say I have been given a second life. My condition was bad and I turned so weak that I couldn’t climb steps or do the simplest of tasks. I feel I wouldn’t have been hit so badly if I had gotten vaccinated earlier. I’m ready to take it now, but I have to wait as per the government’s guidelines,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/comorbid-people-shed-hesitancy-give-vax-drive-a-shot-in-the-arm/articleshow/83676082.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Bidhuri, however, claimed that several government departments were running day-to-day work on outsourcing the same to contractors. “Most of the contractors are not paying minimum wages to people working in such departments, which is a violation of the government notified Act,” he claimed. The Badarpur MLA said Delhi government had no right to ask the private sector to implement minimum wages in Delhi, when its own departments were under scrutiny for not ensuring that hiked wages are paid to workers.

---||Goa||Non-invasive brain surgery saves vision of 6-yr-old boy||Panaji: A six-year-old boy with fading eyesight recently had his vision saved after doctors performed a rare procedure — a non-invasive brain surgery. The child had suffered a sudden onset of paralysis of left eye muscles, affecting his vision. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed an abnormal outpouching (aneurysm) in his left internal carotid artery with bleeding in the brain and behind the left eye. It also showed swollen eye muscles and pressure on the optic nerve. “This is one of the first pediatric neuro-interventions done in the state,” said Dr Sanat Bhatkar, an interventional neurologist at Healthway hospital, who led the endovascular procedure. “The minimally-invasive procedure is advantageous because of the reduced risk of blood loss, and fewer procedure-related morbidities. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is important in treating cases of strokes.” Dr Sumant Prabhudessai, a paediatrician and, Dr Bharati Sawant, an anaesthetist, were also part of the team. Other options were considered but discarded due to the higher element of risk. “An open neurosurgical clipping on the outpouching was nearly impossible, due to its dangerous location, risk of rupture, and infection. Endovascular coiling was done for him and platinum coils were used to pack the outpouching (aneurysm), and that cut down the risk of re-bleeding,” Bhatkar said. The patient’s response to the treatment has so far been satisfactory, and was discharged a few days ago. “There has been a marked improvement in his vision, a partial opening of the left eye as well, as in eye movements. He will likely completely improve over the next eight-twelve weeks,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/non-invasive-brain-surgery-saves-vision-of-6-yr-old-boy/articleshow/83676137.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Ivermectin, doxycycline, zinc out of Covid home kits||PANAJI: The directorate of health services (DHS) has instructed health centres and hospitals across the state to remove ivermectin, zinc and doxycycline tablets from the kits given to Covid-19 patients who are in home isolation. The directive come after the Union health ministry’s revised guidelines dropped ivermectin and a few other medications from the Covid-19 treatment protocol. A health officer in North Goa said his centre received the communication from the DHS on Friday. “The stock of the tablets taken out from the Covid kits will be returned to DHS,” he said. 50% of people believed the two tablets could not deter the virusBesides ivermectin and other medication, the kits contained a pulse oximeter, vitamin C and vitamin D tablets, paracetamol tablets, masks, and a bottle of clinic spirit. The consumption of zinc tablets, the health officer said, was dropped due to the increasing cases of mucormycosis, which has partly been attributed to increased levels of zinc in the body. “The efficacy of doxycycline and ivermectin, on the other hand, has always been questionable. At least 50% of the people believed that the two tablets could not deter the virus,” he said. Goa was one of the few states in the country that began distributing home isolation kits to Covid-19 patients at the height of the first wave of the pandemic last year, and continued it during the second wave as well. The quantum of ivermectin, doxycycline and zinc that is currently available with the DHS remains unknown as the directorate procures medication in bulk to meet the requirements of facilities across the state. It is also not known whether the balance stock of the three tablets will be returned to their distributors. Goa’s health ministry was in the eye of a storm last month over its decision to distribute free ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug, as a prophylaxis for people above 18 years of age. The matter was also raised before the high court of Bombay at Goa, which is hearing multiple petitions related to Covid-19 management. The government was ultimately compelled to drop ivermectin consequent to the Centre’s decision. Last week, chief minister Pramod Sawant had rejected a DHS proposal to procure ivermectin worth Rs 10 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ivermectin-doxy-zinc-to-be-excluded-from-covid-home-isolation-kits/articleshow/83676133.cms||---

Maharashtra reported 8,912 cases from more than 2.34 lakh tests conducted in the last 24 hours, taking its daily positivity rate to 3.8%. The test positivity rate (2.1%) in Mumbai too dropped to its lowest ever in the second wave on Saturday as 33,136 tests revealed 676 cases. Fatalities reported an increase in the state, while they dipped in the city. The state reported 257 Covid deaths and added 425 unreported deaths, taking the cumulative death toll to 1,17,356 and the total caseload to 59.6 lakh. Mumbai recorded only 13 deaths, taking its total toll so far to 15,279. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s dashboard showed that the number of critical Covid-19 patients in the city’s hospitals had now dropped below 1,000 (951). “As the number of serious patients drops, the daily deaths are bound to drop too,” said a doctor from a BMC hospital. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that the civic corporation is stepping up efforts to ensure the city’s health infrastructure is ready in time for the third wave. “Today, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria has said that the third wave is inevitable and could be here in August. We will speed up the process of readiness. Construction of the new jumbo centres in the city is in full swing,” he said. In the Mumbai circle, which consists of multiple civic corporations, the daily caseload was a bit higher than in the city itself, at 1,708, and 81 deaths were reported. However, some corporations such as the Kalyan-Dombivli municipal corporation, Mira-Bhayander and Vasai-Virar recorded zero deaths on Saturday. A senior state government official said that the Centre has asked the state to proceed cautiously while opening up, as crowding in the cities could lead to a sudden surge in cases. “There is also the danger of the Delta variant. Until a sizeable population is vaccinated, opening up should be done cautiously,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-state-citys-daily-positivity-rate-at-lowest-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/83685022.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Error-ridden estimate raises costs for parking projects||Thiruvananthapuram: Erroneous estimates prepared for the construction of multi-level car parking (MLCP) facilities at the corporation’s main office and Putharikandom under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) project have forced the local body to shell out additional amount to the tune of over Rs 1 crore. The estimate prepared by Kitco made errors in civil and electrical estimates and even missed out on need for general lighting in multi-level car parking facility. The engineering wing has reported that it was owing to the lapses from the project consultant Kitco that the project could not be completed on time. The works standing committee is set to present the agenda seeking time extension and ratification of additional amount for the projects in the council meeting to be held on Monday. The inauguration of MLCP at main office was held in September 2020. However, the fire safety component was missing from the entire project and work is still going on for installation of fire safety measures due to which the parking facility is yet to be opened to public. Administrative sanction was received for Rs 17.64 crore for two MLCPs at main office and Putharikandom ground. The estimate for main office MLCP was Rs 5.64 crore while that of Putharikandom was Rs 12 crore. The amount was fixed based on the estimate furnished by Kitco. However, it was later revealed that during the progress of construction of MLCP at main office, 12 footings were considered by Kitco when it should have been 24. Besides the new dimensions of sump room as per the fire safety norms, roofing, grade beam were not considered in the estimate prepared by Kitco. The depth of the foundation also had to be increased from 2m to 3.5m and this resulted in an increase in the original estimate. The corporation was forced to ask the contractor to complete the missing works as well. LSGD chief engineer sanctioned a revised estimate of Rs 6.13 crore for the completion of MLCP at the main office. Electrical estimate also had missed components like general lighting and liasoning charges. Although the revised rate was Rs 6.13 crore, the private contractor quoted additional amount at a rate of 3.5% and Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society, which was awarded the fire safety installation works, quoted an excess 9.5% to complete the work. This further increased the amount to Rs 6.71 crore. The agenda note of works standing committee shows that similar lapses in estimates were noted for Putharikandom project as well and the original estimate had to be revised from Rs 12 crore to Rs 14.86 crore. The review meeting held in April cited that if two-wheeler parking and solar block could be exempted, the work can be finished at Rs 12.19 crore. MLCP lighting and fire stair were not considered for Putharikandom project as well. The estimate for MLCP at the Medical College also had to be revised from Rs 11 crore to Rs 12.24 crore. The corporation plans that since the sanction was given for Medical College MLCP at Rs 14 crore, the excess amount could be used to meet the additional expense required for two other schemes. Works standing committee chairman D R Anil said that work on MLCP at the main office will be completed within a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/error-ridden-estimate-raises-costs-for-parking-projects/articleshow/83674353.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Survey finds high awareness of waste segregation, laxity in processing||NAGPUR: While 98% of the citizens are aware about solid waste segregation, 78% are not fully satisfied with the current waste processing practices in the city. An online survey, carried out by the Centre for Sustainable Development (CFSD) in ten zones of the city, brought this to the fore. The survey attempted to understand citizens’ perspective on the current status of Nagpur’s waste management system, as well as inform Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) about the gaps in waste management practices. Calling this a pilot exercise to ensure accuracy of findings, the online survey was conducted on 297 people across all 10 zones of the city, including slum settlements and residential areas. Majority of the sample participants — 81% — indicated that they have a system of door-to-door collection for household waste. Around 12% said that they dispose of their waste in the waste bins placed inside their residential colonies or societies while 11% disposed of their waste in public bins placed outside their colonies or societies. Negligible percentage of participants (1%) also said that they threw their waste in open spaces or road sides. More than 80% of the participants said they were segregating their waste at the household level. When it comes to collection of waste, over 70% participants indicated that the waste collector collects the segregated waste separately. This practice was reported highest by the participants from Gandhibagh (96%), followed by Lakadganj (96%) and Dhantoli (88%). However, 42% participants from Dharampeth and 35% from Mangalwari said that the waste collector collects unsegregated waste. Only 22% respondents were found to be fully satisfied with waste collection and disposal system in their neighbourhood. Among the reasons for partial or non-satisfaction, maximum participants (67%) said the waste collector mixes the dry and wet waste. Another crucial finding of the survey showed that 71% of participants said segregated waste was being transported in the same van having different compartments for wet and dry waste. “This is the biggest flaw in the waste collection system. All the separated waste is finally dumped together as mixed waste at Bhandewadi dumping ground, leading to failure of the whole segregation effort. Using vans with separate compartments needs to be stopped,” said Leena Buddhe, founder of CFSD. According to her, the waste management tussle between NMC and private contractors is currently at its peak. “NMC has given the contract for waste management across Nagpur to two private contractors for 10 years. Though the tender mentions door to door collection of segregated waste, mixed garbage is being dumped at the Bhandewadi dumping site. Moreover, the contract is based on tipping fee, where they are being paid on tonnage basis,” she said. She added that the contractor is keen only on collecting as much waste as possible to increase the weight, and is not interested in promoting the decentralized waste management model. “The private contractor doesn’t have a proper plan for the collection of garbage from slums,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/survey-finds-high-awareness-of-waste-segregation-laxity-in-processing/articleshow/83674358.cms||Manka Behl

The complaints have been filed by Nayan Patel, the talati of the area. In the first complaint, Patel has stated that an area of 21,825 sq m was government land but the developers of Al-Fazal Row Houses had encroached upon it. Patel stated that one Kunjiben Thakore had filed an application to get back the land in question. The application was submitted to the collector as well as to the Gujarat high court. The court had directed the applicant to contact the collector who had concluded that she had no right over the land as it was in the government’s possession. During the investigation it was revealed that the land had been encroached upon and hence a complaint was filed against the developers and associated persons. The complainant stated that on June 18, 2021, a meeting of the new committee against land grabbing, headed by the Ahmedabad district collector, was held. The committee checked all the records and directed the talati to register the complaint. Another complaint filed by Patel related to land that had been encroached upon by 17 people. The complaint was filed after the committee found the 17 guilty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fatehwadi-land-grab-2-plaints-filed/articleshow/83674320.cms||---

This land, which is estimated to be around Rs 327 crore, is located at various places across the state. According to a report submitted by the controller of defence accounts (CDA), Secunderabad to the controller general of defence accounts (CGDA), Delhi this land has been transferred to the state. When STOI approached the CDA office with a copy of this report, the officials said that they have submitted all the details to the Centre, based on which the land transfer has been done. As thousands of acres of unused land at its disposal, the ministry of defence (MoD) is exploring ways to commercially exploit these surplus land parcels. “As per the directive 64.464 acre defence land worth Rs 327 crore has been transferred to the Telangana government,” the CGDA report said. It may be mentioned here that Telangana government has sought about 185 acre defence land to build various infrastructure projects. The worth of this defence land is around Rs 1,280 crore. When compared to Karnataka (44 acre), a large chunk of defence land was sought in Telangana. Meanwhile, with regard to encroachment of defence land, Telangana stood third after Jammu & Kashmir (249 acre), and Maharashtra (145 acre), according to CGDA report. The All Cantonments Citizens Welfare Association (ACCIWA), a civic body has welcomed the move. “This is a clear admission by the government that there is a large extent of surplus land with the defence. This decision will help to boost the revenues,” said Jeetender Surana, general secretary of the All Cantonments Citizens Welfare Association (ACCIWA). “The annual property tax will be increased on large properties and the Centre can increase its revenues through development charges and employment opportunities,” the ACCIWA general secretary added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/64-acre-defence-land-given-to-t/articleshow/83674332.cms||Sunil Mungara

Cyber police inspector Maruti Khedkar told TOI, “The 24-year-old youth and the accused woman, while pursuing higher education in Aurangabad, became friends. Over a period of time, they got into a relationship. However, due to lockdown, the youth returned home and got into farming. During this time, he got married to another woman, following which he stopped talking to the accused.” This did not go down well with the accused, who allegedly created fake social media accounts in the name of the youth’s wife and started defaming her. The youth is currently pursuing his M.Sc, while the accused woman is pursuing her M.Phil.  Both hail from Gahnsawngi in Jalna, said the officer. The youth had married another woman in January this year and within few days of marriage, he started receiving messages and links on social media raising questions over his wife’s character. This resulted in some friction between the newlywed couple. The woman initially tried to convince her husband, but in vain. Worried over the increasing number of messages being received by her husband, she brought the matter to her father’s notice, who reached to Gahnsawngi police station and lodged a complaint against the unidentified suspect. The matter was referred to cyber police, which tracked down the cellphone used for creating fake accounts, only to zero down the suspected woman. “We arrested her, seized her her cellphone and produced her before the court on Friday, following which, she has been remanded in judicial custody,” said Khedkar. The cellphone has been sent for analysis to cyber forensic experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/woman-creates-fake-account-to-defame-ex-flames-wife-held/articleshow/83671126.cms||---

Kasba Peth is the site of the Budhwar Peth station, one of five on the 5km Shivajinagar to Swargate underground stretch, which falls on the Pimpri to Swargate Metro corridor. Officials from Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro), the agency executing the project, said the two machines have crossed the Mutha river at a depth of 25 metres and would reach the Kasba Peth site in the next few days. Officials said the machines, which started excavating from Civil Court, had crossed the river last month. Maha-Metro said the two machines have excavated tunnels that were a kilometre long. “The tunnelling work has not run into any hurdles so far as the machines were excavating through uncut basalt rock,” an official said, adding, “The work is progressing towards Budhwar Peth at the expected pace.” The Civil Court interchange station is located around 30 metres underground, while the station at Kasba Peth is five metres higher. MahaMetro has already started the work on both the Civil Court and Kasba Peth stations. The MahaMetro officials said work on tunnelling and construction of the Metro stations has been compartmentalized. “This is to ensure that the work is executed faster. The tunnelling work has continued even when work on the stations has yet to be completed. Tunnels are already passing through the locations of both the stations. A similar plan is being executed for the Mandai and Swargate stations,” the official added. After Kasba Peth station, the machines will dig the tunnels towards Mandai. Swargate is the culminating station on the underground stretch. MahaMetro has introduced a third tunnel boring machine, from the Swargate-end towards Mandai. Officials said they were now working to complete the remaining tunnelling work. The plan is to extract all machines at Mandai, once the tunnels are ready, the official said. Meanwhile, MahaMetro has also started work on a short passage connecting both tunnels at the Shivajinagar-Civil Court location. “The passage will be used to move from one tunnel to another in emergency situations. The provision is among safety measures planned as part of the Metro project,” another official said. Work on the underground stretch had begun at the beginning of 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metros-tunnel-boring-machines-set-to-reach-kasba-peth-site/articleshow/83674377.cms||Sarang Dastane

He is not entitled to the discretionary relief.”Eight policemen, including the bodyguard of Nanded superintendent of police Pramod Kumar Shewale, sustained serious injuries in the incident that took place at the main gate of the gurdwara complex. Dozens of vehicles, most of them belonging to the police, were damaged as an armed mob went on a rampage.Due to the increasing number of Covid-19 cases, on March 21, the Nanded district administration had imposed section 144 of the CrPC from March 24 to April 4. Accordingly, the permission to hold the ‘Halla Bol’ on Rangapanchami (falling on March 29) was denied by the Nanded police.The procession is a three-century old tradition followed by members of the Sikh community in Nanded in which they gather and run from the gurdwara to Nagina ghat — a distance of about 1,500m — holding swords and traditional weapons.In one of the three FIRs registered by the Nanded police, 84 suspects were booked and 27 were arrested on charges of attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, rioting, using criminal force to deter public servant from performing official duty. In addition, sections of the Disaster Management Act, Indian Arms Act, Criminal Law (amendment) Act, Maharashtra Police Act and Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act were slapped.Police have contested before the HC that the violence was the result of a conspiracy hatched by a group of people, including Bungai. Initially, the FIR stated that at the time of the incident, Bungai was present in Nanded. However, the probe found that he was in Mumbai. Additional public prosecutor K M Kagne contested: “Though Bungai was in Mumbai at the relevant time, he simultaneously has played a pivotal role in inciting the mob to hold the procession by hatching a conspiracy. There is a call data record to demonstrate that though he was in Mumbai, he was in constant touch with the other suspects at Nanded.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/gurdwara-board-secys-pre-arrest-bail-rejected/articleshow/83671132.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The ATS officials said that three others accused from Maharashtra are absconding. Such VoIP exchanges pose a security threat to the country and can cause revenue loss, the ATS said. Acting on a tip-off about an illegal VoIP exchange being operated, Gujarat ATS and Vadodara special operations group raided the establishment in the Vasna area of Vadodara and arrested one Shehjad Rafik Malek. Officials said that three others — Jini Vasva, a resident of Bhayandar West in Mumbai, Amimer alias Harun Majid (Mira-Bhayandar), and Ishaq Raj (Mira Road) — are absconding. The accused had taken the premises on rent and were allowing people to make international calls, said a statement from the ATS. The accused allegedly used a postpaid primary rate interface line for VoIP call routing, which is illegal, it was stated. “Calls made through VoIP exchanges leave no trace of the international number from where the call originated. Running such an exchange is illegal and causes revenue loss and creates a security threat to the country,” the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/one-held-for-illegal-voip-exchange/articleshow/83674369.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Leaders miffed over futile debate||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state politics is likely to witness more verbal sparring between chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and KPCC president K Sudhakaran due to their aggressive political style. However, political observers and Congress leaders are of the view that it is time both the leaders came out of Kannur politics and debated crucial issues concerning the state. Launching personal attacks based on past incidents will not do any good for Congress party or the state, they feel. “A great leader or a strong leader is not the one who boasts of what he had done in his college days. A strong leader never speaks about violence, instead he/she takes strong positions on crucial issues,” said political analyst Prof J Prabhash. Even though the Congress leaders have rallied behind the KPCC president in the issue, most of them are of the opinion that such sensationalism would not do any favour for the party, especially when the party is attempting a political makeover. “It is a non-issue. We should put an end to this. There are several crucial issues which we have to debate in the state. Hence, I personally feel this should end here,” said opposition leader V D Satheesan. Political observer Jacob George said that politics is no longer a show of strength using muscle power. “It is your ability to take strategic decisions in the crucial issues that counts. Tall leaders like K Sudhakaran debating over campus politics is not going to help the Congress. Sudhakaran should come out of the hallow of Kannur politics,” said George. Many leaders within the Congress are also upset over the ongoing debate. They feel that it is not just Kannur politics that the people of the state are interested in now. “Debating over what leaders had done as part of campus politics is immature. Both the leaders should avoid such unnecessary arguments,” said senior Congress leader and MP Benny Behannan. “Everyone knows the fact that Sudhakaran reacts aggressively. Hence, it is not a surprise. But we have to think whether a KPCC president should react like this or not,” said another senior leader in the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/leaders-miffed-over-futile-debate/articleshow/83672416.cms||---

The association has written to the GCZMA putting on record its objection to this inspection to be carried out under the supervision of an additional collector. The residents have said that prior to their complaint, another complaint had been filed against the same wall to GCZMA on April 19. Based on this complaint, an inspection of the wall was carried out by GCZMA. Another site inspection was carried out on April 23,based on a letter from the village panchayat of Taleigao. The association has stated that as the starred hotel, which was constructing the wall, was duly served notices for the previous inspection and therefore the inspection was valid. The hotel deliberately abstained from attending the inspection. The residents have therefore said there was no requirement of a third joint inspection involving the hotel. The association has said the inspection agenda should include a finding of whether the wall is a new construction. The residents said the wall is a new construction started in 2021 illegally in a public property by the starred hotel. “The illegal offending structure constructed today has no connection whatsoever to any wall that existed earlier, and is a new wall, blatantly and illegally constructed on land that is publicly owned,” The president of Vainguinim Valley Residents Association Collin Curry said in his letter to GCZMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vainguinim-residents-object-to-third-inspection-of-beach-wall-by-gczma/articleshow/83676355.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Childhood friends form robbery gang, held||NAGPUR: Matching fingerprints led to the arrest of a burglar who, along with his childhood friend, had committed a spate of housebreakings in the city. Shanti Nagar police have identified the burglars as Rupesh Pande (30) and Abdul Rehman (30), both residents of Shanti Nagar. They are childhood friends and reportedly studied together in school. “Now, they formed a gang to commit housebreaking thefts,” said the police. Cops said that on April 20, one Krishna Jha (30, a resident of Tulsi Nagar) had lodged a complaint that some unidentified thieves had entered his two-storey house by breaking the latch of the main door and decamped with valuables worth Rs5.10 lakh, including Rs50,000 cash. They committed the theft within half an hour when Jha had gone to his uncle’s house in the neighbourhood at 9.30pm. Shanti Nagar police reached the spot and summoned the forensic team. The pattern of the theft of not breaking the door’s lock but opening the latch and not making any noise gave the police an inkling that some expert gang of thieves may have committed the crime. First, Pande was nabbed on the basis of fingerprint matching. The cops had collected his fingerprints during his arrest in a massive Rs26 lakh burglary at Karanja Lad. Later, the police team of senior PI GJ Jamdar under PSI Arun Bakal and including head constable Abdul Wakil Shaikh, naik constables Vinod Samudre, Prakash Pakhan and others, trapped Abdul Rehman from whom the booty worth more than Rs5.30 lakh were recovered. Meanwhile, Kotwali police on Friday night foiled a robbery bid by five persons near Gangabai Ghat. Acting on a tip-off, a team of Kotwali police led by PSI Ajay Lingnurkar raided a secluded place near Gangabai Ghat and arrested Prajwal Kakde (22, a resident of Bahadura), Chetan Lokhande (24, a resident of Wathoda), Aman Bhamode (18, a resident of Mahal), Praful Shivrejar (26, a resident of Pardi) and Pankaj Samarth (32, a resident of Manikpura Chowk). Police have also recovered a saw, sword, nylon rope, chilli powder and stumps. Police said the five were planning a robbery when they were arrested. The police have booked them under sections 399, read with 402 of the IPC and 4, 25 of the Arms Act, 135 of Bombay Police Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/childhood-friends-form-robbery-gang-held/articleshow/83674385.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||‘17 geothermal energy sites in Gujarat can be exploited with good returns on investment’||AHMEDABAD: We may know about hot water springs at Tulsishyam or Lasundra, but there are 17 sites in Gujarat where geothermal energy can be exploited with good returns on investment, Gujarat’s first geothermal atlas highlights. The atlas was created by the Centre of Excellence for Geothermal Energy (CEGE) at PDEU, and is in the final stage before it is submitted to the state government for further exploration. The 17 potential sites explored in Gujarat by the researchers are Dholera, Unai, Gandhar, Chabsar, Ghogha, Harsani, Kawi, Khedpada, Khar, Maktapur, Warha, Mithapur, Tuwa, Tulsishyam, Savarkundla, Lasundra and Lalpur. Prof Anirbid Sircar, head of CEGE and dean of R&D at PDEU, said the results are encouraging with the majority of sites having medium to high enthalpy (total heat potential). “The sites were chosen based on geophysical surveys of gravity, magnetism, seismic activity and magneto-telluric surveys. In the majority of the cases, hot water springs are surface manifestation of geothermal energy,” he said. The researchers went a step further with analysis of geophysical data to project possible energy values of the sites. “Temperature logs are also used to understand the subsurface gradients. An integrated geophysical data interpretation helped us identify the subsurface geothermal anomalies,” said Prof Sircar. When commercial/ non-commercial entities harness geothermal energy, what factors do they consider? How do our sites measure up on those parameters? Prof Sircar said that they should consider the prognosticated energy resource for a particular site. “Depending on enthalpy range and heat capacity they should decide whether it should be used for power generations or indirect applications such as greenhouses, horticulture, sericulture, food drying, honey processing, mushroom cultivation etc.,” he said. “In low enthalpy area, a hybrid approach can also be adopted. For example, we are exploring the solar-geothermal model in Dholera. Similarly, wind-geothermal model can also be adopted depending on the site conditions.” The researchers said the atlas has shown potential to industry for both direct and indirect applications. They pointed to applications such as potato cold storage, milk pasteurization, honey processing etc. around such sites. They added that help from industries can demonstrate the commercial viability of such projects. What makes Gujarat an important region to explore geothermal energy? Prof Sircar said that the Deccan traps are exposed in Gujarat. “The thickness of Deccan basalt varies from 400m to 1,200m. Deccan basalt can hold a lot of heat. If we can drill through it, we can extract a lot of heat from dry rock, a method known as an enhanced geothermal system,” he said, adding that the technique has successfully been used in countries such as Australia, France and the US. CEGE is already working at Dholera and Unai. At Unai, the team has found the hottest well in Gujarat with a surface temperature of 70 degrees celsius. The Centre of Excellence is also working on projects to showcase the capacity of geothermal energy for food drying and balneology (the medicinal effects of hot water springs).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/17-geothermal-energy-sites-in-gujarat-can-be-exploited-with-good-returns-on-investment/articleshow/83674441.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Ayurveda, Unani docs awaiting registration renewal from 2 years, claims NIMA||NAGPUR: More than 20,000 doctors practicing India medicine (Ayurveda & Unani) are still deprived of the registration renewal from their statutory body — The Maharashtra Council of Indian Medicine (MCIM) — since over 2 years, claimed student forum of National Integrated medical Association (NIMA). This registration is must for them to continue their practice. “Thousands of medical professionals and postgraduate students who have paid the registration renewal fee have not received the renewal certificate in last 2 years. Why should action not be taken against the council?,” reads the letter issued by NIMA Student forum president Dr Shriram Ragad and Secretary Dr Rahul Raut. According to Dr Raut, MCIM announced the mandatory renewal of the registration of all Ayurveda and Unani medical professionals as well as postgraduate students registered before December 31, 2015 through a circular in March 2019. Renewal Process started in 2019. “More than 65,000 practitioners in Maharashtra applied through the web application. We have paid the revised fees of Rs2,000 for renewal. But till June 2021, thousands of doctors as well as PG students have not received the certificate of renewal registration,” said Dr Raut. NIMA has repeatedly requested the MCIM through a deputation, he added. Interestingly, MCIM has revised registration fees from Rs50 to Rs2000. According to the officials, this revision was pending since 1960s. Doctors have agreed to pay this fees but still not getting the certificates of renewal. Doctors, especially PG students attached to NIMA have demanded that their PG specialization should be mentioned on the renewal certificate. TOI spoke to Dr Dilip Wange, registrar of MCIM who claimed that the process is going on smoothly. “There were some glitches due to Covid-19 pandemic, but we completed the renewal process meticulously. There is no online renewal application pending with us now. As far as physical certificate is concerned, they are also being provided on fast track,” he said. The MCIM comes under the ministry of medical education and research and minister Amit Deshmukh is statutory head of this council. Dr Ashutosh Gupta is president of MCIM. It works exactly on the lines of Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) which regulates the practitioners of modern medicine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ayurveda-unani-docs-awaiting-registration-renewal-from-2-years-nima/articleshow/83674519.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The police have identified the accused as Shameer (29) of Sreenivasapuram, Al Rabeen (28) of Raghunathapuram, Sunil (48) of Mannaniya Laksham Veedu colony and Mohammed Noufal (25) of Sreenivasapuram. The alleged attack happened near Laksham Veedu Colony at Varkala on Thursday around 4.30pm . Junior Health inspector Aneesh and Arun, a daily wage staff under Varkala Municipality, are the complainants in the case. Besides assaulting the complainants, the accused also vandalized the car in which the latter arrived on the spot. The car belonged to the Varkala Municipality, police said. Varkala SHO S Dwijesh said that the complainants had visited the colony as part of an awareness drive on the Covid-19 pandemic. The accused were gathered in a public place near the colony and were consuming alcohol. Seeing this, the Junior Health Inspector stopped the vehicle and questioned their activities that would affect the fight against the pandemic. Provoked by the questioning, the accused assaulted him. Arun, who tried to intervene, was also assaulted. “We received two complaints in connection with the incident. One from the two men who faced the alleged attack and one from the Municipality regarding the vandalism of the vehicle,” the Inspector said, adding that the Municipality had claimed that the car suffered damages worth around Rs 50,000 following the vandalism act. They were caught from different hideouts in and around Varkala. They were produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/4-held-for-attack-on-covid-duty-staff/articleshow/83674412.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: HS formula won’t do justice, says Principals||KOLKATA: Several college principals have questioned the formula that the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education has drafted for the final score of Class XII board-year students, pointing out the marking will not indicate the candidates’ aptitude for the subjects they will apply for in undergraduate courses. After the state board exams of classes X and XII were cancelled to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education came up with strategies to compute the final scores of these board-year students. For Higher Secondary final scores, 40% weightage will be given to four best scores out of seven theory papers in their Madhyamik, which they took in 2019, and 60% weightage to the theory paper scores of their Class XI school annual exams, along with the marks scored in practicals for science subjects or projects for non-lab subjects. With admission tests at Calcutta University-affiliated colleges being discontinued since 2019, the institute heads said they would have to admit students on the new-formulated Class XII scores, unless instructed otherwise. “These students started on their Class XI annual exams in 2020, when the pandemic struck. The lockdown was declared, as a result of which the council-set science theory papers of physics, chemistry and statistics and all the practical exams were cancelled.  Now, if 60% weightage is given to Class XI marks and XII practicals, the XI annual scores will not reflect the right picture and will not indicate the strength and weakness of students in those three subjects, even if they score well in the aggregate and apply for physics, chemistry and stats,” said the principal of a CU college. In Arts too, several papers were cancelled, including nutrition & home science. Also, 40% weightage to the best four Madhyamik subjects might not include the scores of the subject a candidate would want to study in college, another principal said. Another principal explained how the evaluation procedure might rob a deserving candidate of a college seat, while some other students, with very high score, may get to study a subject he or she does not have a knack for. “Last year, physics, chemistry and statistics theory papers of Class XI annual exams were cancelled because of the lockdown. A student good in these subjects never got an opportunity to take the test and received his/her marks based on performance in other subjects, like English and Bengali. Many science students do not score high in non-science subjects. So, a Class XII student, who now wants to pursue science at the UG level, has not taken exams in those subjects for the past two years. This will be disadvantageous when he/she applies for admission,” said the principal. “Similarly, somebody excelling in English, Bengali or history also scored high in science subjects in Class XI last year because marks were awarded on the papers that could be held. That student, despite having no aptitude for science subjects, may secure seats in chemistry, physics or statistics honours, just because of the calculation,” the principal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hs-formula-wont-do-justice-principals/articleshow/83674436.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The people who visited the station to lodge complaints were given booklets and books. “Today’s society is estranged from the habit of reading. We thought that it would be great if we could do something to bring back the old reading culture and we distributed books to the complainants who came to the station. Our aim was to inculcate the habit of reading among the people,” said assistant sub-inspector Jayaprasad B, who also holds the charges of PRO and Janamaithri beat officer. The personnel of the police station distributed booklets that carried social awareness messages. The booklets are meant to make people aware of the bad influence of alcohol, drugs and other substance abuse. The books which were distributed contained the safety regulations and precautions listed by Janamaithri police which are intended to be followed by women and children. By circulating such books, they expect to aid women and children to be extra vigilant about their safety. According to sources, the books were collected from Janamaithri directorate. On Saturday, they distributed around 25 books. And in the coming days, they expect to distribute more number of books. By distributing books to the complainants, Varkala police station SHO Dwijesh inaugurated the ceremony. Other personnel of the station, including Jayaprasad and additional SI Chandrababu, actively took part in the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/varkala-police-distribute-books-to-complainants/articleshow/83674466.cms||---

During the course of the investigation, the police team was informed that the suspects are known for their political connections and that the possibility of them being at either of the politicians’ offices cannot be ruled out.The police team, without obtaining a search warrant, searched the office of Danve and his son Santosh on the night of June 11.The incident did not go down well with the senior politician, who lodged a complaint with Jalna police superintendent. Taking cognizance of the same, an internal probe was ordered and on getting the report, police sub-inspectors Nitin Kakarwal and Yuvraj Potre, head constable Mangalsingh Solunke and constables Sachin Tidke and Shaban Tadvi were suspended on June 14.The suspension sparked political statements from the ruling and opposition party leaders. Some justified the police action, while the others stood by action taken against the suspended policemen.Jafrabad’s sub-divisional police officer Indalsingh Bahure told TOI, “The five policemen have now been reinstated.” The officer refused to elaborate on the instructions received from the home department saying the communication might have been received by the SP’s office.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No ward officer appointed ten days after crash||MUMBAI: Ten days after a structure crash killed 12 persons, BMC is yet to appoint a full time assistant municipal commissioner (ward officer) in that ward. BMC’s P-North ward, which includes Malad where an illegal structure crashed, does not have a full-time ward officer since February. Three other wards in the city do not have full-time ward officers and so does BMC’s Removal of Encroachment department. Officials said BMC is short of five ward officers. Currently, there are no full-time ward officers in P-North, B (Mohammed Ali Road, Dongri) M-East (Govandi, Shivaji Nagar) and S (Bhandup) wards. BMC also doesn’t have full-time deputy municipal commissioners (DMC) for its key public health department too. BJP has been demanding that BMC appoint a full-time ward officer for the ward. Times ViewIt reflects poorly on the civic administration that 10 days after 12 people died in a crash, BMC is yet to appoint a full-time ward officer. P-North ward where the illegal structure crashed is Mumbai’s most populous. Three other wards don’t have full-time officers. BMC must at once appoint ward officers at these wards.Then assistant municipal commissioner (AMC) Sanjog Kabre was promoted in February this year and since then AMC Santosh Dhonde of P-South Ward holds charge of P-North ward too. Currently, DMC Bharat Marathe of zone V holds additional charge of zone IV. So the ward neither has a full-time ward officer nor a full-time DMC. Also, executive engineers are holding charge of ward officers at the B, M-East and S wards. Vibhas Achrekar, an executive engineer holding charge of S ward also holds charge of R-East. “This is the reason illegal construction has become so rampant. We have written many letters to BMC chief Iqbal Chahal asking him to appoint a full-time ward officer for this ward but to no avail... BMC administration is responsible for this crash,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. “It seems that political lobbying has led to the delay. BMC administration is bowing to political masters.” Soon after the Malad incident, Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Chahal had admitted that the BMC was short of five Ward Officers and that Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) was in the process of recruitment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-ward-officer-appointed-ten-days-after-crash/articleshow/83679275.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

He informed that his wife told him that she was about to commit suicide by jumping from the Cable-Stayed Bridge over Tapi River. Acting swiftly, a team from Adajan police station reached the spot within four minutes and averted the mishap. “Later, the woman was united with her daughter and underwent counselling from a psychologist,” said B N Sagar, police inspector, Adajan police station. Fast forward to this year’s March 22, a family of four was rescued in the nick of time when they were about to commit suicide by jumping from the weir-cum-causeway bridge. “The family was from the Salabatpura area and the husband had called PCR and informed them that they are going to end their life. Reaching the spot within three minutes, the police rescued the family,” said A A Chaudhary, police inspector, Chowk Bazaar police station. During the counselling, police found that the couple had developed disputes and were also facing financial crisis due to money spent on treatment of an ailing family member. These individuals are among the 25 whom the cops prevented from committing suicide in last six months. Normally, the rising numbers in the department books is a cause of concern for the police. But these numbers of unusual rescues is something the cops are proud of. In another incident, a woman, resident of Rander zone, and her two children were rescued by a police team that reached Vivekanand Bridge within four minutes on May 26. The woman was planning to commit suicide by jumping from the bridge.“Police department has improved its efficiency with regard to quick response to distress calls and the ensuing rescue act. Also, we are working on helping those who wanted to take the extreme step of ending their lives,” said Ajay Tomar, city police commissioner. In August 2020, the city police department started strengthening its network of Police Control Room and PCR vans so as to quickly respond to any distress call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/cops-prevent-25-suicide-attempts-in-last-six-months/articleshow/83672453.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

None of the 1,000-plus patients admitted to Fortis Hospital’s ICU since March 2020 developed the deadly fungal infection that can disfigure or kill a patient. “Of the 1,027 patients admitted to ICU between March 2020 and May 2021, 915 received steroids and 417 had diabetes. Yet, on followup we found that none developed mucormycosis,”' said the study’s main author and state task force member, Dr Rahul Pandit. The results underline that “if you manage patients well”, the fungal infection can be avoided, he said. Most big hospitals in Mumbai treat mucormycosis patients coming from outside the city. “Even if some patients develop mucormycosis, we catch it so early that the patient does not need surgery,’’ said a senior Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) doctor connected to the study. Although India is the capital of mucormycosis as the incidence here is 70 times higher than the rest of the world, the sudden rise in infection during the second Covid-19 emerged as a big cause for concern. There are 30,000 post-Covid mucormycosis patients in the country, including 7,359 in Maharashtra and 596 in Mumbai. “The sudden rise in mucormycosis is an enigma that needs to be solved,” said co-author Dr Shashank Joshi. “It has been linked to uncontrolled diabetes, SARS-CoV-2’s Delta variant, overuse of steroids and zinc, humidity levels and poor infection control measures in ICU,” Dr Joshi added. Dr Pandit and his team at Fortis Hospital, Mulund, conducted a retrospective analysis among admitted Covid-19 patients to find answers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mucor-can-be-avoided-with-a-strict-icu-vigil-shows-study-by-mumbai-city-hosp/articleshow/83678378.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||The ‘cycling’ shift in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: The Covid-19 pandemic brought about a paradigm shift in adoption of cycling not just as an exercise but also as a sporting hobby or even a mode of commute for an increasing section of population in Ahmedabad. The demand for bicycles, be it premium or mid-range, surged soon after the pandemic and the same has continued its momentum. With gyms and fitness centres shutting periodically with every surge in Covid cases and rising apprehensions among people, many have turned to cycling. For instance, city-based professional, Sanjay Parmar has been cycling from his residence in Vadaj to Nehrunagar on a daily basis so that he can remain fit and it helps him save on fuel costs too. Ahmedabad-based banker, Bijoy Varghese, who has been a fitness enthusiast since college days remained in a fix during and even after the lockdown as gyms were shut. “That’s when I took to cycling and it has been working well for me since then. It is a good means of maintaining fitness and at the same time, it is a good mental stimulus. In fact, I’ve begun cycling to office at least three to four days in a week. I live 8km away from my office so it’s a short-commute and a good exercise. Of late, the rise in fuel prices added another reason,” said Bijoy. Similar is the case of Dr Manish Raval, an Ahmedabad-based eye surgeon, who barely cycled once a week till the pandemic. “Since last year, cycling has remained with me. I make it a point to regularly cycle for at least 5-10 kilometres and it works well for my health. Moreover, it also provides a good deal of mental stimulus and is quite a relaxing break,” Raval explained. In fact, night curfew and related restrictions too have encouraged people to cycle within their locality as they have a lot of time at hand. With this the demand for cycles has gone up drastically both in terms of sales and also on rental. With this the demand for cycles has gone up drastically both in terms of sales and also on rental. BICYCLE RENTALS: Turning to cycling isn’t a tough process any more with bikes made available on rent as well and the uptakes have remained good since the pandemic. “From 2014-2020, we had deployed some 3,000 cycles in Ahmedabad, making them available on hourly, daily and monthly rentals. In 2020-21 alone, we deployed 3,000 more cycles in the city to meet the growing demand for cycles. The demand has doubled in just a year and the same has continued to sustain,” said Arjit Soni, founder, MyByk – a mobile app-based platform for bicycle rentals. Soni said that the number of people using bicycles for fitness has grown, however, increasing adoption is seen among those using bicycles for commuting. “The change is slow but a pleasant one to see. The city’s weather is a major constraint for people using bicycles for commuting but adoption even for shorter distances is a good sign,” he explained. SALES MOMENTUM CONTINUES: Soon after the lockdown resumed, the sale of bicycles saw a significant surge in demand over the years. Stores selling such bikes have witnessed sustained growth up to 35%. Sachin Wadhwani, the owner of a bicycle store near Sindhu Bhavan Road said, “People have time at hand with most still working from home, and education continuing online. This is keeping the demand up and we’re expecting good growth through the year. Against an average of 80-100 cycles retailed from each of our stores in Ahmedabad in 2019, at least 150 bicycles are sold now, taking our growth to an estimated 35%.” “People are still reluctant to visit the gym and therefore, the demand is good,” he added. Premium segment bicycles are doing well and stocks are flying off shelves way too quickly, especially for imported bicycles. “Most people in the age-group of 35-50 have been investing in new bicycles. The demand has been good so far and it has sustained since last year,” said Girirajsinh Parmar, owner of an Ahmedabad-based cycle store. COMMUNITY PUSH TO CYCLING: Cycling has been one of the easiest sports that people adopted, but over the years, it slowly gained momentum with a number of cycling clubs and smaller informal groups of cyclists getting formed. While the culture sustained for weekend long-distance rides, since the pandemic it grew further as a conscious lifestyle change for many, cyclists say.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/thecycling-shift-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/83674480.cms||Niyati Parikh

The findings are in a study on the academic and psychological functioning of college students of Kerala in the times of Covid-19 carried out by the Psychological Resource Centre, Government College for Women, Vazhuthacaud, for the directorate of collegiate education is a testimony to the ballooning discomfort the youngsters are facing in the Covid times. According to the study, 28.4% college students in arts and science colleges in the state suffer from ‘mild’ mental depression while 14.8% of them suffer moderate depression and 9.9% suffer from moderately severe depression. Around 6% suffer from severe depression. The findings, say experts should be an eye opener not only to the academic community, but to the state and the government. The prevalence of depression ranging from moderate to severe depression should be taken seriously and action should be initiated to address the same. However, psychiatrists like Dr C J John consider the prevalence of ‘worry’ factor should not be left unaddressed. “A significant number of youth in college who are trapped in loneliness and worry about their future during these online education days are vulnerable to various mental health issues. Youth violence and criminality may erupt. Clinical population also indicate such trends. There is a big need to reach out to this segment to foster their well being,” Dr John pointed out. The study shows that 25.5% of students are ‘very much’ worried about their future while 29.5% are ‘extremely worried’ about their future. The study also found that a significant section of students showed self-harming tendencies. While 22.34% students had thoughts of ending life, 5.17% have made suicide attempts. Around 53% students, said the study, were experiencing loneliness. “The psychological well being of students has decreased significantly since 2019 to 2021 in all the components of well being,” the study report pointed out. Data regarding college students’ psychological well being was collected from 2,514 college students across Kerala as part of a study conducted for the new initiatives, higher education, in 2019. The current study carried out during March-April this year had 8,005 samples and it covered 182 colleges. Female students have significantly higher level of psychological well-being than male students and there is no significant difference between students of UG and PG programmes in their psychological well-being, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/60-of-college-students-suffer-depression-study/articleshow/83674534.cms||B S Anilkumar
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Schools rush to meet June 23 deadline for XI marks||KOLKATA: The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education has directed school principals to submit hard copies of marks of Class XI annual exams held in 2020 to its regional offices within June 23 so that the computation of the final scores of Class XII students can start. After the board exams were cancelled this year owing to the pandemic, the council came up with a formula to compute Class XII final scores by giving 40% weightage to four best scores out of seven theory papers in their Madhyamik, and 60% weightage to the theory paper scores of their Class XI school annual exams, along with the marks scored in practicals for science subjects or projects for non-lab subjects. If a school fails to submit the earlier scores within the deadline, the students will be “marked absent” and the HS examination 2021 result will not be published, the institutes have been told. This directive has led to a scramble among school heads to contact the respective subject teachers and other staff members who handle storing of registers with examination marks so that the data can be compiled and delivered to the council on time. The council aims to publish the HS results by July. “To deliver the hard copies to the regional office on June 23, we must be ready with everything by June 22. So, effectively we are getting only Monday and Tuesday to complete this work, which is a rather short period of time to compile all the marks carefully and arrange them in order,” said Saugata Basu, general secretary of the West Bengal Government Teachers’ Association. “Due to the prevailing restrictions for the pandemic, trains, buses and other modes of public transport have not been operating. How are school employees expected to reach the campuses to complete the work? A majority of teaching and non-teaching staff have not even received their vaccines.” The council is aiming to publish the result by July but before that, the marks will have to be computed according to the new assessment criteria announced on Friday, another teacher said.  “The government does not want the results to be delayed as a later date might be a hurdle for students from applying abroad or taking competitive examinations,” said an official of the council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-rush-to-meet-june-23-deadline-for-xi-marks/articleshow/83674531.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Aurangabad||Heat builds up over water grid project||Aurangabad: The ambitious multi-crore water grid project proposed for Marathwada during the previous BJP-led government is proving to be a bone of contention between ruling MVA government and the Opposition. Amid speculations that the project will be scrapped, Maharashtra water supply minister Gulabrao Patil has said that the project would be executed but in a limited manner to begin with. The scaled-down scope of the project will cover only Paithan taluka of Aurangabad district. “The pros and cons of the water grid project were discussed during the review meeting. The final proposal on execution of the project would be tabled before the state cabinet shortly for taking a final call,” he told the media persons at Mumbai on June 17. A section of water management experts has opposed the project and questioned the rationale behind interlinking dams from the drought-prone region that often do not fill to the designed capacity. The project, which had financial outlay of around Rs 12,200 crore for the first phase, plans to interlink 11 dams catering to Marathwada through a grid in order to supply water for drinking and other needs. Former water supply minister Babanrao Lonikar has accused the MVA government of deliberately sidelining the project. “The crucial project was deliberately kept in a cold storage for last two years. As we have raised hue and cry over non-execution of the project, MVA government is now staging a drama of seeking funds for the project from the Centre. It is duty of the state government to shell out money for the project instead of begging before the Centre,” he said, objecting to reduced scope of the project as well. Lonikar told the media on Friday that he would knock the doors of judiciary if Water Grid project is shelved. “The project will prove a lifeline to Marathwada and is designed in a meticulous way to help the region overcome water scarcity. The state government should not scrap the project, else we will drag the government to the court,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/heat-builds-up-over-water-grid-project/articleshow/83671203.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||KSRTC to begin trial run of route number system||Thiruvananthapuram: KSRTC is going to implement a route numbering system on a trial basis for Thiruvananthapuram city service. The implementation is wholly based on the 2016 study report on the implementation of route numbering in the district conducted by the district administration in collaboration with the DTPC and the Management Department of Kannur University. Colour coding has been employed for different areas, Thiruvananthapuram city — Blue, Netyattinkara and Kattakada Taluk — Yellow, Nedumangad Taluk — Green, and Varkala and Chirayinkeezhu Taluk — Red. Apart from this, a numbering system that is easy for passengers to understand has also been implemented. For Thiruvananthapuram city, the numbers will begin with digits 1,2,3, whereas for Neyattinkara and Kattakada Taluk it will begin with 4,5. Meanwhile, for Nedumangad Taluk the numbers will start with digits 6,7 and 8,9 for Varkala and Chirayinkeezhu Taluk. The route number with colour coding will be displayed on the left side of the place name board. At the same time, the short form of a particular service category with the colour coding will be displayed on the right side of the place name board. Also, colour coding has been implemented in writing the place names. The place-name boards of city ordinary buses will be in black and blue colours and for the city fast, the places will be written in black and red. The guest workers, tourists, and elderly will find the route numbering system quite helpful. Currently, the route numbering for the city bus routes in the district has been completed. The KSRTC has decided to extend the system to other parts of the district and across the state after examining the public response regarding the system, which is being implemented as an experiment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ksrtc-to-begin-trial-run-of-route-number-system/articleshow/83674533.cms||---

In July 2019, the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) issued a demolition order against the ‘illegal’ structures owned by a guest house on the Morjim coast in Pernem taluka. The NGT has now asked the GCZMA to reconsider the case even though the area is close to the ecologically sensitive turtle nesting site. The guest house owner had approached the NGT against the GCZMA’s demolition order. The alleged violator said that the GCZMA had ordered the demolition citing the tribunal’s order on turtle nesting sites. The guesthouse owner said that the order was wrongly applied in his case. The NGT disposed of the matter permitting the guesthouse owner to move the GCZMA within one month for a review of the case. “We note that the area in question is sensitive being close to turtle nesting sites, but the demolition is permissible only if the construction is post February 19, 1991, and in no development zone. Needless to say that the GCZMA must follow due process of law before passing an order in the matter. GCZMA may finalise the matter as far as possible within three months,” the GCZMA stated in its order. The NGT said that it must be examined in the case by GCZMA whether the structure ordered to be demolished was existing prior to the 1991 CRZ notification and whether it stands within the no development zone. “No finding appears to have been recorded about the impugned constructions being post-1991 and within NDZ. The impugned order cannot thus be allowed to attain finality without further consideration,” the NGT said. The tribunal said that the GCZMA has the liberty to move the NGT if it is aggrieved by the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cannot-order-demolition-of-pre-1991-structures-near-turtle-nesting-site-ngt-to-gczma/articleshow/83676569.cms||---

She safely reached a hospital 20km away and delivered a baby girl. Doctors told TOI the woman and girl are safe and doing well.Sangeeta Shivaji Fatkare from Jogewadi Dhangarwada in Bhudargad went into labour on Friday evening. Jogewadi dhangarwada is a relatively small hamlet with a population of around 200. The gram panchayat and main village is 2km away at Vasnoli village. She had to be taken to a hospital but with no roads and bridges, it was a challenge. The villagers hurriedly prepared a makeshift sling to take Sangeeta to hospital. It was a treacherous walk for them. They braved heavy rainfall and waded through two gushing streams and steep muddy paths to take Sangeeta to Vasnoli village, where an ambulance was waiting. Vitthal Yedage from Jogewadi Dhangarwada said, “There is no proper road to our place nor a bridge. We can reach Vasnoli in the summer and winter, but the connectivity is poor during monsoon. We stock up on essentials and stay in Dhangarwada for the entire monsoon season.” Yedage said they somehow managed to reach Vasnoli on Friday evening and the ambulance took Sangeeta to the hospital in Gargoti, a town place in Bhudargad about 18km away. A similar incident took place 12 days ago where the woman unfortunately lost her baby. A villager from Girgaon Dhangarwada in Bhudargad, Arun Phonde said, “On June 6, 2021, a 24-year-old pregnant woman from Erendape Dhangarwada was carried in a similar way to a hospital. Unfortunately, she lost her baby.” Radhanagari MLA Prakash Abitkar said, “Dhangarwadas are mostly located 4-5km away from the main roads or are in the forest areas. Due to complicated regulations of the forest department, the administration is unable to provide facilities such as electricity and roads to these areas. Often, even sanctioned budget is returned without use because of such rules.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/villagers-carry-pregnant-woman-in-makeshift-carrier-for-2km-to-ambulance/articleshow/83671242.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Delhi||Monsoon to take a few more days to reach Delhi||NEW DELHI: The southwest monsoon has progressed into some other parts of Rajasthan and west Uttar Pradesh, but further advance of monsoon into Delhi is likely to be slow, stated India Meteorological Department (IMD). Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “The southwest monsoon has advanced to west Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh and Meerut, but is yet to reach neighbouring areas of Delhi. It is likely to take a few more days for the onset of monsoon in the capital.” According to IMD’s bulletin, further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Punjab is likely to be slow as largescale features are not favourable and the forecast wind pattern by the numerical models do not indicate favourable condition for sustained rainfall over the region during the forecast period. IMD had earlier forecast arrival of monsoon in Delhi by June 15, but the advancement has now slowed down. The normal meteorological date of onset is June 27. Though the Met department has been predicting pre-monsoon showers in the capital for the past many days, most areas in Delhi did not receive any rain. The forecast said the capital might receive light rain or thundershowers accompanied by gusty winds at the speed of 30-40 kmph on Sunday. There is a possibility of “very light” rain or drizzle on Monday. On Saturday, the maximum temperature was 35.1 degrees Celsius— four notches below normal— while the minimum settled at 25.3 degrees Celsius— three degrees below normal. Meanwhile, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) was in “satisfactory” category at 70. “The air quality has improved due to strong winds, which were recorded in parts of Delhi. Some neighbouring areas have witnessed rain, which helped in washing out of pollutants,” said Srivastava. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, the forecasting body under Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “Isolated thunderstorms with rainfall are likely in Delhi. Rainfall and aerosol washout are expected to improve AQI, which is likely to stay in the ‘satisfactory’ to ‘moderate’ category for the next three days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/monsoon-to-take-a-few-more-days-to-reach-capital/articleshow/83674580.cms||---

The BMC has said it wants to vaccinate 1 lakh people every day. The BMC had collected the vaccine requirement of various private hospitals as per the Centre’s new vaccine procurement policy. From June 21, the Centre will purchase 75% of vaccine doses manufactured in the country, and while the private sector can purchase the remaining 25% stock, it would be under the Centre’s supervision. As per the new policy, the state would no longer need to purchase vaccines but act as an aggregator and put together the requirements of the private sector. While the state government had been toying with the idea of letting private hospitals directly procure the vaccines as before, the Centre late on Friday sent a directive on collecting information from the private sector. “Late on Friday, the Centre gave us the format needed for private hospitals to fill. We have communicated the format to various districts, but it will take some time to get the data,” said director of health services Dr Archana Patil.

Sniffer dogs, who are a critical part of the bomb detection squad of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) at Kolkata airport, have been relocated from the old kennel on the airport premises to smarter living quarters outside. Spread over 4,000 square feet, the new facility at the CISF camp in Narayanpur has a 10ft×8ft room for each dog, fitted with sliding windows, tiled floors and an air-conditioner. The dogs have plenty of open space to relax or run aroundTwo handlers are deputed to take care of each of the dogs. Their typical routine involves physical training and jumping obstacles outside their roster duty at the airport. If they are not dog tired with the day’s activities, they can even enjoy a swim in the pool and a private session of massage at the new set-up. The upgrade from the cramped and damp shelter near airport’s Gate 7 at Bankra that used to get flooded during the rain is substantial. “The relocation was important as the earlier shelter will be demolished to make way for the runway and taxiway expansion that is underway,” said a Kolkata airport official. The sniffer dog squad has two breeds—cocker spaniel and Labrador retriever. There are eight members at present: Ruby (10), Rambo (10), Caesar (10), Magic (10), Bruno (9), Bujo (6), Jack (2) and Rex (2). Retriever Ruby, a Labrador, is also the only female in the team. With a service tenure of 10 years, three of them are already on extension, while another one is due to retire in two months. To replace them, four dogs are undergoing training at a Ranchi training centre and will join the squad and live here on completion of their training. The squad had another full-time member, Astro, who died of kidney ailments last year. “Dogs have a service tenure of 10 years, during which their salary of Rs 11,000 per month is spent on their upkeep. Some active dogs are allowed an extension of up to a year till their replacements arrive. Post-retirement, the dogs are given to private handlers,” said the official. Dogs have been crucial members of an airports’ security ecosystem for years. The Aviation Security Group annually trains several dogs for a range of jobs, including explosives detection, security drills and prevention of smuggling. Canine teams are trained to identify not only explosives but also blood, drugs, cash, firearms, wildlife, animal parts like ivory and rhino horns and contraband items.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/every-dog-has-its-day-cisf-canine-squad-shifts-to-spacious-ac-quarters-with-pool/articleshow/83674561.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

According to a government order issued in this regard, it has become imperative to start a special home for survivors with 40% or more mentally disability. Currently, for providing a homely atmosphere and care for the survivors of sexual atrocities, there are 16 women and children homes and two SOS model homes functioning as part of the Nirbhaya cell under Women and Child Development. Though a home can accommodate only 25 inmates as per government regulations, the present numbers have shown an increase. Also, as the survivors, irrespective of their age and mental state, are found staying under a single roof, it has become difficult to provide deserving care to each one of them. “When we visited different homes in different parts of the state, we found that many survivors of Pocso cases who are mentally challenged stay along with other rape survivors. And the staff of those homes find it difficult to give special care to them. Thus, we thought it would be better to have a special home for the survivors who are mentally disabled, so that, they will get special care. It is also an inevitable need to have a special home for such rape survivors,’‘ said an official. With the special home, the authorities intend to ensure safety and child-friendly atmosphere for the mentally challenged girl survivors of sexual abuse. They also ensure to provide safe shelter, treatment, food, and special care to the survivors. Also, education, physical and mental health, and personal hygiene of the inmates will be guaranteed. By giving ample mental support, the rape survivors will be enabled to go ahead with legal proceedings. In the special home, besides the existing staff pattern, there will be special teachers and caregivers, in proportion to the number of children. Meanwhile, the services of behaviour therapists and speech and hearing therapists will be sought from NISH. According to the government order, Rs. 59.28 lakh has been sanctioned for the special home, which can house up to 20 inmates. A district-level monitoring committee will be formed with the district collector as its chairman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/spl-home-for-pocso-offence-survivors/articleshow/83674558.cms||---

Additional commissioner of police (north) Dilip Sawant said they will probe the complaint before deciding on registering an FIR. The civic report, submitted by DMC Vishwas Shankarwar, stated that no permissions were taken from the BMC for conducting the Kandivli vaccination camp, nor was any memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with any hospital which was to be the designated private vaccination centre (PVC) for the drive. The BMC in its report also said the accused who have been arrested by the police stole user ids and passwords from a hospital to get the society’s residents registered on the CoWin platform and generate vaccination certificates for them. According to the BMC report, the vaccine given to the residents was not purchased from any authorised source. However, the report did not mention if the vaccines were genuine or fake. A total of 390 residents of the Kandivli society were vaccinated against Covid-19 on May 30. The beneficiaries paid a total of Rs 4.56 lakh, which amounted to Rs 1,260 for each dose. However, the vaccinating team did not have laptops, and the beneficiaries received vaccination certificates in the name of different hospitals. The residents lodged a complaint with the police after some realized the vaccines could be bogus. BMC officials said that though 390 people were given the vaccine, only 120 received vaccination certificates. The names of three different hospitals were on the certificates. “An inquiry conducted by the three hospitals revealed that those concerned had not entered into any agreement with these hospitals, and the hospitals had nothing to do with the vaccination drive. Overall, it has been revealed that this type of vaccination was done in a bogus manner,” officials said. Police probing the case have arrested four persons so far and have recorded statements of two trainee nurses who were given the charge of administering the vaccine to the society’s residents. “We found out that standard operating procedures were not followed while vaccinating. Three rooms should be available: one required for waiting, the second for vaccination and the third for rest. In this case, the clubhouse was used,” the police said. The complaint by Aditya College said an event management company had carried out vaccination of its staff and their family members (in the age-group 18-44) on their campus on June 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-probe-report-vax-drive-in-hsg-society-fake-in-mumbai/articleshow/83679295.cms||V Narayan

The two leaders discussed the water release from Almatti dam and steps to be taken to avoid flooding in Sangli and Kolhapur region. Maharashtra already has a ‘real-time data acquisition’ system in Krishna basin and a similar system will be installed by Karnataka in Narayanpur dam. This will make water management in the entire Krishna basin more effective. “Both the states need to strategically and dynamically monitor Almatti dam water level and the height of the rivers flowing from Maharashtra into Almatti dam so that flood situation can be managed effectively,” Patil said after the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/dynamic-monitoring-of-krishna-river-basin-for-flood-control-patil/articleshow/83671249.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy found fault with ACE Realty firm for filing an appeal against the single judge order when its vendor, Prime Properties company, from whom it took the land for development, had already filed a petition before the single judge seeking vacation of the restraint order. “Go and join your vendor or we will dismiss it here,” the bench said. The counsel for ACE Realty then withdrew the appeal before the CJ bench. The land dispute was over the ownership of Rs 6,000 crore worth prime land (119 acres) located between Kukatpally and Hi-tec City area in survey number 1007. Two sets of people were fighting over the land and the papers they produced claiming ownership show the alleged flow of title to them from two different owners. The Supreme Court earlier ordered status quo and directed all the parties to raise their contentions before the civil court where the title suit is pending. A part of this land — around 75 acres — was taken for development by Aditya Constructions from the farmers who owned and were cultivating the land for a long time. The single judge was convinced about the rights of Aditya Constructions and stayed attempts of others from creating any third party interests over the 75-acre land. Prime Properties filed a petition before the single judge seeking vacation of the restraint order. Its associate firm, ACE Realty, filed an appeal against the single judge order. The bench led by CJ Kohli found fault with these multiple litigation attempts and refused to entertain this plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-not-to-intervene-in-kukatpally-dispute/articleshow/83674590.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The labourers also wanted action against Matti sarpanch Sukhwinder Kaur. The labourers claimed that the matter pertained to fixing the rates of paddy transplantation. The labourers had started working in the fields after fixing Rs 3,500 per acre as rate for paddy transplantation. But when the migrant labourers returned to village, they agreed to transplant paddy for Rs 2,900 per acre. Over it a meeting was arranged at the residence of village sarpanch where, MMM claimed, Gora Singh maltreated labourer Gurpreet Kaur. MMM state president Bhagwant Samao said, “We wanted strict action against Gora Singh and the sarpanch in whose presence Gora Singh maltreated woman labourer. We held a demonstration at Bhikhi police station after which the police registered the case.” Matti sarpanch Sukhwinder Kaur had denied any ill treatment of Gurpreet Kaur. SC panel asks Mansa DC, SSP for report The National Commission for Scheduled Castes, headed by Vijay Sampla, has issued notice to the Mansa DC and SSP, Punjab chief secretary and DGP asking them to submit the ATR in the case within seven days.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Sangli centre doctors trainees, not qualified for Covid care||MUMBAI: The Sangli police on Friday sealed a private Covid care centre and arrested its owner following the death of 77 persons. Sangli-Kupwad civic chief NitinKapadnis said there was lack of basic infrastructure and manpower for treatment of Covid-19 patients. “We will take stern action against the hospital owner,” he said. While the administration found that there was either shortage of ventilators at the hospital or there were no ventilators at all, most of the doctors at the centre too were not qualified to treat Covid-19 patients. “Our information is that most of the doctors were trainees, and even the medical and paramedical staff had no experience in treatment of Covid-19 patients,” a senior official said. The official said that when permission is given for a Covid care centre, it is normally ensured that it meets norms prescribed by the public health department. “We ensure there are an adequate number of ventilators, oxygen beds and basic infrastructure, particularly manpower, doctors and paramedical staff,” he said. In the wake of a series of complaints, including about inflated bills, the civic chief visited the hospital and found several lacunae. A team of doctors, including the civic body’s chief medical officer, and dean of Miraj Government Medical College, then visited the hospital for verification. “We registered an FIR on May 31,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sangli-centre-docs-trainees-not-qualified-for-covid-care/articleshow/83678491.cms||---

The tanker (MH-01-CV-9876) turned turtle after the driver lost control of the vehicle. The driver and the cleaner escaped without injuries, however, the fuel started spilling out on the road and collecting in the roadside pits. When people in the nearby villages came to know of this, they rushed to the spot to collect diesel. Many were seen collecting the diesel and putting the same in their vehicles’ fuel tanks. One local resident, unsatisfied with the amount of diesel he was able to collect in a small can, went home to return with a 200 litre plastic drum. The collection chaos continued for at least four hours till the police reached the spot. There was also a traffic snarl on the highway. Fire brigade teams were also summoned to the spot. When contacted, Vaijapur police inspector Samratsingh Rajput said: “The tanker was carrying 20,000 litre of diesel from Mumbai to Amravati. The driver lost control and the vehicle toppled into a roadside farm, before turning upside down.” In the afternoon, two cranes were roped in and the tanker was lifted and brought to the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/toppled-diesel-tanker-fuels-collection-spree/articleshow/83671257.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Hyderabad||Dispute between brothers ends in triple murder in Bhupalpally||Hyderabad: A long-standing land dispute between two families led to the murder of a man and his two sons while they were working at their agriculture field in Kataram in Jayashankar-Bhupalpally district on Saturday. Kataram police said L Manju Naik,70, and his two sons — Bhaskar Naik,35, and Saraiah Naik,45 — were hacked to death. Police said that Manju Naik’s family and his brother Mahankali Naik’s family had been fighting over a 20-acre agriculture land for the last several years as both lay claim over the parcel of land. On Saturday, Manju and his two sons were sowing cotton seeds. Mahankali and 10 others, reportedly armed with axes and knives, reached the agriculture field and picked up an argument. They overpowered the trio and attacked the victims mercilessly with the weapons. Many other farmers who were nearby rushed to the trio’s rescue, but the victims were already dead by then. During investigation, Kataram police found a case was pending in court over the disputed land for the last several years. After committing the murder, the accused fled from the location. Police said there were a few eye-witnesses when the triple murder took place. Based on the information given by them, police started a man-hunt for Mahankali and others. Later, a few assailants, including Mahankali, reportedly surrendered before police. On knowing about the triple murder, their family members rushed to the agriculture field. They were shocked to see the three bodies in a pool of blood. They were inconsolable. Police registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Police have beefed up security to avoid further clashes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dispute-between-brothers-ends-in-triple-murder-in-bhupalpally/articleshow/83674623.cms||---

---||Nagpur||‘Rich or poor, it’s every patient’s right to be continent and clean’||NAGPUR: Many men and women across the world silently suffer due to an overactive bladder (OAB) without taking expert medical help despite medicines and therapies being highly effective in controlling the disorder. June 21 to 27 is observed as World Incontinence Week, a health campaign run by the International Continence Society to raise awareness about incontinence-related issues. In an exclusive interview with TOI, well-known urologist Dr Sadashiv Bhole talks about the impact of the overactive bladder (OAB) on an individual’s life. The director of Ketki Nursing Home & Urology Hospital as well as Seven Star Hospital also throws light on OAB management. Excerpts... Q. Why is there a need for an awareness week all over the world? A. Many men and women all over the world suffer silently without taking expert medical help. The problem seems much worse in India where the awareness regarding OAB is quite low. The campaign aims to inform these sufferers that good treatment options exist for such a disease. It doesn’t matter whether the patient is rich or poor. It is every patient’s right to remain continent, clean and confident. Q. What is urinary incontinence? A. Basically, incontinence is unknowing and undesirable leakage of urine. Various types of incontinence include continuous incontinence or intermittent. Continuous incontinence is usually seen in patients of neuropathy – those who suffered spinal injuries, congenital neurological defects, patients with urinary fistulas. Urge incontinence, and stress urinary incontinence are other types of urinary incontinence. Q. What is OAB? A. An overactive bladder is a condition when patients have varying degrees of incontinence associated with frequency (multiple bathroom visits during the day), urgency (a strong desire to pass urine), and nocturia – getting up multiple times from sleep at night to pass urine. Urge incontinence is the severest form of OAB where a person wets clothes due to strong urgency. Q. How does OAB affect the quality of life? A. It impacts the quality of life negatively. Patients are always insecure while they are into their day to day work. Their personal and professional relationships are strained. They tend to avoid travelling, gatherings and meetings because they feel embarrassed to go to the washroom multiple times. It also affects a person’s self-confidence. It can cause inter-relationship stress and depression. Q. What are the causes of OAB? A. It can be a result of certain diseases like diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, prostate enlargement, urinary infections and neurological diseases. In most cases, the cause can remain unknown. It is commonly seen in women as compared to men. Q. What is urge incontinence? A. It is a sudden and severe desire to pass urine which may result in leakage and soiling of clothes. It is different from stress urinary incontinence which is an involuntary loss of urine due to coughing, sneezing, laughing etc. Stress urinary incontinence occurs because of weakness of pelvic musculature resulting in descent of the bladder. This is seen in women with multiple pregnancies or advancing age. But it is not uncommon in young active women. Q. How do we treat/manage such patients? A. The first thing is taking a detailed clinical history. This includes a thorough inquiry into patients’ symptoms, and past operative procedures and treatments. It is also important to assess during history the compliance and cooperation of the patient which is very crucial in treatment. A detailed physical examination is necessary for a correct diagnosis and to rule out secondary causes of urinary leak. Q. Are diagnostic methods also needed? A. Some of the common investigations which may be prescribed are the routine blood count, blood sugar, kidney function test and urine test. A sonography may be ordered or certain imaging modalities may be required in some of the patients. Once a clinical diagnosis is made, the patient is counselled about his/her active participation in treatment protocols. Q. What about the treatment? A. Treatment of OAB is multi-pronged. It involves behavioural modification and lifestyle changes, certain oral medicines and in certain severe cases even endoscopic or surgical procedures. The lifestyle modifications which are strongly advised are limiting fluid intake, decreasing the amount of tea, coffee and beverage intake which is actually stimulating the bladder and worsening the condition. Consumption of low salt, losing weight and maintaining an active lifestyle, control of diabetes eases urgency and frequency. Bladder training, double voiding, scheduled toilet trips are used to control the symptoms. Q. What kind of exercises help? A. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) or kegel exercise are a set of exercises which are designed to increase the strength of pelvic musculature. Pelvic musculature strengthening improves continence, works long term, and helps in decreasing the dose of medication required. These exercises need to be taught to the patient by a qualified doctor in order to understand how exactly they have to be performed. Q. What challenges do you face while teaching PFMT? A. We have noticed that most women patients are comfortable with a woman physiotherapist or a doctor teaching them proper ways of pelvic contraction. There are also certain specialized equipment which helps a patient judge his/her performance of pelvic contraction. Once trained through these 30-minute sessions for five to six days, the patient can continue them at home. These are easy to do, rapidly performed and do not require any special equipment at home. PFMT remains a mainstay in mild to moderate cases of incontinence. Q. What are interventions, surgeries and medicines all about? A. Medicines are started as the first line of treatment. The drugs are usually effective and have limited side-effects. They work very well in patients of urge incontinence coupled with lifestyle modifications and PFMT. Now, better drugs are available in India with minimal side-effects. Some of the side-effects may be a dry mouth, dry eyes and constipation. Some severe side-effects are loss of cognitive abilities. All the side-effects get immediately reversed on stoppage of medication. Clinical assessment will help urologists to decide which drug is to be preferred in a certain patient. Q. What’s the next line of treatment when drugs don’t work? A. In certain severe cases not responding to medicines, interventions or surgical therapies are required. One of the interesting things is the use of botox. In severe urge incontinence cases, botox can be endoscopically injected into superficial layers of bladders with very good results. This ‘botoxing of the bladder’ can give relief in severe cases of urgency and incontinence. The effect lasts six to nine months. The only hitch is the cost. This therapy is expensive and only offered in cases which need it the most. Q. Is there any other method? A. Certain operative procedures like insertion of tape in stress urinary incontinence give great results and relieves the patient of troublesome leak within 24 hours of the procedure. These tape procedures give long-term lasting relief, are affordable and are done by minimal invasive techniques which require very short hospital stay and early return to daily routine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rich-or-poor-its-every-patients-right-to-be-continent-and-clean/articleshow/83674652.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kolkata||Two-wheeler theft cases spike during restrictions in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Two dozen motorcycles and scooters have been stolen during the month-long restrictions, up from the average monthly theft of 15-18 two-wheelers. The use of two-wheelers has gone up since last year’s lockdown due to paucity of public transport and fear of infection. During the enhanced restrictions from May 16 to June 15, public transport has gone off the streets. This has led to many commuters using personal transport, including two-wheelers. Several of these thefts took place in the daytime from parking lots in localities like New Market and Posta in central Kolkata. In contrast, thefts reported from Survey Park, Tiljala and Topsia happened in wee hours when people were asleep. Earlier this month, Prabhakar Prasad (47), a resident of Uttarpara in Hooghly, had parked his vehicle in front of a bank on Central Avenue around 11 am. When he returned at 2.30 pm, the bike was gone. Similar thefts took place from Amiya Hazra Lane in New Market and Sambhunath Pandit Street near a branded tea shop during the afternoon. Not just expensive bikes, scooters and scooterette bikes and even batteries from two-wheelers have been stolen. Police have nabbed some of the thieves from Topsia and Girish Park and recovered a few bikes. Cops from Topsia arrested a person with a stolen scooter within hours of the theft. Similarly, the police, analyzing CCTV footage, apprehended a minor for allegedly stealing a scooterette from Tiljala Road. The cops said these thieves had no previous records. “It is easy money now,” said a police source. “We have formed special teams and have strengthened our source networking,” said an officer at the police headquarters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/two-wheeler-theft-cases-spike-during-restrictions/articleshow/83674646.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Bhujbal said, “We were toying with the idea of constructing a parking space to meet requirement. But none of the agencies was ready to foot the cost of Rs 70 crore. We have now decided to renovate the stadium as planned. The renovation at the cost of Rs 25 crore will begin soon.” The government had sanctioned Rs 8-crore for the redevelopment of the stadium in 2018. The district sport office has already given Rs 4.31 crore. DSO Ravindra Naik said that the decision has come as a big relief to the sports fraternity. “The plan for clay track, single-deck administrative office, several sports arena and a multi-purpose hall along with seating arrangement were the part of Rs 8 crore plan. Now, we have revised our plan and will add more infrastructure to the stadium,” said Naik. The stadium will now have synthetic track for the athletes surrounding the football ground and there will be two grounds each of kabaddi, kho-kho and volley-ball. A three-storey structure with halls for badminton, table tennis, squash, wrestling, fencing, table tennis, toilet facilities and changing room will be built. Naik added that there is still space to accommodate a hostel for 300 sportspersons, which can be taken up in the second phase of redevelopment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/not-parking-space-stadium-revamp-on/articleshow/83671300.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Valsad superintendent of police Rajdeepsinh Zala told TOI that a 12-member special team has been formed to investigate the case registered with Dharampur police station of Valsad district in Gujarat. “We believe the notes were printed in Surgana and then circulated in Dharampur and other places in Gujarat. The suspects claim that this is the first time they have printed the notes of value Rs two lakh,” Zala said. The Surgana police said that Ajay, who ran a Setu office in Borchonda village of Surgana, allegedly owed Rs 30,000 to Haridas. While Ajay could not repay, Haridas was after him for the money. Haridas then allegedly devised a plan and told Ajay to print fake notes of Rs 500 with the help of a printer he had. Later, the notes were exchanged from one person to another promising people double the amount in Rs 500 fake notes against payment of original currency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/surgana-4-nabbed-in-fake-note-case/articleshow/83671296.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Mumbai||Invisible heroes of Alibaug make best of changing waste economy||MUMBAI: Every day, Shah Mohammed cycles through the bylanes of Alibag, balancing enormous gunny bags with the ease of an acrobat. He periodically stops to pick up soft drink cans, plastic packaging, pieces of mangled metal—the detritus of daily life—and pedals on, whistling to himself. His final stop is a courtyard centred around a giant weighing scale resembling a Subodh Gupta installation. Here, his brother Aish Mohammed separates and neatly stacks the material before it is trucked off to places where garbage is turned into gold. Shah Mohammed and his brothers—originally from Siddharthnagar in eastern Uttar Pradesh—are the invisible heroes who keep India clean. They are part of that vast and mind-boggling army of waste collectors and recyclers that sweeps through regions where the garbage footprint is rapidly spreading without the supporting civic infrastructure to handle it. “Without these people, the entire countryside would be a huge garbage mess,” says Stalin D of Vanashakti, an environmental NGO that has been lobbying for better waste management. “The contribution of this unorganised sector of waste collectors and recyclers across the country goes completely unrecognised. Their returns do not justify the efforts put in, they need to be part of the solution,” he says. “These people need both space and assistance from the Pollution Control Board or local authorities.” In Alibag, for example, that combustible combination of changing land rules and growing tourist traffic has led to a huge waste management problem. While collection and disposal of waste in India is the responsibility of local village governments, most of it still ends up getting burned, or dumped at random spots or in the ocean. This is a problem being replicated across the country where rural areas are haphazardly turning semi-urban. Despite the critical service they provide, waste workers like Shah Mohammed must deal with the paradox—on one hand, cleanliness is worshipped as a virtue but, on the other, workers on the waste chain are invisibilized and treated as polluting. Writers exhort contemporary India to redefine its relationship with waste. Even after the Swachh Bharat campaign, there remains no granular documentation of the number of people who work in the waste chain across the country—from collectors, sorters, loaders, transporters and the workers in the units that disintegrate plastic into pellets or melt down iron to be reused, says environmentalist Rishi Aggarwal, who runs the Mumbai Sustainability Centre. “The work they do is critical. Firstly, they are cleaning the environment. Secondly, they are creating an income for themselves and are not a burden to the economy. While theirs’ may be a market response, a far greater good emerges from their work.” Some of them are impacted by the changing waste economy. For example, glass has become far less viable as a recyclable product. Instead, broken glass continues to pose a health hazard during sorting. Or, the price of plastic waste fluctuates based on crude oil prices, although those at the lowest rung do not feel the impact, either way. In the hierarchy of waste, iron, plastic and paper generate higher prices. The main industrial hubs for recycling plastic are in Vapi in Gujarat. Meanwhile, if daily waste can be a barometer for changing consumer lifestyles, Shah Mohammed and Aish Mohammed know exactly what people are up to—the empty pizza boxes reveal food tastes; the brown beer bottles tell of drinking habits. “Fifteen years ago, the rubbish was very different. We didn’t get that much plastic, or thermocol, nor as much construction rubble,” says Shah Mohammed, 29, who landed in Alibag to join his brother-in-law in the business. “I heard how once an entire ship carrying scrap landed here from some foreign land.” His anecdotes serve as small pieces in the incredible jigsaw puzzle of India’s multicrore garbage recycling industry. Recently, a wadi owner had disposed of an old rusty cycle.

The site said the petition was put up three years ago. It appears to have gained traction only in the past two days though. On Saturday it became one of the top signed petitions on the site. On Friday, TOI had carried a report about airports in countries such as the US, Australia, France and Turkey that are named after their aviation pioneers. By contrast, in India, not a single airport honours any aviation pioneer. The TOI report quoted Piloo Tata, a member of the Tata family, who suggested the greenfield airport at Navi Mumbai be named after JRD Tata. He, for instance, flew the historic 1932 inaugural flight, carrying airmail from Karachi to Mumbai aboard Tata Airlines, India’s first airline, later renamed Air India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/online-petition-seeks-naming-n-mumbai-airport-after-jrd-tata/articleshow/83671494.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala Financial Corporation launches new schemes to cope with pandemic loss||KOCHI: Kerala Financial Corporation (KFC) has introduced new schemes and benefits for entrepreneurs in the state to cope with the hard times amidst the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. One-year principal moratorium will be granted to the MSME enterprises financed by KFC. The loans of such enterprises will also be restructured as per the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), thereby preventing such accounts being categorized as non-performing assets. The scheme is available to the in standard category till March 31, 2021, and will be allowed on the basis of applications from the promoters received till September 30. No charges or additional interest will be charged for this facility. Last year, KFC had sanctioned 20% additional loan to its customers whose repayment was prompt until March 31, 2020. Now, the second wave of Covid-19 has once again affected the tourism sector and small industries. Entrepreneurs in these sectors will be allowed an additional 20% top up to their loan in addition to the 20% provided last year, taking the lot to 40%. The scheme has been formulated in line with the emergency credit line guarantee scheme (ECLGS) of the central government. Loans by banks under ECLGS will be guaranteed by National Credit Guarantee Trust Company Ltd. However, this facility is not available to KFC. Therefore, KFC has formulated a similar scheme with more benefits to its customers. While banks lend only 20% of the outstanding balance in the customer’s account, KFC lends up to 20% of the disbursed amount, thereby allowing a higher amount to its customers. Furthermore, while the central scheme provides loans only to the tourism sector, KFC has also included small enterprises and the healthcare sector under the scheme. There will be a 24 months moratorium period for principal repayment in the scheme. Since interest is payable during this period as well, customers will have the option of adjusting it against the loan. The finance minister had announced in the state budget that assistance would be provided to entities manufacturing products that help prevent the spread of Covid and so KFC has come up with a new plan for such ventures. The scheme will be available to all sectors involved in Covid prevention in the field of healthcare, like hospitals, laboratories, units involved in oxygen storage and distribution, manufacturing of ventilators, oxymeters, and other life-saving equipment. Loans up to Rs 50 lakh to such enterprises will be covered under the chief minister’s entrepreneurship scheme and will be provided at 7% interest with a tenure of 5 years. For loans above Rs 50 lakh, the interest rate will be 7% up to Rs 50 Lakh and interest for the remaining portion will be fixed as per the rating of the entity. The repayment period available is up to 10 years. Up to 90% of the total cost of the project will be financed under the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kfc-launches-new-schemes-to-cope-with-pandemic-loss/articleshow/83674693.cms||---

Construction work at about 1,000 residential projects in Nashik city has restarted after three months of disruption following the second Covid wave, confirmed Ravi Mahajan, the president of Credai, Nashik. Since March this year — due to the district administration’s strict restrictions in response to the surge in Covid cases — construction activity in the real estate sector had been in limbo. However, things are changing for the better now. “Builders have started getting calls from prospective home buyers since early this month. Some of these potential buyers have also started visiting the project sites to assess the properties. My feedback is that many builders are having at least 10-15 prospective buyers at their project sites. These prospective buyers want to get a feel of the projects that are being implemented,” said Mahajan predicting that the footfall of prospective home buyers will further rise in the near future. He said it may take about a month for conversion of the enquiries into deals. The real estate sector in Nashik had been registering robust growth till the pandemic struck in March-April 2020. Although things had started improving after the first wave, things returned to square one after the second wave of the pandemic in March 2021. Many builders here are of the view that the sector will get a big boost if the state government reduces the stamp duty that would attract more buyers to invest in properties. “We want the state government to reduce the stamp duty from 5% to 2%. Last year, the government had reduced the stamp duty after the first Covid wave and it had yielded good results. A similar step may instil a positive mood in the realty sector again,” said Mahajan. Umesh Wankhede, a builder and also an office-bearer of Credai Nashik said: “Things are positively working out in the realty sector following the ease of restrictions. People recognized the need for housing during the pandemic. They know how safe it is to be at home.” The flow of walk-in customers is more than the telephonic enquiries. People are directly making site visits. One customer visits more than four-five sites. Moreover, the prices are still stable even though the cost of construction has increased by Rs 300 per sft due to rise in cement and steel prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/real-estate-sector-gains-momentum-in-nashik-city/articleshow/83671315.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Vadodara||Vadodara: No major lead on robbers, cops grill jeweller’s driver||VADODARA: The city police has formed different teams including sleuths from the crime branch to crack the heist of gold jewellery worth to Rs 2.35 crore from a jewellery dealer’s car on Friday morning. Gold jewellery weighing around 5 kilograms was stolen when the jeweller and those accompanying him were having refreshments. The police have started gathering CCTV footage to trace the movement of the accused. It has come to light that the accused had left towards Chhani from the Chhani Jakatnaka where the incident took place. Sources said that so far the CCTV footage had not led to any major clue for the police to work on. It has also transpired that the registration number on the motorcycle of the two accused was fake. One was wearing a helmet while the other had covered his face. An offence registered regarding the incident states that the jeweller Vipul Rasiklal Dhakan owns a firm by the name of V Rasiklal in Rajkot. According to Dhakan, the firm procures jewellery manufactured by artisans and then sells the to jewellery stores. His brothers Hitesh and Hiren are also in the same business and operate a firm by the name of H Rasiklal. Dhakan had arrived in Vadodara on Wednesday afternoon along with his salesman Jalpesh Lathigara and driver Praful Dangar. They had brought jewellery weighing approximately 5.75kg with them in two bags. They then went to a shop in Alkapuri and sold ornaments weighing approximately 800 to 850 grams there and checked into a hotel in the same area later. On Friday morning they left the hotel and were to leave for Rajkot. According to Dhakan, the driver suggested that they eat ‘ganthia’ at an eatery at Chhani Jakatnaka. They decided to do so and then leave for Rajkot. They kept the bags in the boot of their car. They ate snacks and went to a shop nearby to eat ‘pan masala’. Here they were told that their boot was open. When they reached the car, they found the bags missing. Others in the area told them that two persons had taken away the bags. It came to light that the accused had broken the glass of the car and opened the boot. While the incident took place at around 11.30am, the complainant did not approach the police. Dhakan discussed the matter with his brothers first. It was late in the afternoon that one of the brothers informed the police that reached the spot. Sources said that Dangar had told the police that he had suggested the eatery near the circle after speaking to an employee of the hotel where they had stayed. The police also spoke to the employee to cross check the claim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/no-major-lead-on-robbers-cops-grill-jewellers-driver/articleshow/83672254.cms||---

It’s not any colony though – it’s Gujarat’s first abode for the adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The philanthropic initiative is the dream project of two city-based fathers Raju Shah and Parag Shah, both businessmen, to ensure that adults across the state like their girls don’t have to depend on anybody when they are not around. Incidentally, both lost their dear daughters – one in 2013 and another in 2020 – but their dream project provides solace to many parents across the state. Parag Shah told TOI that the project started taking shape with a central idea. “We would do everything for our kids. But what would happen when we are not around? This thought worries the parents of every child with intellectual disabilities. Thus, we started the initiative with all the amenities and decided to admit only those above 30 years of age,” says Shah. Shah’s younger daughter Rishi has speech and hearing impairment. “We have given her the best education possible making her self-sufficient. She is associated with the Blind People’s Association (BPA) for many years now. We had even been to the US for her treatment, but we were told that the approach by city-based institutes is best suitable,” he said. “Which parent wouldn’t do everything in his or her power to ensure that a child reaches full potential?” The founders said that the younger children are still managed by many families, but those with intellectual disabilities need care and understanding – something they strive to provide through their limited efforts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/minds-needing-care-feel-at-home/articleshow/83674781.cms||Parth Shastri

This is the finding of the first study on cost of oral cancer by Tata Memorial Centre, Parel. India accounts for a third of the global burden of oral cancer. The study by cancer surgeon Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi and Dr Arjun Singh found medical equipment (especially radiology services such as PET, MRI & CT) accounted for 97.8% of capital cost. “Variable costs, including consumables for surgery in advanced stages, were 1.4 times higher than early stages. With the addition of additional chemo and radiotherapy to surgery, average cost of treatment increased by 44.6%,’’ said the paper. The study found that most oral cancer patients visited sought help at an advanced stage. “Multiplying cost per unit of early and advanced cancer as per the study’s results, India spent Rs 2,386 crore in 2020 on oral cancer treatment, paid for by insurance schemes, government and private sector spending, out-of-pocket payments and charitable donations, or a combination of these,’’ said Dr Chaturvedi. Early detection strategies could lead to 20% reduction in advanced stage disease, saving Rs 250 crore annually. TMH director Dr R A Badwe said, “The rate of new cases has increased by a staggering 68% in the past two decades, making it a real public health crisis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-treatment-of-advanced-oral-cancer-42-costlier/articleshow/83678607.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Open seal of liquor outlets & let them operate, HC directs Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Saturday directed the state to forthwith de-seal outlets serving liquor in various places and allow them to operate. “Open the seal and allow them to operate. Whatever action you have taken, withdraw it,” said a bench of Justices Suresh Gupte and Makarand Karnik. It was hearing a petition by Hotel and Restaurant Association (Western India) that in spite of the high court’s May 6 order, granting relief to members who pay 50% towards renewal of FL-III licence fees, coercive action was taken for not paying 100% fees. The HRAWI claimed that 370 restaurants and bars are affected in Mumbai, Mira-Bhayander, Navi Mumbai as also in the districts of Parbhani, Kolhapur and Satara. After HRAWI had earlier moved HC to reduce the licence fees for 2020-21 due to Covid19 restrictions, the state reduced it by 50 %. But for 2021-22, on January 28, it notified higher rates. HRAWImoved the high court again. On May 6 the HC directed it to make a representation for the state to consider and meanwhile those who pay 50%, no coercive action would be taken. “The only coercive action is to stop liquor sale and seal business premises. They did that,” said senior advocate Virag Tulzapurkar, with advocate Ramesh Soni, for HRAWI. The state’s advocate, Milind More, said that, as per the notification, until they pay 100 % fees they cannot be allowed to operate. He said 14,500 FSL-III holders, who comprise 90%, have paid full licence fees. The judges said when the notification is challenged and relief given to HRAWI, the state cannot insist on 100% payment. In another petition by Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR), the judges granted relief from coercive action to its members who pay 50% licence fees. The state is directed to decide its representation expeditiously and within four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/open-seal-of-liquor-outlets-let-them-operate-hc-directs-maharashtra-state/articleshow/83674762.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Zagde, who is now the chairman of the Pune chapter of Public Concern for Governance Trust, had on June 1 written to the state chief secretary, saying that while the decision to allow the private healthcare sector and corporates to participate in the mass Covid-19 vaccination programme was the right way of covering a very large population in the shortest possible time, there were some critical issues where utmost caution needed to be exercised. Zagde had suggested to the public health department to issue a standard operating procedure or SOP, so that private centres could be made accountable for a scientific vaccination programme and held responsible in case of any adverse event. It was suggested non-health department staff, on the lines of elections, be deployed temporarily for opening of new centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/former-babu-had-alerted-maharashtra-state-on-vax-camp-fraud/articleshow/83679322.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

In an advisory issued on Saturday, Delhi Jal Board statedw, “Production has been curtailed from water treatment plants at Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla and water supply shall be affected in the morning and evening of Sunday (June 20) till the ammonia level in the Yamuna reduces to treatable limit.” DJB supplies 935 MGD (million gallons per day) water to the city and around 45 MGD production—20% production capacity of Wazirabad and Chandrawal WTP—was impacted due to the pollution in the river on Saturday evening, said officials. “The areas that are likely to be affected include Civil Lines, Hindu Rao Hospital and adjoining areas, Kamla Nagar, Shakti Nagar and adjoining areas; Karol Bagh, Pahar Ganj and NDMC areas. The areas likely to be impacted in west Delhi are old and new Rajinder Nagar, East and West Patel Nagar, Baljeet Nagar, Prem Nagar, Punjabi Bagh and adjoining areas. In the southern part of the city, the list of possible affected areas includes Kalkaji, Govindpuri, Tughlaqabad, Sangam Vihar, Moolchand, South Extension, Greater Kailash and adjoining areas. Other city parts that may face low pressure water supply include Prahladpur and adjoining areas; Ramleela Ground, Delhi Gate, Subhash Park, Model Town, Gulabi Bagh, Jahangirpuri and parts of Cantonment areas,” stated the DJB advisory. A senior DJB official said that on Saturday evening, 20% to 25% operations at Chandrawal and Wazirabad plants were hampered. “Ammonia levels are within treatable limits but algae pollution is causing the main problem. We are using activated charcoal to reduce the pollution load. People are advised to make judicious use of water and water tankers shall be available on demand on water emergency helpline numbers and the central control room on 1916 helpline.” A similar advisory of water supply being affected due to algal growth was issued on June 12 too.

---||Lucknow||AK Sharma, PM’s ex-aide, made VP in UP BJP||LUCKNOW: In a significant development that has virtually ended speculations about retired IAS officer AK Sharma getting a key position in the Yogi Adityanath government, the newly elected MLC was appointed the vice-president of UP BJP on Saturday. Besides Sharma, the state BJP announced the names of two new secretaries of the state unit and heads of the party’s frontal organisations, a day after state president Swatantra Dev Singh and general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal met the party national president JP Nadda in Delhi on Friday. When Sharma quit as the Union secretary, MSME, early this year and was sent to the upper house in UP, it was speculated that the bureaucrat, considered close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would be given a key ministry in the state. However, that seems unlikely now after he has been given the responsibility in the party organisation just before the state elections due early next year. A party insider told TOI that as BJP strictly follows the policy of one man, one post, the possibility of Sharma getting any position in the government is now ruled out. “The present party chief Swatantra Dev Singh also quit as the cabinet minister in the Yogi government after being appointed as the state BPP president,” he said. “However, with the state assembly elections 2022 drawing near and BJP in the poll mode already, giving Sharma an organizational post in the state unit is a “significant” development as he would have a bigger say and role in election management and planning,” he added. Sharma, who has earned the image of a bureaucrat who delivered time-bound results, would be a significant addition to the party’s organization,” said another party source. BJP’s state unit now has all the organizational posts filled up. It has 16 vice- presidents, eight general secretaries, including one general secretary (organization), and 16 secretaries. On Saturday, Archana Mishra and Amit Balmiki were made the secretaries in the state unit of the party. The two posts were left vacant after Pranshudutt Dwivedi was made the state president of Yuva Morcha and Ashok Jatav became the Zila Panchayat member. The 1988 batch Gujarat cadre IAS officer, Sharma is from Mau district in UP and hails from a farmers’ family. He earned Modi’s trust after making Vibrant Gujarat a successful campaign to attract investment to the state, when the former was the chief minister. He had served in the PMO for six years since 2014 before he took voluntary retirement from the post of MSME secretary to join UP BJP in January this year. Ever since he joined BJP in January, the speculations were rife that he would get a bigger role in the UP government. But, the cabinet expansion is yet to take place. Sharma has been looking after the Covid management in PM Modi’s constituency Varanasi and few other districts in Purvanchal. In a virtual meeting to assess the Covid management in Varanasi, the PM also praised the Varanasi model. Earlier, speaking for the first time in the Legislative Council in February, he had defended the new farm laws for which the PM has faced a lot of criticism. He said that there has been enough misleading information spread against the laws and that no provisions of the laws support the fears that are being talked about. “Farmer is not worried. Everyone knows who is worried. Modiji through his welfare schemes has reached every house,” he said. With next assembly polls just about eight months away, the BJP is already into poll mode.There have been a series of meetings among key players. Recently CM Yogi Adityanath made a trip to Delhi to meet PM Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda. Besides, the party’s national general secretary BL Santosh and national vice-president and UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh had also visited Lucknow to take feedback from the party leaders, ministers and people’s representatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/retired-ias-officer-sharma-gets-vps-berth-in-up-bjp/articleshow/83678586.cms||Neha Shukla

A 56-year-old male patient, who survived Covid, has been found infected with green fungus and is under treatment at a private hospital in the city. Doctors said the infection is common in immune-compromising persons, who suffer from uncontrolled diabetes, AIDS or those who were in ICU treatment for many days. Indore had reported green fungus infection in a post-Covid patient recently. Doctors said if not treated or delay in providing treatment would make the infection deadly. “The aspergillosis fungus is commonly seen around us and it was reported in pre-Covid period too. It will also cause invasive fungal infection. When the immunity of the patient is low, the patient will contract normal fungal infection. Aspergillosis is one among them. There might be more green fungus cases as a good number of people whose immunity is low have contracted Covid and had been under ICU treatment. This is not a rare fungal infection,” said a district health official. The infection mainly affects the lungs and one gets pneumonia and experience breathlessness and fever.

The state has also decided to open all educational institutions from July 1 and conduct offline classes. These crucial decisions were taken by the state cabinet, chaired by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, on Saturday considering the health department report that there has been a dip in Covid-19 cases and decline in positivity rate. The CM said the decision to lift lockdown was taken for the benefit of people as the poor were losing their livelihood due to the restrictions. Apart from this, the cabinet reportedly took into consideration the state revenues taking a hit in the last two months. The estimated loss of revenue in the past two months was Rs 4,000 crore. In 2021, the state government had first imposed night curfew from 9pm to 5am on April 20. Later, a complete lockdown with a few hours of relaxation was imposed from May 12 and since then the government had been extending it. Six assembly constituencies were not given any relaxation. With educational institutions allowed to open, the cabinet has instructed the education department to prepare instructions and guidelines on compulsory attendance of students, online classes and other related issues and release them at the earliest. The cabinet, however, made it clear that lifting of lockdown should not lead to any negligent behaviour. “People should wear masks, maintain physical distance and use sanitisers and other self-regulatory methods to curtail the spread of the virus and they should follow the guidelines prepared by the government,” a cabinet note said. The cabinet also urged people to extend their full cooperation to contain the spread of Covid 19.

Rashmi suffered burn injuries on her left eye, nose and chest and is undergoing treatment at a private hospital, the cops informed. Although not sure if the accused used acid or not, the police have booked him under IPC section 326(A) (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid, etc) among other sections. “It was an inflammable chemical and we have sent the sample of the same to FSL to ascertain what exactly it was,” said sub-inspector Y G Girnar of Rander police station. On Saturday, Guddu was detained and is being held under quarantine before the mandatory Covid-19 test. Police said that Rashmi, along with her children, moved to Surat from Uttar Pradesh after divorcing Guddu in October. Suspecting Rashmi of having an affair with another man, Guddu used to beat her after getting drunk, which led to the divorce. Around 10 days ago, Guddu came to Surat and Rashmi allowed him to stay with her. However, soon Guddu again started checking her phone out of suspicion. He again beat her after getting drunk following which Rashmi barred him from entering the house. On Friday morning, when she took leave from work and was resting at home, Guddu attacked her and fled with her phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/man-throws-chemical-on-divorced-wifes-face/articleshow/83672752.cms||---

Announcing the decision, deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Saturday said their sacrifice had left everyone proud, and though the money would not lessen the grief of the bereaved families, it would be a big support to them. “Delhi government respects and honours the bravery of every soldier in uniform who risked their life to protect people and the nation. Honouring such brave hearts, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has initiated financial assistance for personnel in Delhi Police, defence, paramilitary forces and others. Although we cannot compensate for the huge loss their family has to bear, we can pay our respect and ensure they live a life of dignity. Ex gratia Rs 1 crore may aid and support their livelihood,” the deputy CM added. Kejriwal also took to Twitter and said he “bows before the brave hearts” and added that the country was proud of them and stood by their families. Delhi government decided to support six such families on Saturday, of them three belonged to the IAF, two to Delhi Police and one was a civil defence personnel. Sanket Kaushik, ACP Delhi Police, died while performing his duty at Rajokri flyover. A truck had hit him while he was checking vehicles in the area and had died on the spot. He is survived by his wife and three daughters. Apart from Kaushik’s pension, the family do not have other active earning source. Sisodia said Rajesh Kumar from Safdarjung and Flight Lt. Sunit Mohanty, who was from Dwarka, were martyred while performing duty in the Air Force. Kumar and Mohanty were in an aircraft that took off from Jorhat, Assam, and its wreckage was found in Arunachal Pradesh.

After an ordeal of over two years, recently she got a kidney from her father Surendra Bahadursingh, 60, at IKDRC or Kidney Hospital in Civil Hospital premises. Dr Vineet Mishra, director of IKDRC, said that in the past two decades, 634 men have donated kidneys to their children. “In 537 instances, the recipients were sons, and in 97 they were daughters. On the other hand, the number of instances (9) is the same when a son or daughter donated kidney to save fathers,” he said. Citing recent instances, the IKDRC officials said that Savji Bavaliya, a resident of Bhavnagar, donated his kidney to his son Vipul, 18, suffering from kidney failure. Likewise, Jaiprakash Singh, 63, a resident of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, donated his kidney to his 29-year-old son Pravin Singh to save his life. “Fathers often accompany patients for dialysis and other procedures. While they don’t speak much, we have seen them waiting entire nights to hear a single update about their children,” said an IKDRC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/634-men-donated-kidneys-to-their-kids/articleshow/83674839.cms||---

The court has also told the authorities to aggressively test, trace, and treat patients to prevent the possible third wave. After a hearing on a suo motu PIL on the surge in Covid-19 cases earlier this week, the bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia told the state authorities to remain on guard. The authorities were told to be prepared to handle the situation in case there is any sudden surge in the number of cases. The court said that the government is expected to take all necessary actions to improve the health infrastructure in the state considering the likelihood of the third wave. The court said it expects the state government to vigorously follow the ‘testing, tracing, and treatment’ model, particularly because the number of Covid-19 cases has reduced at present. Therefore, the court said: “It would be easy for the administration to trace the contacts, quarantine such contacts and test them and treat them accordingly.” The court said this will ensure “…that public at large is saved from the third wave of the pandemic which is expected as per experts’ opinion somewhere in October-November 2021.” The court has sought the details of the state’s action plan by July 2, when further hearing has been posted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-wants-govt-plan-to-deal-with-third-wave/articleshow/83675091.cms||---

The villagers’ forum approached the NGT stating that it had complained to GCZMA about illegal constructions, and where sewage was also being let out into the water body. Villagers said that the coastal body found no grounds to act against the illegal structures since GCZMA said that the structures existed prior to 1991. The forum also informed NGT that the GCZMA inspection had been carried out “in another survey number altogether” and said that the illegal structures were present at a different survey number and pointed it to being recent constructions. Villagers said the Cavelossim village panchayat had “in fact decided to act against the illegal structure as recently as 2015”. The Captain of Ports (CoP) and the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) had also inspected these constructions but GCZMA had not considered these documents while passing its order, the villagers’ forum said. Based on all the information provided by the forum, NGT has asked GCZMA to re-examine these claims. “We consider it to be in the interest of justice to permit the appellant an opportunity to raise all such contentions and produce documents sought to be relied on before the GCZMA itself within one month from today. The GCZMA may consider such documents on their merit and record an appropriate finding after giving due opportunity to the affected parties. In particular the issue of hygiene in terms of solid waste, sewage disposal etc. may be looked into,” NGT said in its reply. GCZMA may take a decision preferably within six months, the NGT also stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/re-examine-complaint-of-sewage-discharge-in-cavelossim-water-body-ngt-to-gczma/articleshow/83676763.cms||---

The newly formed divisional cyber cells at each division will now be asked to play a more pivotal role in order to take pressure off the main Lalbazar cyber cell under the detective department. Cops will intervene as quickly as possible after a complaint is lodged to stop the actual transfer of funds in the cheats’ accounts. The minutes of the game plan were discussed at a meeting attended by the top brass. Several divisions like Port and Jadavpur already have a cyber cell of their own and cops want citizens to know about the existence of such cells in each division. “While the bigger crimes will be dealt with by cyber cell, anti-bank fraud and anti-fraud sections of Lalbazar, our job is to block the flow of money as soon as we are intimated about the crime. At present, local police stations have neither the necessary training nor the time width to pursue such cases. Local divisional cyber cells will serve that purpose,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/more-pivotal-role-for-divisional-cyber-cells/articleshow/83674788.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Their suspension was revoked within a week after former Shiv Sena minister Arjun Khotkar and former MLA Chandrakant Danve contested the suspension with the home department. Following an alleged attack by sand mafias on a local journalist on June 11, Jafrabad police launched a manhunt for the suspects. The police team was told the suspects were known for political connections and the possibility of them being at either of the politicians’ offices cannot be ruled out. The team, without a search warrant, searched the office of Danve and his son Santosh on the night of June 11. The senior politician had complained to Jalna police superintendent. An internal probe was ordered and on getting the report, sub-inspectors Nitin Kakarwal and Yuvraj Potre, head constable Mangalsingh Solunke, constables Sachin Tidke and Shaban Tadvi were suspended on June 15. Jafrabad’s sub-divisional police officer Indalsingh Bahure said the five have been reinstated but refused to elaborate. Jalna superintendent of police has gone on week-long leave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-five-jalna-cops-who-searched-union-mins-office-are-back/articleshow/83676915.cms||Mohammed Akhef

But this girl faced issues right from the birth,” recounts Vala, a retired industrial production unit employee. The girl, who was later named Daya, was underweight, had hole in her heart, and had windpipe and food pipe (oesophagus) entangled. As if it was not enough, one of her eyes was white – indicating at a rare congenital cataract. “But we both are resilient – after a string of operations, several of her conditions got cured, but not her visual and hearing impairment,” recounts Vala. Daya not only completed her studies till Class VIII and regained some vision after a couple of surgeries, but also travelled to different cities of India as a jewellery designer. “I am proud of her achievements that she found her calling and is not dependent on anyone,” says Vala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dads-dreams-propel-visually-impaired-girl/articleshow/83674831.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||MiG-21s to be phased out in three years, says Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria||HYDERABAD: The phasing out of MiG-21 fighter jets, which have been involved in several accidents over the years, will happen over the next two to three years, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said on Saturday. He added that this would pave the way for the induction of the 36 Rafale jets by 2022, and then the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) would be added. Speaking at the combined graduation parade at the Air Force Academy in Dundigal, Bhadauria said that mere ageing of aircraft doesn’t make them accident-prone. “Discontinuation of flying the MiG-21 immediately is not the answer. In another 2-3 years they will be phased out as soon as they get to their life’s end. Our plan to induct 36 Rafales is on target. Once the Rafales are inducted, the focus will be on the induction of the LCA over the next three-and-a-half years,” Bhaduaria said, adding that the LCA is set to replace the MiG in the near future. The Chief of Air Staff added that the country is focusing on indigenous projects, such as the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), a fifth-generation fighter aircraft for the IAF and Navy. “The AMCA will be indigenously produced by DRDO in collaboration with industry. A decision in this regard has been taken in principle. In addition, Airbus 320-based airborne warning aircraft and followup on Embraer aircraft will take place,” Bhaduaria said. Unprecedented and rapidly evolving security challenges, coupled with rising geopolitical uncertainty in India’s neighbourhood and beyond, have led to rapid infusion of niche technology in the IAF’s operations. The IAF is emphasising on networking, digitisation and automation using emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and big data. “Capability enhancement would translate into indigenous weapons and sensors. Sensor fusion is a major area where AI will be extensively used. In fact, the LCA has a fair amount of sensor fusion. In the AMCA, the useof AI will be immense. Apart from this, radar networks will generate huge datasets for which big data is being extensively used,” said Bhadauria. He added that across the board new aircraft, weapon systems, radar, sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles and everything else will be networked to enable operational data to fly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mig-21s-to-be-phased-out-in-3-yrs-bhadauria/articleshow/83676774.cms||---
---||Pune||No evidence that steam kills coronavirus||Pune: Unproven home remedies against Covid-19 resurfaced this week with several messages on social media claiming steam inhalation can prevent Covid-19 by killing the coronavirus. For years, steam inhalation has been used as a home remedy for common colds and upper respiratory tract infections. But there's still no evidence to support claims the remedy can kill SARS-CoV-2. Inhaling steam can certainly ease some symptoms, but cannot kill the virus or prevent Covid infection. Experts have cautioned that steam inhalation is especially hazardous for children. Scalding may lead to hospital admission, surgery or life-long disfigurement, they warned. Both the US CDC and the WHO have stated that steam therapy is not a cure for the coronavirus. One study found some benefits in easing symptoms, but concluded that steam will not stop Covid from progressing. "Since steam cannot reach the bronchial tree, bronchi and lungs, it is unlikely it could be beneficial once the infection has reached the deep internal airway mucosa," the researchers wrote, adding that larger trials would be needed to test the efficacy of steam therapy or inhalation. Even before Covid, steam therapy was a popular choice of treatment against the common cold. A Lancet article last May said studies have shown no "additional symptomatic relief from the use of steam inhalation therapy to treat the common cold". It added that a 2016 survey of general practitioners had found that 80% of them had recommended steam inhalation as a home remedy to their patients. Experts said citizens should not attempt daily steam inhalation without assistance or supervision. During Covid, hospitals worldwide have reported an increase in admissions involving burn injuries among people who were near boiling water prepared for steam inhalation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-evidence-that-steam-kills-coronavirus/articleshow/83674864.cms||---

A majority of these calamity-hit fishermen belong to Diu. The distribution event was held in Diu in presence of Praful Patel, administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli (DNH) and Diu and Daman (DD). Apart from relief to fishermen a total amount of Rs 1.14 crore was also distributed to families who suffered losses from the cyclone in DNH and DD. Total 1,189 families of Diu, 10 from Daman and 474 from DNH were provided financial aid. According to DD and DNH administration, a total 943 residences of cement and brick structure and 260 makeshift homes were ravaged by the cyclone. The fishermen received Rs 5 lakh for boats above 15 ft length and Rs 3 lakh for smaller sized boats. “In case of complete loss of the boat, the fishermen were issued maximum relief amount while smaller amounts were paid in accordance to the damage and repairing cost,” said an officer in Daman administration. The amounts were deposited directly in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. Due to the cyclone in May 2021, parts of DNH and DD were highly affected. In Diu, the damage was especially widespread with the fishing community taking full brunt of the cyclone. As part of providing immediate assistance to the fishing community, the funds were issued by the administration of the union territory. “A plantation drive was also launched as the coastal areas suffered a major loss of green cover due to the cyclone,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/ut-fishermen-get-relief-aid-for-tauktae-damage/articleshow/83672817.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||All age groups affected by the Delta variant||HYDERABAD: The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant of novel coronavirus has been found to affect people of all age groups — babies to 80 plus. Women and men are equally hit, though male patients are slightly higher in number. Though Delta variant affects across age groups, a higher number of cases are found in the 20-30 age group. Children, teenagers and those in the 30-39 age groups are also affected by it. According to Public Health England, which is currently monitoring the Delta variant and its mutations around the world including India, the “age-sex pyramid” of the variant shows the virus affecting people across all age groups. Though genome analysis of the Covid-19 cases from Hyderabad and Telugu states is very limited, it is believed that the Delta variant, first found in Maharashtra and initially dubbed as the double mutant, is fuelling the current second Covid-19 wave across the country. Break-up of Covid positive cases released daily by Telangana government also shows people across all age groups being affected by the pandemic virus during the second wave. Meanwhile, the Delta variant, which recently acquired a mutation (K417N) to emerge as Delta plus or AY.1, has now got another mutation in the spike protein to emerge as AY.2. Though AY.1 variant has been found in at least 10 countries including India with eight cases so far, AY.2 is currently limited to the USA. It has not been found so far in other places. The PHE, in its latest report updated on June 18, said there are at least two separate clades of Delta with K417N. “One clade is large and internationally distributed with PANGO lineage designation AY.1. A second clade found in sequences uploaded to GISAID from the USA, now designated AY.2,” the report said, adding that eight cases of Delta plus were reported from India out of 161 genomes submitted from across the world as on June 16. According to Bani Jolly of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, the phylogeny of Delta has two separate clades. While AY.1 is found in a few countries including the UK, India and Nepal, the other clade (AY.2), is largely from the sequences from California (USA). “The split between the two clades seems to be based on two spike mutations — A222V and T95I. While all sequences in the California cluster share spike A222V, all sequences in the larger international cluster share spike T95I,” Jolly tweeted. Stating that AY.1 has arisen independently a number of times and could be more prevalent than observed in countries with limited genomic surveillance, she tweeted that given that Delta is a variant of concern, it is important to take note of any sub-lineages that may emerge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/all-age-groups-affected-by-the-delta-variant/articleshow/83674822.cms||Syed Akbar

In those five years, about 140km away, “Anil Kumar” was also rushing around Moradabad as an emergency responder, a cop. Five years on, a phone call busted what had been a convenient arrangement for Anil — he had cracked the government teachers’ test, landed a job, did not quit the police job he already had and sent off his brother-in-law to take his place with a transfer and a fake ID. On Thursday, police at the Thakurdwara station in Moradabad received a call, said the complaint by SHO Satyendra Singh on the basis of which an FIR was filed, saying the identity of a cop, Anil Kumar, was being falsely used by someone else. “Anil”, posted with a public response vehicle (PRV) of the Dial 112 unit, was summoned. “He came in his uniform, his name tag on him, with the PRV driver,” the complaint said. He was asked where he was from, who his father was. He had the answers. He was from Muzaffarnagar, became a cop in 2011 after training at Bareilly Police Lines and his father was Sukhpal Singh. But there was one slip-up — he did not know who the Bareilly SSP was at the time he said he had been trained. At this point, “Anil” excused himself to go to the washroom, and took off. Police, meanwhile, found the photograph in the records did not match the man they had met. It was, instead, someone called Sunil Kumar, who turned out to be Anil’s brother-in-law. “Anil and Sunil had known each other since they were in Class XII. In 2016, when Anil cracked the teachers’ test, he asked Sunil to take his place so he could take the time and complete his BEd degree. To make sure nobody found out it was not actually Anil, he took a transfer to Moradabad. Meanwhile, he started working as a primary school teacher in Muzaffarnagar and married Sunil’s sister in 2017,” a police officer said. “Anil had even handed in his service revolver to Sunil.” The two have been charged with abetment of offence, pretending to hold office as a public servant, wearing any garb or carrying any token resembling any garb or token used by a class of public servants while not belonging to the class of public servants, cheating by personation and criminal conspiracy. Circle officer Anoop Singh said, “Both of them were arrested and sent to jail on Saturday. We will continue the investigation to find out if someone else helped them. I am sending a team to Muzaffarnagar to collect information from the Basic Shiksha Adhikari office.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-cop-does-2-jobs-teacher-constable-caught-after-5-yrs/articleshow/83671381.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The crime came to light after a complaint was received at Sagarpur police station in which a woman reported that an unknown person has been repeatedly harassing her by sending her lewd messages and obscene videos on her Facebook Messenger. “She said the person was continuously stalking her despite telling him not to do so. The user also told her that he knows her personally. A case under appropriate sections was registered and investigation taken up,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Amit Goel. “During inquiry, it came to notice that the details used by the accused to create IDs were obtained through wrongful means and subscriber details also didn’t match with the location. During further technical analysis, it was found that the location of the accused was near the complainant’s address. After sincere efforts and cyber trailing, the alleged user of the Facebook ID, Vikas Kumar, was tracked and arrested,” the police officer said. During interrogation, Kumar said that he was addicted to watching porn videos and used to send vulgar and obscene messages and videos to induce girls for sexual favour. He also disclosed that so far he had created 3 Facebook profiles in the name of different women—Shital Thakur, Pooja Kumari, Shivani Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gym-trainer-held-for-stalking-and-harassing-women-online/articleshow/83674867.cms||---
---||Mumbai||No action in Dahanu till expert panel takes decision: NGT||MUMBAI: National Green Tribunal’s principal bench, in its June 15 order, said it “found merit in the contention that there cannot be an omnibus declaration of all ports and allied activities as ‘non-industrial’ so as to nullify the prohibition intended for protection of the ecologically fragile area of Dahanu taluka”. In April 2020, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had directed “harmonization” of 242 industrial sectors into red, orange, green and white categories. Red is a prohibited category. A revised classification placed ports in the non-industrial category. The NGT order, by a bench headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, said “classification’’ without studying the impact of pollution on ecologically fragile zones would “defeat precautionary sustainable development principles”. It may lead “possibly to an interpretation that there is no restriction of activities not classified as ‘industrial’, including ‘ports’, which were earlier disallowed”. The expert panel, NGT directed, must comprise at least five renowned experts, including from marine biology or ecology and Wildlife Institute of India which may visit the site and interact with stakeholders. “Till such a study is carried out and a fresh decision taken, the impugned direction and OM (office memorandum) insofar as they apply to the Dahanu taluka ecologically fragile area may not be given effect,” said the NGT order.  The fishermen’s forum argued the CPCB order would mean ports can be undertaken in ecologically sensitive areas. “Having identified the DTEPA as one such impediment, given its order passed against the setting up of a port in Vadhawan previously, the MoEF has taken calculated steps to impair its effective functioning by withholding grants, moving the Supreme Court to do away with the DTEPA, appointing secretary to government, instead of a retired high court judge, as chairperson, DTEPA,’’ it said. The NGT order said, “The judgment of the Supreme Court in Bittu Sehgal versus UoI (Union of India) mandates observance of precautionary and sustainable development principles for protection of the above ecologically fragile area in the light of NEERI (National Environmental Engineering Research Institute) report mentioned above.” It added the application shows in the past, there was an attempt to set up a big port, which was found to be incompatible with the area. Advocate Meena Kakalia for the forum said, “We hope the committee constituted by NGT reaffirms what has already been observed as far back as 1998 by the Dahanu Taluka Environment Protection Authority—that a port will have a deleterious impact on the environment in Dahanu.” NGT passed its order with no notice to MoEF or CPCB as it said it was “only directing compliance of pre-existing judgment of the SC”. It gave both the liberty to move NGT if aggrieved by the June 15 order though.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ngt-no-action-in-dahanu-till-expert-panel-takes-decision-in-mumbai/articleshow/83678702.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Hyderabad||Children unlikely to be hit in third wave||HYDERABAD: Amidst concerns that children may be hit hard in case of a third wave of Covid-19, health experts allays the fears saying that children will not be the main target of the pandemic virus. This is because children, who had very low seropositivity in the initial phase of the first wave of Covid-19 during June-August 2020, had developed antibodies during the late phase of first wave (January-February 2021) and the second wave (since March-April 2021), said experts. In fact,children were the silent spreaders of the pandemic virus within households before the schools were closed down in the wake of the second wave. Most of the children were asymptomatic and thus developed seropositivity for the pandemic virus. This, in other words, means they are unlikely to be the target of Covid-19 in the assumed third wave. A WHO-sponsored research study in the country covering seropositivity in children has found that almost one in two children below the age of 18 years had exposure to the pandemic virus with or without experiencing any symptoms. The assumption that children will be affected during the third wave, if any, was based on the fact that only a small percentage of children had seropositivity during the first wave. It was less than 10%. But as the schools reopened during July-August 2020, more children tested positive and the percentage of children carrying antibodies increased considerably. The WHO unity seroprevalence study now put the seropositivity in Indian children at 55.7% for those below 18 years of age and 63.5% for those above 18 years. Official data in Telangana shows that about 13% of the Covid-19 patients in the state during the second wave are people below 20 years. This does not include asymptomatic cases. Researchers from All India Institute of Medical Sciences and other research bodies were also part of the study published in MedRxiv.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/children-unlikely-to-be-hit-in-third-wave/articleshow/83674869.cms||Syed Akbar

The accused confessed to the crime and said that the baby was killed as she wanted to teach a lesson to his mother, who had earlier allegedly humiliated the accused. Police said that O Swetha, 21, was arrested for killing the victim, Uma Maheshwar, by drowning him in a water tank. Afteracriminalcasewas registered on Friday, police began to interrogate the victim’s family members who were in the house on Thursday night. Officials found that on Thursday night, Uma Maheshwar’s mother D Latha, her parents, her bother Balaraj and his wife Swetha were present in the house. When each one was questioned separately, the accused Swetha confessed to have committed the murder. During the questioning, Swetha said that Latha came to her parents’ house a few months ago as she was pregnant. However, two months ago, Swetha, who too was pregnant, underwent an abortion due to ill health. Swetha alleged that Latha humiliated her by telling her that she can never conceive as she was suffering from thyroid. “A week ago, Swetha decided to kill the infant in order to take revenge against Latha,” police said. According to the police, when the infant was sleeping between his motherand grandmother on Thursday night, Swetha took him to the terrace and tried to smother him. As the boy was crying loudly, she drowned him in the water tank on the terrace. Later, the accused returned to her bedroom and slept. At around 4.30 am on Friday, when Latha saw that the baby was missing, she alerted other family members and locals, who found the baby in the tank at 7.30 am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/aunt-held-for-infants-murder/articleshow/83674905.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||38 days on, Mohali recovery rate more than +ve cases||Mohali: From the past 38 days, the number of Covid-19 recoveries recorded in the Mohali district are more than the number of positive cases, resulting in the downfall of the active cases. This comes as a relief for both the Mohali administration as well as the health officials. Not only this, but around one-third of the total recoveries have been witnessed in the past 38 days. According to the data procured by the officials of the Mohali administration, a total of 28 cases were reported on Saturday along with 82 recoveries. No death was reported. Maximum 11 cases were reported in Kharar, followed by Dhakoli (7), Mohali (4), Derabassi (2) and one each in Lalru, Boothgarh, Gharuan and Banur. With this, the active cases in the district have come down to 489, which is less than 500 after a period of almost four months. It was on February 24, 2021 that the number of active cases were less than 500 i.e. 471. What comes as more relief for the officials is that a total of 22,312 patients have recovered from the virus in these past 38 days which is 33.5 per cent of the total recoveries. While the cases have seen a downfall recently, the health officials claimed that people should still follow protocols strictly. They claimed that to control the severity of the third wave, taking all the precautions is a must. Currently, as per the officials of the health department, around 1,500-2,000 Covid-19 tests are being conducted daily. Dr Adarshpal Kaur, civil surgeon, Mohali, said, “The current recovery rate of the Mohali district is 97.7 per cent. With the cases coming down and relaxations being given, the public should not think that Covid-19 is gone as the relaxations are given for economic purposes. We should rather increase precautions as now markets will also witness a rush.” She also claimed the second wave of the Covid-19 was a dangerous one and the district faced huge losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/38-days-on-mohali-recovery-rate-more-than-ve-cases/articleshow/83672858.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Ten perish in separate road accidents in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Ten persons died and several others suffered injuries in four separate road accidents at different locations in the state since Friday night. In the first accident, four persons travelling from Yousufguda in Hyderabad to Yadgir in Karnataka died when their vehicle’s tyre burst and crashed into the safety railing of NH-165 on the outskirts of Kodangal in Vikarabad district on Saturday morning, Kodangal police said. The left rear tyre of the SUV burst and the driver lost control over the vehicle and it veered towards the right. Meanwhile, another car, which was coming in the opposite direction hit the SUV, which turned turtle, crashed into the safety railing of the highway and and came to a halt. Four persons —Moulan Bee, 58, along with her two sons Babu Miya, 39, and Mohammed. Abdul, 35, and her grandson Mohammed Rasheed, 27, who were in the rear seat of the SUV —died on the spot, while Mohammed Ameer, who was behind the wheel, and Mohammed Aslam, driver of the other car, suffered injuries. Police claimed the SUV’s tyre burst due to Ameer’s rash and negligent driving. “The family members were going to Yadgir for Moulam Bee’s leg treatment,’’ Kodangal inspector M Appaiah said. Four persons died after a ready-mix lorry ran amok, first hitting a tractor and then two motorcycles at Jadcherla on Friday night.

---||Vijayawada||AP: Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams to destroy its Rs 49 crore old notes?||TIRUPATI: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) may have to destroy demonetised currency worth Rs 49.7 crore as its repeated pleas for a single window opportunity to get the currency notes exchanged have been turned down by the central government. Post the Union government’s announcement on November 8, 2016, demonetising 500 and 1,000 denomination currency notes, people kept dropping the demonetised currency into Lord Venkateswara temple’s Srivari hundi despite TTD’s repeated appeals not to do so. The temple body currently has 6.34 lakh currency notes of Rs 500 denomination and 1.8 lakh notes of Rs 1,000 denomination, totalling Rs 49.7 crore of demonetised currency, stacked in its treasury chests. TTD chairman Y V Subba Reddy said though he approached and requested Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for a one-time window several times, there hasn’t been a positive response on the issue. The Centre expressed its inability to give us a one-time window citing various constraints. We will keep trying, but cannot continue to hold the demonetised currency for too long,” he told TOI. TTD had on July 13, 2020 represented to the Centre to permit it to exchange the demonetised notes. Subba Reddy had called on Nirmala Sitharaman, urging her to accept the TTD’s plea as a special case and permit the RBI to accept the demonetised currency. Sitharaman had also promised to take up the issue with the RBI governor. But in the last 11 months, the plea has remained on paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ttd-to-destroy-its-rs-49-cr-old-notes/articleshow/83676866.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Kochi||Kerala: Local body to cancel notification||PALAKKAD: The meeting of the Shoranur municipal council, led by the Left Democratic Front (LDF), has urged the state government to cancel the gazette notification converting 350 acre of wetland as dry land in the data bank within the municipal area notified under the initiative of the municipal officials during the previous council’s term, also led by LDF. The resolution has been passed at the council meeting with opposition from the United Democratic Front (UDF) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillors. The opposition said that those eligible for getting the wetland converted to dry land should get the sanction. But the LDF councilors said that since the conversion has led to a major controversy, all conversions should be cancelled. Municipal chairman M K Jayaprakash said that the stand of the municipal council is that all eligible applicants holding five to 10 cents of land will be given sanction through the revenue divisional officer (RDO). “If some applications from the controversial list are accepted, that will result in more complaints. So the entire list has to be cancelled, fresh applications should be invited and decided on merit by the RDO,” he said. The council meeting was held online to discuss the controversial conversion of wetland in the data bank of revenue department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/local-body-to-cancel-notification/articleshow/83674910.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Andhra Pradesh leads in job creation under Centre’s BPO scheme||HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh has been able to notch up the highest number of jobs at 12,234 out of the over 47,000 jobs created under the India BPO promotion scheme (IBPS) rolled out by the Centre to encourage ITeS players to set up shop in tier 2 and 3 centres. AP stole a march over other states like Tamil Nadu that saw 9,401 BPO jobs being created followed by Punjab (4,463), Odisha (2,493), Maharashtra (2,353), Jharkhand (2,256) and Bihar (1,551). When it comes to cities too, AP’s Visakhapatnam created the highest number of BPO jobs under the scheme at 7,738, followed by Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore at 4,908, Punjab’s Mohali at 4,453, Jharkhand’s Ranchi (2,162), Bhubaneswar in Odisha (1,901) and Patna in Bihar (1,324). Currently, 252 BPO/ITeS units are operational with 47,043 seats across over 100 towns in 27 states and Union territories under the scheme, Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) director general Dr Omkar Rai said. IT, telecom, e-commerce, fintech and healthcare are the key sectors driving the demand for these BPOs, added Rai. According to STPI, nearly 38% of the over 40,000 direct jobs created by the scheme so far are occupied by women. Also, these units have reported more than 3,000 additional jobs in the last year. Interestingly, over 30 of these locations reportedly saw their first formal BPO/ITeS operation due to this initiative. Pointing out that traditionally, the Indian BPO/ITeS sector was centred around a few metropolitan cities, forcing youth to migrate for jobs, Rai said the scheme has helped thousands of local youth find employment in their native places and also led to the establishment of BPOs in cities hitherto untouched by the BPO & ITeS wave, such as Baitalpur, Mayiladuthurai, Bhimavaram, Majuli, among others. Smaller towns offer benefits like lower operational costs, lower attrition rates, dedicated employees, among others, he added. Pointing out that India accounts for nearly 38% share of the global BPO industry with revenues slated to grow from the existing $38 billion to $54 billion by 2025, Rai said it is important for India to unlock the potential of smaller cities to maintain this leadership.“The IBPS scheme has made some great strides in this direction. More than 60 BPO/ITeS units under the scheme are successfully delivering services to global clients in atleast 16 countries,” he said. SPTI is the nodal agency for implementing IBPS,which was initially announced with a target of creating 48,300 jobs across the country’s smaller cities. The target was ramped up by the ministry of electronics& information technology (MeitY) to 1 lakh jobs across the country earlier this year. Under the scheme, the government provides financial support of up to Rs 1 lakh per seat as Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for setting BPO/ITeS operations in non-metro locations as part of efforts to generate employment for youth in smaller towns and promote balanced regional growth through investment in BPO & ITeS sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/andhra-leads-in-job-creation-under-centres-bpo-scheme/articleshow/83676935.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Pandemic dents real estate project registrations in Gujarat||Covid-19 and the disruptions induced by the pandemic hampered the registration of new real estate projects across the state. Real estate developers in all the four major cities — Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot — registered fewer projects with the Gujarat Real Estate Regulatory Authority (GujRERA) in fiscal 2020-21. The number of real estate projects — residential, commercial, mixed development and plotted schemes — registered with GujRERA declined by 22.8% to 1,346 in 2020-21 from 1,745 projects in 2019-20, shows data available on the website of the state real estate regulator. The total investment proposed through these projects also plummeted by 28% to Rs 32,674 crore in 2020-21 as compared to Rs 45,490 crore in 2019-20. Real estate players attribute the drop in project registrations to the Covid-19 pandemic and the uncertainties induced by it. "The nationwide lockdown last year eroded the first quarter (April-June) of fiscal 2021 as the real estate market had come to a standstill. The first half of the second quarter ending September was also sluggish in terms of demand. Again, there was a spike in cases soon after Diwali. This resulted in wastage of five months for the real estate market, which adversely affected project registrations by developers," said Dipak Patel, past president, CREDAI Ahmedabad-GIHED, a body of Ahmedabad-based real estate developers. Echoing similar views, builders in Vadodara, too, maintained that the pandemic, of course, had a big role to play in the declining project registrations. "The builders were ready with their projects and wanted to get them registered. But the Covid suddenly brought uncertainty to the real estate market over the last one year. Builders were unsure if people would be keen to invest in new property amid the pandemic that was wreaking havoc not just in the economy but also people’s lives," said Vipul Thakkar, former president, CREDAI- Gujarat. "Builders were waiting for the situation to normalize as once the project is registered under RERA then they have to meet deadlines regularly. Hence, the registration numbers dipped over the last one year. But the numbers will surely improve this year," added Thakkar, a Vadodara-based builder. Those in the realty market also blamed the delay in government procedures. "There were projects in the pipeline, but developers could not go for registering their projects as the process to get different approvals such as non-agriculture (NA) permission and building plan passing was hampered due to the pandemic as the administration was busy handling Covid situation. Developers were also facing staff crunch as well," said Paresh Gajera, president, Rajkot Builders Association (RBA). "The government offices were not working at full capacity due to the pandemic. There were delays in getting NA permissions and meeting other procedures and that also affected RERA registrations. The prime reason, though, is that builders were in a dilemma due to Covid and the uncertain period of the second or impending third wave," said Pritesh Shah, president, CREDAI, Vadodara. The realtors said the economy was down and people were losing jobs. There was this feeling that many would hold on to their savings instead of investing in real estate. But the RERA registrations will soon improve as the demand has picked up in the market. According to Patel, the market had seen traction for some time before Diwali, and picked up well from January to the first week of March. In these periods, much unsold inventory was cleared and gave space for new projects. "Given the impact of the pandemic on economic activities, I believe the 23% decline in registrations of real estate projects with RERA is not much," said Patel. With developers seeing latent demand and inventory getting cleared, the project registrations seem to have got traction. About 358 realty projects have been registered with RERA till June 19 from April 2021. The total investment in these projects is estimated at Rs 8,448 crore. Speaking of the demand for residential housing, Balbirsingh Khalsa, national director industrial and logistics and branch director-Ahmedabad, Knight Frank India, a leading real estate consultant in India, said, "The demand, however, will be short-term in nature. The long-term demand depends on economic improvement."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pandemic-dents-real-estate-project-registrations-in-state/articleshow/83675088.cms||Kalpesh Damor

The four-member death audit committee and two investigating officers who were looking into the deaths at Shri Paras Hospital on April 26 and 27 cleared the hospital in their report. “The availability of oxygen was found adequate,” it said. “The investigating officers and death audit committee found oxygen supply was not cut off.” The Agra chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) had earlier refuted the district administration’s statement that there was no shortage of oxygen in Agra in April. “The claim of the district administration that there was no shortage of oxygen is completely baseless,” the body’s president elect OP Yadav had said, adding that a five-member panel of its own would investigate the matter. “The entire incident has certainly brought a bad name to the medical fraternity." The probe report went on to quote hospital owner Dr Arinjay Jain’s statement to the committee, saying that the conclusion from the video that 22 patients had died “is entirely untrue … No mock drill was conducted, no one’s oxygen was cut off, there’s no evidence.” Jain had earlier told TOI, “We had conducted a mock drill to identify critical patients.” The probe panel also said 16 patients died during the period under investigation, of which 14 had comorbidities and two were critical. Complaints by families of at least 10 of these 16 patients do not form part of the probe report. Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh had on June 8 said only “seven patients” who had Covid-19 died on April 26 and 27. The DM had, however, ordered an FIR against Jain and that the hospital be sealed. Jain was booked under Section 188 of the IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant, causing obstruction and injury) for “spreading false information” and under the Epidemic Diseases Act. “The charges have not been dropped. The focus of our investigation is the video, where it came from, who all are in it and why it was not made public immediately,” Agra SP Botre Rohan Pramod said. The hospital, too, remains sealed and its licence suspended. “On the basis of how the hospital management responds (to these), action will be taken,” Agra chief medical officer Dr RC Pandey said. Families of those who died at the hospital that day questioned the findings. “I will take this to the high court. It is shocking that the hospital has been given a clean chit,” said Ashok Chawla, whose father and sister-in-law died there on April 26 and 27. Raju Yadav, whose brother-in-law died on April 26, added, “I had filed an FIR against the owner on May 17, but no action was taken … I will stage a sit-in outside the collectorate seeking justice for my widowed sister.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-hosp-deaths-probe-panel-says-no-mock-drill-16-died-but-not-due-to-o2-disruption/articleshow/83671431.cms||Deepak Lavania

Despite mortalities and large number of morbidities, the recovery rate for Covid-19 has been over 80% throughout the pandemic so far. On May 12, lockdown was imposed in Telangana and between the first and second week of lockdown, the recovery rate jumped by 2%, further improving by 1% in the third week and has now reached 96% by the end of the fifth week. “While there are states like Rajasthan and MP which have recovered cases at 99%, Telangana is improving. Nearly 96% cases of second wave recovered in Telangana,” said Dr Kiran Madala, incharge head of department of critical care at Nizamabad Medical College. “Lockdown and the household survey probably helped in containing second wave as the same pattern was observed at the end of the first wave around mid-November across the country and in Telangana,” said Dr Kiran Madala, incharge head of department of critical care at Nizamabad Medical College,” added Madala While the country has witnessed the second wave precisely four months after the end of the first wave and there are predictions of a possible third wave in future, following Covid appropriate behaviour is essential at all time, reiterate officials. “It is possible that the variants of interest (Delta variant) might have been responsible for the second and hence it is essential to continue taking Covid precautions. Covid-19 appropriate behavior and speedy vaccination process is important to counter third wave,” said an official from the state health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-recovery-rate-jumped-to-96-during-lockdown/articleshow/83674945.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Mumbai||Face-to-face interaction ended school’s fee row: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Saturday was informed that the dispute at a Malad (E) school, which denied 203 students access to online classes due to non-payment of fees, had been resolved. “Most of the time face-to-face interaction resolves a lot of issues,” said a bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Chandrakant Bhadang. A petition was filed by 203 students, mostly aged 6-13, of ICSE medium Seth Juggilal Poddar Academy. For 2020-21, their parents paid 50% fees and payment delay was “due to loss of job or loss of business, or exhausting of all savings during lockdown”. On June 15, HC nudged the parents to meet the management and resolve the issue. “We granted them time to pay in instaments from 3-6 months and more, and waivers in some parts. All these cases, according to us, are resolved,” the school advocate Arvind Kothari said, adding that parents will have to give an undertaking. He said students will be admitted to online classes from Monday and the school will take steps to cover lost syllabus by holding extra classes “so that students will not be put to loss in any manner”. While the students’ advocate, Disha Karambar, said they are grateful to Kothari who took the initiative, she expressed their apprehension if the lockdown continues, saying it was not clear what steps should be taken. “In case lockdown continues, you hold another meeting. You establish a proper communication channel. Once it is done, many issues will be resolved,” said Justice Jamdar. The judges, in their order, noted that all issues have been resolved and the interaction between representatives of parents and management was in a “cordial and cooperative atmosphere”. “That being the position, we trust parents and management will not have any difficulty in resolving issues through dialogue, as trust and confidence are now restored.” Disposing of the plea, they appreciated Kothari’s efforts for an amicable settlement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-face-to-face-interaction-ended-schools-fee-row-in-mumbai/articleshow/83678772.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad mosques offering more than just prayers||HYDERABAD: Cutting across religious lines, mosques in Hyderabad are offering a range of services from healthcare to libraries for everyone. Mosques in Hyderabad are gradually evolving from being mere places of religious activity to centres of social, economic and community service and development. Their role in society is now manifold. At least 25 mosques have come forward to open health clinics once the lockdown norms are relaxed. From offering coaching and opening libraries for students appearing for competitive examinations to running health clinics, gymnasium and yoga for women and serving Covid-19 patients with isolation centres to providing mid-day meals to students, many city mosques are coming to the aid of those in need Jama Masjid, Salarjung Colony:The Jama Masjid at Salarjung Colony doubles up as a sort of e-Seva centre. The mosque regularly takes up drives for online applications for enrolment of voters, scholarships and pensions. It also conducts online classes for students. It has set up a coaching centre to train students in multiple subjects. Mosque committee head Muhammad Abdul Majeed said soon the mosque will run a superspeciality clinic. Eight doctors, specialists in different medical fields, have agreed to provide free consultation to patients, he said. In association with MS Education Academy and Siasat, the mosque has introduced the “Education @ Mosque” concept by holding online classes during lockdown. Masjid Ishaq:Masjid Ishaq at Nawab Saheb Kunta runs a mid-day meal centre for schoolchildren regardless of their caste or creed. The mosque took up the initiative after the state government closed schools as part of containment measures. Since many poor students lost access to nutritious mid-day meals provided at government schools, the mosque came forward to continue with the scheme till the schools are reopened. “It is the first midday meal programme launched from a mosque in Hyderabad. Mujtaba Hasan Askari, managing trustee of Helping Hand Foundation, which is funding the mid-day meal scheme, said the mosque also runs an exclusive women and children health centre. The menu is based on the diet recommended by UNICEF and includes rice with dal, vegetables and boiled eggs. Masjid Muhammadi:The Masjid Muhammadi at Attapur shot into prominence after it opened an isolation centre for Covid-19 patients at a time when patients and attendants were running from pillar to post for quality treatment. The centre is equipped with all medical facilities including oxygen. People across religions can avail this facility. As all services are free, patients collectively saved about Rs 90 lakh, which otherwise they would have spent on hospital bills. The 40-bed centre was jointly set up by Rotary Club of Hyderabad Deccan, SEED USA and Helping Hand Foundation. Medicines and food were also provided free. An expert dietician supervised the food supply, while senior physicians monitored patients’ health. An ambulance was also kept ready to shift patients to tertiary care centres if needed. Sainath (29), resident of Tarnaka, who was admitted to an isolation centre, said he was cured of Covid-19 without spending a single paise from his pocket. Jama Masjid, Chowk:This 200-year-old mosque, popularly known as Chowk-ki-Masjid, has set up a library for the benefit of research scholars, particularly those involved in studying Hyderabad of yore and history of Deccan. It has a collection of rare 4,500 books. According to Munawar Hussain, president of the mosque committee, the idea behind opening the library is to help students and research scholars. “Currently the library is closed due to lockdown norms. Once reopened, we will assess the demand and procure books on various subjects. We also plan to run a health clinic and a coaching centre for students appearing for competitive examinations,” Hussain said. Educationist and Salar Jung Museum Board member Zakir Hussain said a group of Muslim elders, educationists and philanthropists held a meeting recently and decided to open health care centres, coaching centres and study centres at various mosques across the city. Twenty-five mosques have agreed so far, he added. Masjid Muhammed-E-Mustafa:Located at Wadial-Mahmood in Rajendranagar, Muhammad-e-Mustafa mosque has to its credit the first community level ophthalmology centre for primary care. The eyecare centre has facilities to screen for refractive errors, cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and other visual impairments. Mucormycosis screening is also going on. The outpatient facility is available two times a week (Monday and Friday) under senior ophthalmologists and ocular surgeons. Poor patients with visual impairments are provided free spectacles. It will also assist people with visual impairment for surgeries free of cost. “Identifying and treating patients for glaucoma is also at the mosque centre,” said Dr Arshiya Akbar, senior ophthalmologist and oculoplastic surgeon associated with the mosque eyecare program. Patients with long standing diabetes and hypertension get priority in screening for retinopathy and glaucoma. So far, the mosque centre has provided free spectacles to over 200 patients and cataract surgeries to about 50 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/citys-mosques-offering-more-than-just-prayers/articleshow/83674976.cms||Syed Akbar

We lost a true friend, an innovator, a problem solver and an administrative reformer,” exclaimed a senior IAS official who attended the last rites on Saturday of the 1986 batch Gujarat cadre IAS officer and DPIIT secretary Dr Guruprasad Mohapatra. He was heading the empowered group and was managing the entire oxygen supply logistics across the country during the Covid second wave till he was admitted on April 19. He passed away due to Covid related complications at AIIMS and was cremated at the Lodhi Road crematorium in New Delhi. He was 59 years. Prior to taking over as DPIIT secretary, Mohapatra served as chairman of Airports Authority of India. Guruprasad MohapatraMohapatra began his career as an assistant collector in Surendranagar in 1986 and was then posted as DDO Junagadh. “During these years, Guru honed his skill at developing administrative tools to solve governance issues,” says member Lokpal IP Gautam, who was Mohapatra’s batchmate. After his brief stint at GIDC, Mohapatra was one of the key members in restructuring of Gujarat Electricity Board into different entities between 2002 and 2004. As Surat civic chief, he streamlined solid waste management and urban governance. As transport commissioner, Mohapatra drew the roadmap for phasewise CNG-fication of public transport in major Gujarat cities. But it was during his 3.5 year stint as Ahmedabad civic chief that he put many of his ideas into action — from setting the ground for the Unesco World Heritage City nomination, completing major portion of BRT, Kankaria lakefront and Sabarmati riverfront projects, to putting the metro rail project on fast track to setting the ground work for SVP Hospital. “AMC still follows the road quality audits, concept of model roads and the roadmap for zero-waste city,” says a senior AMC official. CM Vijay Rupani also took to Twitter to express condolences and said the state has lost an able officer. “His contribution to all sectors in Gujarat, be it urban development, industries or commercial taxes has been significant. He was a hard-working, innovative and team person. His work will continue to inspire us,” said Anil Mukim, chief secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guruprasad-mohapatra-passes-away/articleshow/83675021.cms||---

In details that emerged on Saturday, a Gurugram-based lab was found to have sent five different messages to Ranjith Kumar, a resident of Chennai, on April 16 when the Kumbh was in progress. In all the five messages, the names mentioned were different and all were intimations of negative Covid status. "I was shocked to see five messages on my phone; all had some Covid report links," Ranjith Kumar told over phone. When he clicked on the links, he found names of five different people and their test results - all negative. "I tried to trace the source of the messages and found that the samples were collected from some place in Haridwar," said Kumar. Since he works in the IT sector, he could immediately sense there was something amiss, that it could be a case of fraud. But when all his attempts to trace the reports failed, he ignored the messages. A Haridwar-based professor, who didn't wish to be named, had a similar experience. He received an RT-PCR report from a lab in Roorkee during the Kumbh even though he had never got himself tested. A Delhi-based journalist who reached Haridwar to cover the Kumbh with a valid RT-PCR report also received a message on her phone, a few days after she had got her report, saying that she had tested negative for Covid. She claimed that her credentials were noted at the Narsan border by officials who were deployed to do Covid tests and check reports. She filed a complaint about this with the Haridwar CMO who assured her that the matter will be looked into but according to her, nothing came of it. Haridwar district magistrate C Ravishankar said these messages could be due to a "technical error".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/more-labs-involved-in-fake-covid-test-reports/articleshow/83679856.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Married man rapes minor cousin, impregnates her||RAJKOT: A 25-year-old man was booked for raping his minor cousin around six months ago and impregnating her. Based on a complaint filed by the survivor’s mother, Aji Dam police booked the acused Sanjay (name changed), a resident of Kothariya Road, on Friday night. According to police, the family of the girl came to know about the incident only after a medical check-up revealed that she was five months pregnant. The 17-year-old Class XII student was allegedly blackmailed by her cousin to concede to his sexual demands around six months ago after he threatened to expose her affair with one of his friends. The survivor, only child of a middle class family, had met him at accused Sanjay’s wedding last year and got romantically involved over a period of time, which Sanjay came to know. He, however, used the information to his own devilish designs and threatened his cousin of revealing the duo’s chat conversations to her parents if she did not meet his demands. Fearing that Sanjay, who works in a finance company, would tell her parents about Sameer, the survivor remained silent. Taking advantage of this, Sanjay took her to different places near her home and raped her repeatedly, asking her not to tell anyone about it. However, her mother started noticing recently that her daughter’s stomach had started to bloat abnormally and confronted her about it. The girl broke down and revealed her ordeal to her mother who then took her for medical examination where to their horror found out that she was pregnant. “We have registered an offence and will arrest the accused soon. Since he saw the messages on his friend’s phone and took photos of it to threaten the girl,” said inspector V J Chavda.

In fact, according to the study only a small percentage of people contracted Covid-19, post their vaccine shots. The study was conducted on a group comprising 12,000 healthcare and frontline workers. Among them, it found, that about 13% were infected with the virus -- after taking the first dose -- out of which 2.63% of them needed hospital admission. The percentage of those who tested Covid-19 positive after their second dose stood at 2.8%, as per the survey. It stated that only 0.4% of these fully- vaccinated individuals had to be got admitted in hospital for treatment. The study by Medicover Hospital also found that all these infections were in the “mild category and none of them turned to moderate or severe category”. There were neither any deaths nor cases of clotting issues reported among any of them. “Our motto behind this is to put an evidence-based study in front of the people to avoid the hesitancy towards Covid-19 vaccination,” said Dr Sharath Reddy, executive director, Medicover group of hospitals. He added: “Population considered for this study, both healthcare and frontline staff, is at constant exposure to multiple strains of virus ranging in their virulence and from different geographical locations.

The study was conducted during March-April in four major sectors namely brick kilns, stone crushing and sand stone mining, agriculture and gems workshops across six districts including Jaipur, Dausa, Dholpur, Hanumangarh, Baran and Bikaner. The survey conducted by NGO Save the Children under the title ‘Status of Child Labours and Legal Entitlements of Workers in Major Sectors in Rajasthan’ reached out to 543 parents and 317 child labourers. The study found that the average monthly household income is Rs 11,628 for worker families out of which Rs 2,707 came from children. Family earnings were highest for brick kiln workers who get Rs 17,915 and least for agriculture workers who get Rs 4,528.The average earning per day for a child is Rs 208. One-third of the children interviewed get employment for a period of 3 to 9 months in a year. The study further found that nearly 53% children worked for 8 to 10 hours a day. Working hours are highest in brick kilns where 20% of children work for more than 10 hours per day. During the interactions, majority of the children acknowledged better living standards, ability to provide financial support to family and no dependence on parents as key benefits of working. On the flipside, lower wages (33%) followed by excessive physical work without any extra pay (31%), unsafe working conditions (27%) and workplace humiliation by employers (21%) were reported as key challenges faced at workplace by children. “Income of workers decreased drastically during Covid across the sectors making life of these labourers miserable due to lack of adequate money to look after their families. However, some employers supported with advances of Rs 5,000-10,000 during the lockdown, especially in brick kiln sector, which helped them tide over the crisis. Parents hold the view that they are ready to take their children out of work if they could generate an additional income of Rs 6,100 per month,” said the study. Apart from this, nearly 10% children reported about physical exploitation but no one reported about sexual exploitation at workplace during the study. However, as many as 23% children said that they were aware of sexual exploitation of children at some other work sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1/4-of-monthly-household-income-earned-by-child-labourers-study/articleshow/83675024.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

Earlier, there were reports of fake Remdesivir being administered at many places. Such gangs are playing with people's lives.

Dr MC Mishra, the former director of AIIMS, is also of the opinion that the vaccine should be administered only from the authorized places.

---||Pune||‘Still waiting for vax volume PM promised’||Pune: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday said the state had yet to receive the volume of doses the Prime Minister had promised for the vaccination of the 18-44 group in Maharashtra. “If the doses arrive, we will be able to scale up the vaccination drive. We have already issued orders for sequential vaccination for this age group (18-44), in which we'll start vaccination of the 30-44 category,” Pawar said. He added that if the vaccine supply from the Centre is streamlined, the state may scale up the drive in Pune district to vaccinate at least 1.5 lakh beneficiaries daily. Currently, shortages have limited daily coverage to 30,000 daily beneficiaries. For months, officials here have been saying that the one lakh-vaccination mark — critical to quick and widespread coverage — can only be achieved if the Centre increases vaccine supply to the region. On Friday, state officials said government-run vaccination centres will start inoculating people in the 30-44 age category from Saturday. Vaccination for the 18-44 group was limited to private hospitals after the government, on May 12, suspended drives for the category to focus on people over 45. Earlier this month, the Prime Minister had announced that the Centre would go back to vaccine procurement and supplythe Covid-19 jabs to all states — free of cost — for coverage of all adults (18-plus) from June 21. The PM said states and UTs will not have to spend on vaccines. Of the total vaccine availability, 75% will be procured by the Centre. The rest (25%) will continue to be available for private hospitals. Pawar said if there are enough vaccines, vaccination drives can be expanded across the state to cover more people every day. He cited the example of Bahirwadi in Purandar taluka (Pune district) where there has been 100% coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/still-waiting-for-vax-volume-pm-promised/articleshow/83675069.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Pune: Big hospitals yet to place combined order for doses||PUNE: Big private hospitals in the region haven’t yet sent an aggregated demand of how much vaccines they might need to civic or district authorities, the Association of Hospitals has said. Smaller hospitals in the district have said they’ll need over 33 lakh doses of Covaxin and Covishield for their vaccine drives. But there has been no such demand placed by the larger units so far, the association said. Dr Manjusha Kulkarni, secretary of the Association of Hospitals, Pune, said, “Even though guidelines state that private hospitals have to route vaccine procurement through the state government, we are waiting to see how the process will work after June 21. Big hospitals are yet to send an aggregated demand of doses to the municipal body as we need more clarity on whether private hospitals can process procurement directly (from manufacturers) instead of waiting for the state government to route the orders.” Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said as per the new rules, private hospitals should send an aggregated demand of doses to municipal or district authorities first, who will then forward it to the state government. “The state government will forward it to the Centre. Private hospitals will have to make the payment (for the doses) through the National Health Authority’s electronic platform,” he said. He added that private hospitals cannot place orders directly with manufacturers after June 21, and will have to route it through the state. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India (IMA, Pune), said the 400-plus hospitals that sent over their vaccine demand to state authorities were indeed the small and medium-sized units in the district. “Many of them are approved vaccine hubs. They are crucial,” he said. But bigger private units said they're still unclear on how the new procurement process is set to work after June 21. Some reported shrinking reserves. Bomi Bhote, chief executive officer (CEO) of Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “We have stopped procurement after June 21 as we need to see how things go with the new guidelines. At Rs 150 cap on service charge, it may be difficult to carry out the drive.” Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, said clear procurement guidelines are needed. “We paid SII for 50,000 doses in early June. We are yet to get a chunk of the order. We plan to continue on-site (in-hospital) drives, but have doses left for just a few days more,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/big-hospitals-yet-to-place-combined-order-for-doses/articleshow/83675063.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Ahmedabad||Gold price dips to Rs 48,500 per 10g||Ahmedabad: Gold price plunged further to settle at Rs 48,500 per 10 gram in the Ahmedabad market on Saturday. Yellow metal price consistently declined for the fourth consecutive day after it touched Rs 50,300 per 10 gram on June 15, tracing gold price in the international market. “Sharp fall in gold price can be attributed to the announcement by the US Fed to hike interest rates twice in 2023, as a consequence of which, the US dollar has gained against major global currencies,” said an Ahmedabad-based gold analyst. Even though the plunge in gold price is a good sign to boost retail demand for gold and gold jewellery, the effect has not been visible in the market as yet, according to jewellers and bullion traders. “Despite the price correction, demand continues to remain muted. People will begin investing or making jewellery purchases only when the prices stabilize at this level. Currently, even investors are in wait-and-watch mode. In the longer run, however, yellow metal price is expected to go up in the days to come,” said a city-based bullion trader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-price-dips-to-rs-48500-per-10g/articleshow/83675070.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Agamkuan police station SHO Abhijeet Kumar said the incident came to light when locals spotted the broken window of the temple. “The idols were of Lord Ram, Sita, Laxman and Hanuman. They had silver ornaments on them, too. Locals said the idols were around three centuries old and made of ashtadhatu,” he said. The temple is also believed to be centuries-old, he said. SHO Kumar said the thieves had cut several thick iron rods fixed in one of the temple windows to make space for entering inside. “The temple is looked after and maintained by the locals. No priest has been there for the last two years,” he said. The SHO said no CCTV cameras are there. “A dog squad was roped in,” he said. The SHO said the suspicion is high that the theft is not a routine one but is related to organised idol smuggling gangs. “Such ashtadhatu idols are precious and mostly centuries-old. They fetch crores in the international market. Such idols are mostly smuggled outside the country through northeast or Nepal,” a senior police officer said. A large number of centuries-old precious ashtadhatu idols of gods and goddess have been stolen from temples and mutts across the state in the last several years. Police have been able to find hardly a few of them so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/centuries-old-four-idols-stolen-from-city-temple/articleshow/83673204.cms||Debashish Karmakar

By Saturday early morning cops rounded up eight people from Mafatiyapara area after they conducted a combing operation following the clash that started over a petty bickering between Vicky Mamaniya and Shahrukh Fakir and soon escalated into a fist fight. When Mamaniya’s friend Uday Koli intervened, Fakir mercilessly beat him too before fleeing away. Mamaniya and Koli were taken to Civil Hospital for treatment where Fakir reached with a mob. Fakir stabbed Mamaniya and also his two other friends named Raju Chudasama and Vijay Almadi. When cops arrived at the hospital, the mob pelted stones at them damaging their vehicles. A police constable named Hitesh too was stabbed in the melee. When hospital staff closed the doors to prevent the rioters from entering, they pelted stones at the hospital and banged on the door. The situation was brought under control after an additional police force was called in. However, the rioters by then had escaped from the hospital. “We conducted combing operations throughout the night and rounded up eight of the attackers. We have booked them and a mob of 20 to 25 people for the attack,” said inspector D G Parmar of Veraval police station. An offence of attempt to murder, rioting, deterring public servant from performing duty, damaging public property and criminal conspiracy was registered at the Veraval police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/mob-attacks-group-of-youth-police-over-minor-clash/articleshow/83673184.cms||---

Long queues were seen outside the centres as people eagerly awaited their turns. The longest queue was seen inside Sukhadia university campus where people had collected in large number. Two days ago in Ajmer some 49,805 persons were vaccinated on a single day. The health and medical department at Udaipur had announced 50,000 slots availability a day ago and people had rushed in for registration. Even after 6 pm, many slots were available on the website despite thousands of people having secured their allotments. In Udaipur city, of the seven centres Mohanlal Sukhadia university held the vaccination of highest 5,000 people. “The V-C assisted us with extra workers including clerical staff scout volunteers and our medical team thus vaccinated the highest number of people here. Most of them got their first shots,” Aditya said. The officer said while only some people received Covaxin second dose, the majority vaccinated in Udaipur were administered Covishield. In Udaipur the medical department had targeted 7 lakh people above 45 years of age, while 14 lakh people from 18-44 years were to be vaccinated. “If we get an uninterrupted supply of 30,000 vials on a daily basis, the entire district can be covered within 50 days,” said Aditya. One lakh people have been vaccinated in past three days which itself is a record. Beginning from Wednesday 18,000, 20,000 and 64,000 people have been administered the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/64k-get-jabs-in-udaipur-in-a-day/articleshow/83675054.cms||---

While the opening up of activities, after decline in cases is essential, the states and UTs must ensure that the whole process is carefully calibrated.The Centre has expressed that while opening up, it would be extremely important to follow the fivefold strategy of Covid-appropriate behaviour, test-track-treat and vaccination.A senior health department official said that they have been testing 40,000 to 50,000 samples on a daily basis, while focusing on vaccination to ensure that before the emergence of the third wave, most of the people should get vaccinated.The Centre has expressed the need to regularly monitor Covid-appropriate behaviour to prevent relapse. It has also asked the states to ensure use of masks, hand hygiene, social distancing and proper ventilation of closed spaces. “Easing restrictions in some states have led to resumption of crowding in market without adherence to the norms of Covid-appropriate behaviour. It is therefore essential to ensure that complacency does not set in, and there is no let-up in adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour, while opening up activities,” the Centre has told states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centre-asks-state-not-to-lower-guard/articleshow/83675060.cms||---

Sandeep Sahni, president of Hotel & Restaurant Association of Uttarakhand, told TOI that around 50 people working in various wings of the tourism sector, including hotel, restaurant owners, tour and taxi operators and others, walked from Haridwar to Dehradun. They were joined by 150 others in Dehradun. Over 200 of them thereafter collectively marched towards the state assembly on Saturday. “Tourism industry is the backbone of Uttarakhand's economy and the lockdown has broken the back of all those associated with it. We need the government to support us so that we can stand back on our feet. For this, there should be immediate removal of the RT-PCR test report, especially for those who are vaccinated, even partially,” he added. Abhishek Ahluwalia, president of tour operators' association of Uttarakhand, in a joint statement said the government should pay attention to the demands of tourism bodies. “What we are asking is not too difficult. It’s possible for the state government to waive off loans of small tourism body traders. The government can help us in reducing taxes, power tariffs and other charges that we are supposed to give on an annual basis, even when our business is shut for long,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hundreds-of-tourism-trade-members-hold-protest-march/articleshow/83673143.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: 49 unreported Covid deaths surface so far, more likely||LUCKNOW: The death toll during the deadly second wave of Covid-19 is turning out to be bigger than reported so far. Nearly 50 casualties that occurred between April first week and mid-May remained uncounted because many hospitals, despite recording them manually, did not upload the details on the health department’s Covid portal. This has been revealed in the death audit conducted by the chief medical officer’s (CMO) office of various hospitals which were converted into Covid facilities during the second wave. As many as 49 backlog deaths have been recorded so far. More such fatalities are likely to add to the overall toll in the next few days as the audit will continue for a week. The final count may raise the overall toll by 5%, said officials. With the addition of these fatalities, the number of deaths that took place in city hospitals during the second wave from March 15 till June 19 has touched 1,415. Of these, about 70 patients were from other districts. This means, around 1,345 Lucknow residents lost the battle with the disease over three months. CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said the audit is being conducted to ensure that not a single death from the pandemic goes unreported. “It will help us plan our strategy for the third wave,” he said. When asked how the deaths went unreported, health officials explained that when Covid-19 cases skyrocketed in mid-April, hospitals were converted into Covid facilities on war-footing. “The staff of these hospitals could not be trained to upload the data on the portal due to work pressure and kept manual records of deaths. Now, we are checking records of every hospital to update the toll. So far, records of around 12 hospitals have been examined in which we have found 49 backlog deaths,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/49-unreported-covid-deaths-surface-so-far-more-likely/articleshow/83677143.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Kartikey Hari Gupta, the agency’s advocate, said that “Max Corporate Services entered into contract with nationally accredited laboratories for conducting rapid antigen tests for the Kumbh Mela and it has no role to play in the alleged scam.” Gupta argued before the court that the agency had roped in Nalwa Laboratories and Dr Lal Chandani Labs Limited, both accredited by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “Max Corporate Services is merely a service provider,” he said, adding that “the sample collection and data entry was done by the labs, well to the knowledge and under the supervision of the Uttarakhand health department.” “I have requested the HC to protect the petitioner from any coercive measures of police. My client is willing to co-operate in the investigation, in whatever manner the government chooses to conduct it. In fact, my client is willing to help authorities unearth the scam, if it did indeed happen,” Gupta said. The petition was filed on Friday, a day after Haridwar Police filed an FIR against Max Corporate Services and the two labs it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with for conducting Covid tests during the Kumbh Mela. The FIR was filed based on a complaint by Haridwar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr SK Jha. On Friday, a special investigation team (SIT) was also formed to probe the matter. Max Corporate Services was one of the nine private agencies deployed by the state government to conduct Covid tests in Haridwar after the high court directed the state to conduct 50,000 daily tests during the Kumbh’s duration (April 1-30). A total of 4 lakh tests were conducted during this period by the agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/max-corporate-services-agency-accused-of-conducting-1l-fake-tests-at-kumbh-moves-hc/articleshow/83673209.cms||Ishita Mishra

He was in the city on official work, including attending an inquiry at the institute in Bhat area of the city. IPR sources claim that Dr Bora suffered a heart attack and was rushed to Zydus hospital where he was declared brought dead. Following his retirement from IPR, he was appointed as the vice-chancellor of Assam Science and Technology University (ASTU). Bora, a reputed scientist, took over from IPR’s founder director PK Kaw. Under him, the Steady State Tokamak fusion reactor at IPR first achieved a plasma in 2013. The SST achieved its full circular plasma in May 2016, challenging the Korean and Chinese counterparts. During his tenure, Bora even played a significant role in getting the LIGO-India project — which is an advanced gravitational-wave detector to be in India. He was associated with plasma research right from its inception in the 1980s at Physical Research Laboratory (PRL). “Till his tenure at IPR ended in August 2016, Bora led the fusion programme in India that competed with the Chinese and the Korean reactors and even earned India a reputation in the ongoing ITER programme. He led India at several fronts in the fusion zone. He was a man of action,” says a senior IPR official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/former-ipr-chief-dr-bora-no-more/articleshow/83675133.cms||---

According to the disaster management office, Almora received 79 mm rainfall in the last 24 hours, followed by 75 mm rainfall in Bageshwar and 57 mm rainfall in Pithoragarh. Due to the downpour, traffic movements were disrupted on 27 roads — six border roads and 21 internal roads — in the Pithoragarh district. The road leading to Munsyari from Jauljibi was also closed for traffic. The All-Weather Road, at the time of filing this report, was blocked at 20 places between Tanakpur and Pithoragarh. HD Mathela, the executive engineer of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), told TOI, “The All-Weather Road from Tanakpur to Pithoragarh is blocked at five places between Pithoragarh and Ghat and at 15 places between Ghat and Tanakpur.” The official added that earthmover machines have been deployed to clear the stretch but incessant rainfall and boulders falling from the hills on the road are disrupting the restoration work. Also, the Kailash Mansarovar route remained blocked at Tawaghat for the 13th day due to rain-related disruption. Besides, a total of 40 villages situated in the Darma, Chaudas and Vyas valleys have got cut off from the Dharchula tehsil headquarter. In Almora, traffic movements were suspended on 31 roads. The Almora-Haldwani highway was also closed for traffic for some hours but was later restored. As a consequence, commuters were diverted to the Almora-Ramgarh route, extending their journey by nearly 30 kilometres. Rakesh Joshi, district disaster management officer, Almora, told TOI, “Six motorable roads in the rural areas and the Almora-Pithoragarh national highway are closed for traffic. We are working on restoring these stretches at the earliest possible.” Similarly, 25 roads, including the Kausani-Baijnath route, got blocked for traffic in Bageshwar as debris was repeatedly falling on these stretches following heavy rain. The intermittent sliding of debris made the task of clearing the road more difficult for the personnel of the Border Roads Organisation and the National Highways Authority of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rainfall-blocks-several-roads-in-kumaon-traffic-disrupted/articleshow/83673258.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Pune||Covid-19: Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar warns of stricter weekend curbs||PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday said the weekend restrictions would be essential to restrict crowding while relaxations were being introduced under the state government’s Break the Chain order and dropped hint at compulsory 15-day quarantine of people stepping out for monsoon trips on Saturdays and Sundays after they returned to the district. “In the wake of the increased crowding, observed especially during weekends, we might have to impose more stricter restrictions. If the situation improves further, a decision on this would be taken after a review,” Ajit Pawar told reporters after the weekly Covid review meeting on Saturday. He asked people not to lower their guard against Covid-19 in view of the possible third wave of the pandemic. He cautioned residents against visiting tourist spots during weekends in the present scenario just because the restrictions had been eased. Ajit Pawar said police officers and public representatives expressed concern over people heading to Mahabaleshwar, Lonavala and other tourist places in large numbers over the weekends. “I don’t understand why people are doing this? A lot of people have started going to tourist places out of the state. Some are going for trekking. If this continues, there will be no option but to quarantine people going out of the district for 15 days,” he said. “The fear of the third wave is still there in the US and the UK despite large-scale vaccination. So, there is a need to be cautious here also,” he said. Ajit Pawar said the Covid death analysis in four major hospitals in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas revealed that 53% deceased were aged below 60 years, while 20% were in the age group of 21 to 45. A similar survey would be carried out by the Pune Municipal Corporation also, he said. Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla in his note to all the chief secretaries on Saturday advised states to be cautious while opening up and ensure that there was no let-up in adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/deputy-cm-warns-of-stricter-weekend-curbs/articleshow/83675101.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Close to 6,000 of these posts are vacant after two rounds of appointments held last year. Following chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s directives to fill the remaining posts in a timely manner, the basic education department released a schedule for the third phase of counselling. Accordingly, the appointment letters to the selected candidates will be issued on June 30 after document verification slated for June 28 and 29. According to a government spokesperson, the selection and district-wise allotment of the candidates will be done through a software developed by NIC. “Under the government’s Mission Rozgar, close to 4 lakh jobs have been given in the past four years through a transparent and neutral process,” said the spokesperson. After appointment letters are issued, verification of all educational and training certificates would take place followed by a medical examination of candidates. UP government had released the district-wise list of selected candidates on June 1, 2020.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Scholarships, a good samaritan help farm labourer’s son achieve Isro dream||PUNE: When Somnath Mali (28) was a student at the Zilla Parishad School in Solapur, he did not even know what a scientist did. His parents are farm labourers and his elder brother is a Std IV dropout. Mali’s interest in education, the mammoth effort by his parents to pay for his education and a private tutor, who taught him gratis, helped him get an offer letter for the position of a senior scientist at Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). He shared that if the OBC scholarship didn’t fund his college fee and he hadn’t received a stipend during his stint at IIT, Delhi, completing his education would have been tough. Mali completed his primary education at a local ZP school followed by an aided school till Std X. For junior college, he travelled to Pandharpur. “We were four boys staying in one room. My father would send my tiffin in a state transport bus coming to Pandharpur. At college, I came to know about the Common Entrance Test for engineering courses. I had no money but I went to a coaching class and told them about my condition. My life changed when Vinayak Paricharak sir agreed to teach me free-of-cost. He would even give me notes and other study material for free,” he recalled. The village boy did well and got admitted to Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute in Mumbai. “The OBC certificate helped cover a large portion of the fee. The remaining tuition, mess and hostel fee still added up to around Rs 60,000. My parents and elder brother would work as daily wage labourers, then come and work in our own two-acre plot to pay for the expenses. They also took loans from friends,” he said. After completing his MTech from IIT, Delhi, Mali and then took up a job in the private sector. “I had already appeared for the Isro exam once but I didn’t clear it. After a year, I decided to go for civil services and worked hard. However, I was unsuccessful. I again appeared for the Isro written exam in 2019 and the interview in April this year. On June 2, I came to know that I have been selected for Isro,” said Mali. Looking back, Mali shared, “When I was a student, I had no clue about engineering or a career as scientist. If I had not gone to Pandharpur or if Paricharak sir had not helped me, it would have been really difficult for me to get a decent job. I think every ZP school must have regular career guidance lectures. We need to give rural children some exposure. Education and knowledge of opportunities is the only way to lift villages from poverty,” said Mali, who will be joining Isro’s Thiruvananthapuram centre next month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/scholarships-a-good-samaritan-help-farm-labourers-son-achieve-isro-dream/articleshow/83675172.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Lucknow||BJP rejigs frontal units to spark up machinery||Lucknow: In a major move to spruce up the organization, the state BJP on Saturday constituted a new team of state unit's frontal organizations (Morchas) which work with different target groups. The re-constitution of the new team was due for more than a year. The state party president Swatantra Dev Singh, on Saturday, appointed Pranshudutt Dwivedi as the state president of Yuva morcha. He was the state party secretary till now. OBC leader and Rajya Sabha member Geeta Shakya was appointed the state president of Mahila morcha. Mohanlalganj MP Kauhal Kishore has been reappointed as chief of SC/ST morcha. The others who were appointed the state presidents of frontal organisations were Kameshwar Singh of the Kisan morcha, former MP Narendra Kashyap of the OBC morcha, Sanjay Gond of the ST morcha and Kunwar Basit Ali of the minority morcha. The other office-bearers to these morcha would be appointed now. The state BJP has to revamp and rejig its frontal units before mid-July. The revamp would be done in a phased manner. The office-bearers and the teams that work in the frontal units of the party are appointed for three years by the state party president. The teams are reshuffled with the new state party president assuming office. The current state party president, Swatantra Dev Singh, was elected as the state BJP chief in January 2020. The party insiders said that the revival of the units and the appointments of the new teams was delayed due to Coronavirus. The units had their old teams continuing in the office. Now, eight months left for the state assembly elections, the party has to revive these units on top priority. The multiple morcha, prakoshth and vibhag of the state BJP, which a senior party functionary said are like "lateral appendages or limbs" of the party, work to increase the party's reach among specific communities of people and, at the same time, forward the ideology of the party, promote its good work and combat negative publicity. The state unit of BJP has set a deadline to reconstitute these units by mid-July. There are seven morchas, 17 prakoshth and 28 vibhags of the state BJP. Each has its role defined. The seven morchas work among youth, women, OBC, minority, SC, ST and farmers. Similarly, the prakoshth works with lawyers, weavers, cultural artists, fishermen, traders and other communities. The vibhag, on the other hand, includes the party's IT cell, media cell, campaigns like Swachhta Abhiyan and Namami Gange, disaster management cell and similar others. Each of these units have a full-fledged team with president, vice president, secretary and members at the state and district level. These units help the party not only reach out to more and more people but also keep its committed workers within the fold as many of the party workers vie for the posts in these units. As has been in the past, at least 60% of the team members are retained and the rest are replaced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-rejigs-frontal-units-to-spark-up-machinery/articleshow/83677236.cms||Neha Shukla

Dr Pragya Yadav, head of the NIV’s Maximum Containment Facility, said, “Serum samples from those given Covaxin will be used to test if they can neutralize Delta Plus.” The NIV team said serum samples from recovered patients will also be used to gauge the neutralization potential of antibodies against the variant.  Delta Plus, or the AY.1 variant, has been found in at least seven Covid cases in the country. It formed after the Delta variant mutated further and features the K417N mutation in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Dr Yadav said, “We still don’t know how much the mutation allows the virus to escape antibodies. All that has been said so far about the variant's ability to escape antibodies is speculative and needs more analysis.” Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control, said any mutation over the Delta mutation (B.1.617.2) in the variant is called Delta Plus. Dr Singh said, “Immune-escape ability of the variant is still not established. But it is said that it can have an immune escape property, as this mutation is also in B.1.351 (Beta variant). As of June 18, 205 sequences of AY.1 lineage have been detected worldwide, with US and the UK reporting over half the cases. As of now, two things are key: India has fewer and scattered Delta Plus cases. Second, its potential of high transmissibility, immune-escape and virulence is being studied.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/niv-to-test-if-covaxin-can-fight-off-delta-plus-variant-of-coronavirus/articleshow/83675169.cms||Neha Madaan

The passenger has not been arrested as the gold is within the allowed limit. “The passenger was intercepted after thorough examination of his baggage. The gold was concealed in the form of a wire in trolley bags, wire in mouth organs, gold plates in hair straightener, clips in footwear and rings in keychains. The gold was plated with white rhodium to conceal the golden colour,” said an official. Prior to this, the customs officials had seized around 350 grams of gold from a passenger who had landed here from Sharjah in May. Officials claimed that due to the lockdown, smuggling of gold had reduced as flights were limited, but as restrictions are being eased, they anticipate more seizures in the coming days. Gold seizures at the airport had proved that smugglers had switched to new ways of getting the precious metal illegally in India. Officials claimed that while the alleged smugglers had previously used electronic items to smuggle the gold, they now converted the metal into a part of the product. Everything including sandals, iron, fountain pen and even human rectum are being used by smugglers to conceal gold. According to officials, those involved in smuggling of gold keep changing airports and Dubai is one the places where majority of the time the gold is smuggled from. They said that seizures and arrests are the only deterrents. In the past seizures, it was also found that the carriers were paid a very measly amount for carrying the gold and were mostly working class people who were given a ticket to home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gold-worth-rs-17-lakh-seized-from-dubai-passenger-at-airport/articleshow/83675155.cms||---

The decade-old practice was abruptly stopped in July 2017. The civic body has now uploaded all the resolutions it has passed between July 2017 and January 2018 on the website.Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara said uploading of resolutions on the website was a routine procedure that was followed by all the other corporations in the state. “They upload resolutions without any delay. The same procedure will be followed here as well.”Until recently, the corporation had been making some excuses for not uploading the resolutions on the website, despite several requests in this regard and an order from the Tamil Nadu Local Bodies Ombudsman.A resolution is a document containing all the details about a project - the bidder selected, cost and exact design, among other details.RTI activist S P Thiyagarajan, who had moved the high court seeking intervention in the matter, welcomed the move and requested the corporation to upload all the pending resolutions on the website.He said the corporation had stopped uploading the resolutions on the website almost eight months after dissolving the local body council in October 2016, when the commissioner took charge as the special officer. “Since then, there was no transparency in its works. It seems the corporation was under political pressure not to upload the resolutions on the website. Now that the government has changed, officials have started uploading the same.” Since the documents would be on the public domain henceforth, malpractices in the corporation works, if any, could be easily detected by the public, the activist said. Based on Thiyagarajan’s petition, which was filed on August 24, 2018, the Tamil Nadu Local Bodies Ombudsman had directed the corporation to upload all the resolutions on the official website immediately. But in February 2019, then corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan had sought time till the second week of May to upload the resolutions, citing works were on to upgrade the website. The ombudsman had sought an explanation from the commissioner of municipal administration when the corporation failed to upload the resolutions even after the extension of time it had sought. Since nothing changed on the ground, the activist moved the high court later that year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-resolutions-online-after-4-yrs/articleshow/83675195.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Ahmedabad||E-commerce company supplying baby products raises $75,000||The pandemic has brought about a fundamental change in the way people shop, and e-commerce has played a vital role in shaping this change. Tapping into the market for baby and motherhood products through the e-commerce channel, an Ahmedabad-based startup, TheBabyBo, has raised $75,000 (about Rs 55 lakh) within six months of its launch. Parth Sharma, founder and CEO, TheBabyBo, said, "We began our fundraising in March and closed the deal in May. With the fresh round of funds, we are looking at enhancing our technology offerings on our platform along with the expansion of our team. We are also focusing on ramping up digital marketing to be able to cater to a larger market." The startup, which was also co-founded by Siddhi Samel and Umang Seth, was incorporated in October 2020, whereas the digital platform was launched in December 2020. "When uncertainty around Covid-19 and lockdown struck together, many parents and parents-to-be were left running from pillar to post to find baby-care and motherhood products. The need gap was evident, and that is when the idea of such a startup struck. We surveyed a population of 1,000-plus new parents in addition to at least 200 doctors to understand this gap better and identify how we can address it," Sharma explained. The startup works on a subscription model based on which customized kits comprising 6-8 baby-care and motherhood products to suit the need of customers are supplied to the subscribers from time to time. "Currently we have at least 300 unique subscribers and by the end of the financial year 2021-22, we aim at crossing 10,000 subscribers. We are also tapping into a business-to-business space, besides the direct market," said Sharma, who is an MBA – Marketing from Indian Business School (IBS) - Mumbai. In fact, Sharma began ideating and working on the startup while completing his MBA. TheBabyBo is incubated at Start-up Chaupal’s incubator programme. The e-commerce platform serves some 27 tier-I and tier-II cities mostly in the northern, western and southern parts of India. "We have been serving cities like Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Surat, Nagpur, Pune, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Gorakhpur, Kasol and Bhuwaneshwar," Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/e-commerce-company-supplying-baby-products-raises-75000/articleshow/83675197.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Main accused in Bijnor double murder case, 3 others held after encounter||BIJNOR: Main accused wanted in the murder of a primary school teacher and his nephew outside Dhaukalpur village on May 9 was arrested on Saturday following an encounter with police. Three others, including his wife, were also arrested. According to police, Dheer Singh (50) and his nephew, Ankur Singh (24) were murdered over what is seen as a rivalry between two families. It started over “molestation” of a girl from Dheer Singh’s family allegedly by Anuj Kumar, son of one Aman Singh. It led to the murder of Aman Singh in 2015. Dheer Singh, Ankur and his father, Jagveer Singh alias Pappu, were arrested for the murder. Dheer Kuamar and Ankur were out on bail, when they were killed. Six named people, including slain Aman Singh’s three sons, and an unidentified person were named for the double murder. A reward of Rs 50,000 on each of them was announced. Of these, four of the accused, including Krishna, brother of the main accused, Anuj, was arrested. Giving details about the encounter, Dharamveer Singh, Bijnor superintendent of police, said main accused, Anuj, his wife, Lavali, and their relatives, Tikam Singh and Harsh Kumar, were travelling in a car on Mandawar road when a police team hailed them to stop. Instead, they opened fire. The latter retaliated and soon overpowered and arrested them. Two weapons, including a licensed gun, were seized from them. During the interrogation, police learnt about the role of Lavali, Tikam and Harsh in the double murder. Lavali said her husband, Anuj, had a love affair with a girl in Dheer Singh’s family. This led to the murder of Anuj's father, Aman Singh. Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh said Anuj’s brother, Nitin, who is also an accused, is still at large. He is an SSB jawan who was last posted in Bihar. A hunt is on for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/main-accused-in-bijnor-double-murder-case-3-others-held-after-encounter/articleshow/83670505.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan first to appoint people with disabilities in 73 urban bodies||JAIPUR: For D D Anjana (42), who has been nominated as a councillor of Kherli municipality in Alwar district, it is a dream come true, as the department of local self-government (LSG) has begun the process of nominating specially-abled persons to every urban local body (ULB) as members. Out of 213 ULBs in the state, persons with disability (PwDs) have already been nominated in 73. The state government had amended the Rajasthan Municipal Act in March this year to introduce this provision of nominating PwDs to the ULBs as members, making it the first in the country. “I took oath as a councillor on June 16 and was the first person to do so. I am very excited to have been appointed as a councillor. When I got to know that a provision has been made in the Act to nominate specially-abled persons, I had decided to submit an application for the same. But, I didn’t imagine that I would ever be nominated as a councillor. The local (Kathumar) MLA’s (Babulal Bairwa) son called me to inform me of this on June 14. I would like to work towards building ramps for PwDs at hospitals, banks and other places. I shall also work towards ensuring pension for PwDs and serving the poor,” said Anjana, who is 82 per cent disabled and is a social worker. Anjana is wheelchair-bound since the age of 8, after she was disabled having suffered from arthritis. The representatives of the community said they had to wait for 11 long years for this to become a reality. “A couple of days ago, I received a certificate of commitment from World Book of Records (London) appreciating my efforts to make Rajasthan the first state in the country to nominate PwDs to the ULBs as members. As per the advocacy groups, this has never happened anywhere in the world as of now. They say they couldn’t find such examples anywhere. It has been 11 years since we have been fighting for this. Earlier, we were demanding reservation for PwDs, but we dropped that idea due to technical reasons. Now, we are fighting to ensure nomination of PwDs to panchayati raj institutions,” said Hemant Goyal, national vice-president, Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh. Deepak Nandi, director and ex-officio special secretary, local bodies, said, “Rajasthan is the first state in the country to nominate PwDs to ULBs. After amendments in the Rajasthan Municipal Act, now it has become mandatory to keep one post vacant for PwDs in an urban local body.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-1st-to-appoint-people-with-disabilities-in-73-urban-bodies/articleshow/83675201.cms||---

---||Pune||Parenting through pandemic leads to paradigm shift in roles||PUNE: Mops, scrubs and diapers are no longer unfamiliar territory for most fathers. The pandemic and the work from home regime have led to a welcome change, not just in sharing household chores but also handling parental responsibilities. Fathers are getting the hang of multi-tasking as they learn the balance between their professional work life, household chores and baby care during the pandemic. Nishant Wadhwani, director at a private company, had twin girls Maahi and Meher just as the pandemic hit India in March 2020. “We were waiting for eight years to have a child, so we were grateful that we got the time to cherish each and every moment with them during the lockdown,” he shared. He added that parenting in the new environment has its pros and cons. “I was able to devote a lot of time to our babies and give them proper care since they it was a premature birth and they required extra care. Now, they are over a year old and our life is getting better. One of us takes care of the babies, while the other manages household chores, cooking, or work. If there was no lockdown, one of us may have had to leave the job,” he said. Vishal Choudhari, manager at a company, had ample privacy to conduct online meetings before his son Advay was born last September. “Nowadays, it’s a routine for me to take care of my son, coax him, put him to bed or babysit him while I am logged onto an online meeting. I am a professional from 9am-7pm, but a father 24x7. Usually, I have to travel for work but, due to the pandemic, I have had the opportunity to stay home and not miss any of my son’s milestones,” he said. Vicky Jain, who had his first child Dhruvansh in October 2020, said, “The last year has brought parents closer to their children. It has pushed us to be ‘atmanirbhar’ with regards to parenting tasks. I learnt how to massage our baby, as we were unsure if maids would be allowed to come to work during the lockdown. Though working from home has definitely extended office hours, we still spend more time with our child and that’s the best gift a father can get.” Vishal Ramaiya, another professional, noticed a stark difference in his role as a parent when his younger daughter was born in July last year. “When my elder daughter Aarvi was born 2017, I would play with her when I came back from work and babysit her while my wife was busy. With Avika, I had the chance to dive head on into parenting. I learnt how to bathe her, feed her, make her a bottle, put her to sleep. I wake up early to take care of the children while my wife works on her home-based business. In the evenings, when my shift starts, she takes over watching the children. Being at home full time with my newborn increased my skill and knowledge as a father.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/parenting-through-pandemic-leads-to-paradigm-shift-in-roles/articleshow/83673364.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Pune||Don’t need lectures from US cos on freedom of expression: RS Prasad||Pune: Union law and telecommunications minister Ravi Shankar Prasad reiterated at an online lecture on Saturday that the guidelines issued by the Union government for social media companies came after a direction from the Supreme Court, adding that the instructions were essential to stop “misuse” of social media. “Around 100 crore Indians use various social media platforms. Criticism of the government is no problem to us. But, of late, there are negative trends emerging of fake news, women’s naked images being displayed, and their dignity being compromised, morphed images, and others. There is also a new trend to file PILs in court, start campaigns on social media, and if the judgment is against what the campaigners want, the judges are trolled. Judges should be free to take judicial decisions. The guidelines have not come suddenly. The Supreme Court directed the government to set up guidelines for content on social media after a few cases. If messages that can cause harm are going viral, there must be a framework,” Prasad said. The minister was addressing a lecture organised by the Symbiosis International (Deemed University), as part of its golden jubilee celebrations. He also spoke about criminal justice reform, and improving the arbitration process, and defended exemptions to the right to privacy. Prasad also defended messaging services like WhatsApp being asked to disclose names of origin of viral messages which “can cause riots, or have child sexual abuse material”, but as a last resort, when all other investigative methods have been exhausted. He also warned Twitter that India “does not need lectures on freedom of expression” from profitable American corporations, and operating in India implies obeying Indian law, which includes legal action under the loss of legal protections. “I have not made Twitter lose their exempted status under Section 79 (of the IT Act). The guidelines were issued on February 25, and social media companies had three months to comply. As a gesture of goodwill, I gave more time for the companies to comply. Their protections have expired due to the law, and now they have to respond through the legal process. I am not in the business of banning any company, but India’s digital sovereignty is important,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dont-need-lectures-from-us-cos-on-freedom-of-expression-rs-prasad/articleshow/83675199.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Kolkata||Post-Cov patients force 3-way bed division at private hosps||Kolkata: With a steady climb in the number of non-Covid admissions over the last fortnight and a corresponding drop in the number of Covid patients, private hospitals are now faced with three major segments of patients. With a section of Covid survivors returning for post-disease complications, many have gone for a three-way division of beds to accommodate all. One has even decided to set up an ITU for those seeking admission for post-Covid complications while another is contemplating a similar arrangement. The largest share of beds is being reserved for non-Covid patients and it’s rising gradually. “But due to the restrictions on travel and unavailability of public transport, non-Covid patients haven’t gone up as fast as they would have otherwise. Also, a substantial number of Covid survivors are seeking readmission due to post-disease complications and we are keeping beds ready for them,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. At Peerless Hospital, out of the 196 non-Covid patients now admitted, around a fourth are suffering from post-viral diseases. The hospital is ‘seriously considering’ an ITU for these patients. “Some of these patients were treated at our hospital and were released after recovery but they remain positive. So, they are having to be admitted at the Covid ward and shifted to the non-Covid section again once they turn negative. These patients are, in fact, often more serious than the Covid positive ones,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Another hospital representative said it’s toying with the idea of a post-Covid ward with a team of specialists appointed to deal with these patients. “With Covid numbers dwindling, we will see more post-Covid patients now and they can’t be treated on a par with Covid patients,” he said. Barua said that though the latter are treated as non-Covid patients, ‘separate arrangements’ are often being made for them since their ailments are similar. AMRI now has 90 Covid patients across its three units and 350 non-Covid patients. “Due to the slow increase in non-Covid patients and the rise in the number of post-Covid patients, we have decided to convert beds (from Covid to non-Covid) slowly. For instance, we have raised the number of critical beds in non-Covid section and reduced the same in Covid units since the latter is a dwindling number,” added Barua. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), almost half of its 120 Covid beds are vacant. Of the 450 non-Covid beds, 60% is occupied. Here, however, just 2% of non-Covid patients are those with post-Covid complications. The demand for critical care beds among post-covid patients has gone up sharply over the last two weeks even as the number of Covid patients has dropped, pointed out Mitra. “Their ailments are often severe, including cardiac diseases, cerebral strokes and lung fibrosis. These patients need ITU care,” he added. Hypoxia, recurrent fever, lingering pneumonia in case of younger patients and lung fibrosis and cardiac ailments in the case of elderly or middle aged are the most common post-Covid ailments, according to doctors. It has helped that the number of non-Covid patients hasn’t risen sharply due to the transport restrictions, felt Medica Superspecialty Hospital chairperson Alok Roy. “We have 150 non-Covid patients now but the number would have been much higher had transport been available. So, it’s relatively easy to admit post-Covid patients now but they may find it difficult to find a berth once the transport restrictions are lifted,” said Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/post-cov-patients-force-3-way-bed-division-at-private-hosps/articleshow/83673440.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The Sassoon general hospital in its advance post-mortem report certified it as the cause of the manager’s death. He was missing since the bodies of his wife and seven-year-old son were found on Tuesday. His body was fished out from a waterbody at Khanapur near Khadakwasla dam on Friday. The police were searching for the man after the double murder came to light on the evening of June 15 (Tuesday). The bodies of the woman and her son were found 35km apart at Khalad village near Veer dam in Saswad and at Jambhulwadi, off Katraj-Dehu Road bypass, respectively. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone II) Sagar Patil told TOI on Saturday, “The victim’s family members have told the police that there was a domestic dispute between the manager and his wife over some issues. The insurance manager, after killing his wife and son, went into depression and ended his life by jumping into the waterbody. No suicide note was found. The Sassoon hospital has confirmed in its post-mortem report that the victim had died due to drowning.” Senior inspector Jagganath Kalaskar from the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said, “The victim had used a sharp weapon for inflicting self-injuries before ending his life. The police, with the help of the PMRDA’s (Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority) fire brigade personnel and residents of the area, conducted searches in the waterbody for recovering the sharp weapon, but in vain.” Kalaskar said, “The victim’s neighbours and people known to them have given information to the police that the deceased couple were in the habit of quarrelling/fighting with each other over trivial issues. We shall submit a detailed report related to the incident before a magisterial court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sassoon-report-confirms-insurance-manager-died-of-drowning-after-double-murder/articleshow/83675224.cms||---

In fresh documents released by the party, Singh claimed that Ayodhya Mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay and his nephew Deep Narayan were involved in questionable land deals. “Where Upadhyay was the witness in the all crucial deal where land was first sold to two persons for Rs 5.6 crore and then minutes later was sold to the Trust for Rs 18.5 crore, Narayan purchased land worth Rs 35.6 lakh in Kot Ramchandar for Rs 20 lakh. One Jagdish Prasad purchased land in the same area, worth Rs 14.8 lakh for Rs 10 lakh. However, the Trust purchases land worth Rs 60 lakh for Rs 4 crore in the same area,” he said.

Kites with the images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, SP supremo Akhilesh Yadav, BSP president Mayawati and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi are on sale in Mathura, Agra and other places on the eve of 'Ganga Dussehra'. The pictures of national and state leaders on the kites and their respective sales also reflects the prevailing political mood. And if the kite sellers are to be believed, Congress still has a long way to go. “These kites are more in demand this year. Every year different kinds of kites come in the market as per the choice of the youth,” said Sharik Ali, a kite seller in Mathura, adding that kites with Modi’s image come from Gujarat. “Keeping the state polls in mind, we have started making kites with photos of other political leaders on them and we are having a bumper sale,” said Ali. He claimed that CM Yogi and Akhilesh’s kites are more in demand after PM Modi. “Youngsters are more crazy about political leaders this time,” he claimed. Each kite costs Rs 25, but due to bumper sale the prices have been jacked to Rs 30 per piece as printing at the last moment cost more. Another kite seller in Agra, Rakesh said that kites with pictures of PM, CM and Akhilesh are a huge hit. He said this has been in fact a trend in the past few years. “I have sold 50 kites of Modi ji alone. Its demand is soaring,” he added. Traditionally on 'Ganga Dussehra', devotees take holy dips in river Ganga as it is believed that the holy water washes away all sins - past and present.

Dilip Kumar Phulwani alleged in his complaint to VKI police that he had gone to meet his relative near Vidhyadhar Nagar on Friday evening. When he returned home around 10pm, the house was ransacked. The accused had searched through cupboards and shelves and took the money. VKI police have not ruled out the possibility of an insider’s hand in the theft.“Prima facie investigation hints at the involvement of someone who knew the movements of Phulwani.

---||Kolkata||Chef employed at US Army base in Iraq airlifted to Kolkata for Covid care||KOLKATA: Tagore Park resident Biraj Rufus Gomes, 43, was stationed at a US Army base in Baghdad, Iraq, as a chef when he contracted Covid-19 in May-end. He was initially admitted to a hospital in Baghdad but as his condition turned serious, his employers, a services company called Vectrus, tried to shift him to a better healthcare facility in Dubai where the company is headquartered, but was reportedly denied permission by the authorities. The company then decided to airlift Gomes all the way to Kolkata for treatment. “On June 2, Vectrus got in touch with us. An official told us they had decided to fly my brother to Kolkata in an air ambulance. Since Ruby General Hospitals is close to our house, it was decided that he would be treated there,” said the chef’s younger sister, Teresa Khan. On June 7, an air ambulance with Gomes took off from Baghdad. Two doctors accompanied Gomes, who was fitted with high-flow nasal cannula. “I was drowsy during the flight. The craft halted somewhere for refuelling and took almost eight hours to reach Kolkata. I felt restless and prayed that I reach my city safe. The moment I landed in Kolkata, I got back the resolve to fight,”Gomes told TOI. The air ambulance landed at Kolkata airport on the morning of June 8 where a medical team with a critical care ambulance from the hospital was waiting. “The team had taken prior permissions to drive the ambulance right up to the aircraft. The patient was shifted to the ambulance and reached the hospital around 6.15am,” recounted Ruby general manager Subhashish Datta. At the hospital’s Covid ICU, doctors found that along with Covid-induced acute breathing distress, Gomes also had diabetes ketoacidotis, a serious complication that sometimes prove fatal. “We put him on steroid therapy, fluid insulin and worked out on electrolyte correction measures. Luckily, he showed signs of recovery. Though his oxygen requirement remained high for days, he did not require ventilation,” said critical care specialist Rimita Dey who attended to the patient along with endocrinologist Ajitesh Roy and gastroenterologist Debasis Sardar. Gomes was shifted out of the ICU after a week. He was discharged from the hospital on Saturday after doctors certified him fit. Starting from a small pizza outlet in Kolkata two decades ago, Gomes’ culinary skills opened up vistas abroad. Last October, he had returned from another Army base camp in Afganisthan due to the pandemic but his employers recontacted him and offered the work at the US Army base camp in Baghdad. “The company that employed me has taken care of all expenses for the air ambulance and the treatment. I hope they will call me back soon as I can’t wait to resume work,” said Gomes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chef-employed-at-us-army-base-in-iraq-airlifted-to-kol-for-covid-care/articleshow/83675235.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Two brothers along with a scrap dealer have been arrested. According to police, the accused used to speak in codes - Santro was 'santra' [Orange] and Wagon R was 'anar' [Pomegranate], among others. Following a tip-off, police laid a trap for the brothers, Phool Miyan and Aslam. Both are residents of Muzaffarnagar. Scrap dealer Saleem was picked up hours later. Eighteen engines of luxury cars and other parts were recovered from the premises of Saleem. A stolen car and bike which were about to be dismantled were also found. The brothers used to steal cars from Haryana, Uttarakhand and Delhi, and sell them in Muzaffarnagar. Saleem was their main buyer. He used to sell luxury car parts and bikes after dismantling them. On Saturday, senior superintendent of police Abhishek Yadav said, "The arrested men have several criminal cases registered against them in various police stations of the district. Police teams are also trying to find more links in other states. Further action is being taken." The station house officer (SHO) of New Mandi police station, Anil Kaparwan, said, "After lifting the vehicles, the brothers used to call Saleem and they would speak in code language. A case has been registered against them." All three have been sent to jail, the SHO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/car-lift-codes-when-santra-means-santro-anar-is-wagon-r/articleshow/83670600.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Senior BSP neta quits, eyes return to Samajwadi Party fold||LUCKNOW: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) witnessed another exit of a senior member with former minister Ambika Chaudhary resigning from the party on Saturday, hours after his son was handed over a ticket by Samajwadi Party to contest zila panchayat chairperson elections. Chaudhary, who has been minister in at least two SP governments under Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav, joined BSP ahead of 2017 assembly elections amidst a feud in the Yadav first family. His resignation, said sources, is a signal of his imminent return to the SP fold. In his resignation letter to BSP chief Mayawati, Chaudhary said, he wasn’t assigned work after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and he was feeling redundant. His decision was also guided by his son’s move to contest panchayat chairperson seat on SP ticket and did not want his commitment to BSP questioned or accused of conflict of interest, he added. “Since I joined BSP ahead of 2017 assembly elections, I have been a dedicated worker. I fulfilled big and small responsibilities given to me. After 2019 Lok Sabha elections, for reasons unknown to me, I have not been given any responsibility and this made me feel marginalised,” he said. A senior BSP member said, Chaudhary had contested 2017 assembly polls on a BSP ticket and wanted to contest Lok Sabha polls too, but due to the alliance with SP, he did not get his favoured seat. Subsequently, he was involved in elections in Chhattisgarh. “His resignation can only mean that he wants to return to SP, since his son has been given a ticket,” he said. Mayawati had expelled two senior party members, MLA Lalji Verma and former state president Ram Achal Rajbhar on June 3 .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/senior-bsp-neta-quits-eyes-return-to-sp-fold/articleshow/83677342.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: NIV to test if Covaxin can fight off newfound Delta Plus variant||PUNE: The recently discovered Delta Plus variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus will be isolated and grown at the Pune-based ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV) to test if it can be neutralized with Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. The NIV will isolate the variant from samples collected from Covid cases involving Delta Plus reported in India, Dr Samiran Panda, chief of epidemiology and communicable diseases (ECD), told TOI on Saturday. Dr Pragya Yadav, head of NIV’s maximum containment facility, said: “As soon as it is isolated and cultured, serum samples drawn from those given Covaxin will be used in the lab to test if they can neutralize Delta Plus.” The NIV team said serum samples from recovered Covid patients will also be used to gauge the neutralization potential of the antibodies against the variant. Not many cases of the latest variant have been detected in India. According to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), Delta Plus has been found in at least seven Covid-19 cases in the country. GISAID is an open-access global initiative that boosts rapid sharing of data linked to the influenza viruses and the coronavirus-causing Covid-19. Delta Plus, or the AY.1 variant, formed after the Delta variant mutated further. Preliminary data indicates Delta Plus shows signs of resistance to monoclonal antibody cocktail treatments being tried in India. AY.1, or B.1.617.2.1, is characterised by the K417N mutation in the spike protein of SARS-COV-2, which helps the virus enter and infect human cells. “There is only one extra mutation in Delta Plus. We still do not know how much this mutation allows SARS-CoV-2 to escape antibodies. All that has been said so far, about this variant’s ability to escape antibodies, is speculative and needs more analysis,” Dr Yadav said. Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), told TOI any mutation over and above the Delta mutation (B.1.617.2) in the variant is called Delta Plus. The Delta variant with the K417N mutation is B.1.617.2.1 (AY.1) and colloquially known as Delta Plus, he said. Dr Singh said, “The immune-escape ability of the variant is still not established. But it is said it can have an immune escape property, as this mutation is also there in B.1.351 (Beta variant). Its resistance to monoclonal antibody cocktails is being studied. As of June 18, 205 sequences of AY.1 lineage have been detected worldwide, with US and the UK reporting over half the known cases. As of now, two things are important: the number of Delta Plus cases are fewer in India, and scattered. Two, the variant’s potential of high transmissibility, immune-escape effect and virulence are being studied.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-niv-to-test-if-covaxin-can-fight-off-newfound-delta-plus-variant/articleshow/83671773.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Traders like ‘jab all, work longer’ rule, but Covid threat stays||MUMBAI: BMC’s plan to allow companies to work longer if staff are fully vaccinated was welcomed but health experts said the entire anti-Covid drill of masking and maintaining social distance cannot be abandoned for long. There also is a medical caveat: People vaccinated could still get infected but not display symptoms. “These asymptomatic people travelling in Mumbai’s crowded trains could spread infection around,”' said a doctor. Bengaluru epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu concurred, “Vaccinated people could still be carriers and pose a risk for unvaccinated people.” But Dr Babu said it was a risk cities could take provided precautions are taken. With the vaccination drive in public sector likely to step up from June 21 as per Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement 10 days back, BMC is looking to incentivise Covid-19 vaccination; One of the ideas is to allow companies, commercial establishments and malls to stay open longer if employees are vaccinated. “It is a not a bad idea. It is like creating a cloud for yourself. Hospitals have been working in this way, with most staff fully vaccinated,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state government’s Covid-19 task force. Many traders are planning to make it mandatory for employees to have a vaccination certificate. “From July 1, we plan to make it mandatory for employees to show the certificate,” said Viren Shah, president, Federation of Retail Traders’ Welfare Association (FRTWA). Shah said, “We are lucky as many of my staff are above 45 years plus and have taken both the shots. Those who are left have been told to get vaccinated quickly.'' Restaurant associations are also relieved but want BMC to offer free vaccinations to staff, even those aged 18-44 that BMC has at present excluded from the drive. AHAR secretary Sukesh Shetty said, “We want to ensure the safety of staff, so we want to ensure they all are vaccinated as they come in contact with customers.’’ But as the dine-in sector has taken a hit over the last 15 months, he said owners cannot get employees vaccinated in the private sector. BJP corporator Atul Shah said civic centres get 100 vaccine doses a day. “At this rate, it is not possible to ensure faster vaccination to allow establishments to open,” he said. MLA Amin Patel said BMC should open up vaccination for the younger group. “Civic vaccination centres are running largely empty, as many aged above 45 have been vaccinated. If vaccination is opened up for those aged 18-44, many of those whose employment demands a certificate can get the jab,” said Patel.

---||Mumbai||Will never bear someone else’s palanquin: Maharashtra CM||MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray said on the 55th anniversary of the Shiv Sena on Saturday that he would never turn servile to remain in power in the state. “The Sena believes in self-pride, which Balasaheb Thackeray taught us. We will not lose our dignity and self-respect. We will not be the bearers of someone’s palanquin,” he said. This was Thackeray’s tacit warning to allies in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, especially in view of the noise from the Congress that it would go solo for the upcoming civic elections. The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena are the three main parties in the MVA. Thackeray urged politicians of all shades to to address post-Covid-19 issues. In his on-line address to Shivsainiks, Thackeray took a dig at the Congress. “‘Swa-bal’ [contesting elections on one’s own strength] should stem from ‘swabhiman’ (self-pride), and this sentiment should not remain confined to polls,” he said. He invoked his father’s name often. “Balasaheb gave top priority to swabhiman. For him the pride of the Marathi manoos mattered much more than a poll victory. Elections come and go, self-pride needs to be upheld with one’s head high,” he said. Doing some tight-rope walking on the issue of Hindutva and regional pride, Thackeray said the twin plank marked Sena's political philosophy. He praised West Bengal for upholding its self-pride in the assembly election. As Sena chief, Thackeray could not help praising the Shivsainiks who were part of the street fight with BJP activists in Dadar recently. “This is what a Sainik is,” he said, before quickly adding that it was not fair to resort to violence at the slightest provocation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/will-never-bear-someone-elses-palanquin-in-mumbai-uddhav/articleshow/83679043.cms||Ambarish Mishra
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Lalbazar asks cops to be polite during naka vigil||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police top brass has asked traffic and local cops to be compassionate when conducting checks on restriction violations. At the monthly virtual crime meeting held on Saturday, the cops have been asked to find out the point of origin and the destination at the check posts. “If someone staying in the extreme south chooses to go to north Kolkata for any purpose, where exceptions have been allowed, there has to be a valid reason. Hence the documents in hand will help decide if the person concerned is indeed out with a valid purpose. Cops have to be conversant with the rules and look at the real cause,” explained a traffic officer. Sources said that though they have not yet received any complaint of high-handedness, the top brass does not wish to take any chance. All cops manning nakas have been asked to be polite and keep their body cameras on at all times while interacting with motorists. Individual traffic guards have been asked by the traffic department to report on why vehicle count in the city has multiplied several times in the morning since June 16, given that only a limited percentage of office goers are allowed to attend office on a particular day. They have been instructed to be especially vigilant on weekends when there are no office goers. “The number of private vehicles and app cabs on the road is comparable to the unlock period. This is a clear indication of violation of rules,” said an officer. Statistics collected in the past 35 days show that the number of seizures vary widely on a weekend. “People trying to enter the city is higher on weekends rather than on weekdays. Hence, for cops at naka points in Howrah and Ultadanga, checks are intense. We also carry out special checks at unannounced locations,” explained an officer. The top brass also asked all local police stations to complete the pending passport verifications within one week. “This is a necessity for several people and with Covid cases now dropping, the pending work needs to be completed,” a senior officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lalbazar-asks-cops-to-be-polite-during-naka-vigil/articleshow/83673490.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: More labs involved in sending fake Covid reports?||DEHRADUN/HARIDWAR: Further revelations in the fake Covid test scam now point at the involvement of multiple testing labs, besides Nalwa Laboratories and Dr Lalchandani Labs against whom FIRs have already been filed. In details that emerged on Saturday, a Gurugram-based lab was found to have sent five different messages to Ranjith Kumar, a resident of Chennai, on April 16 when the Kumbh was in progress. In all the five messages, the names mentioned were different and all were intimations of negative Covid status. “I was shocked to see five messages on my phone; all had some Covid report links,” Kumar told TOI over phone. When he clicked on the links, he found names of five different people and their test results – all negative. “I tried to trace the source of the messages and found that the samples were collected from some place in Haridwar. This happened on April 16,” said Kumar. Since he works in the IT sector, he could immediately sense there was something amiss, that it could be a case of fraud. However, when all his attempts to trace the reports failed, he ignored the messages. A Haridwar-based professor, who didn’t wish to be named, had a similar experience. He received an RT-PCR report from a lab in Roorkee during the Kumbh even though he had never got himself tested. “Initially I panicked as this could be a case of cyber fraud or data theft. But as the report was negative, it brought some relief,” said the professor. A Delhi-based journalist who reached Haridwar to cover the Kumbh with a valid RT-PCR report also received a message on her phone, a few days after she had got her report, saying that she had tested negative for Covid. She claimed that her credentials were noted at the Narsan border by officials who were deployed to do Covid tests and check the reports. She filed a complaint about this with the chief medical officer of Haridwar, Dr S K Jha, who assured her that the matter will be looked into but according to her, nothing came of it. Commenting on these new developments in the case, Haridwar district magistrate C Ravishankar said that these messages could be due to a “technical error.” “People deployed for testing wear PPE. Sometimes, there can be some miscommunication that can make this happen as technicians may not note down the last digits of the phone numbers properly. Also, sometimes, people themselves give wrong info so that if they test positive, they cannot be tracked. But if there are instances like these in bulk, we will surely look into the matter,” said Ravishankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/more-labs-involved-in-sending-fake-covid-reports/articleshow/83671824.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Pune||Three masked men steal cash, helmets, high-end bike from Lullanagar showroom||Pune: Three men wearing masks broke open the shutter locks of a two-wheeler showroom at Lullanagar and stole cash Rs2 lakh, four helmets and a new high-end motorcycle, collectively worth Rs4.93lakh, on Friday night. The showroom owner, Chirag Mutha (28) from Salisbury Park, has registered an FIR with the Wanowrie police. Mutha, in his FIR, said that he had closed the showroom on Thursday at 7pm. The CCTV cameras at the showroom recorded the images of three men, wearing face covers, breaking open the shutter locks of the store and executing the crime between 1.55am and 2.01am on Friday, he said. The trio also broke the central lock of the glass door behind the shutter and stole Rs2lakh from the cash box, four costly helmets and a high-end KTM bike of 390 model and took to heels, the FIR stated. Assistant inspector Bhagwan Kamble of the Wanowrie police, said on Saturday, “The burglary came to light after the showroom employees reported for duty on Friday at 10am. There was no security guard at the showroom. The CCTV cameras have captured images of the three masked men, and we are working on certain clues to establish their identities.” Senior inspector Deepak Lagad said, “The burglary took place within a span of six minutes. Mutha has not suspected involvement of his employees behind the incident. We don’t know what mode of transport the trio had used. We are checking CCTV cameras around the showroom to establish the routes used by the suspects before and after the crime. More details will emerge during investigation.” The showroom owner did not offer his comments when TOI reached him on the phone as he was busy with police investigations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/three-masked-men-steal-cash-helmets-high-end-bike-from-lullanagar-showroom/articleshow/83675289.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: In saffron avatar, Jitin Prasada’s first tryst with BJP headquarters||LUCKNOW: Ten days after he joined BJP, Congress turncoat Jitin Prasada visited the BJP office in Lucknow, signalling his political relevance in the party, where he is expected to be projected as a key Brahmin face, ahead of assembly elections next year. Prasada’s visit to UP BJP headquarters was marked by presence of supporters, mainly from Shahjahanpur and Lakhimpur Kheri, the two districts where he wields political influence. Hailing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the only person who can do good for the country, he stepped into the state BJP office after paying obeisance at a temple in the premises. He said, he sought blessings of chief minister Yogi Adityanath and vowed to reach out to people with government’s welfare schemes and strengthen the party at the grassroots. Earlier, he received a rousing welcome from supporters at Lucknow airport before driving down to BJP office to meet state party president Swatantra Dev Singh. Prasada was one of the Congress rebels in Group-23, which not only questioned the functioning of the grand old party, but also sought an overhaul. His stand had further marginalised him in the party. After joining BJP, he called it as the only national party in the country. “BJP is the only party that gives workers a fair chance to grow and rewards them for their work,” he said. With over 12% Brahmin vote at stake in UP, Prasada may be projected as the Brahmin face before the assembly elections early next year. “BJP is a party, where even an ordinary citizen can reach the top rung of leadership,” he said. He also attacked regional parties for ignoring development and securing their own interests. “Regional parties have not created leadership, BJP on the other hand has clear direction, strong leadership and vibrant organization. I would function like any other ordinary worker and let my work do the talking. My supporters are happy and I took the decision to join BJP based on ‘janbhawna' (sentiments of my supporters),” he said. UP BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh said, Jitin Prasada is welcome in the party. “Respect for all is assured in BJP,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-saffron-avatar-jitins-first-tryst-with-bjp-hq/articleshow/83677419.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Dehradun||Always feared Kumbh could act as super-spreader, my worst fears have come true, says former Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Rawat||Dehradun: Amid the ongoing war of words between CM Tirath Singh Rawat and his predecessor Trivendra Rawat over the fake Covid-19 test scam at Kumbh, the former CM told TOI on Saturday, “I always feared that Kumbh may act as super-spreader and my worst fears have now come true.” He added it was because of his apprehensions that during his tenure, he took several strict decisions to limit the number of attendees at Kumbh in order to prevent the festival from turning into a super-spreader. On CM Tirath Rawat’s remarks that the fake Covid testing scam at Kumbh happened before he took over on March 10, Trivendra Rawat said, “As per my information, the three private firms in question had signed MoUs around March 10 or 11 and were empanelled for work around March 23. The SOPs for Kumbh were released on March 24. I don’t want to argue about the timing as everyone knows that Kumbh was from April 1 to 30, but the important point is that strict action is taken against those involved in the crime. It is a clear case of an attempt to murder.” He added that “people have the right to know fully about the crime that has been committed in the form of the fake tests.” “If a probe is conducted by a district or state authority, people may doubt the findings. I would like to request the government for a judicial probe by a sitting high court judge so that all the facts can come out clearly before the people,” he added. Further, the former CM said that an important part of the enquiry was to find out the circumstances under which the firms that had conducted the fake tests were empanelled by the Haridwar district administration and Kumbh Mela authorities. “Tenders were not floated for the process and the work was given directly after consent by either the Haridwar district magistrate or the district health department. This also needs to be probed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/always-feared-kumbh-could-act-as-super-spreader-my-worst-fears-have-come-true-says-former-ukhand-cm-trivendra-rawat/articleshow/83671854.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Pune||Citizens come forward to turn 11 acres of barren land into a mini forest||Pune: Citizens have taken up the task of turning an 11-acre barren land near Mohammadwadi into a mini forest. The initiative by Anandvan Mitra Mandal, headed by Praveen Kumar, is already under way with volunteers contributing towards constructing trenches, ponds and planting various trees in the area. The area, covering a tekdi, belongs to the forest department, which has partnered with the non-governmental organisation (NGO) for this green initiative. The forest department has built boundary walls and an entrance gate near Nine Hills Society and Elina Living Society, Mohammedwadi, to restrict entry of vehicles and trespassers. “We plan to turn this barren tekdi into a forest like Anandvan in the NIBM Road area. This project was inaugurated on Environment Day (June 5). We have already built a pond with the capacity to hold 50,000 litres of water and divided the entire area into different zones to encourage biodiversity. Volunteers have planted trees such as neem, peepal and tamarind that are beneficial for avian life,” said Kumar. Over 110 volunteers have worked on this project, including residents of the area, student groups and young professionals interested in nature work. Citizens from locations such as Uruli Kanchan and Nanded City have also pitched in. The volunteers work to revitalise the tekdi every day from 6.30-11am. All necessary materials and equipment are donated by citizens. “We want to install a drip irrigation facility. Four months ago, we proposed that a pipeline be laid from Bhairoba Nullah to provide waste water to the tekdi. It will help us convert 2-3 lakh litre waste water into grey water for plantation on a daily basis, while also reducing the flooding problem in that area. It will take a lot of water to turn the barren land into a forest as the soil has hardened. We are also dumping good quality soil for the plantations to flourish,” said a volunteer. Housing societies in the area are donating four tankers of water on a daily basis for this work. “We are getting together and leaning how to take care of the environment so that we can make the city greener and its air cleaner. Turning barren land into a mini forest will help improve air quality, which in turn will have positive effects on public health. All participants wear masks and maintain social distancing protocols,” said a volunteer. Anyone who wants to volunteer can reach out to the NGO through their Facebook page and come over to the tekdi to help out. “There is enough work for everyone, and we invite everyone to help out in whatever way they can. We are also looking for donations in the form of water, soil, coconut pits and most importantly, plants. It will take a few weeks for the project to be completed, though maintaining the greenery will be a continuous task, ” said Kumar. Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests (Pune division), said, “This is a great project for citizens to come together and participate in. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the forest department is also involved in this eco-friendly initiative. We urge all citizens to come forward and participate in such initiatives in their areas. Similar projects are being planned for other barren plots in and around the city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-come-forward-to-turn-11-acres-of-barren-land-into-a-mini-forest/articleshow/83675316.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Launched by cooperatives minister and Howrah Municipal Corporation board of administrators chairman Arup Roy, the project christened Haath Baralei Mutation (mutation within reach) is part of the government’s ‘Duare’ programmes that provides services at doorstep. On Saturday, HMC carried out around 150 mutations at Merlin Waterfront on Swarnamoyee Road in collaboration with the Howrah-Hooghly chapter of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai). “Nearly 60% of apartment owners have not done their mutation because the services were not streamlined. We have therefore decided to take up this drive that will also lead to collection of mutation fee and much needed revenue,” said Roy, adding that property tax payment and other services would also be extended. Among those present at the function were HMC commissioner Dhaval Jain, Credai Howrah Hooghly chairman Ramratan Chowdhury, Credai Howrah Hooghly president Tamal Ghoshal and Merlin Projects director Satyen Sanghvi. On Wednesday, a pilot project was carried out at Ideal Residency on Foreshore Road in which around 110 mutations were completed. “HMC and other major civic bodies need to upgrade the services and come to the standard of KMC. This doorstep mutation is a great initiative and has to be followed up with upgrades in IT infrastructure so that there is ease of property tax payment,” Ghoshal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/duare-mutation-for-howrah-high-rises/articleshow/83673523.cms||Rupak Banerjee
---||India||Doval, Pakistan NSA may come face-to-face at SCO conclave||NEW DELHI: National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and his Pakistan counterpart Moeed Yusuf are expected to come face to face at a meeting of the SCO NSAs in Tajikistan's Dushanbe on June 22-23. While a "pull aside" isn't ruled out, sources said neither side had proposed any bilateral meeting. Foreign minister S Jaishankar was also in Dushanbe earlier this year with his counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi for a Heart of Asia meeting but there was no bilateral meeting between them. Yusuf was recently elevated to the rank of NSA by Pakistan. While the NSA meeting of the SCO member-states is held every year, the meeting this year will follow reports of backchannel talks between India and Pakistan in the run up to the February agreement to observe ceasefire understanding. The NSA meeting is expected to focus on the situation in Afghanistan where US troops withdrawal and increase in violence by Taliban have created a dangerous situation. Pakistan army chief Qamar Bajwa had been quoted as saying that Doval and ISI chief Faiz Hameed had met in Dubai late last year. UAE was also reported to have mediated between the two countries. India has so far not denied these reports. To allow their respective missions to function smoothly, even as ties remain downgraded, India and Pakistan had this week approved all pending visas for diplomats and other staff members after two years of strife over the issue. Tajikistan will host the NSA meeting as the current chair of SCO. Doval had walked out of the virtual meeting of SCO NSAs last year after Yusuf displayed what India described as a fictitious map of J&K in the background. India sees Pakistan's efforts to bring up the Kashmir issues as a violation of SCO's norms of safeguarding sovereignty of member states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/doval-pakistan-nsa-may-come-face-to-face-at-sco-conclave/articleshow/83679896.cms||---

The park that has been developed by NKDA with the project sanctioned by the New Town Kolkata Green Smart City Corporation, was recently inaugurated by state urban development department minister Chandrima Bhattacharya. “Honorable chief minister had initiated the neem plantation. Residents of New Town will enjoy the benefits of having such a park with neem trees along with a beautiful landscape that has been developed,” Bhattacharya said. Earlier, Hidco had planted thousands of neem saplings in Eco Park. Several neem saplings were also planted at a corner of the present plot but weeds had developed on it. It was then that the officials planned of developing a park dedicated on neem trees. NKDA chairman Debashis Sen said that the chief minister had called for developing neem bonani back in 2015 when neem saplings were planted in Jhargram and Midnapore. “The next year we had initiated a neem bonani project in a temporary manner following which this project was developed, keeping over 100 neem trees.There is a 4-meter-wide jogging track, senior citizens and kids’ corner with as and park and an acupuncture pathway along with a beautiful landscape with neem trees all around,” Sen said. According to the government instructions as for now till July 1, visitors who are vaccinated can enter the park from 6am to 9am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nkda-sets-up-park-with-100-neem-trees-jogging-track/articleshow/83673566.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Pune||With rapid antigen tests, life can go on even during spikes||PUNE: One way to rein in future spikes without stringent lockdown-like curbs is to increase the use of rapid antigen tests (RAT) over RT-PCRs and regular surveillance to isolate and treat symptomatic persons quickly. Twenty members of the experts’ panel formed by the Indian Public Health Association (IPHA) and Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine (IAPSM) in their fourth joint statement upheld these steps. Choosing testing kits should be guided by the objective. When it is to limit the spread of the disease, then rapid antigen test (RAT) should be preferred over RT-PCR. A good testing regime needs to be fast, accurate and reliably identify most contacts of an infected person, the panel said. The future should focus on a balance between preserving lives and livelihoods, they added. “ Challenges that India’s rural, peri-urban and city areas may face must be addressed over the next few months. The tools, techniques, and focus during the initial phases of the pandemic may not be valid now. A substantial increase in RAT uses is needed,” public health expert Sanjay Rai said. He is the national president, IPHA and professor, Centre for Community Medicine at All India Institute of Medical Science, New Delhi. Suneela Garg, former head of the department of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, and president of IAPSM said, “If the objective of testing is to diagnose and treat, then preference should be given to RT-PCR. But, if the objective is to limit the spread of the disease, then RAT should be preferred in the community setting.” The Union government guidelines issued during May this year also called for upscaling the use of RAT. Prior to this, the guidelines had told states to maintain the 70:30 ratio in terms of conducting the RT-PCR / RAT in the overall testing strategy. Both have their benefits. “The sensitivity of RT-PCR is better than RAT, but it requires a centralized laboratory to process the test and is time-consuming. RAT gives results in a few minutes, needs no laboratory and it low-cost and can facilitate higher volume of testing,” public health expert A C Dhariwal, former director of National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi, said . RAT requires 15 to 30 minutes, offers quick detection, opportunity to isolate and treat symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers early for curbing transmission. It was recommended in India for Covid-19 testing in June 2020. However, the test remained limited to containment zones and healthcare settings. “Besides, an acute shortage of testing facilities in rural and peri-urban areas underlines not the need in just increasing the use of RAT, but also continue doing syndromic surveillance to isolate and treat every symptomatic patient through the door-to-door visits. Syndromic management should put focus on making a diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and epidemiologically linked evidence,” clinical epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee. New knowledge about the spread (epidemiology) of the disease and newer tools to control it like vaccines, must be used in a manner so as to make a dent at the population level, rather than individual level, experts have said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/with-rapid-antigen-tests-life-can-go-on-even-during-spikes/articleshow/83675393.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Four private labs adopt Neeri’s Covid testing via gargling samples||NAGPUR: After government agencies, private laboratories have now adopted the technique of collecting RT-PCR samples through gargling, an innovation developed by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri). TOI learns that four laboratories will be using this technology. This includes city’s Rainbow Medinova and Su-Vishwas, and Mumbai’s Hind Labs. Pune’s Mylab Discovery Solutions is planning to implement this technology in their mobile laboratories in different states. Hind Labs also plans to use it at Kolkata and Chennai airports. Earlier, the testing centre at the Regional Police Training School, which is a Nagpur Municipal Corporation-designated sample collection centre for Neeri, first implemented the technology for routine testing which was a first in the country. The Nagpur zilla parishad will also be soon starting its implementation in rural and tribal areas. The collected samples will be sent to the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital and Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Sciences for testing. Now with private laboratories bringing it into use, the technology is expected to bring about a big change in detecting Covid-19, making the process simpler, faster and cost-effective. On directives of the Indian Council of Medical and Research (ICMR), Neeri scientists based in Nagpur are conducting a proficiency exercise and brief training of the lab personnel to ensure smooth transition to the new technique. “We are asking each laboratory to perform the comparative testing between the routinely used swab test and the saline gargle test for 50 cases. The proficiency report is submitted to Neeri for vetting. Upon 100% satisfactory performance in proficiency test, the labs are allowed to go ahead for testing with saline gargle on full scale,” said scientist Krishna Khairnar, who is head at Neeri’s environmental virology cell. As reported by TOI earlier, Neeri has prepared a special buffer medium in which the collected sample is mixed for releasing viral RNA. This eliminates the RNA extraction process which is necessary as in the case with existing testing of samples. The saline gargle sample collection kit developed by Neeri is commercially available with Mumbai’s Hi Media Pvt Laboratories Ltd and Ahmedabad’s Meril Diagnostics. “Both the labs have applied for the approval of manufacturing Neeri’s one-step RNA release buffer. The Drugs Controller General of India is expected to give its nod soon,” added Khairnar. In the gargling method, a person coming for the test is given a wide-mouth conical tube with 5 ml of sterile saline in it. He has to gargle the saline for 15 seconds and then rinse for another 15 seconds. After this, he has to put the liquid back in the tube and shut the lid properly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/4-private-labs-adopt-neeris-covid-testing-via-gargling-samples/articleshow/83675423.cms||Manka Behl
---||Meerut||African catfish farm busted in Uttar Pradesh, 14 quintals of banned ‘invasive’ fish seized||MEERUT: For over two decades, the African catfish, locally known as ‘mangur’, has been banned in India. But it would be hard to tell by the ease with which it can be found. It’s cultivated because it grows fast and needs little effort, and it’s bought because it’s inexpensive. The illegal catfish business is thriving, the latest instance of which yielded 14 quintals in Bulandshahr on Friday. This year alone, about 10 such fish farms have been identified in the state. “We received information that this fish was being farmed and fed carcass and meat. We have seized the school and buried it,” Bulandshahr fishery development officer Neetu Singh said. “The farm belongs to someone called Iqram Ahmad.” In June 2000, the department of animal husbandry and fisheries under the Union ministry of agriculture had banned the rearing of African catfish, or Thai mangur, in the country, formalised under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. In numerous orders to states, over the years, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has reiterated the need to implement this ban. “It highly tolerates adverse water quality conditions and can be raised in high densities resulting in high yields in a short period of time compared to Indian Catfish and other indigenous species,” it said in a 2016 order. “It is the most dangerous freshwater fish, introduced in the country in the ‘90s. It’s predatory. Even a pair in a large pond can destroy every living organism in the pond within no time. It can make local species go extinct,” Dr DV Singh, officer in charge of fisheries and professor of entomology at Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Agriculture University said. “It is also known to have high iron and lead content, which makes it carcinogenic.” The NGT, in its orders, has also flagged the water pollution it causes because of the “decomposed wastes” of cattle it is fed. Yet, the practice continues. “This year alone, we have seized about 10 such consignments,” said Anil Kumar, deputy director of the state department of fisheries. Three of these were in Varanasi (one of which was a 15-tonne consignment), two were in Lucknow and two in Meerut (one of which led to a 10-quintal stash), among others. “It’s a menace. The main reasons it thrives are that the fish can survive on anything, including cheap slaughterhouse waste, and it grows at an amazing rate. It sells cheap and the farms require little maintenance,” Kumar added. An African catfish can grow up to 3-4kg in four months. Even the fast-growing carp takes about 10 months to attain a weight of 5kg. And the African catfish sells for about Rs 80-90 a kg. “People consume it because of its low cost,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/african-catfish-farm-busted-in-up-14-quintals-of-banned-invasive-fish-seizedcheap-fast-growing-easy-to-farm-illegal-practice-thrives-about-10-such-seizures-in-up-this-yr-alone/articleshow/83670712.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Delhi||DMRC makes move to get 48 trains for 3 new corridors||NEW DELHI: Even as it races to complete its first corridor of the Phase-IV project by next year despite setbacks caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has started the process of procuring ‘driverless’ trains for three of the project’s approved corridors. DMRC has floated tenders for design, manufacture, supply, testing, commissioning and training of staff for a total of 288 standard gauge coaches, which will be converted into 48 six-coach trains to be deployed on the three approved corridors of the Phase-IV project. The tender has been divided into two parts, with the Part A for 234 coaches for the Janakpuri West-RK Ashram (28.9 km) and Maujpur-Majlis Park (12.5 km) corridors, which are extensions of the Magenta (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri West) and Pink (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) Lines, respectively. The Part B is for 54 coaches for the standalone Aerocity-Tughlaqabad (20.2 km) corridor, which has been named ‘Silver Line’. Unlike the trains for the other two corridors, the tender for Silver Line would also include comprehensive maintenance up to 15 years for these coaches, apart from design, manufacture, supply, testing, commissioning and training of staff. All the trains will be built for Unattended Train Operation (UTO) operations, commonly known as driverless operations, using state-of-the-art communication-based train control signalling technology. DMRC started the country’s first ever fully automated driverless train service on the Magenta Line on December 28, 2020 with Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagging off the first such train. An essential condition that is part of the tender is that the manufacturer would have to establish facilities either independently or with an Indian partner for local manufacture of coaches in India. DMRC also expects the contractor to make efforts to source a maximum number of equipment and materials from India. Even though work is going on simultaneously on all the three corridors despite the setbacks caused by different waves of Covid-19 in the capital, DMRC is putting in a lot of effort and focus behind the diminutive Majlis Park-Maujpur section, which it plans to start next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dmrc-makes-move-to-get-48-trains-for-3-new-corridors/articleshow/83675443.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Yellow Gate police, which registered an FIR for culpable homicide not amounting to murder on May 20, had mentioned Ballav as an accused. The complaint was by P305’s senior engineer, Mustafizur Shaikh, who is being treated. Seventy-one crew died, while 186 were rescued by Indian warships, INS Kochi and INS Kolkata. Investigators, who recorded statements of dozens of survivors, said at 11.30pm on May 16, the barge began drifting during Cyclone Tautkae. “Ballav made the distress call the next day at 10am,” said a police officer. Many crew jumped into the sea to save their lives. The barge sank by May 17 evening. Even though police have taken blood samples of relatives of some missing/deceased twice, only three could be matched to unidentified bodies on Friday. Sixty-seven bodies have been identified and handed over to families. “We have had seven unidentified bodies with us since last week. We then called parents of missing crew and took blood samples. Earlier, blood samples of brothers and other family members were taken. The second blood report, sent for DNA analysis, matched three bodies and they have been handed over to families. We are sending the remaining four DNA reports to Valsad, where some bodies were found. We will see if DNA samples match with the bodies in Valsad,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-barge-master-sent-msg-they-moved-to-safety/articleshow/83675672.cms||Mateen Hafeez

These sessions will focus on students who are due to appear for NEET/JEE this year. The institutes are going ahead with just these sessions and not full-fledged classes due to the limit on number of students. With a maximum of 20 being allowed inside coaching institutes, many owners say it’s not viable to conduct regular lectures. One of the coaching institute owners told TOI that only if the limit is raised to at least 75 will it make any sense to conduct regular classes. “You can’t have a situation where 20 students are being taught in a classroom while others await their turn to be taught the same topic. Also, we can’t have 20 students in physical mode while the rest join through video call because it would be unfair to them. Parents will be breathing down our neck as to why we did not select their child to be in class,” said an owner. Another coaching class owner said as of now, doubt-clearing sessions are the best alternative. “Every student has a different doubt or query and this is one of the key sessions for every coaching institute. It’s this part which can alone be handled in a one-to-one physical mode. Students who are due to appear for the exams are looking forward to these sessions as it gives them an edge,” the owner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coaching-classes-to-reopen-for-doubt-clearing-sessions/articleshow/83675492.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

In another development on the day, Sri Dev Suman Uttarakhand University issued a circular stating that the exams for the students enrolled in its university and its affiliated colleges will be held in the MCQ (Multiple Choice Questions) format. The exams will be held only for the first year and last year students. Meanwhile, the education department on Saturday received a letter from a group of government teachers which said that they don't have the records of the performance of Class XII students in unit tests and half-yearly exams as these exams never took place in most of the schools in the wake of the pandemic. According to UBSE’s evaluation criteria, the board students will be marked based on their performance in previous tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/probe-ordered-into-irregularities-in-election-on-several-posts-in-uttarakhands-primary-teachers-association/articleshow/83672047.cms||Mohammad Anab

In 2019, the nullah had flooded and damaged properties in various localities. Susmita Shirke, the superintending engineer of the PMC’s sewage and maintenance department, said, “Our endeavour is to complete the work in the next two weeks. Last year, we cleaned mud from the nullah at various locations. However, residents dumped garbage in the nullah in the last few months, so cleaning is required to maintain its natural flow. Otherwise, it will get choked.” On Saturday, PMC started the work in the Fatimanagar and lifted 10 truckloads of mud and garbage. Ajay Jadhav, assistant supervisor of the department, said, “We have roped in two earth movers. The debris and garbage has been dumped at the designated place in the Katraj area.” Amit Kumar, the PCB’s CEO, said, “As the nullah comes under the local military authority, no structure is allowed to be set up without permission. Also, if there is any damage to property, PMC will have to repair it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-starts-cleaning-9km-stretch-of-bhairoba-nullah-in-pcb-limits/articleshow/83673717.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Patna||More power to women in Bihar as 35% of all field posts go to them||PATNA: In yet another move to empower women, the Bihar government has decided to depute women officers on 35% of the field posts of sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), circle officer (CO), block development officer (BDOs) and the station house officer (SHOs) of police stations. All these posts are considered very crucial in the lower rung of administration as these officers play the main role in maintaining law and order, solving day-to-day issues of public, upkeep of land records and execution of most of the development works at block and panchayat levels. The state’s general administration department (GAD) letter sent to the additional chief secretary of revenue and land reforms department on Friday stated, “It was suggested during the review of progress of the different schemes being executed under the ‘Atmanirbhar Bihar Ke Saat Nischay-2’ that the administrative (cadre-controlling) departments concerned must take necessary action to ensure as far as possible the participation of 35% women in transfer and posting of the SDMs, BDOs, circle officers and the SHOs.” GAD’s joint secretary Jai Shankar Prasad, in his letter, has also asked the revenue and land reforms department to send a report by June 22 stating the number of women officers working as circle officers. The department executes transfer and postings of the circle officers. Sources said the GAD has sent a similar letter to DGP and rural development department, seeking a similar report on the number of women officers posted as SHOs and the BDOs, respectively. The transfer and posting of the SDMs are executed by the GAD itself. “The GAD is collecting data because it has to send an integrated report on the number of women officers currently working as the SDMs, circle officers, BDOs and the SHOs, to the Bihar Vikas Mission. The development commissioner is to review the posting of women officers on July 1,” a GAD official told TOI on Saturday. Sources in the GAD said CM Nitish Kumar, during a recent review of the schemes under ‘Atmanirbhar Bihar Ke Saat Nischay-2’ had asked the officials to ensure posting of women officers on 35% posts of field administration. State information and public relations department (IPRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha told TOI that the move will obviously bring a sort of revolution in the state’s governance system. “It will bring a major transformation in favour of the women. It has always been a thrust of the state government, especially our leader Nitish Kumar, to empower women in all fields, be it education, health, administration or panchayati raj bodies. But the posting of women officers on 35% posts will not happen in a day or two. It will take some time,” he said. Earlier, in January 2016, the then Mahagathbandhan government-led by Nitish had decided to reserve 35% posts for women in all state government jobs. Recently, Nitish decided to reserve 33.3% seats for women in admission in all engineering and medical colleges as well as the first proposed sports university of the state. Within months of taking oath as the CM in 2005, Nitish reserved 50% seats for women in the panchayat election in 2006. His move resulted in women capturing half of the 2.6 lakh elected posts in the state three-tier panchayati raj institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/35-of-key-field-officers-to-be-women-in-state/articleshow/83673020.cms||Madan Kumar

Unlike the first edition last week, milk parlours in addition to the medical services will function during this period while the rest are brought under complete shutdown, as a part of the state government’s move to curb the chain of Covid-19 transmission, cases of which are gradually on a downward trend in Jharkhand. Talking to TOI, Ranchi SSP S K Jha said that they are fully prepared to enforce complete lockdown like the last time and added that footfall in market areas will automatically be lesser due to rains and Sunday. As a result, city police have also cut down on the number of check points which they had installed last time. “During the first edition of the weekend lockdown, some 93 check points were identified and put up to block unwanted movement of people. This time, there will be less check points. Our control room is also active which will keep tabs on the city through CCTVs at different intersections. Static and mobile teams have also been briefed on their responsibility,” he said as lockdown began at 5pm. Jha hoped people will continue to behave responsibly. “With tomorrow being Sunday, coupled with rains, we are hoping that people will automatically remain indoors,” he said. Earlier in the day, several parts of the city reported heavy traffic jams. Vehicular snarls returned to haunt commuters in places such as Main Road, Lalpur, Tagore Hill road in Morhabadi among others. “Due to rains, even those who would tend to venture out of homes on two wheelers for buying veggies and fruits, drove in cars. This was the major cause of the rush,” said a DSP rank official in Morhabadi who was on duty at the weekly haat here. On the other hand, businessmen hoped to get further relaxations in the coming weeks. On June 15, the state government extended the ongoing partial lockdown till 24th of this month by allowing all kinds of shops including malls and departmental stores to function till 4pm. However, hotels, banquet halls, buses and few others are yet to be allowed. Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI), the state’s apex trade body, said that they have urged the CM to also allow resumption of those businesses to bail them out from further losses. Kishore Mantri, vice-president of FJCCI said, “We have written a letter to CM Hemant Soren with our demands and hope for positive response when government takes a call on next unlock.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/city-residents-rush-to-stock-up-on-essentials-choke-arterial-roads/articleshow/83674904.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The incident took place in Galhobar panchayat under the Bishnugarh police station area of Hazaribag district and the deceased has been identified as Naimuddin Ansari. Deputy commissioner Aditya Kumar Anand, however, said his death wasn’t caused by the vaccine. “We got the post mortem report today (Saturday) and prima facie it appears that he died from some other ailment,” he said. District civil surgeon Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said, “Although it is true that he died four-and-a-half hours after taking the jab, he was suffering from hypertension and heart ailments. Since this incident was the first of its kind in Hazaribag, we conducted an autopsy as per the DC’s directive and to rule out any doubt, we have sent his viscera to a forensic laboratory in Ranchi for further investigation.” He added, “There were many people who took the jab at the vaccine camp in Galhobar and they all are fine.” The relatives of the deceased have claimed that Ansari was fine on Friday morning and had even gone to the market for shopping. Later in the day, he went for his second dose of the vaccine and died four hours later. Anand said Ansari took his first dose on March 23 and he did not complain of any problems and was fine. “So far, three lakh persons, including senior citizens, have taken the shot in Hazaribag and not a single vaccine-related death has been reported,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/75-yr-old-man-dies-4-hrs-after-taking-vax-in-hbag/articleshow/83674494.cms||Abhijit Sen

The highly contagious variant of the virus was verified after samples were sent to an Odisha-based laboratory for examination, officials said. "We had sent 100 samples to the laboratory and 47 were found to be Delta variant," said Rajan Choudhary, advisor (medical services) Tata Steel. Delta variant has been declared as highly contagious by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and its finding in the state is a concern. Choudhary said two doses of the vaccine available in the country currently, Covaxin and Covishield, is still effective against the variant and give protection to a considerable extent. "Delta variant is believed to show increased transmissibility or detrimental change in epidemiology," Choudhary said, referring to various findings. The official further said the second wave of the pandemic is fast declining in the district. "In TMH, the positive rate has declined to 2.06% from 17.13% a few weeks ago," Choudhary said. He said only one Covid patient is currently admitted to the critical care unit of the hospital while 11 others are undergoing treatment at the Covid ward. Last week, the hospital had 15 Covid cases compared to 12 currently. "The cases have come down but there's no lowering the guard.

In a representation before the officials, the parents said that the school is demanding fees which is more than what was approved by FRC for the year 2019-20. For academic year 2020-21, the state government had further announced a reduction of 25 % fees in the FRC approved fee structure. “But the school management is not ready to accept the FRC and state government’s decision,” parents alleged, adding that those kids whose parents do not approve of such demands face discrimination. “For the past one year, we have approved DEO and FRC but there is no resolution. Now, FRC members have assured us that they will convene a meeting of parents where the principal of school will also remain present. The meeting has been called on Tuesday with the assurance that all the pending issues will be resolved in presence of everybody,” said a parent, Prerna Gupta. Another parent, who did not want to be identified, alleged that the school has created a separate section of children whose parents pay fees as approved by the government. “Home work of such children is not checked, we are also removed from WhatsApp groups,” the aggrieved parent stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/parents-accuse-school-management-of-discrimination/articleshow/83672281.cms||---

The accused were identified as Md Ali from Ranchi and Md Nasim from Chatra district. A CISF crime wing officer on condition of anonymity said, “CISF had received information regarding people moving around the airport to target passengers who have arrived without RT-PCR test reports, which are mandatory for boarding flights. They were mostly targeting workers leaving for their place of job.” A CISF’s personnel pretending to be a passenger approached Ali saying he needed a Covid negative report. Ali took Rs 1,000 from him and assured the report will be provided in half an hour. Even as several CISF personnel were waiting in the vicinity in plain clothes to nab him red-handed, Ali got a hint about their presence and tried to slip away. CISF caught the accused after a short chase. Nasim, who was standing a little away, was also caught as CISF personnel had noticed that whenever Ali made a call from his mobile phone Nasim was picking up his phone. The arrested persons were handed over to the airport police station for further action. Police said the accused persons confessed to their crime during the interrogation which was conducted by senior officials. The accused used to change names and dates in the format of previous RT-PCR reports and give print out to passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/2-held-at-ranchi-airport-for-selling-fake-rt-pcr-negative-reports/articleshow/83674963.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||World||'Never again': Imran on allowing CIA to use Pak bases||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan PM Imran Khan has said the country will "absolutely not" allow the CIA to use bases on its soil for cross-border counter-terrorism missions following the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan. "There is no way we are going to allow any bases, any sort of action from Pakistani territory into Afghanistan," Imran said in an interview to be aired by HBO on Sunday. "Pakistan will not allow the CIA or US special forces to base themselves inside this country ever again." Despite an uneasy relationship with Pakistan, the US had conducted hundreds of drone strikes and cross-border counter-terrorism operations from Pakistani soil since 2004. For nearly a decade, Pakistani authorities had denied allowing the CIA to use its bases. In 2013, however, ex-President Pervez Musharraf admitted giving permission to the CIA to launch drone attacks from bases in his country, breaking the official policy of blanket denial of involvement. Despite rumours and claims by some opposition leaders that Pakistan’s military leadership has tacitly agreed to allow the CIA to base itself in the country again for counter-terrorism operations and intelligence gathering on Afghanistan, observers believe that it would be political suicide for Khan to embrace the presence of the CIA or special forces on his country’s soil. CIA director William Burns did not meet with Imran when he made an unannounced visit to Islamabad last month to meet Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and ISI head Lt Gen Faiz Hamid. Burns's secret visit was aimed at exploring the possibility of counter-terrorism cooperation between the two sides. Earlier this month, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan had claimed that the US had "constructive discussions" with Pakistan about ensuring that Afghanistan would never again become a base from which terrorist groups would attack it. He declined to go into specifics. Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, had testified that the risk of attack on the US would only increase if the Afghanistan government collapsed and the country saw a civil war. Defense secretary Lloyd Austin had told the congress this week that it would take terror groups like al-Qaeda and IS possibly two years to develop the capability to strike the US homeland. Last month, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had said that getting Pakistan on board the peace process in his country would be the pivotal factor to restoration of stability. "The US now plays only a minor role. The question of peace or hostility is now in Pakistani hands," Ghani said, referring to Pakistan military’s deep ties with the Taliban.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/never-again-imran-on-allowing-cia-to-use-pak-bases/articleshow/83679953.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The state government recently approved an eight-lane coastal highway from Bheemili to the proposed Bhogapuram airport to facilitate better regional connectivity and tap into the tourism potential of the area. Two major tourism nodes proposed in the VMRDA draft master plan have been identified along this proposed beach road. One is proposed at the confluence point of river Gosthani (into the sea) at Mullakaddu near Bheemili, while the other would be developed at the confluence point of river Champavati at Konada in Vizianagaram district. Apart from these, two more tourism facility centres have been proposed in the Visakhapatnam industrial zone at Muthayalammapalem and Pedateenarla. The concept plan for the beach corridor between Visakhapatnam and Beemunipatnam has also been integrated in the draft master plan. As per the 2041 draft, the region has vast potential for diverse tourism opportunities. But from the existing situation assessment, it is observed that the tourism potential of the region has remained underutilised. All the proposed tourism nodes are located along the coast and are in the vicinity of existing tourist spots. The master plan also recommends exploration of coastal corridor for tourism and recreational development along with connecting heritage tourism sites falling along the coastline in Visakhapatnam metropolitan region. As part of the master plan, some recreational spaces at urban and neighbourhood levels have been identified as buffer areas for the water bodies. The buffer areas would be developed as parks and urban greens, and used for community recreation. Separate playgrounds and stadiums such as the large sports complex which is under construction in Vizianagaram have been incorporated in the plan. The VMRDA area is also dotted with numerous heritage sites. As part of the master plan for the development area, as many as 160 heritage sites and properties of national, regional, and local importance have been identified. It is proposed to enhance the key heritage sites in a phased manner to promote heritage tourism at these locations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vmrda-draft-master-plan-proposes-4-tourism-nodes/articleshow/83672295.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Investigation revealed that the case was a murder for gain. Police arrested a 26-year-old man, identified as Sheik Imran, for the murder. Vizianagaram police chief B Raja Kumari said that 70-year-old G Shakunthalamma lived in a rented house at Salur in Vizianagaram district.

Assistant engineer Sharad Naik told TOI that the 11KV underground cable got damaged when PWD’s water supply division was excavating mud using heavy machinery to repair a leaking pipeline. The staff of Quepem electricity department rushed to the site to repair the damaged cable, but could not do so it was submerged. The power department later bypassed the underground cable upto the next transformer connecting the overhead 11kv line which was not in use. Power was finally restored at around 7pm. A year ago, Quepem and parts of Ambaulim went powerless for over 36 hours when the main transformer was burnt at Xeldem power station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pwd-damages-underground-cable-snaps-quepem-power-for-4-hours/articleshow/83678024.cms||---

No casualties were reported and the road was later cleared by PWD workers. On receiving information about the dump’s collapse, Sakhali Municipal Council chairperson Raya Parsekar rushed to the site with his staff and helped PWD workers in clearing the road for traffic. Parsekar said the dump may slide onto the road again following heavy rainfall and could pose a risk to road users. “We discussed the matter with Sesa Goa Mine and a steel net will be put in place at the earliest,” Parsekar said. Locals said that such issues need to be taken up immediately by the management of the mining companies and demanded that the dangerous dumps should be removed immediately for public safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mining-dump-collapses-at-sakhali/articleshow/83676218.cms||---
---||Goa||Finally, govt starts to recover money lost to illegal mining||Panaji: The state government has started recovering money from mining companies involved in illegal mining. A senior official said that as per the recovery order, some companies have started paying the amount, but many others are yet to pay up. The payments are based on an order by directorate of mines and geology to recover around Rs 300 crore, based on an audit report submitted by a team of chartered accountants. During the recently-concluded assembly session, Goa Forward Party MLA Vijai Sardesai grilled chief minister Pramod Sawant over the government’s failure over the past nine years to recover losses to the state exchequer due to illegal mining. In October 2020, the department had started the final hearing, based on the audit report, to recover money lost to illegal mining. Earlier, it had evaluated the replies filed by holders of 118 mining leases to the audit report submitted by the team of chartered accountants. In 2015, the state government had appointed 15 chartered accountants to undertake a comprehensive audit of leaseholders and traders of mineral ore in Goa during the past five years, when exports touched peak figures. The accountants had submitted an audit report of 118 mining leases to the mines department. Subsequently, the department analysed the report to ascertain the exact loss to the state owing to illegal mining. The high court of Bombay at Goa had directed the mines department to decide on the showcause notices issued to mining companies for recovery. Goa Foundation had approached the court through a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking directions to the state government to recover Rs 3,431 crore from mining companies within a time-bound period. It had filed the PIL when it became apparent that the government was not pursuing the recovery with zeal. Director of Goa Foundation, Claude Alvares had said that the demand notices worth Rs 1,580 crore were issued in 2016 on the basis of a report by a team of chartered accountants. Notices pursuant to the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) report were issued in 2017 and were worth Rs 1,922 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/finally-govt-starts-to-recover-money-lost-to-illegal-mining/articleshow/83676358.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: After a year, Covid cases drop to single digit in city||NAGPUR: The number of Covid-19 positive cases dropped to single digit (8) in the city after almost a year. In all, the district registered 16 cases on Saturday, the lowest after 361 days. As per the data of district civil surgeon, eight persons were found positive of the 7,493 tests in the city on Saturday. Previously, eight cases were registered on June 22 last year, but tests were only 34 then. From June 23, 2020, onwards, the cases have always been above 10, as per the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). It also meant that the cases were in single digit in the city for the first time since the peak of first wave witnessed in August and September. Test positivity rate (TPR) of the city on Saturday was 0.11%, which was probably the lowest-ever in the 15-month-long pandemic. Of the eight cases, three were from one family residing at Wanjari Nagar and two from one Nara family. The remaining three were from Shahu Nagar, Bhagwan Nagar and Gittikhadan. The 16 cases in the district were the lowest since June 23 last year when the number was 15. TPR of the district was 0.16% on Saturday as 9,809 tests were conducted. The cases from rural areas were seven from 2,316 tests to lodge a TPR of 0.3%. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “It is a big relief for the city as cases dropped below 10 in a day. We are ensuring tracing and testing of all contacts of positive patients. People should follow Covid-19 guidelines and prevent any rise in cases,” he said. Another highlight of the day was that none of 1,574 persons tested under rapid antigen came positive in the district. Joshi said most of those who tested positive are symptomatic persons. “We have maintained satisfactory number of tests by continuing special camps. Also, some people are testing for various reasons like travelling to other states or resuming work at offices etc,” he said. The district had registered highest cases of 7,999 on April 24. On the same day, the city also recorded its highest cases of 5,236. There were no deaths from the city and rural areas for the second consecutive day. The district recorded one fatality and the deceased was a resident of other district. Total 115 patients recovered on Saturday. Recoveries have been more than new cases for 51 consecutive days. Active cases dropped to 1,002 in the district, which were 0.2% of total cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-a-year-covid-cases-drop-to-single-digit-in-city/articleshow/83674614.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The bus was halted near the Valpoi community health centre when the driver noticed smoke emanating from the bus and alerted the commuters. The incident occurred at about 9 am on the KTC bus, which had six passengers aboard at the time. “It was raining when the incident occurred. When the driver noticed the smoke, he asked the passengers to vacate the vehicle. After a few minutes, the bus caught fire due to a short circuit. The passengers had safely alighted, and no one was hurt in the incident,” sources said. Officials at the Valpoi fire services told TOI that they received a call about the bus at about 9.20am following which they immediately rushed to the site with their fire tender and doused the blaze. They said that the cabin was entirely engulfed in flames. KTC chairman Carlos Almedia said that the loss has not been evaluated yet, but that the bus has been sent to the depot for further investigation. Following this incident, Almeida has ordered a check of all operational KTC buses in a bid to avoid any untoward incidents in the future. “All depot managers have been instructed to carry out a check of the wiring of all the buses in their depot,” Almeida said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bus-bursts-into-flames-at-valpoi-no-casualties/articleshow/83676653.cms||---

The Special Operations Group (SOG) of city police conducted raids after receiving information about the operator and verifying it with the laboratory. SOG sleuths was tipped about travel operator Krunal Patel living in Maneja and they contacted the Pathocare Laboratory whose report Patel provided. The laboratory, which has the largest RT-PCR testing capacity locally, checked the details and found the report to be forged. Cops along with lab operator Dr Viral Patel reached Patel’s house from where he operated his travel agency. A search led the police to a computer and three mobile phones along with more forged RT-PCR reports on one of the phones. Patel was arrested in connection with the case. City police had earlier nabbed a travel operator from Warasiya in connection with similar fraud. In both cases, the operators used to take the onus of providing a negative report to facilitate their clients’ travel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/taxi-operator-providing-fake-covid-reports-held/articleshow/83672292.cms||---

The rain gauge station shows that as of June 19, the taluka has received the highest amount of rainfall, so far, with a total of 1033mm. “Pernem is a hilly area and due to its topographical features, when the period of active monsoon arrives, it receives a lot of rain. This is as opposed to the coastal areas in Goa,” India meteorological department (IMD) scientist Rahul M said. “When continuous active spells of monsoon are going on, the topographical features help receive a lot of rainfall in the area,” he added. Valpoi has received the second-highest rainfall this far, with a seasonal total of 899mm followed by Quepem with 815mm of rainfall. Data shared by the IMD reveals that last year, during this time, Pernem received 1031mm, Valpoi received 729mm and Quepem received 724mm of rainfall. The IMD had forecast heavy rainfall at a few places in Goa till June 19. Squally weather with wind speed reaching 40-50kmph gusting to 60kmph are likely to prevail along and off South Maharashtra-Goa coast till June 20, the IMD update states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-2-weeks-pernem-gets-1000mm-rainfall/articleshow/83676808.cms||---

Generally, an immediate blood relative or spouse of recipient (mostly wives) with compatible blood group is preferred for kidney donation. But, it’s rare for a donor of non-compatible blood group to donate kidney. Such rare transplant was successfully conducted in Nagpur three months ago. Archana Gadhikar, headmistress of Bhide Girls High School, donated kidney to her husband Rajesh, a professor. Archana’s blood group is AB while Rajesh’s is B. Typically, this combination of blood groups is considered unsuitable for blood or organ donation. Nephrologist Dr Ashwinikumar Khandekar said that the circumstances made him select this latest treatment option that allows such transplants. “Though this technique is available and mostly successful, there is a risk involved. So, doctors generally prefer a paired exchange programme where two suitable donors swap their recipients. But, it was not possible in this case,” he said. Kidney patients with AB blood group are universal recipients and can get kidney from donor of any blood group. For example, a man with AB blood group can get kidney of his wife even if her blood group is different. Now, with Archana having AB blood group, it would have been difficult to find another couple that would have agreed for a swap. Also, there were 280 names ahead of Rajesh in the waiting list for kidney recipients from cadaveric donation. So, this was also not an option. “My in-laws are not alive and no sibling of my husband was fit enough for donation. So, I decided to go for it. Doctors made us aware of the risks involved. We both agreed and completed the legal formalities,” said Archana. Senior nephrologist Dr Sameer Chaubey had done such transplant two years ago in Nagpur which was successful. This experience proved helpful for Dr Khandekar. The process was conducted during the period when Covid-19 resurgence had just begun, but doctors gave details of the case to TOI only after confirming that both donor and recipient are doing well for a considerably long period. “Covid-19 second wave began right after the surgery and both donor and recipient got infected. It was a tough time as the recipient was on immunosuppressive medication. Still, he managed to recover,” said Dr Khandekar. Archana said they both have returned to their routine. “I am attending school for administrative work. My husband has started online classes. I am happy that he no longer needs to go through painful dialysis thrice a week now,” she said. The Gadhikar couple shared their experience with TOI so that people can know that such facilities are available in Nagpur and change the lives of many kidney patients needing transplant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kidney-transplant-successful-despite-different-blood-groups-covid-infection/articleshow/83674861.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Was there a leopard in city? Was it a ghost?||NAGPUR: Recorded after nine days on camera traps in the midst of claims and counter-claims about its presence close to human settlements in the city, now questions have been raised whether the ‘ghost’ leopard of IT Park had really moved through well-populated parts of the city? Nagpur was abuzz with rumours when the leopard was first sighted on May 28 morning in the bathroom of one Narendra Chakole who resides near IT Park. It then leaped over to his neighbour Kishore Jagtap’s compound in Gayatri Nagar, on the edge of the isolated National Power Training Institute (NPTI). Citing the example of Aarey Colony near the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), Mumbai, wildlife biologist Vidya Athreya says, “Leopards are frequent visitors to Aarey. They also enter residential complexes and housing societies in search of prey but rarely harm humans. Something similar may have happened in Nagpur.” On May 29, the leopard was sighted by an IT company security guard Omprakash Naidu in the wee hours. Its hazy image was also captured by a CCTV camera. “I’ve not seen the animal since then,” recalls Naidu. This was the so-called last evidence about the leopard’s presence. Even as news spread like wildfire, on May 30, around 10.30pm, one Atharva Pande claimed the leopard crossed the road and jumped the walled agriculture field of Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PDKV) in Bajaj Nagar. Though the sequence of events matched the sighting, forest officials are still perplexed. They are not sure whether the leopard really entered the field. At 11pm, Sameer Pisal, the guard on night duty at the PDKV guest house in Bajaj Nagar, too claimed to have seen the leopard preying on a dog outside the guard cabin. “As the leopard pounced on the dog, it ran and collided against the main gate and started barking loudly. When I came out to check, I was shocked to see the leopard. It waited for a few seconds and vanished towards the PDKV VC’s bungalow on the same premises,” says Pisal. Even as a frantic search at the sprawling PDKV area came to a naught, the mystery further deepened when a woman labourer, Ashabai Nikhare, claimed she spotted the leopard on May 31 at 3.20pm on the nullah wall at the edge of the Maharajbagh zoo. “Having worked for 14 years in the zoo, we cannot doubt Nikhare’s identification of the animal,” says Dr Sunil Bawaskar, the officer in charge of the zoo. “Various studies have also shown that leopards frequent areas in the city by avoiding human habitations during the day. Across India, there may be many cities where leopards overcome human habitations every night without any untoward incident,” says Dr Mayukh Chatterjee, head, human-wildlife conflict division, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). “Considering the behaviour of leopards, we too did not discredit the woman worker and hence placed trap cages near the zoo. Though a pig was killed on May 31 night, I’m surprised there was no iota of direct or indirect evidence about the big cat,” says P Kalyan Kumar, CCF, Nagpur. On June 1, even as foresters were busy scanning nullahs and vegetation in nearby areas and attending hoax calls about the sighting of the leopard in Civil Lines near the old high court building and GPO, on June 2, the teams found four pigs that were killed and their flesh consumed in the Ambazari reserve forest on the Pandhrabodi side. This means that the pigs must have been killed on the night of June 1. If the pigs in Ambazari were killed on the night of June 1, then who killed the solo pig near the zoo the same night? “I doubt whether the pig near the zoo nullah was preyed on by the leopard. It seemed to be the handiwork of feral dogs the way the animal was consumed,” says Dr Bharat Singh Hada, deputy conservator. Even wildlife veterinarian Dr Syed Bilal Ali, who worked as a back-up during the drive, says, “It’s hard to believe that there was a leopard in the bathroom of Chakole, who had said that on seeing the beast he came out and that the animal followed him and escaped by stepping on his left foot.” “Can you believe it? It may have been a civet cat as the NPTI premises is a good habitat for civets. It seems to be a case of mistaken identity. Why wasn’t a single pugmark traced between May 28 and June 1, when it was claimed that the animal was moving in the city through muddy patches and nullahs,” counters Dr Bilal. “The pig that was killed near Maharajbagh seems to be the handiwork of stray dogs. Even when the kill was put in trap cages to lure the leopard, two dogs were trapped. They must have entered the cage to feast on their kill,” say foresters. CCF Kumar too admits that all the last three calls from passers-by and citizens received on June 1 were hoaxes. The verification after spot visits and identification of the animal recalled by people resembled a tomcat and a Siberian Husky dog in Civil Lines and a civet cat spotted by a VNIT security guard. “We worked on the first theory of the leopard entering the 758-hectare Ambazari forest. Earlier, on December 5, 2019, a leopard from the Gorewada reserve forest off Katol Road was sighted at the Ambazari Biodiversity Park by a forest labourer. Our fears came true when the leopard was caught on camera on June 6. The big cat was again captured on camera on June 10 and is still in Ambazari. We fear it might become a resident of the biodiversity park,” said Kumar. In the meanwhile, the leopard’s presence will remain a legendary story.

---||India||Covid-19: As crowds swell, AIIMS director warns of early 3rd wave||NEW DELHI: A third wave of Covid-19 is inevitable and could hit the country earlier than expected, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria warned on Saturday. He said it usually takes 4-5 months for a subsequent wave to peak. "But given the way people are crowding in the markets and malls without following any Covid-appropriate behaviour, I feel a third wave may hit earlier, possibly in 12 to 16 weeks," he said. Earlier, while speaking to a TV channel, he had said that it could come as early as 6-8 weeks. He explained that the Delta variant, which is highly transmissible and is supposed to be responsible for the devastating second wave, continues to pose a high risk to a large section of the population that is not vaccinated and hasn't been exposed to the virus yet. "There are also reports of cases due to a Delta plus variant. If we don't follow Covid norms, cases may start rising again," he said. Several countries, including the United States of America and the United Kingdom, are witnessing a rise in Covid-19 cases caused by the Delta variant. The UK, in fact, recently decided to postpone lifting of lockdown restrictions fearing another wave of cases due to the new variant. The highly transmissible variant, first identified in India, now makes up 99% of fresh cases in the United Kingdom, according to news agency PTI. Public Health England (PHE), which has been tracking variants of concern (VOC) on a weekly basis, said its data shows an increased risk of hospitalisation with Delta VOC compared to Alpha, the VOC first detected in the Kent region of England. It also pointed to its previous findings that two doses of a Covid vaccine give a "high degree of protection" against hospitalisation from the Delta variant. India reported its first case of Covid in January last year. Cases of the viral infection peaked in September with nearly one lakh reported in a single day. From the middle of September last year to the first week of February this year, there was a steady decline in cases which reached about 10,000 cases daily. One can say that the second wave started from the second week of February when new cases started increasing steadily once again. It reached a peak in the second half of April, and by April-end the cases had touched about four lakh daily. From May first week, Covid cases have been on the decline. Delhi recorded its biggest single-day jump of over 28,000 cases on April 20. It registered a record 448 deaths on May 3. In the past two weeks, there has been a steady decline in new cases in Delhi as well as in the country following which many states have lifted or eased lockdown restrictions. "Since unlocking has started, we are seeing a huge rush in markets and malls and few people are following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Our vaccine coverage is also low. Together, this may lead to an early onslaught of the third wave in India," an expert said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-as-crowds-swell-aiims-director-warns-of-early-3rd-wave/articleshow/83680051.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Kochi||Kerala: College launches digital laughing library||KOCHI: To capture the joyful moments of students’ college life, which they miss currently due to Covid-induced lockdown restrictions, the Yeldo Mar Baselios College in Kothamangalam has launched a digital laughing library for students on the occasion of World Sauntering Day on Saturday. The library is a digital platform where three-minute long videos capturing joyful moments in the life of each student will be uploaded on the college website. “As the World Sauntering Day falls on the Reading day, everybody forgets the importance of the Sauntering day. As we are all cooped up, joyful moments have a lot of importance in our life, and that’s what we asked students to capture. Besides, students miss their college life dearly nowadays. So, we put forward the idea of asking them to capture joyful moments that can be anything or recreate one and send it to us for editing and uploading on our college website. But one of the characters in the video should be the student. We will upload it to our digital library, and they can watch and reminisce it any time after leaving the college. We will release the selected videos on our YouTube channel,” says Soya Francis, assistant professor, English department. The programme was held in a video making competition mode, ‘Euphoria 2021’. While making the video, students have been asked to follow certain rules, including adhering to Covid-19 protocols. They should not hurt religious, national, personal and social feelings. The winning student will get a cash price of Rs 2,001.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/college-launches-digital-laughing-library/articleshow/83674054.cms||---

---||Goa||BJP’s promise of 10,000 jobs a cruel joke: AAP||Panaji: By repeating the false promise of 10,000 government jobs, the BJP-led government is making a mockery of the struggle faced by unemployed Goans, said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday. AAP convenor Rahul Mhambre said that BJP makes the promise before every election to try and win votes. Mhambre said that BJP made the same promise before the 2017 assembly elections, 2019 assembly bye-elections and before the 2020 zilla panchayat elections. “Chief minister Pramod Sawant’s announcement of 10,000 jobs on the occasion of Revolution Day was the same stale but cruel joke being played on struggling Goan youth by BJP,” said Mhambre. Further, he accused BJP of failure to create even a few hundred government jobs and even those jobs were not given on merit but “sold” to those who could meet the minister’s demands. “Instead of going through the Goa Public Service commission, jobs are given on the basis of private commission,” Mhambre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjps-promise-of-10000-jobs-a-cruel-joke-aap/articleshow/83676934.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: BJP moves into poll mode, chalks out 15-day plan to connect with voters||PANAJI: With Covid-19 cases in the state showing a decline, and aiming at tapping maximum votes at the upcoming 2022 state assembly election, BJP has gone back to the drawing board to chalk out a detailed strategy to create a strong bond between voters and the party karyakartas.  For this, it has worked out a 15-day programme from June 21 to July 6. It will include the likes of yoga day, tree plantation drives, celebration of the birth and death anniversary of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and Mann Ki Baat to connect with the maximum number of people. BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade told TOI that they want BJP workers on the field and that through its programmes, the party wants to connect with people across all 191 village panchayats and 14 municipalities, including the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP). He said that it is too early to discuss forging alliances with any other political party. “We want to win the next assembly election on our own,” Tanavade said. Recently BJP national general secretary (organization) B L Santosh and Goa desk in-charge C T Ravi had asked the party to connect with the people so that it wins the 2022 assembly election with an absolute majority. Political observers said that BJP could be the first political party that has got into election mode, but that the end result would depend on the last-minute political strategy. Meanwhile, as part of its efforts to connect with voters, the party has formed a medical team, headed by Dr Shekhar Salkar, to deal with the situation in the eventuality of a third Covid-19 wave. Further, in each panchayat, two karyakartas - a female and a male - would be trained to help people. “They will be trained to check oxygen levels, temperature and in case a patient require medical help, to take them to the hospital for medical treatment,” Tanavade said He said that every booth will plant at least 10,000 fruit bearing treats in their vicinity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-moves-into-poll-mode-chalks-out-15-day-plan-to-connect-with-voters/articleshow/83677089.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Protesters burn copies of government order||KOCHI: Opposing the government’s Punargeham rehabilitation and housing project for fisher families residing in areas vulnerable to sea erosion, the members of Chellanam Janakeeya Vedi, whose relay hunger strike completed 600 days on Saturday, burned the government order (GO) regarding the project as a protest. The residents boiled milk using the fire by burning the GO copies and shared it among all residents. The ash of the burnt copies was packed in paper boats made out of the GO copies and was immersed in the sea by nearly 50 residents. The residents alleged that the project was an attempt to evict the fishing community from the coastal lands. The project aims to rehabilitate fishermen families living within 50m of the tidal area by giving Rs 10 lakh each for every family, who are willing to relocate from the coast to a safer place. While the government has decided to allot Rs 6 lakh for purchase of land, the remaining Rs 4 lakh will be used for the construction of house. If it is possible to get land for a lesser price then the excess amount will also be invested for the construction of house. V T Sebastian, a patron of the Janakeeya Vedi, said that the project was introduced with the condition that only those people interested in availing the benefits would be asked to relocate and no family would be forced to relocate but now they are facing the threat of eviction. “They said that no family would be forced to relocate. But a GO was issued later stating that those who are unwilling to relocate will not be eligible to get any compensation or financial assistance for losses suffered due to natural calamities. This is forced eviction, which is anti-constitutional. We cannot agree to the project,” Sebastian said. Meanwhile, Care Chellanam, another faction of residents led by the Kerala Region Latin Catholic Council, said that they did not oppose the Punargeham project but could not agree with the compensation policy. “People are ready to relocate if they are provided a compensation according the market price of their land. There are people who own up to 50 cents. Providing the same Rs 10 lakh to those who own three cents and 50 cents would not do justice. The government should give them what they deserve,” said Care Chellanam coordinator Fr John Kandathiparambil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/protesters-burn-copies-of-go/articleshow/83674017.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

On Friday, an argument between the couple, Gunjan and Sachin Kumar, allegedly escalated into a fight and Sachin sustained a deep knife wound in the chest. Gunjan, according to police, claimed they would often have fights because Sachin would be too busy with work and hardly give time to the family. The two have an 11-year-old daughter, who witnessed the incident, and an 8-year-old son, who is believed to have been in another room. Police said Gunjan had claimed she picked up a kitchen knife during the argument and threatened to kill herself, and Sachin had tried to snatch the knife from her when it pierced his chest. Knife accidentally pierced his chest, says techie’s wifeSachin, who worked with an IT firm, and Gunjan, who is employed with an export house,were marriedfor 12 years. The family lives on the ground floor of a two-storeyed house in Sector 7 while Sachin’s younger brother owns the first floor. Neeraj, Sachin’s brother, said he rushed downstairs after hearing the commotion on Friday morning. He told police he saw his brother lying on the ground, blood spurting out from the wound. He took Sachin to a nearby private hospital, from where he was referred to Medanta. He died during treatment there. Neeraj claimed fights over office hours were nothing new for Sachin and Gunjan. Both had been working from home during the pandemic. “Gunjan would often accuse my brother of not giving enough time to the family. They had fights like any other couple. We never took it so seriously,” he added. Gunjan has claimed in her police statement the knife accidentally pierced his chest. Police said they have collected evidence for forensic reports. The couple’s daughter is the sole witness in the case. “There didn’t seem to be any serious issues between them. They would have fights like any other couple,” said Subhash Boken, a spokesperson for Gurugram police. Neeraj has lodged a police complaint, accusing his sisterin-law of killing his brother. “I saw my brother lying on the ground. My niece wouldn’t stop crying,” he added. On the basis of his complaint, a case was registered under Section 302 (murder)of theIPC atNewColony police station. The police said though a preliminary probe pointed to an accidental death, they were scanning the couple’s phones and talking to their children as part of the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/couples-spat-ends-in-gurugram-techies-death/articleshow/83680094.cms||Bagish K Jha

As there is no demand for flowers, they are forced to plough tractors over their blooming plants. The farmers are now seeking compensation from the Haryana government. Recently, two farmers in Ahirka village of Jind district were forced to destroy their standing flower crops this year too. Kuldeep Singh, who grows flowers after taking land on contract and ploughed tractors on 4.5 acre flower crops. In 2020, he did the same in and 6 acres. Whereas Vikram Singh destroyed crop in 2.5 acre this year and five acre last year. Mainly farmers of Ahirka, Amarheri and Haibatpur villages, adjoining Jind city, grow flowers crops at large scale every year and supply it in local markets and national capital as well. Farmers said crops in around 50 acres were destroyed in one village which put them under a debt. Talking to TOI, Sukhdev Singh, a native of Ahirka village and flower grower, said, farmers have been growing seven varieties of flowers in Jind district, like marigold, rose, tuberose and Godavari. These were supplied to marriage and political events mostly. “We used to earn up to Rs 70,000 per acre in a year after bearing all the costs. Flower crops get ready within four to six months thus farmers cultivate two crops a year. I have been growing flower crops for the last 18 years and never faced such loss as now. Other farmers get compensation if their crops are damaged but flower growers are feeling deprived. Farmers of Jind, Karnal, Sonipat, Panipat, and Kurukshetra mainly involved in flower growing who received an estimated loss of over Rs 100 crore during the lockdowns,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/hit-severely-by-lockdowns-flower-growers-seek-compensation-from-govt/articleshow/83680102.cms||Vijender Kumar

Rao said Congress will seek feedback from local party workers and non-political entities regarding the pros and cons of a pre-poll alliance, an understanding with regional parties or fighting the elections alone. “How to defeat BJP is what we need to see. To defeat BJP we can do... everything is possible,” said Rao. “Whether it is an alliance, whether it is an understanding or we go on our own, that is a strategy that we are still working on.” The former Karnataka Congress president refused to give more clarity but said that the party would decide the strategy after considering the ground reality and while also considering the steps taken by BJP ahead of the polls. He said that the earlier norm of announcing candidates at the last minute would not be repeated and that the party would finalise candidates much earlier. Rao is on a four-day visit to Goa and over the last two days he has met heads of frontal organisations, Mahila Congress workers, block presidents and even non-political people. He visited the Santa Cruz, Cumbarjua and Sakhali blocks on Saturday, where he reiterated that the 10 MLAs who claimed to have merged with the BJP would not be taken back. Rao is in Goa in order to oversee the preparations for elections and help rebuild the party. Speculation has been rife that current party president Girish Chodankar will be replaced, but the younger party workers have conveyed their reservations regarding such a step.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-keeps-alliance-option-on-table-for-2022-state-polls/articleshow/83677234.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Rajya Sabha MP and old timer Partap Singh Bajwa's accommodating words at a press conference for his arch foe, chief minister Amarinder Singh, and his view that Sidhu should need to sweat some more to achieve his "colonel to general" ambition appears to reflect more than a personal opinion. Read AlsoPunjab Congress crisis: Amarinder Singh says meeting with panel was pre-poll discussionPunjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh who on Friday appeared before a three-member panel tasked by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, said the meeting was part of internal discussions ahead of assembly polls. As per sources, the agenda of the meeting was to resolve the widening differences between SinghMany view that he was also articulating the stance of younger Congressmen who are opposed to Sidhu getting a big lift because of his rebellion, mirroring the view of CM Singh against whom the mercurial leader unsheathed his sword. The AICC panel, headed by Mallikarjun Kharge and comprising AICC general secretary Harish Rawat and J P Aggarwal, looking into the Punjab problem is working out a formula to marry individual aspirations of leaders with organisational rejuvenation ahead of the February elections. Read AlsoAmarinder Singh-Navjot Singh Sidhu tussle: Congressmen stand dividedEven as Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has openly hit out at his former cabinet colleague Navjot Singh Sidhu, other Congress functionaries continue to speak in different voices, waiting to see how the episode unfolds in the days to come.While leaders like Bajwa who have been sidelined under "Captain" are eager for a settlement, the Punjab unit is teeming with young leaders who are also known to be close to Rahul Gandhi, an association which is also Sidhu's chief asset. While one of them is a former youth Congress president and MLA, another is deputy party leader in Lok Sabha besides a couple of others. The bone of contention is the presidency of the state unit that Sidhu is eyeing. A senior leader claimed that Sidhu can be deputy chief minister or can be given the other sought after post of the chairman of the campaign committee, but nobody is backing him for the top organisational post. This will test the Kharge panel in its final decision though nobody is ruling out anything. A change of state president is likely though, a post presently held by Sunil Jakhar. Sources said the leadership is likely to call key Punjab leaders including CM Singh, Sidhu, Bajwa and Jakhar for a final discussion which may also be attended by party supremo Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. A final formula is likely to be offered to them while also seeking their suggestions. Sources said the meeting may happen as early as the coming week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congresss-old-guard-gennext-come-together-to-thwart-sidhu/articleshow/83680107.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Hybrid work model here to stay: Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani||BENGALURU: Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani said the hybrid workforce model will be the new normal and the dramatic shift to living and working online has altered the business landscape in irrevocable ways. “Hybrid work is here to stay, requiring organisations and their people to find new ways to come together, collaborate and deliver seamlessly,” he said at the 40th annual general meeting of Infosys on Saturday. Nilekani’s words echo the sentiment of Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran, who also voiced support for a hybrid workforce model even as it prepares its employees to get back to office after vaccination. While almost 97% of employees of IT companies continue to work remotely, offices of some of their clients in the US – specially big banks like Goldman and JP Morgan Chase – are slowly opening up. The Infosys co-founder added that unprecedented technology transformation driven by cloud, and digitalisation of business models are shaping the new normal. Companies have found it imperative to undergo a digital transformation, which is often a large exercise both for clients and vendors. That’s why many are sticking to one vendor to help them navigate this complex journey. “Whether it’s the uptick in online demand, mastery over digital demand fulfillment or tackling the threat of cyberattacks, technology has become an urgent and critical business capability,” said Nilekani, adding: “Adjusting to this new reality can be daunting. Companies can no longer afford the long wait for business returns or settle for the sometimes underwhelming outcomes of large transformation projects.” Such projects have helped the company sign multiple large deals with clients. Last fiscal, such deals were worth $14 billion, up from just $3 billion three years ago. “We have expanded our capabilities which resulted in these large deals. One metric is the number of clients where we have revenue of more than $100 million has increased,” CEO Salil Parekh said. To help in this journey, Infosys has reskilled its manpower in the latest technologies and made acquisitions to fill gaps in its portfolio. Infosys launched an initiative called Digital Quotient, which gauges an employee’s digital knowledge and helps it determine an employee's readiness for emerging digital opportunities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hybrid-work-model-here-to-stay-infosys-chairman-nandan-nilekani/articleshow/83680160.cms||---

While an attempt has been made to clear the silt in canals and drains under the Operation Breakthrough, local bodies have begun to feel the strain of the sedimentation, which is blocking water flow. Following a memorandum by residents to the Industries Minister and Kalamassery MLA P Rajeev, irrigation department officials visited the area where the sediment blockage has restricted the water flow into the sea. “We have inspected the area following the instructions from the minister. We will be submitting a report to the minister,” said Sandhya, Executive engineer of the Major Irrigation Department. "We had raised this complaint last year with the district collector who had inspected and directed the officials to clear the silt under the Operation Breakthrough. There's a lot of debris and mud from the Periyar river bed, particularly in the areas between Aluva and the Kochi Corporation. They cleaned their inner canals, but the main river from Aluva to Pachalam has not been cleared," said Santosh Jacob, one of the complainants. The residents have been raising this issue annually because of the sand accumulated on the western side of Vaduthala near the Don Bosco campus. Officials indicated that the main bottleneck has huge sedimentation that would need a major investment under the Disaster Management Act. Locals said that the sediments are part of debris left behind by the construction company which built the railway bridge. Jacob said that officials had informed that they had visited areas downstream from Manjali and found that the river was in a state of stagnation due to the accumulation of silt and other debris in the river and action was being taken to remove it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/periyar-sedimentation-causes-flooding-in-inner-canals/articleshow/83674143.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Gupta said BBMP is not in a position to give any discount. "To address the Covid-19 situation, we hired a lot of people on contract and hired several vehicles too. In this situation, it's impossible to give any discount in property tax," he said. As on May-end, BBMP has collected Rs 1,320 crore in property tax. For 2021-22, BBMP estimates to mop up Rs 3,353. BBMP estimates revenue/funds of Rs 9,286 crore this financial year and 36% comes via property tax. A senior BBMP officer said, "We have pending bills amounting to over Rs 3,000 crore for civic works completed and ongoing works worth Rs 7,000 crore. These liabilities have pushed us to take difficult decisions." BBMP extended tax rebate of 5% on property tax if it's paid in one instalment by June-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-traders-demand-property-tax-relief-bbmp-turns-down-plea/articleshow/83680185.cms||---

The entire exercise, bigger than the 1982 cyclone in the Asiatic lion landscape, is expected to be carried out over the next three to four years. In the 1982 cyclone, an estimated 28.1 lakh trees were uprooted. "We plan to clear the trees that have been uprooted in the cyclone that struck Gujarat in May. As per initial estimates, the number of trees that have been uprooted would be anywhere between 30 lakh and 40 lakh. The damage seems bigger than the 1982 cyclone. We will do an extensive survey to assess the exact damage and will prepare a plan on how to clear the areas," said Dushyant Vasavada, chief conservator of forests (Junagadh wildlife circle). He said that the fallen trees will be cut down, wherever necessary and stacked in a safe place inside the sanctuary till necessary clearances are availed about the future course of action from the state and national wildlife boards in line with the Supreme Court directives. Why Gir lions prefer open forest?Many lion experts and wildlife lovers are of the view that due to better protection, the forests of Gir are becoming dense and turning into non-typical lion habitats, as lions are believed to prefer open forests or savanna-type habitats. The state forest department had in 2015 included thinning of the Gir sanctuary in its forest management plan. The department had begun work in this direction a few years ago but had to discontinue it in 2019 due to Covid-19. The felling of trees by Cyclone Tauktae could be a blessing in disguise for lions, as it will open up spaces and the fallen trees will offer easy access to food to herbivores including the deer population, an important prey base for lions. The lion is a species of open scrub in flat forests, preferring dry deciduous to the thorny scrub and savannah woodland, the management plan states. “Conservation of key protected areas with the lion as the key species is one of the prime objectives of the plan. Looking to the dynamic and uncertain nature of the complex system, it seems desirable to put in the idea of habitat manipulation in favour of the lion,” the management plan states, which suggests conducting trials and research initially. Observations indicating greater use of dense forest by lions appear to be based on the lion’s habit to seek cool and shady riverine zones for rest during the daytime in summer, it said. Initial habitat condition and use pattern will be recorded properly before and after thinning and changes will be recorded in a prescribed proforma, the 2015 plan states. “If the trees that are lying in the jungle and blocking paths of the lions are not cleared, there is a possibility of more lions venturing outside the sanctuary,” said a forest official. An estimated 30-40 lakh trees were uprooted in the recent cyclone. The overall increase in the population of the Asiatic lion from 2010 to 2015 was 27% but that within the Gir protected areas it was only 3%. “Outside the protected areas the satellite population increased by 97%. The population of herbivores increased by 51% in five years, which shows that the habitat is suitable for herbivores. Therefore, habitat intervention and manipulation is required to increase the carrying capacity of the Asiatic lion in Gir protected areas and for subsequent control of herbivores for future management,” according to a 2018 research paper by A P Singh, additional principal chief conservator of forests, monitoring and evaluation. The increase in population of herbivores and the lion population which has more or less stabilized in the Gir sanctuary from the past many years could be a strong indicator that Asiatic lions prefer open spaces, said a retired forest official. Many trees that have fallen due to the cyclone are likely to regenerate and the forest department may allow these trees to remain in their present condition, not touching them at all. “After the 1982 cyclone, the forest department cleared about two-thirds of the uprooted trees and this time too, a similar view can be expected,” said a forester who is an expert on lions. According to the latest census held in 2019, Gujarat is home to 674 lions. Of these, about 350 are in the Gir sanctuary, spread over 1,412 square kilometers and the others are outside it. The sanctuary includes 258 sq km of Gir National Park. “Lions do survive in a range of habitat types. They mostly prefer open areas. I do know that the central part of Gir is quite dense and also has undulating terrain. The impact of the cyclone should not only be seen as uprooted trees and clearing or “thinning” of habitat. The overall ecological impact has to be clearly understood. Lion is just the top of this pyramid. We have to look all the way down. The response has to be studied and guided by forestry management experts. Definitely, some proactive action has to be taken,” said Meena Venkatraman, a wildlife biologist who is doing research on Asiatic lions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-mega-clean-up-op-to-remove-30-40-lakh-fallen-trees-in-gir-forest/articleshow/83680158.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Kolkata||Cong-Left truck for civic polls ‘uncertain’, hints Adhir||Kolkata: Pradesh Congress president Adhir Chowdhury has indicated that he is “uncertain” about an alliance with the Left Front for the upcoming civic polls. “I am not saying that the alliance with the Left is over. But, I neither vouch for an alliance at local-level polls,” he said on Saturday. Chowdhury minced no words to say that the Indian Secular Front (ISF) had come in the way of Congress-Left ties. “The Congress had no alliance with the ISF, which is why the outfit fielded candidates against us in Murshidabad. We wanted a transparent alliance with the Left, but that didn’t happen,” he said, putting a question mark on the future of Sanjukta Morcha. Pradesh Congress leaders were not keen on having any seat adjustment with the ISF from the very outset. Chowdhury was opposed to making way for the ISF in Murshidabad and Malda, where Congress support among the minorities was depleting. The cold war between the Congress and the ISF found vent at the first public meeting of the Sanjukta Morcha at Brigade Parade Ground in February, when Congress’ Lok Sabha leader Chowdhury had to stop his speech as CPM leaders Biman Bose and Mohammad Selim got busy welcoming ISF leader Abbas Siddique to the dais. The CPM, on the other hand, is not in a mood to exclude any member of the Morcha — be it the Congress or the ISF or other Left Front partners. CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra, at a party committee meeting a few weeks ago, categorically mentioned that CPM would not ask any Morcha member to leave. “However, if any party wants to leave the alliance on its own, it is free to do so,” he had said. The Left Front is also facing problems within over its Morcha partners. Forward Bloc wants the CPM to dump its “crutches” (read Congress and ISF) and carve out a poll strategy with only Left parties. Bloc state secretary Naren Chatterjee has already written to Left Front chairman Biman Bose on the matter. Some Pradesh Congress leaders too have written to AICC chief Sonia Gandhi to put an end to this “unnatural” alliance with the Left, especially when the parties come from “different ideological clans” and have fought against each other for decades in Bengal and Kerala. Others do not see any “justification” in continuing an alliance that was rejected by the people in the 2021 Bengal assembly polls. Political observers believe that the fate of the Congress-Left alliance depends on developments at the all-India level ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. In the meantime, the Congress wants to work independently at local polls and try to improve its vote share from 2.9% before it can go for a seat bargain with any party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cong-left-truck-for-civic-polls-uncertain-hints-adhir/articleshow/83675481.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Debjani gets bail in Bengal Saradha cases after 8 years||Kolkata: “Bail is still the rule and jail is the exception during or before trial,” the Calcutta High Court said on Saturday while granting bail to Debjani Mukherjee, who is in prison since her April 2013 arrest in the multi-crore Saradha Ponzi scam. “Personal liberty is sacrosanct and a person, even an accused, cannot be kept incarcerated except for compelling reasons,” the court said. The CBI had opposed the bail plea. The three-page judgment by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Arijit Banerjee came after advocate Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee moved court against Mukherjee’s continued incarceration for eight years, with the CBI already submitting a charge sheet. The HC said, “It is not in dispute that the charge sheet was filed on October 22, 2014,” adding it meant that the probe was complete. It added that the “CBI has not been able to satisfy us as” to why Mukherjee needed to be imprisoned further. “The trial has not started and nobody can say with any certainty when it will start. It does not appear that the trial will conclude within a measurable distance of time. It will indeed be a travesty of justice to keep the petitioner confined in jail any further if after the trial the petitioner is ultimately found to be innocent. It is also not the case of CBI that the petitioner did not cooperate in the process of investigation. There is no allegation that she is likely to tamper with evidence,” the court observed. The HC then granted Mukherjee bail on a Rs 2 lakh bond with two sureties and asked her not to leave the police station area where she stayed except to attend court. She was asked to meet the CBI investigating officer once every week and deposit her passport. The HC directed her “not make any attempt to contact any of the prosecution witnesses and shall not tamper with evidence in any manner whatsoever”. Chatterjee, however, said Mukherjee, who is now in Dum Dum Central Correctional Home, was unlikely to be released as there are cases pending against her in courts in Bhubaneswar and Guwahati. “She has now got bail in all cases against her in Bengal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/debjani-gets-bail-in-bengal-saradha-cases-after-8-years/articleshow/83675465.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

The latter’s condition is critical. Ram Murmu (30), of Memul village under Salboni police station, reportedly picked up a bow and arrows lying in their hutment and shot at his family in a fit of rage. Mother Lakkhirani (55) was struck in the back while an arrow hit sister-in-law Sonali (19) in the abdomen. On hearing the women’s screams, neighbours rushed to their hut and took them to the local Salboni rural hospital. From there, the two were shifted to Midnapore Medical College and Hospital. The arrows will have to be extracted through surgeries, doctors said. Lakkhirani’s daughter Panmoni Murmu said: “My brother has had mental health issues for a long time. He was treated for his illness in the past. He would keep to himself most of the time. We don’t know what came over him.” Ram has been detained at Salboni police station. Police said they were waiting for a formal complaint to be lodged and would act accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/youth-shoots-arrows-at-mom-sis-in-law/articleshow/83675668.cms||Sujoy Khanra

AGVKS has demanded action on representation made by Savli MLA Ketan Inamdar, who is also an office-bearer in the union, against the alleged mismanagement. The union has threatened that it will begin its protest with dharna programme and sloganeering on June 26 for an hour and all its members will go on mass casual leave in the second stage of the protest. The association alleged that two years ago, poor quality safety shoes were purchased at the cost of Rs 12 lakh. After complaints regarding the poor quality, the safety shoes were discarded as scrap but no action was taken against the officer responsible for placing order for such inferior quality shoes. Similarly, no action has been taken against officials responsible for clearing fake overtime bills of line staff, illegal outsourcing bills even as non-performers are given better postings and promotions if they are near to the top brass of the state-run power distribution company. The association also alleged that the purchase policy of the Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited is being wrongly interpreted, vehicles are running without any contract, resulting in loss worth lakhs of rupees even as field staff are not getting any benefits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/employees-union-alleges-corruption-in-mgvcl-threatens-stir/articleshow/83672303.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Villagers, admin tussle over land in Khunti village||RANCHI: The Munda tribe-dominated Khunti district that remained in the limelight for the Pathalgarhi movement and consequent police action in 2018-19 is once again attracting eyeballs in the wake of an “encroachment” by the district administration and protest by villagers. According to the Tilma gram sabha, the district administration and the police have “encroached” upon their Sarna Sthal (sacred place for tribal worship) and preventing the villagers from offering their worship. On Thursday afternoon, a large number of security personnel prevented the villagers from protesting in the area and threatened to take action if they continued to protest. The gram sabha, on the other hand, has written a letter to chief minister Hemant Soren seeking restoration of their rights guaranteed under the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act 1996. The Act gives the tribal community right over land and empowers the gram sabha to make decisions about any government project in their command area. The letter sent to the chief minister by the gram sabha said it had denied permission to the police for construction or camping of police personnel. In the letter, the pradhan of Tilma village, Birsa Munda, said no procedures were followed under Section 24 of Land Acquisition Act 2013 for acquiring the land measuring 0.58 decimal marked as plot number 1456. “It was on February 28 that during a football match in the village, a large contingent of security forces came along with local administration officials to encroach over the land by levelling it with JCB machines and erecting a fence,” the letter reads. The residents have also handed over another appeal to the SDO with the signature of over 100 villagers reminding the administration of the mandatory consent needed from the gram sabha for any construction project that has not been carried out without acquiring land. One of the villagers, Nandaram, said they already have a police station in Maranghada, hardly 7 km from Tilma. “The villagers do not require a police camp or a police station and the gram sabha has not raised any demand So, there is no point to take the land forcibly to set up a camp or a police station, about which we have not been taken into confidence,” he said. Stating that the villagers were not allowed to perform puja at the Sarna Sthal, Nandaram said the fencing has been made over a barren piece of land. “The administration has not acquired the Sarna Sthal completely but they have encroached the open land where the villagers carry out other rituals like animal sacrifice,” he added. Tilma and Turup are among the two villages where Pathalgarhi — the tribal movement of setting up stone tablets to assert their rights over land and forest as guaranteed under the PESA Act — was not carried out. Deputy commissioner (Khunti) Shashi Ranjan did not answer TOI’s calls or text messages, the SP of the district, Asutosh Shekhar, said the land was acquired by the administration and handed over to police. “The plot on which the police station is being constructed does not include any Sarna Sthal. An adjacent plot is the Sarna Sthal but the villagers wanted to carry out rituals inside the fencing. Hence, they were stopped,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/villagers-admin-tussle-over-land-in-khunti-village/articleshow/83673904.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: BJP submits letter to Speaker seeking Mukul Roy’s disqualification||KOLKATA: Bengal BJP’s legislative wing on Friday submitted a letter to the assembly Speaker’s office urging disqualification of Krishnanagar Uttar MLA Mukul Roy, who re-joined Trinamool Congress after winning the assembly polls on a BJP ticket. BJP MLA Manoj Tigga submitted leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari’s letter at the receiving section at 11am. Speaker Biman Banerjee said he was yet to receive it. Under the anti-defection law, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha, mentioned as the presiding officer, will examine the application and hear out the alleged defector before taking a decision. Initially, the decision of the Speaker was not subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court in 1992 struck down that condition. Bengal BJP leaders also cited a recent apex court order relating to the Manipur assembly in which the SC gave a four-week time-frame to the Speaker to arrive at a decision on defection. Adhikari took up the issue from the day Roy joined TMC, presumably to keep the BJP flock together and stop future defections. The other reason for the LoP pursuing the case dates back to 2016 when the Speaker appointed Manas Bhunia, a Congress member who defected to Trinamool, as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. The Speaker set aside pleas by Congress against Bhunia’s appointment and strong objections from then opposition leader Abdul Mannan. According to BJP sources, Adhikari made the defection plea against Roy to avert a similar situation. BJP Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta posted on Twitter: “Last week, Mukul Roy joined AITC in presence of chief minister Mamata Banerjee. There was no ambiguity over his defection. Politics will take its course, but law demands that he resign as MLA elected on BJP symbol.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-submits-letter-to-speaker-seeking-mukuls-disqualification/articleshow/83652387.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Many Lakshwadeep islands may be extinct by 2035: IIT Kharagpur study||KOLKATA: In the next 14 years, many islands in the Lakshwadweep archipelago may be lost forever thanks to a steady rise in the sea level, according to a study by ocean engineering scientists of IIT Kharagpur. The article, published in the current issue of international magazine Elsevier (Regional Studies in Marine Science), has been posted by the Department of Science and Technology on its website. The study highlights the importance of moving the population to the safest island of the group to prevent loss of lives. The study said while it had been indicated that the sea level at the 36 islands would rise between .8 mm to 2m by the end of the century, in most islands it had already reached the .78 mm mark. “We have projected 70%-80 % land loss due in many islands by 2035. There are many small islands in the archipelago that will be reduced to a strip almost. The worst-affected will be Chatlat island, where land loss will be over 82%,” said Prasad K Bhaskaran, a faculty member of IIT Kgp’s ocean engineering and naval architecture department, who was the principal investigator of the project. The study has found that capital Kavaratti will be 70% affected. Deep signs of damage have also been noticed at the islands’ lone airport in the southernmost tip of Agatti, which has started getting dangerously inundated. “We have suggested that the government take up immediate coastline protection measures by creating artificial barriers and embankments, especially in the Bipra, Minicoy, Kalpeni, Kavaratti, Agatti, Kiltan, Chatlat, Kadmat and Amini islands, to save them from extinction. Since Androth has been projected to be the safest with only a 30% loss to its landmass, the population can be moved there,” Bhaskaran said. The study mentions that the rise is much higher in the Arabian Sea than the Bay of Bengal because the latter’s salinity is lower because of many fresh water rivers opening into it. Hence, Lakshwadweep islands are at a great risk compared to India’s other archipelago, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/many-lakshwadeep-islands-may-be-extinct-by-2035-iit-kgp-study/articleshow/83675574.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Fortunately there was no derailment or injury to any passenger as the section is on permanent speed restriction due to the topography of the area. As per reports, a landslide occurred due to incessant rains for the last several days and a boulder came on the tracks around 5.17am but by that time the New Delhi-Ranchi Rajdhani special had already reached there and one of the small boulders hit the engine after which the driver stopped the train. New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani special and Ghajipur City-Kolkata express special running behind the Ranchi Rajdhani remained stranded for nearly three hours due to the incident. According to senior divisional commercial manager, Dhanbad, AK Pandey, “Dhanbad DRM Ashish Bansal who was on board the Sealdah-Rajdhani and the first senior officials to reach the spot to get the tracks cleared under his guidance.” “The rail staff keeps a track on loose boulders flanking the tracks and removes them during summer days,” he said, adding that continuous rains for the last seven days might have loosened a portion of the flanks of this rocky terrain which may have caused the incident. The DRM has constituted a committee under the supervision of senior divisional safety officer and senior divisional engineer (coordination) to identify vulnerable locations and suggest safety measures within a week, he informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/loose-boulder-hits-ranchi-bound-rajdhani-express-alert-driver-averts-major-accident/articleshow/83673951.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

DVC’s chief engineer Satyabrata Banerjee said the Bengal government had asked that not more than 40,000 cusecs of water be released. So 24,000 cusecs were released from Maithon Dam and 14,000 cusecs from Panchet dam. From Sikatia barrage, 18,000 cusecs of water were released. Durgapur barrage was discharging around 50,000 cusecs at 2pm. The move by DVC caused panic in Udaynaryanur and Amta areas, as the water level in the Damodar, Mudeswari and Rupnarayan rivers got higher. Howrah DM Mukta Arya on Saturday held a meeting at Udaynarayanpur, where Howrah Rural SP Soumya Roy was also present, in which officials discussed how to tackle the situation. The DM told engineers to increase the embankment height with sandbags and asked for 12 flood centres to be kept ready. An elderly couple died at Ram Chak area in Khejuri, East Midnapore, on Friday night as their mud house collapsed due to heavy rain. Panchanan Mondal (70) and his wife Lalibala Mondal (65) were declared dead when taken to hospital. Their son Kush, who is disabled, is in a serious condition. Though rain continued in East and West Burdwan, the intensity reduced. West Burdwan DM Bibhu Goyel went to the control room and took stock of the situation. Manoj Kumar Das (56), a private security guard and resident of Kulti, was swept away by a river on Friday. The body of engineering student Iftikar Alam (22), who went missing in the Garui river on Friday, was found near Kalipahari. In East Burdwan, the irrigation department has started repairing the embankment at Guskara. The main road in Burdwan town was blocked as a tree was uprooted near Curzon gate. The executive engineer of Burdwan municipality, Amit Kumar Guha, managed to have it removed quickly. In Ausgram area, BDO Arindam Mukherjee said 30 hectares of crop and a concrete bridge at Baburbandh had been damaged. Ghatal town was flooded as the Shikabati river overflowed, said Ghatal SDO Souvik Chatterjee. Several families were rescued from Mansukha gram panchayat area and taken to shelters. People were asked not to go fishing. Some areas of Arambagh municipality in Hooghly remained under water. Several hundreds took shelter at Kalipur, where police supplied them with food. Locals demanded immediate repair of the sluice gate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dams-release-water-flood-fears-rise-in-bengal-districts/articleshow/83675844.cms||Rupak Banerjee

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Teen kills family, hides bodies in basement for four months||MALDA: A 19-year-old school dropout, with an unhinged fetish for gadgets, drugged and drowned four of his family members following a property dispute, buried their bodies in the basement and told neighbours for four months that his grandmother, parents and sister were away in Kolkata. The grisly murders, executed in Malda’s Kaliachak on February 28, came to light only after the teenager’s elder brother walked into a police station on Friday. The accused, Asif, was taken into custody based on the statement of his brother Arif who claimed to have escaped his clutches that fateful night. Following Asif’s interrogation, the heavily decomposed bodies of his parents Jawad Ali (53) and Ira Biwi (36), sister Rima (16) and grandmother Alek Nur Bewa (73) were recovered from their house in 16 Mile village on Saturday. They have been sent for autopsy. Police are also probing if Asif has any terror links, as a large cache of arms and ammunition have been found on his friends Sabir Ali and Mafooz Alam. Asif, who went missing from home for two years before the pandemic, reportedly skipped mentioning about his friends during questioning. Preliminary investigation suggests that Asif wanted his father to will the entire property in his name so that he could lavish money on electronic gadgets, but the old man refused. Police have seized Asif’s laptop, a purchase he made before the incident. The search history shows several videos on how to plan a murder. Police are probing why it took Arif so long to report the murders. A Class XI dropout, Asif would often demand money from his father to buy expensive gadgets, a relative told police, adding that he became abusive once his father refused to give him the property. According to Arif, the teenager spiked the family’s soft drinks with sleeping pills on February 28. He then tied their hands and taped their mouths. Arif claimed the effect of the drugs wore off and he escaped while Asif drowned the others in a water reservoir. It is not immediately clear why Arif did not try to save his family instead of running away. The bodies were dumped into the basement and buried under a mound of soil and bricks. Asif continued to live in the house alone and ordered food from outside. Interestingly, police had detained Asif within days of the murders, but for a fight with a neighbour whom he would not let enter his house. The teenager was let off with a warning back then. Relatives recalled that Asif would not allow them to visit either, saying the family was away and that he needed his space. On Saturday, after his arrest, Asif led police to his house where the bodies were dug up in the presence of a magistrate. “We have recovered the bodies along with a bottle of soft drink. The decomposed corpses still had their hands tied and mouths taped. We have also found around Rs 1 lakh from Asif’s room apart from his gadgets,” Malda SP Alok Rajoria said, adding that Arif’s role was under lens. Minister of state Sabina Yeasmin visited the crime scene and asked police to unravel “the truth”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/teen-kills-family-hides-bodies-in-basement-for-4-months/articleshow/83675655.cms||Subhro Maitra

In between, he would take breaks to feed his newborn son a bottle of formula milk, burp him and put him to sleep. Bharat and his wife Manju were over the moon when she conceived after 11 years of married life through IVF treatment. The couple often dreamt of sharing the task of bringing up their precious baby. Not even once did Sharma think he will have to double up as both a mother and father for his baby, Ramansh, who was born on Ram Navami on April 21. His wife succumbed to Covid-19 on April 29 during the second wave. "Manju just saw the baby's picture and flashed me a victory sign. Then her condition worsened, was put on ventilator but she did not survive. Being the best father to my son is the only mission of my life. I will ensure I also shower Manju's share of love on him," says Bharat, his voice breaking down. He says he is blessed to belong to a joint family. "It will be a sombre father's day for many families like the Sharma's where pregnant women succumbed to Covid-19 leaving fathers with the sole responsibility of bringing up newborns," says Dr Manish Banker, who treated Sharma couples with IVF. Devdutt Taviyad, serving in the ITI in Santrampur, Mahisagar is another father struggling to come to terms with the grief of losing his wife Daksha who died of Covid-19 complications days after giving birth to a son. Fertility specialist Dr Falguni Bavishi said the couple was expecting a child after 23 years of married life. Daksha delivered a baby boy on May 19 and succumbed to Covid complications of pancreatitis on May 30. "I navigate through grief daily but pull myself together to raise my son. I am learning how to know when he is hungry, feed him well and change his nappies. Currently I am staying with my brother and bhabhi to pick up the basics of child rearing," says Devdutt. . In Nadiad, Nitin Sodha, 49, spends his day in the hospital where his newborn daughter is admitted after being prematurely delivered at 1.7 kgs. "The couple had got pregnant after 35 years of marriage and were all hopes and dreams of bringing a bundle of joy in their lives, '' says fertility specialist Dr Nayana Patel. But Nitin says it would be his biggest regret that his daughter would never see or meet her mother Jassi. "I can cry rivers but I have resolved to be strong for my daughter. It is my life's mission as a father to see that my girl survives and lives to fulfill her mother's dreams," says Nitin. "God will give me strength to live and work some more for our girl," added Nitin who works as a mason on contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-dads-made-single-by-covid-tend-to-babies-and-grief/articleshow/83680180.cms||Radha Sharma

Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh distanced himself from the comment, saying it was not the party’s “official” view. Barla said he would plead with the state government and the Centre to accept his demand. “As many as 1,000 tea garden workers in the district have left the gardens seeking jobs outside, leaving behind their families. There is no development in the gardens. I know that the state government has little to do in this regard. Yet, I will try to convince the state government and take my demand to the Centre if that can bolster development in north Bengal,” he said. TMC senior Partha Chatterjee and Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy came down heavily on the BJP, calling the demand an effort to divide Bengal. “No dearth of venom-spitting under the reign of BJP. Learn from your lessons in May that this doesn’t work with the people of Bengal! John Barla, you and your friends at Bengal BJP should not embarrass yourselves again!” Chatterjee posted on Twitter. Roy wanted the BJP brass to come clear on Barla’s demand. “There are demands for smaller states in Maharashtra and Modi’s own Gujarat. Some people in Maharashtra are demanding a new Konkan state, merging parts of Maharashtra and Goa. There is also a demand for creating a Vidarbha state out of Maharashtra. In Modi’s Gujarat, there is a demand for Saurashtra state. The BJP should come clear on these demands along with Barla’s demand to divide Bengal,” Roy said. Ghosh said: “It is not the BJP’s official stand. What the Alipurduar MP has said is his own view. The administration is not listening to MLAs and MPs. This might have prompted some of them to make such a demand. Our priority is to restore democracy in Bengal,” he added. Pradesh Congress president Adhir Chowdhury held that the BJP was into “narrow politics” to disturb peace in Bengal. “This is a nefarious design to divide Bengal once again and put people of Bengal in peril,” he said. Political observers felt BJP was trying to play to “local sentiments” before some other forces appropriated the cause as was seen in the Kamtapur or Gorkhaland movements in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-mp-raises-n-bengal-statehood-call-again/articleshow/83675670.cms||---

Speaking at a press conference here, Sudhakaran denied all charges levelled against him by the CM, including the allegation that the Congress leader had long ago hatched a plot to kidnap his children. "He alleged that I had planned to kidnap his children. To begin with, would anyone who faces such a threat read out of from a prepared statement or consult notes? He said that it was one of my late friends and a financier who told him about the kidnap plan. Then, why doesn't Pinarayi Vijayan reveal my late friend's name and address. Why didn't he lodge a complaint with the police," Sudhakaran asked. "It is for the first time that a chief minister in Kerala has responded in such a rude manner. Now, you can see the real Pinarayi Vijayan, the person behind the PR mask," Sudhakaran said. The KPCC president also challenged the chief minister, if he had "spine", to probe all allegations that he had levelled against him - allegations like having connections with foreign exchange smuggling mafia. Sudhakaran alleged that it is Vijayan who has links to the "foreign exchange smuggling mafia". "It is not me who had foreign exchange dealings. It is under the leadership of CM Pinarayi Vijayan that foreign exchange was smuggled. It was committed by Swapna Suresh who was the right hand of the CM,"Sudhakaran claimed. Not been named as accused in any murder case: SudhakaranIt is from Vijayan that bullets had been seized. Who is part of mafia, Vijayan who carried bullets or me who never had a gun,” KPCC president Sudhakaran asked. Sudhakaran said that he had not been named as accused in any murder case. “Vijayan was the first accused in the murder of Jana Sangham worker Vadikkal Ramakrishnan. Vijayan attacked Ramakrishnan with a sword,” Sudhakaran claimed. “Pettundayi Babu was his (Vijayan’s) bodyguard for 20 years. Both of them split following a petty issue. Vijayan sent goons and killed Pettundayi Babu,” Sudhakaran alleged. Kandoth Gopi, a Congress leader from Kannur who accompanied the KPCC chief during the press conference, alleged that Vijayan hacked him using a sword following a labour dispute in Dinesh Beedi Society. Gopi was the secretary of National Beedi and Cigar Workers Federation when the incident occurred in 1977. Though the police collected his statement, they didn’t frame an FIR in the case due to the pressure exerted by Vijayan, Gopi alleged. Sudhakaran said that some of the remarks he made during an interview with a local magazine were off the record. “Despite giving his word that such remarks will not be published, the reporter published it. I had no intention to say such things. It was the reporter who asked about it. I just made a few amendments to it,” Sudhakaran said while referring to the remarks in the interview that he had kicked Vijayan during a clash in Brennen College in 1967. “If Vijayan is trying to cover up corruption charges levelled against his government by making a controversy using my interview, it won’t work,” the KPPC chief added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/k-sudhakaran-rubbishes-charges-dares-kerala-chief-minister-pinarayi-vijayan-to-walk-the-talk/articleshow/83680179.cms||---

Consequently, the share of deaths of patients under 50 increased, accounting for 24% of the overall fatalities recorded in the state from April 1 to June 16. Before this year's surge, the share was about 18%. But not all numbers are grim. A detailed analysis by STOI showed that the case fatality rate (CFR) in multiple age groups was lower during the second wave than earlier. In the said April-June period, Karnataka reported 20,837 Covid deaths across age groups as against 12,459 seen between March 2020 to March 2021. A total of 4,996 patients aged below 50 died in the second wave compared to 2,249 earlier. Fatalities in this age group are expected to increase with every wave, given that the majority of Karnataka's, and India's, population falls under this category. Experts say strategies must be drawn up keeping this fact in mind. "The increase in deaths in this category must be viewed in the context of the massive surge in cases. Many people had not been exposed to the virus earlier and had not been vaccinated when the second wave erupted. Also, most deaths would be in the 40-plus age category, where there could be some latent and some diagnosed comorbidities," said Dr S Sachidananda, the head of the Karnataka Covid clinical committee. In the 0-9 years group, only one out of every 1,700 positive cases died during the second wave compared to one out of 988 earlier - the CFR was 50 percentage points lower. In the 10-19 group, one out of 3,765 died compared to one of over 1,400 earlier (71 percentage points lower). The trend was similar for patients aged between 20 and 29: one fatality per 947 cases as against one per 907 cases before. But it was the opposite for patients in the 30-50 years category. The 50-69 years category also saw a higher death rate, while the 70-89 group saw a marginal decline in the rate. The rate remained constant among patients aged above 90. "As we prepare for the next wave, the focus is clearly on the younger population, especially those under the age of 20. The government has already set up a committee and strategies are being prepared to tackle the pandemic," Dr Sachidananda said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/covid-19-wave-ii-in-karnataka-24-of-fatalities-were-under-50-patients/articleshow/83680251.cms||Chethan Kumar

Chief minister M K Stalin will make an announcement on Sunday morning. Stalin held a meeting with health experts and officials to review the situation on Saturday. “Lockdown will be extended for a week since the government is concerned about certain districts clocking positivity rate of 10% or more. Though there was discussion on further relaxation of lockdown norms, no decision has been taken. Announcement will be made on Sunday morning,” said an official. The state is also cautious about the possibility of a third wave. “We have reached a lull phase in the second wave, but after seeing at least seven cases with new Delta plus variant, experts project a possible third wave in many states in the next two to four weeks. Some of these infected patients had taken both their vaccine doses,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. Govt wary of permitting major activities “We have reasons to believe TN will be no different if people don’t follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” health secretary J Radhakrishnan said. The health and revenue and disaster management departments are engaged in fine-tuning the relaxations based on experts’ views. The government seems to be wary of permitting major activities that would allow crowding and infection spread, sources said. There could be some changes in the e-registration process, said an official. As of now, emergency travel for medical reasons and funeral — between districts and states — is permitted with e-pass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-lockdown-may-be-extended-more-relaxations-likely/articleshow/83680208.cms||Julie Mariappan

The Tiruvarur police arrested all the four within hours of the incident. According to police, the victim, Tamilarasan of Koodur Bazaar, was the owner of the commercial complex which housed the State Bank of India ATM. Around 1.30am, the gang stormed into the ATM and tried to break open the machine to take the cash. On hearing the noise, Tamilarasan rushed to the spot. He saw what the gang was up to and tried to prevent them. However, he was stabbed on the chest with a screw driver which left him dead on the spot. Locals caught culprit, handed him over to copsThe gang members, identified as P Vijay, R Madhan and A Akash, all aged 19, and K Prathap, 18, fled the scene soon after. Police said Akash was caught by the local people and handed over to the police while the three others escaped. Acting on information, superintendent of police V R Srinivasan formed special teams to nab them and intensified vehicle checks. According to police, the three were nabbed when they tried to escape on a two-wheeler and dashed against the sluice at Vadakattalai. As they got their legs injured in the process, police admitted the three to government medical college hospital while Akash was arrested. They will be produced before a magistrate at the hospital and remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tamil-nadu-man-tries-to-stop-burglary-at-atm-gang-stabs-him-to-death/articleshow/83680239.cms||---

Greater Chennai Corporation runs 281 schools — 119 primary, 92 middle, 38 senior and 32 higher secondary schools. In the academic year 2019-20, 18,605 students in Classes IXI enrolled in GCC schools. Of them, 6,533 were from government-aided and private schools. In 2020-21, after the pandemic set in, the enrolment in corporation schools increased to 27,843 — a 33% jump from the previous year. The year also saw a huge increase in the number of students leaving government-aided and private schools for the GCC-run schools with 14,763 of such students enrolling. This was more than double the number of students made the switch the previous year. Civic officials expect high enrolment figures in the current academic year (2021-22) too. While admissions began on June 14, around 7,000 students have already enrolled in corporation schools. “Admissions to the schools will be open till December due to the pandemic, we expect enrolment to exceed last year’s figures,” said R Bharatidasan, educational officer of GCC. Corporation officials see good infrastructure and amenities as one of the two major reasons behind the higher enrolment. “The improved facilities in the schools have caught the attention of people. Our infrastructure matches that of private schools. Proper drinking water, grounds and good toilets are available. The quality of English medium education is also high,” a civic official said. The second reason is that its a ripple effect of the pandemic. The pandemic has pushed many families into poverty due to job losses and bankruptcy due to mounting medical bills. “Due to this, many families are unable to afford private education and enroll their kids in corporation schools,” the official explained, adding that GCC will continue to scale up facilities in its schools further. The civic body has initiated transformation of at least 70 schools with modern teaching equipment and better sports facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kids-switching-to-chennai-corporation-schools-doubled-since-pandemic-began/articleshow/83680258.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar
---||Chandigarh||Ladakh standoff: Defining reality check||One year after the Ladakh stand-off, it is axiomatic to take stock, analyse shortcomings and options to chart the way forward. Unfortunately, major focus is skewed in favour of Galwan and Kailash, bordering largely on self-adulation. There is concurrent need to learn appropriate lessons and apply correctives. It will be fair to admit that the Chinese leveraged the pandemic to surprise us. There were enough indicators of build-up and brewing storm, yet we failed to synthesise the complete picture and infer PLA’s intentions. While it is normal to blame agencies and commanders but the overriding reason was that the Chinese lulled us into believing that they would follow stipulated agreements and CBMs. With an elaborate set of protocols and stability since 1988, kinetic operations were certainly most unlikely, yet risk mitigation has to be catered for. PLA leveraged a deadly cocktail of deceit and diversionary transgressions at Naqu La (Sikkim), coupled with our total compliance to norms. Exploiting the raging pandemic was a classic application of the Chinese proverb, "loot the house on fire." In the process, understanding and protocols on border management have been rendered meaningless and replaced with dangerous mistrust. The debate on Chinese objectives can only be answered by CCP and may never be conclusively resolved. The same opacity norms apply to information on trigger for Galwan incident and PLA casualties. It is fair to surmise that it was possibly a coercive action, limited to Ladakh, to grab strategically important territory up to the 1959 claim line. Forces were arrayed in broadcast mode, backed up with "triple warfare," replete with hype, on technological asymmetry. PLA neither mobilised nor has the stomach for a full-fledged offensive. Surprised by the Indian resolve and response, China settled for an unresolved stalemate with localised gains short of the 1959 claim line. Strategically, it is a far cry from decisive victory, even amounting to a loss of sorts. Key takeaways are, first - at tactical level, audacious initiative and spontaneous reactions at Galwan. Second - at operational level, pre-emptive and surprise occupation of Kailash heights and subtle leveraging of Tibetan (SFF) card. Third- strategically, induction and sustenance of dissuasive force levels. They in effect, reined PLA’s vaulting ambitions. Despite the much-touted surveillance system, PLA was literally foxed, only because they never imagined transition of defensive Indians, to offensive QPQ. Have they unlocked new challenges; mistrust and resurgence at ground level? China is reportedly transiting from a roving style of border management to a fixed form. The earlier system of basing troops at bases in depth and launching patrols was economical in numbers, health and logistics. Choice of location and frequency of transgressions heightened unpredictability. Like they say, mountains eat troops. Does the current switch indicate insecurity? Will China have to revisit conventional strategic construct, outlined by American sinologist, Taylor Fravel and dedicate enhanced effort to the south-western front, besides the Pacific? While China has delivered a message on asymmetry over India in CNP, for India, it has also highlighted utility and limitations of multi-lateral groupings like Quad. In fact, it has emboldened Philippines and other South China Sea littorals, to discover their back bone against the Dragon. Its implications are likely to manifest in the long term, provided alliances solidify and with commitment. Much more damage to our standing has been done by the second wave of Covid-19, particularly the Delta mutant. Concurrently, BRI and CPEC seem to have also hit the Covid road block. Build Back Better World (BBBW), US and west anchored connectivity and infrastructure initiative is likely to provide more acceptable and less predatory alternatives. In essence, Ladakh is the watershed moment of self-realisation. Chinese seek to keep the border unsettled and are in no hurry to resolve it. Downgrading of talks to Major Generals, euphemistically described as functional level, is part of Chinese filibustering. They also seek to delink the border from other issues, especially trade. It is appropriate that the government is staying the course to retain focus on border resolution. In the interim, there is a need to promulgate agreed on buffer zones, even if they curtail patrolling. It will be prudent to inject pragmatism in this debate and settle for existing realities, especially with multiple claim lines, relics of colonial legacy. It will be sensible to cut out rhetorical statements like-reclaiming Aksai- Chin, at least till we build capabilities. We have to concede that the Chinese are currently in a different league. Relative asymmetry has to be addressed with a multi-pronged, long-term strategy. With our current reliance on Chinese manufacturing and trade imbalance, immediate de-coupling and Atam Nirbhar are exercises in emotive motivation. Indians need to be prepared to make sacrifices. It has jolted a large pool of trusting and aspirational Indian millennials, making them aware of the assertive and deceitful Dragon. Belated attempts by Xi to reorient ‘wolf warrior’ diplomacy is unlikely to redress significant erosion in soft-power. There has been great clamour for disruptive technologies, yet PLA couldn’t operationalise them, propaganda on microwave weapons and drone swarms notwithstanding. While we need to invest in these, we shouldn’t give up on kinetic options. The way forward is to follow ‘firm-base to firm- base’ approach. Belated rebalancing to Northern borders with additional Corps is indeed very welcome. ITBP should be placed under the Army’s operational control and Empowered to inject stability and free Army units for QPQ and offensive defence. It may also be a good idea to conduct a Kargil type interim review under a group of experts. Maritime and hybrid warfare are viable options to keep the Dragon in check. The former requires considerable investment and the latter is an option, if the Chinese force us.

Jakhar’s statement follows five cabinet ministers objecting to the proposal to give jobs to sons of two party MLAs on compassionate grounds on Friday. Opposition parties AAP and SAD too have been questioning the decision. Urging chief minister Amarinder Singh to rescind the appointments in public interest, Jakhar said certain elected representatives tending to their own families did not deserve the same consideration, as it was due to those who make the supreme sacrifice for the nation. “Captain Amarinder Singh must reverse the ill-advised decision,” Jakhar said, cautioning against potential charges of nepotism.The decision is also in my view, the state party chief said, against the ethos and culture of neutrality followed by the chief minister and the Congress party as a whole. Jakhar said the decision had overshadowed several key announcements made by cabinet on Friday, including the implementation of the pay commission recommendations and the regularisation of sanitation workers. He said the party had also failed to highlight benefits of proemployee decisions which it had taken despite severe financial crunch. MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring said the government should listen to the sentiments of people, if lots of unemployed are airing for jobs then the jobs should not be given to sons of MLAs and the MLAs should decline the jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amid-outcry-jakhar-says-reconsider-jobs-given-to-2-cong-mlas-sons/articleshow/83679283.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Cannot allow sacrifice to go waste, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh defends move||CHANDIGARH: Defending his government’s decision to give jobs to sons of two MLAs, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday said it was a recognition of the sacrifices made by their grandfathers, who laid down their lives for the country. Interacting informally with mediapersons outside the residence of Milkha Singh, where he had gone to pay his last respects to the legendary athlete, the chief minister said those who make a sacrifice for the nation can, and should, never be forgotten. Their families deserve to be compensated for the loss, he added. Taking a dig at the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which have criticised the government’s move, the chief minister said if these parties provide names of any youth whose father/grandfathers have made similar sacrifices for the nation, they will also be provided jobs in the state government. Captain Amarinder said he had tried to find such persons in these parties, but could find none. He was responding to a question on the decision to give government jobs to Arjun Partap Singh Bajwa, son of Qadian MLA Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa, as inspector (Group B) in Punjab Police, and Bhisham Pandey, son of Ludhiana MLA Rakesh Pandey, as naib tehsildar. The names of Bajwa and Pandey were cleared by the state cabinet yesterday. Asserting that he would give jobs to anyone coming from a family that had made similar sacrifices, he pointed out that Punjab had been through tough times in the dark days of terrorism, when 35,000 innocent lives had been lost to senseless violence. As many as 1,700 police personnel had also died, he recalled, adding that it was not sufficient to pay tributes to these people at their memorials, and the state needed to do something more to compensate their families. “We cannot allow their sacrifices to go waste,” said the chief minister, adding that Punjab salutes those who have shed blood for the country, and his government will continue to recognise their contribution to the state’s peace and harmony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cannot-allow-sacrifice-to-go-waste-cm-defends-move/articleshow/83679291.cms||---

Prabhmeet Sarkaria got elevation from associate minister and two others, Parm Gill and Nina Tangri, got entry into the cabinet. Parm Gill, who was born in Moga, got the ministerial berth only a day after attaining the age of 47 years. He was born in Moga on June 17, 1974 and was elected as minister on June 18, 2021.

Earlier, he was associate minister of small business and red tape reduction in the Doug Ford government. Nina Tangri, who represents Mississauga Streetsville riding, has been made associate minister of small business and red tape reduction, a position previously held by Prabmeet Sarkaria. Earlier, she held the post of parliamentary assistant to minister of economic development, job creation and trade. Brampton resident of Punjabi origin, Sukhdev Singh said, “as the Punjabi community has considerable presence in Brampton and Mississauga in Toronto Metropolitan area in Ontario province, it seems that Punjabis have been given ministerial seats eyeing the vote of diaspora in the next elections, to be held before June 2, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/punjabi-origin-canadians-get-ministerial-seats-in-ontario/articleshow/83679293.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chennai||Chennai may have a hot noon, rainy dusk on Sunday||CHENNAI: After a sweltering day, some parts of the city and its suburbs received rain and strong wind on Saturday. Showers are likely to continue on Sunday as IMD has forecast convective rain for 24 hours. A forecast by IMD for the city said, “The sky condition is likely to be partly cloudy. Light rain is likely to occur in some areas.” However, a cloudy sky and light rain will not bring down the temperature. The IMD forecast says the maximum temperature will be 37°C and minimum temperature 28°C. The hot day is likely to trigger rain in the evening. On Saturday, Nungambakkam recorded 16mm rain and Madhavaram recorded 2mm rain. It also rained for a brief while at Aminjikarai, Anna Nagar, Virugambakkam, Perambur, Nanganallur and a few other places in the evening. Live weather tracking sites showed clouds over northern and southern suburbs but the sky was clear over the central and coastal areas of the city at night. Private weather bloggers said in their posts that there was a possibility of early morning rain on Sunday but it may not continue on Monday. A Met department official said the rain on Saturday was due to convective action, where heating up of the land causes hot air to rise up, cool and condense, often triggering rain. “The daytime temperature on Saturday was around 38°C. This caused the land to heat up and cause convective action. There is a likelihood of rain in the evening or night on Sunday due to convection,” he added. The influence of southwest monsoon may cause rain in the Nilgiris, Coimbatore and ghat areas in the coming days. On Saturday, Valparai recorded 7mm rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-may-have-a-hot-noon-rainy-dusk-on-sunday/articleshow/83680300.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||SAD asks guv to dismiss Capt govt for ‘purchasing loyalty of MLAs’||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday urged Punjab governor V P Singh Badnore to take suo moto notice of the manner in which chief minister Amarinder Singh was “purchasing the loyalty of Congress legislators to save his chair by doling out jobs to their wards illegally” and immediately dismiss the Congress government. The SAD leaders also asked the youth “whose rights had been usurped” by Congress leaders to gherao the chief minister and ministers to demand jobs for deserving and meritorious students. Addressing a press conference, SAD’s Bikram Singh Majithia and Daljit Singh Cheema said the governor should take note of the manner in which the state cabinet had “legalised corruption” by doling out jobs to sons of Congressmen on compassionate grounds “even though they were not eligible for these jobs”. In case the governor did not take action in the matter, the President should take note of the unconstitutional appointments and dismiss the Amarinder-led government immediately, they demanded. The SAD-BSP alliance would quash all illegal appointments made on compassionate grounds and also register cases against those responsible for the wrongdoing, the party declared. Majithia said it was condemnable that Amarinder had taken a holy oath to provide jobs to each and every household and even got forms filled by the youth in this regard. “However, jobs have only given to ‘crorepati’ Congressmen be it the family of former chief minister Beant Singh whose grandson was recruited as a DSP, wards of Congress MLAs Fateh Jang Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey who have been appointed as inspector and naib tehsildar and son-in-law of cabinet minister Gurpreet Kangar who was given out of turn appointment as an assistant excise and taxation officer.” MLAs’ sons were not qualified for the jobs even on the basis of financial need also, they said. “Bajwa has filed an affidavit pegging his worth at Rs 35 crore, even though it’s actually much more. Similarly, Pandey is a six-time legislator and earns lakhs of rupees in pension alone,” Cheema added. Even cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa had given a statement saying that Bajwa’s son rides a car worth Rs 3 crore, he said. In direct contrast, the government had refused to give government jobs as promised to kin of 2,000 farmer suicide victims, 500 ‘Kisan Andolan martyrs’ or even para Olympians, the party alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-asks-guv-to-dismiss-capt-govt-for-purchasing-loyalty-of-mlas/articleshow/83679296.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Sixth pay panel recommendations a cruel joke, say Punjab veterinary officers||CHANDIGARH: Punjab State Veterinary Officers Association has rejected implementation of the sixth pay commission report saying that the state government has played a cruel joke by reducing non-practice allowance (NPA) of veterinarians, medicos, Ayurveda and homeopathic doctors and delinking it to be part of pay for all purposes. The association held a meeting in Mohali on Saturday under the chairmanship of Dr Sarabjit Singh Randhawa to discuss the implementation of the pay commission recommendations. Dr Randhawa said doctors and technocrats had played a crucial role during the ongoing Covid pandemic, even at the risk of their lives. He added that veterinarians and medicos had been granted NPA due to their long duration of study and late entry to service, which was considered part of pay for all purposes, including pensionary benefits. Dr Randhawa urged the Punjab government to restore the NPA as 25% of the basic pay and to let it remain a part of pay for all purposes. Meanwhile, Senior Vets Association also slammed the Punjab government for reducing NPA to 20% and delinking it to be part of salary for calculation of other allowances and pensionary benefits. Dr Gurinder Singh Walia, retired joint director and member of Punjab State Veterinary Council, said that leave encashment, pension and gratuity of vets would be reduced. He quipped that this was “perhaps a parting gift by the Punjab government to employees.” Akali dal hits out at state government:The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday said the Congress government in Punjab had defrauded its employees by merely announcing implementation of the 6th pay commission, but leaving its delivery to the next government. SAD spokesperson N K Sharma said it was shocking that the Congress government was taking credit for the implementation of the pay commission which was due in 2017. He said even after delaying release of the pay commission recommendations for four years, the Congress government had staggered release of the benefits to employees till 2025. “Staggering the release of dues till 2025 does not make any sense as the next pay commission will be due in 2026,” said Sharma, demanding total dues of Rs 13,800 crore be released to employees immediately. The SAD leader said clerical staff and police personnel were the most affected. He said benefits extended to employees by the SAD government’s committee in 2011 which redressed grievances of employees vis-a-vis the 2007 pay commission had been taken back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vets-object-to-6th-pay-panel-recommendations-over-reduced-npas/articleshow/83679299.cms||---

The health department, which has been preparing for a surge in cases, continued to equip hospitals with beds, oxygen tanks and concentrators. “We don’t want a third wave but scientists are predicting a possible outbreak in a few weeks. We don’t want to drop the guard,” said health minister Ma Subramanian after inaugurating an oxygen generation plant at Saidapet Government Hospital. The plant came as a donation from a private firm based on a request from Chepauk MLA Udayanidhi Stalin. “We plan to install similar tanks in more hospitals,” he said. Later in the evening, 50 more oxygen generators were donated to the ESI hospital in Ayanavaram. To protect vulnerable populations from getting infected, the state is planning to home deliver medicines to people with comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, the minister said. Fresh cases in all districts barring Coimbatore dropped below 1,000 on Saturday. While Coimbatore reported 1,014 cases, its neighbour Erode recorded 933 cases and Salem 533 cases. The remaining districts reported fewer than 500 cases. Chennai reported 468 new cases, Trichy 262 and Madurai 145. Ten districts reported fewer than 100 cases.

Kallakurichi, Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram and Sivaganga reported no deaths. By Saturday morning, the state had reported 2,383 cases of “black fungus” disease. “Early diagnosis and therapy have helped more than a 100 people recover. The state has adequate amounts of medicine to treat the viral infection,” Subramanian said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-registers-8100-more-covid-cases-180-deaths/articleshow/83680309.cms||---

But what Shantilal Parmar (61) from Godhra was actually collecting was going to be a treasure one day. Parmar, a retired talati with the Panchmahal district administration, was always looking for empty matchboxes thrown on the roadside. He developed interest in phillumeny about 35 years ago and has not looked back since then.“Today I have a collection of matchbox labels, matchboxes, match sticks and related items from across the globe. I have matchboxes on different topics too,” said Parmar. Parmar pointed out that while he used to collect used matchboxes discarded by others initially, he later started exchanging these with people like him from other parts of the country. He asked people travelling to other countries and those settled there to bring him matchboxes. “I even have a good collection of matchboxes provided by hotels in various parts of the world,” he said.While his government job was not high-flying, his hobby ensured that he got to meet prominent persons and was invited by senior officials to hold exhibitions. “I have held exhibitions on different occasions including government programmes,” he said. During such events, he met senior officials and politicians. He also got a chance to interact with former President APJ Abdul Kalam. Parmar says that his collection now includes 25,000 to 27,000 items related to matchboxes. “I got connected to groups and even traders later. Some of the rare items I have were also purchased,” he said. A highlight of his collection is the matchbox labels manufactured between 1937 to 1945.After matchboxes, Parmar grew curious about postal stamps and currency notes and started collecting them too. He even participated in exhibitions for postal stamps, coins and notes. “I have Indian currency of all denominations from different periods,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/someones-trash-was-gold-for-this-matchbox-collector-from-godhra/articleshow/83671645.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||India||Will phase out MiG-21s in 3 years, induct Rafales by 2022: IAF chief||HYDERABAD: The phasing out of MiG-21 fighter jets, which have been involved in several accidents over the years, will happen over the next two to three years, Air chief marshal R K S Bhadauria said on Saturday. He added that this would pave the way for the induction of the 36 Rafale jets by 2022, and then the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) would be added. Speaking at the combined graduation parade at the Air Force Academy in Dundigal, Bhadauria said that mere ageing of aircraft doesn't make them accident-prone. "Discontinuation of flying the MiG-21 immediately is not the answer. In another 2-3 years they will be phased out as soon as they get to their life's end. Our plan to induct 36 Rafales is on target. Once the Rafales are inducted, the focus will be on the induction of the LCA over the next three-and-a-half years," Bhaduaria said. He added that the country is focusing on indigenous projects, such as the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA) for the IAF and Navy. "The AMCA will be indigenously produced by DRDO in collaboration with industry. A decision in this regard has been taken in principle," he said. In addition, Airbus 320-based airborne warning aircraft and follow-up on Embraer aircraft will take place,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-phase-out-mig-21s-in-3-years-induct-rafales-by-2022-iaf-chief/articleshow/83680332.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal among top 10 most livable state capitals||BHOPAL: The lakeside scenery, tree-lined roads and gentle pace of life made you feel so, and now there’s another survey to prove it – life is a breeze in Bhopal. The City of Lakes ranks seventh among the most liveable state capitals in CSE’s latest report, State of India’s Environment 2021. The fingings are not too far off from last year’s Union government’s ‘ease of living’ ranking. The CSE survey reiterates two main things – citizen perception of the city is very high, but economic ability or availability is a downer. In the Union government 2020 ranking, Bhopal was placed 19th, with an overall ease of living score of 56.26. The aggregate score in latest report for Bhopal is the same. Both calculated the score on five benchmarks: ease of living, quality of life, economic availability, sustainability and citizen perception survey. Economic availability for both surveys have a near identical score of 14 for the Madhya Pradesh capital. Bengaluru and Delhi are way ahead on the benchmark with 78 and 50 (out of 100). Bengaluru was also the most livable city in Union government findings. Bhopal Citizen Forum (BCF) member, Harish Bhawnani, said, “Bhopal, as a city, is spread out and very livable. In the recent past, Bhopal Municipal Corporation has been active when it comes to cleanliness drive. However, economic activity in terms of employment has to improve. Also, new Bhopal needs decent government-run healthcare, like Hamidia Hospital. The need was felt most during the Covid-19 surge.” ‘Bhopalis perception of city very high’While Indian cities have expanded rapidly, essential municipal services and economic and other opportunities have failed to keep up, finds the CSE analysis. “Livelihood opportunities and sufficiency of income to maintain quality of life, have a bearing on the environment too. The city needs a plan which would make for sustainable economic activity and secure the environment for future generations,” said fashion designer Mumtaz Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-among-top-10-most-livable-state-capitals/articleshow/83680360.cms||---

Haseja told TOI, "Masina hospital had organised a special vaccination drive especially for lawyers and anyone of their relatives at the Mumbai high court and thus, me and my lawyer sister Monica had enrolled." "We reached the mentioned destination on Friday for the vaccination. However, when I told the doctors about my allergy, they advised me not to take Covishield and take some other vaccine. So I returned home, but surprisingly, I received a confirmation message and a certificate that said, I was vaccinated with the first dose of Covishield," said Haseja. Haseja has written to Masina Hospital authority demanding them to cancel the first dose certificate issued to him, as he will not be able to get his shot anywhere else. "I am worried that if my registered mobile number and Aadhar card will show that I have already got my first dose, I will not be able to get any other vaccine in future." Haseja has complained to hospital management, but there has been no reply yet.

Police who arrived on the scene were moved when they saw the child’s name emblazoned in bold on the rear windscreen of the Tata Safari. The family lives in Bhavisya Nidhi Colony. They were getting ready for an outing in the afternoon when the child, Shreedhi, playfully moved to the rear of the vehicle and came under the tyres, ASP Prashant Choubey said. Shreedhi’s paternal uncle, 26-year-old Anshul Upadhyay, was reversing down the driveway and failed to see the child, said the ASP. Neither did anyone else. Shreedhi was taken to a nearby hospital, but couldn’t be saved. The SUV is owned by her father, Rahul Upadhyay, 30, an employee with the PF department. “The toddler could not be saved. The death was recorded and the body handed over to the family members after autopsy. We are investigating it,” said Choubey. The family is in shock and were unable to give any statement to the investigators. Police are consulting law experts to decide the next course of action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/toddler-dies-under-suv-being-reversed-by-uncle-in-indore/articleshow/83680384.cms||---

Family members discovered the horrific scene on Saturday morning, and complained to the authorities. The body had been left on a stretcher all night. Asked why it wasn’t kept in a freezer, Dr Bharat Bajpai, forensic officer at Indore district hospital, said: “This is not relevant in case of district hospital because in almost all cases, the family members take the body from the mortuary within hours.” ‘There were marks of being eaten up on face and fingers’Dr Bharat Bajpai said, “There is no deep freezer in the district hospital. The only one at the mortuary had become dysfunctional around a decade back.” The body was that of an alleged suicide victim, Ramlal Panchal, 41, who died at a private hospital late Thursday night while being treated for poisoning. Since it was a medicolegal case, an autopsy had to be conducted, and the body was kept in the morgue. Dr Bajpai said, “The body was put on a stretcher in the mortuary for autopsy after he died in the wee hours of Saturday.” When Panchal’s family arrived in the morning, they were horrified to see blood on the sheet that covered the body. On uncovering it, they found bite marks. There were marks of being “eaten up” on the face and the fingers of the right hand, said Dr Bajpai. It was recorded in the police file as it was a police case, he added. It’s all the more shocking since Indore is considered the medical hub of the state. Indore hospitals handle around 800 autopsies a year. There were at least three such incidents in mortuaries of MY Hospital last year. After the horrors of last year, the authorities had promised to double morgue capacity in a “couple of months”, but it’s yet to come true||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/rats-gnaw-body-at-indore-district-hospital-morgue/articleshow/83680421.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Campaign launched in Pb to ban tree felling for 10 years, mails being sent to CM||Bathinda: A campaign has been launched by environmental activists to ban the axing of trees for 10 years in Punjab. Under the campaign, ‘Rukh Maru Manukh Maru’ (if tree dies, human being dies), activists, religious and social organisations are being asked to send emails to chief minister. It has been said Punjab is almost at the bottom when it comes to forest cover, with only 3.67%. The forest cover is direly needed to be increased and for it axing of trees need to be strictly stopped, said the campaigners. One of the campaigners and Aam Aadmi Party MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan has decided to bring private member bill in state assembly to implement the ban. Environmental activists Gurpreet Singh Chandbhaja, Hari Chand Arora, Jaskirat Singh, Kapil Dev and Kultar Singh Sandhwan have decided to approach environmentalists Sant Babir Singh Seechewal, Sant Sewa Singh Khadoor Sahib, Bibi Inderjit Kaur of Pingalwara to support the movement. “Punjab has lost a very large number of fully grown trees in the last few years, especially in the non forest areas. The trees are still being axed mindlessly in lots of places, sometimes just to sell timber. This is not just a huge loss for environment, tree cover, birds, animals and humanity, it is a crime against future generations and against the accepted principle of intergenerational equity. This tendency needs to be curbed at the earliest with iron hand. People have learnt the importance of oxygen during these painful Covid times. If we continue going down this disastrous path we will soon meet the disaster. Green cover and trees are already so less in Punjab that we are at the bottom of the national rankings with Haryana,” said the activists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/campaign-launched-in-pb-to-ban-tree-felling-for-10-years-mails-being-sent-to-cm/articleshow/83677688.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Gurgaon||Illegal cuts on NH-8 stretch to be closed||Gurgaon: In order to reduce instances of traffic congestion and accidents, all illegal cuts between Dharuhera and Kherki Daula toll plaza on the Delhi-Jaipur expressway, also known as NH-8, will be closed. In a virtual meeting held earlier this week, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the traffic police deliberated on ways to decongest the expressway. During the discussion, the traffic police brought up the issue of illegal cuts that flank an 8-km stretch between Dharuhera and Kherki Daula and requested the closure of these cuts at the earliest. “The stretch is a chokepoint for traffic movement, especially during the monsoon. There are several illegal cuts there that lead to haphazard movement of vehicles, which not only leads to congestion but also is a major road safety concern. We have been asking NHAI to close these cuts. This time, we pressed on this issue and asked them to take it up on a very urgent basis," said a senior traffic police officer. The traffic police apprised NHAI that the Bilaspur portion of the stretch has time and again been classified as a black spot. The closure of illegal cuts on the stretch will substantially bring down road accidents at the spot, officials said. NHAI, meanwhile, said it is reviewing the request raised by the traffic police and will take the action required to ensure better traffic movement on the stretch. “We’ve been told that nearly a dozen illegal cuts have been made by locals. We have tried to block these illegal access points, but locals keep removing the barricades. We'll cooperate with police and ensure these cuts are closed," said an NHAI official. The traffic police have also asked NHAI to review its plan to combat waterlogging on the service lanes along the expressway. “We’ve asked NHAI to assess the status of the service roads and undertake repair work to ensure that we don’t face a severe waterlogging issue and resulting traffic jams in the monsoon,” the traffic police officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/illegal-cuts-on-nh-8-stretch-to-be-closed/articleshow/83677727.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Noida||Wheels in motion: You may hire e-bikes in Noida from next month||NOIDA: The electric bicycle project, which has suffered several hiccups over lack of interest among companies, is likely to take off next month. The Noida Authority has decided it will not demand any money from the companies that will run the bike-on-rent service in the city. The Authority had thrice invited companies to run the bike-sharing project in the past, but they hardly showed any interest and stayed away from the bidding process because of the share it had to give the Authority. The bike docking kiosks were supposed to come up near Metro stations and other areas of the city. The companies invited for the bids had cited lack of office crowd during the pandemic, reduced use of public transport among people and lack of financial viability for not showing any interest in the e-bike project. During pre-bid discussions with the companies, Noida Authority officials had been asked to forego the revenue they had demanded from them. The companies had also sought a moratorium for the first two years and other mediums of earning revenue to make the project financially sustainable. Earlier, Gurugram and Delhi had tried launching a similar bike-sharing system. But barring the initial months, the project could not sustain in the long run due to various reasons. Transport experts, however, believe that even with work from home likely for most of the remaining year, there is ample scope for the bike-sharing system in the city. Amit Bhatt, director of integrated urban transport at World Resources Institute (India), said, "Even though the number of people attending office has reduced due to the pandemic, those who are commuting to work at present prefer to avoid the crowd. Travelling alone is the first choice and for short distances, I believe a lot of people will opt for a bicycle instead of buses, cabs and auto-rickshaws." Bhatt has been involved with several-bike sharing projects across Delhi-NCR as well as other parts of the country. At present, the only two places where the e-bike model is working successfully are Mysore and Ahmedabad. Ritu Maheshwari, the chief executive officer of the Noida Authority, held a review meeting with the traffic cell and discussed the possibilities of giving shape to the project. She directed officials to finalise by June 30 two agencies that would run the bike service. A senior manager with Noida’s traffic cell, AS Sharma, said, "Besides not asking for revenue, we will also offer 100sqft of advertising space at each docking station to the service providers. They will have the option of making revenue through operations as well as through selling ad space. The final presentation of the shortlisted bidders before the technical committee is scheduled for June 24. We will award work to two agencies after that."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/wheels-in-motion-you-may-hire-e-bikes-from-next-month/articleshow/83675663.cms||Shalabh

The accused — also construction workers — filmed the crime and shared it on social media, police said. Originally from Agra, the man was living at the under-construction site with a few others, including some men from his village. The accused went back to their village after the crime, the cops added. On May 30, the man and accused consumed alcohol and slept at the same place. “Next morning, I woke up with pain in my back. The other two started laughing. When I inquired, one of them told me that the other raped him and shot a video,” said Raj. The man threatened them saying that he would lodge a complaint with the contractor. Fearing action, the accused fled. On June 9, when the man’s brother visited Gurgaon, he was informed about how the video went viral in his village. Following this, he approached the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/2-booked-for-sodomising-construction-worker/articleshow/83677804.cms||---

Elderly woman tied to chair, robbed in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: Two youths, posing as prospective tenants, entered a Sector 14 house, tied a 70-year-old woman staying alone to a chair and was about to flee when her son arrived to check on his mother on Friday afternoon. They managed to push aside the son and flee with cash and jewellery on a bike that did not have a number plate. Police said the modus operandi resembled that of the doorbell gang, which is known to make a friendly entry to houses, take the occupants hostage and loot cash and jewellery. On Friday too, the two youths rang the doorbell of the house where a “To Let” sign had been hung outside. When Omwati Devi opened the door, they asked her politely if she would like to show them the house. She allowed them in. Omwati Devi lives alone on the ground floor of the three-storied house in Sector 14. She has a tenant on the first floor while the second floor is vacant. Her son lives with his family in Sector 47. Her son Rajender Singh Yadav (42) said his mother called him around 12.20pm and said two youths had come looking for the second floor house. Yadav reached Sector 14 around three hours later. When Yadav rang the doorbell, a youth in his late 20s opened the door behind the main gate and enquired if he was the tenant who stayed on the first floor. “Without answering his question, I insisted he open the door. He went inside and said he would have to ask aunty (my mother),” he said. In a minute, he returned with another youth. “I told them to open the gate. But they kept asking me if I was the tenant who stayed upstairs. I told them I was the owner of the house and asked them sternly to open the gate. They opened the gate this time, pushed me aside and ran towards the main road. I gave them a chase and tried to note down the bike number. But it did not have any,” said Yadav. He rushed inside and found his mother tied to a chair with a cloth. Her mouth was taped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/doorbell-gang-again-elderly-woman-tied-to-chair-robbed/articleshow/83677882.cms||Bagish Jha

Commissioner Munish Sharma, has asked officials to immediately hire machinery required to address the flooding problem in these areas and also resolve the issue of water run-off from 15 ponds in the villages during the monsoon. The sites include areas near Rampura flyover, Manesar Chowk. “There are 22 waterlogging-prone sites in division 1 and 30 in division 2. The commissioner has directed officials to hire machinery and float tenders immediately to get motors and pumps ready to resolve any waterlogging problems in our areas. Moreover, directions to repair potholes before the monsoon in a time-bound manner have also been given,” said Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCM. Officials have also been asked to hold meetings with the village heads to get a better understanding of the waterlogging problem during the monsoon. “This would be our first experience addressing waterlogging in the MCM areas. In MCG areas, we know the water flow and exit points, however, in the MCM areas, it would be challenging for us to address the problem since the area is new. However, we will put our best foot forward,” said a senior MCM official, privy to the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mcm-identifies-52-sites-prone-to-waterlogging/articleshow/83677944.cms||Vishakha Chaman

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Over 3,000 women embark on a green mission in Churu||JAIPUR: In a unique initiative in the panchayats of Taranagar block of Churu district, women have taken command in the villages for the protection of nature and environment. About 100 women each from the 33 gram panchayats (3,300 women) planted 5,100 plants on a single day in a major drive under Green Taranagar campaign. Apart from planting saplings, these women also took a pledge to take care of the saplings treating them as members of the family. The occasion was World Desertification Prevention Day, organised by Taranagar Panchayat Samiti. Plantation drive in all the 33 panchayats was taken up simultaneously. In this unique programme, participants took a pledge not to waste food along with making trees members of their families. Development officer Sant Kumar Meena said that under the Green Taranagar campaign of MLA Narendra Budania, women planted saplings at panchayat headquarters to prevent desertification under NREGA and Swachh Bharat Mission (Rural) scheme. The programme was organised under the guidance of Prof Shyam Sundar Jyani, winner of the prestigious United Nations’ Land for Life Award for environment conservation. Jayana Devi, sarpanch of Gajuwas panchayat, inaugurated the plantation drive at the local school ground by planting 251 saplings of desert species Khejri, Rohida, Neem, Ber, Bakayana and Shisham. The women participated in the programme were given away saplings of lemon, guava, mulberry, jamun, pomegranate etc., for plantation at home. Former sarpanch of the village Surendra Saran, announced the adoption of the school premises, took an oath to take care of the plants for three years on the occasion. Sarpanch Lichma Meghwal presided over a similar programme organised in Togawas panchayat. In Togawas, 151 women planted 151 saplings while 151 fruit plants were distributed to these women participants. Similar functions were held in the other panchayats as well. Sub-divisional officer Monika Jakhar said, “This is a unique initiative to connect women with family forestry.” She said, “Special attention was paid to the technique and distance of plantation done. All the saplings have been planted from a distance of 15 feet. Rural women and sarpanchs have taken the responsibility of keeping the plants safe.” She said 17 officers were put in charge of two panchayats for supervision in 33 gram panchyats in the block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-over-3000-women-embark-on-a-green-mission-in-churu/articleshow/83680574.cms||Joychen Joseph
---||Chandigarh||Joyful Milkha Singh leaves Chandigarh in tears||CHANDIGARH: Fitness enthusiast. Stickler for punctuality. Down to earth. Social worker. Motivator. For residents of Chandigarh, Milkha Singh was not just the legendary athlete. He was much, much more — a man who taught the city the lessons of life and left a deep mark on the lives he touched. As the cortege of Milkha Singh made its way from his house in Sector 8 to the Sector 25 cremation ground on Saturday evening, people stopped. Many folded their hands and read prayers and a few held placards to show their love and respect for him. The four-time Asian Games medallist Milkha Singh was on Saturday cremated with full state honours here in the presence of his family members and several dignitaries. After battling with Covid-19 for a month, Milkha (91) breathed his last due to post-Covid complications at PGI on Friday night. His son and ace golfer Jeev Milkha Singh lit the funeral pyre. The family was yet to come to terms with the loss of the 85-year-old former India volleyball captain and Milkha’s wife Nirmal Kaur, who passed away after a long battle with Covid on June 13. The couple is survived by Jeev and three daughters. Sports minister Kiran Rijiju, who attended the funeral, spoke about Milkha’s last wish to see India win an Olympic gold in athletics. “Today, Milkha ji is not among us, but we will fulfil his wish. He has given a big message,” he said. When asked if any award would be instituted in his name, Rijiju said these things will be discussed with family at an appropriate time and whatever needs to be done by the ministry in this regard will be done. Those in their homes and offices remembered the city’s favourite resident with tears in their eyes and a smile on their lips. “I knew him for more than 20 years. He taught me the value of time, as for him, even a fraction of a second decided the finishing line,” said PGI director Prof Jagat Ram. A health worker in PGI recalled a four-year-old incident: the Flying Sikh was queuing up for an OPD visit in the hospital like an ordinary man. “I was surprised to see him waiting in the line for his turn. He was such a humble man,” said the health care worker. Dr Aman Sharma from the internal medicine department in PGI remembered how the legend used to participate in walks organised at PGI and leave behind most of the young doctors. “Both uncle and aunty should not have left us. Their son Jeev used to play golf to raise funds for the treatment of our patients. Uncle used to tell us to remain fit. He used to say if doctors are potbellied, how can they take care of others,” said Dr Aman. Prof Rajesh Vijayvergia, a cardiologist who had been attending to him earlier, said, “Some three months ago I mentioned to him that the title of Flying Sikh was bestowed upon him by then Pakistan President Gen Ayub Khan. To which he replied, ‘doctor sahib, it was an honour for me’.” Punjab governor and UT administrator V P Singh Badnore said, “Whenever I used to meet him, sometimes even in the golf course, he would meet with great affection. Not only Chandigarh, Punjab and India, but Milkha ji's demise is a loss to the entire world. He was an inspiration for millions.” Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, Haryana sports minister Sandeep Singh were among the other dignitaries who attended the last rites. PGI director Prof Jagat Ram was also present. Athletics Federation of India (AFI) secretary Ravinder Chaudhary attended the last rites of the legendary sprinter. Chandigarh Athletics Association (CAA), of which he was the founder president, also paid tribute to Milkha. He established CAA in 1985 and remained its president till 2009. UT Cricket Association president Sanjay Tandon condoled the death of three-time Olympian and his wife Nirmal Kaur, a former national women’s volleyball team captain, and termed the couple as an inspiration for future generations. Tandon said the couple’s contribution for the upliftment of sports will forever be cherished and their demise has created a vacuum in the sporting fraternity. “Milkha Singh’s active involvement in social works made him everyone’s favourite,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/joyful-milkha-singh-leaves-chandigarh-in-tears/articleshow/83680608.cms||Tridib Baparnash

Idris was booked earlier this week in a third FIR filed in the investigation into the assault on Samad after police claimed he had hosted a “provocative” Facebook live session with Samad by his side. Police said they nabbed Idris near Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital in Delhi. “Since the day the FIR was lodged against Idris, he had gone underground and was constantly shifting his base. But on Saturday, his luck ran out and the team formed to track him traced him to Delhi,” said Iraj Raja, SP (rural). “He is accused of instigating the victim Abdul Samad and had also gone live on Facebook,” added Raja. Idris, a Samajwadi Party functionary, has been booked under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 505 (publishing or circulating any statement, rumour or report with intent to incite) of the IPC and section 67 of the Information Technology Act. A senior police officer said there were other cases lodged in the past against Idris, who is originally from Hapur. He moved to Loni in 2006. In the probe into the June 5 assault on Samad, police made the 10th arrest on Saturday. “On Saturday, we arrested Poli alias Gulshan. One more accused, Avesh, is absconding” said Akhilesh Mishra, the SHO of Loni border police station. The main accused in the assault, Pravesh Gujjar, has got bail. In the other FIR, a notice has been sent to the Twitter India MD to record his statement. This case was filed against Twitter, a news portal, and six individuals for sharing, according to police, an “unverified video” in which Samad claimed he was the victim of a hate crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/neta-who-hosted-fb-live-with-assault-victim-held/articleshow/83676374.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Chandigarh||38 days on, Mohali's recovery rate more than positive Covid cases||MOHALI: From the past 38 days, the number of Covid-19 recoveries recorded in the Mohali district are more than the number of positive cases, resulting in the downfall of the active cases. This comes as a relief for both the Mohali administration as well as the health officials. Not only this, but around one-third of the total recoveries have been witnessed in the past 38 days. According to the data procured by the officials of the Mohali administration, a total of 28 cases were reported on Saturday along with 82 recoveries. No death was reported. Maximum 11 cases were reported in Kharar, followed by Dhakoli (7), Mohali (4), Derabassi (2) and one each in Lalru, Boothgarh, Gharuan and Banur. With this, the active cases in the district have come down to 489, which is less than 500 after a period of almost four months. It was on February 24, 2021 that the number of active cases were less than 500 i.e. 471. What comes as more relief for the officials is that a total of 22,312 patients have recovered from the virus in these past 38 days which is 33.5 per cent of the total recoveries. While the cases have seen a downfall recently, the health officials claimed that people should still follow protocols strictly. They claimed that to control the severity of the third wave, taking all the precautions is a must. Currently, as per the officials of the health department, around 1,500-2,000 Covid-19 tests are being conducted daily. Dr Adarshpal Kaur, civil surgeon, Mohali, said, “The current recovery rate of the Mohali district is 97.7 per cent. With the cases coming down and relaxations being given, the public should not think that Covid-19 is gone as the relaxations are given for economic purposes. We should rather increase precautions as now markets will also witness a rush.” She also claimed the second wave of the Covid-19 was a dangerous one and the district faced huge losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/38-days-on-mohali-recovery-rate-more-than-positive-covid-cases/articleshow/83680643.cms||---
---||Noida||Bull gores 3 in 15 days; haven’t got any help yet, say villagers||Greater Noida: With at least three attacks on women of Lakhnawali village by a single bull in the past 15 days, local residents are up in arms against the stray cattle menace in the rural areas of Greater Noida. And with only one gaushala in the city and 124 villages, locals say they have so far received little help from the Greater Noida Authority to catch the stray bull roaming in the area and harming villagers. On Thursday morning, a 55-year-old woman sustained serious injuries after the same bull attacked her while she was on her way to get milk in Lakhnawali. The attack was so severe that Mithilesh Sharma’s intestines came out. Despite a five-hour-long operation and 250 stitches to help push her intestines back into her stomach, doctors at Kailash hospital have told her family members that they’re unsure if she will make it. Mithilesh’s son Shravan told TOI, “My mother is in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the hospital. octors have said that they will have to watch my mother for another two-three days.” Villagers say it is not the first case in the village. Earlier too, at least two women were injured due to attacks by the same bull. “Our kids play in the area. It is extremely dangerous to have a stray bull roaming around in the area,” said Lekhpal Singh, a villager. “We have not heard from the Authority on the issue despite the incidents being reported in the media.” Authority officials claim that the only gaushala in Jalpura village to cater to the 124 villages is overburdened with 1,550 cattle. However, the Jalpura gaushala has a capacity for some 1,800 cattle. Senior manager of GNIDA, Salil Yadav said, “The gaushala is brimming to almost full. We are catching 8-10 cattle daily, and ox and bulls are kept in separate areas. Our focus is on accidental cases as between four-five cases are being reported everyday. At times, some animals have to be left in the jungles of Surajpur because of little space in the gaushala. We are planning to construct another gaushala.” However, there seems to be little movement on the development of cow sheds in the district and the financial assistance of Rs 900 to farmers taking care of stray cattle as promised by the UP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/bull-gores-3-in-15-days-havent-got-any-help-yet-say-villagers/articleshow/83676398.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Ghaziabad||Why private centres in Delhi-NCR are no longer seeing vax rush||GHAZIABAD/NOIDA: Getting a vaccine appointment at private centres has suddenly become easier. Slots were hard to find on Co-WIN just a week ago, but the picture has changed significantly – on Saturday, for instance, 1,800 slots were available at Cambridge School in Indirapuram where Max Hospital (Vaishali) has set up a mega vaccination centre. Government session sites have remained crowded, in the meantime. Why, then, has the rush eased at private centres? Ghaziabad IMA president Dr Ashish Agarwal said, “There are multiple reasons for this change in vaccination pattern. First of all, people tend to go for the service that is free. Secondly, those who were scared of contracting the viral disease (Covid), rushed to centres and got the jab. Thirdly, the Covid situation has fairly improved and people are more relaxed about vaccination and waiting for slots to open up in government centres. The Centre's announcement about ramping up the vaccination facility at government centres has also played a role.” Expectation of more free vaccines becoming available after the Centre takes control of distribution from July 21 is a factor, others agreed. Alok Kumar, founder of the Federation of Association of Apartment Owners (Ghaziabad), said, “Residents are now waiting for the new policy to start. In Ghaziabad, the health department has approached us, saying that they would hold camps in societies. Moreover, a large chunk of the population above 45 years has now taken the vaccine.” He added that RWAs were earlier tying up with private hospitals for paid vaccination camps. But now, they are now waiting to tie up with the government for free camps, especially for society staff and domestic helpers. Private hospitals are trying to innovate to keep the vaccination drive going. “We are vaccinating about 200 people daily, though our capacity is much higher. There are government centres nearby and both are situated at the same place, so people would prefer the free dose. However, we are now offering other services too, like free OPD consultation during vaccination,” said Ajit Kumar, registrar, Sharada Hospital. Dr DK Gupta, chairman of Felix hospital in Noida, which was the first to begin 24z7 vaccinations, added, “There was a huge rush when we started, and vehicles would line up at the centre. But there’s hardly any crowd now. We are mainly conducting vaccination camps with societies and corporate groups. We had planned to procure Sputnik V and other approved vaccines too, but there is no incentive for getting them now. It’s difficult to use up the existing doses.” There were 73 government sites and 59 private sites in Noida giving vaccines. Several private sites have now closed down. Officials said supply to private facilities will be regulated after the fresh allotment on June 21. Ghaziabad is running its vaccination programme at 93 government health facilities and 12 private hospitals. Government centres in both cities have limited stock but the crowds haven’t ebbed here. The centres in Noida that see maximum crowds include CHC Bhangel, Child PGI, PHC and CHC Jewar, ESIC Noida, District Hospital, PHC and CHC Bisrakh, CHC Dadri, District Combined Hospital, GIMS, PHC Dankaur and UCHC Raipur. Ghaziabad’s rural centres in Muradnagar, Dasna and Bhojpur did not have slots available on Saturday. Slots are also always full at the four drive-through centres in Noida –DLF Mall of India, GIP, OCP mall and Gaur City mall. Private centres have been charging Rs 780 and above for Covishield and Rs 1,000-1,500 for Covaxin. “While price could be a factor, accessibility may also be a reason why people prefer government centres. We have started government centres in nearly every sector, village and urban village in the district. One can easily get to a government centre within 2-3km of their house throughout Noida and Greater Noida,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, adding the quality of services offered at government centres in Noida is on a par with any private centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/why-private-centres-in-ncr-are-no-longer-seeing-vax-rush/articleshow/83681511.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Noida||Why private centres in Delhi-NCR are no longer seeing vax rush||GHAZIABAD/NOIDA: Getting a vaccine appointment at private centres has suddenly become easier. Slots were hard to find on Co-WIN just a week ago, but the picture has changed significantly – on Saturday, for instance, 1,800 slots were available at Cambridge School in Indirapuram where Max Hospital (Vaishali) has set up a mega vaccination centre. Government session sites have remained crowded, in the meantime. Why, then, has the rush eased at private centres? Ghaziabad IMA president Dr Ashish Agarwal said, “There are multiple reasons for this change in vaccination pattern. First of all, people tend to go for the service that is free. Secondly, those who were scared of contracting the viral disease (Covid), rushed to centres and got the jab. Thirdly, the Covid situation has fairly improved and people are more relaxed about vaccination and waiting for slots to open up in government centres. The Centre's announcement about ramping up the vaccination facility at government centres has also played a role.” Expectation of more free vaccines becoming available after the Centre takes control of distribution from July 21 is a factor, others agreed. Alok Kumar, founder of the Federation of Association of Apartment Owners (Ghaziabad), said, “Residents are now waiting for the new policy to start. In Ghaziabad, the health department has approached us, saying that they would hold camps in societies. Moreover, a large chunk of the population above 45 years has now taken the vaccine.” He added that RWAs were earlier tying up with private hospitals for paid vaccination camps. But now, they are now waiting to tie up with the government for free camps, especially for society staff and domestic helpers. Private hospitals are trying to innovate to keep the vaccination drive going. “We are vaccinating about 200 people daily, though our capacity is much higher. There are government centres nearby and both are situated at the same place, so people would prefer the free dose. However, we are now offering other services too, like free OPD consultation during vaccination,” said Ajit Kumar, registrar, Sharada Hospital. Dr DK Gupta, chairman of Felix hospital in Noida, which was the first to begin 24z7 vaccinations, added, “There was a huge rush when we started, and vehicles would line up at the centre. But there’s hardly any crowd now. We are mainly conducting vaccination camps with societies and corporate groups. We had planned to procure Sputnik V and other approved vaccines too, but there is no incentive for getting them now. It’s difficult to use up the existing doses.” There were 73 government sites and 59 private sites in Noida giving vaccines. Several private sites have now closed down. Officials said supply to private facilities will be regulated after the fresh allotment on June 21. Ghaziabad is running its vaccination programme at 93 government health facilities and 12 private hospitals. Government centres in both cities have limited stock but the crowds haven’t ebbed here. The centres in Noida that see maximum crowds include CHC Bhangel, Child PGI, PHC and CHC Jewar, ESIC Noida, District Hospital, PHC and CHC Bisrakh, CHC Dadri, District Combined Hospital, GIMS, PHC Dankaur and UCHC Raipur. Ghaziabad’s rural centres in Muradnagar, Dasna and Bhojpur did not have slots available on Saturday. Slots are also always full at the four drive-through centres in Noida –DLF Mall of India, GIP, OCP mall and Gaur City mall. Private centres have been charging Rs 780 and above for Covishield and Rs 1,000-1,500 for Covaxin. “While price could be a factor, accessibility may also be a reason why people prefer government centres. We have started government centres in nearly every sector, village and urban village in the district.

---||Ghaziabad||As second Covid wave ebbs, life comes full circle for workers at Hindon crematorium||GHAZIABAD: At the Hindon cremation ground, where the number of bodies arriving for last rites has gone down, life is ever so slightly back to normal for the workers. In April and May, when the second Covid wave wreaked havoc across the city, workers at the cremation grounds were one of the busiest lots. While the number of bodies arriving at the Hindon ground has reduced significantly now, there was a time when it took hours or even a day to get a body cremated. There were a few from the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation who held fort during those difficult times. With bare minimum protection from Covid, these unsung warriors helped perform the last rites of Covid victims, unmindful of the consequences, especially when relatives in full PPE kits dare not touch the bodies. “In times before Covid, we had seen how people followed last rites. They even used to lend shoulders to their bodies. Covid changed it all. People abandoned the rituals out of the fear of contracting the disease,” said Vikas Singh, the point-person deputed by the GMC to oversee cremations at the ground. “We pitched in those difficult times with scant regard for our lives. We helped hundreds of people cremate their loved ones,” added Singh. Yusuf, who was brought in by GMC to manage cremations, said: “As is the custom, cremation is done in the presence of a priest who guides relatives while performing the last rites. Due to the overwhelming number of cases, the priests were hard to find and people had no clue how to go about it.” “Over the years of working at cremation grounds we knew the process and had to double up as ‘priest’ to help people cremate,” added Yusuf. Sonu, a youth in his early twenties, was arranging woods on the pyre with his hands. His mask had fallen below his nose while the relatives of the deceased stood nearby in PPE kits. “We have no time to think about all this. Our primary job is to help people cremate bodies, which were arriving in dozens.” “During peak Covid times, we hardly slept and had stopped going home for fear of spreading disease and had made arrangements for our stay in nearby Hindon Vihar,” added Sonu, who reluctantly admitted that it has helped him earn a few extra bucks. Shivam, on the chance of contracting the disease, said rather resignedly: ‘Hona hota to abhi tak ho gaya hota (if I had to contract the disease, it would have happened by now). “We have the blessings of Mahakal. By his grace, I never felt any discomfort in terms of health. After all, we are doing a sacred job in times like these. The sad part, however, is that there is no acknowledgement of our work,” said Shivam, who put out a rough estimate that he has helped cremate more than 125 bodies at the ground. The pyre between April 25 and May 11 raged round-the-clock at the cremation ground. Now, there is no rush. For Shivam and Sonu, life is almost back to normal. The platforms on which hundreds of bodies were cremated have nothing but ashes left.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/as-second-covid-wave-ebbs-life-comes-full-circle-for-workers-at-hindon-crematorium/articleshow/83676506.cms||Abhijay Jha

On Saturday, active cases stood at 851, after 127 patients were deemed recovered, according to state health bulletin. A dip in active cases below 1,000 was recorded on January 24, after last year’s winter surge in the Covid-19 infection. It took about seven weeks till mid-March for the caseload of infection to go back above 1,000. In the short history of this current pandemic, medical experts are cautious predicting what lies ahead. In mid-July 2020, the active cases were around 1,000. By first week of August, the reproductionfactor resulted in over 2,000 active cases in Bhopal. By December, it had crossed 3,200 active cases. The last surge was far more infectious. Active cases outnumbered bed capacity of about 8,000 in Bhopal. The lockdown or implementing Covid-19 curbs was late. As many as 30 calendar days seems to be a benchmark to revisit and access the situation, according to experts. Experts indicate that moderate or severe cases of the infection would still need to be monitored. The reproduction number (Ro) or Covid ‘R’ number has to be kept low too. It is the average number of infections produced by a single infectious person in a population with no immunity. If the ‘R’ value is less than 1, an epidemic eventually dies out because each infected person generates less than one new infection, cited a January Lancet study. It did not account for the vaccine to protect against Covid-19. Roughly, 40% of city adults have got one jab each. That is the silver lining and also a hope that people would adhere to socially distance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/active-cases-drop-to-851-in-bhopal-lowest-in-5-months/articleshow/83680650.cms||Jamal Ayub

Police said Prabal Kumar may not have been wearing a helmet as they could not find any parts of the safety gear near the accident spot. He was taken to a private hospital nearby and referred to Kailash Hospital in Sector 27 from there. He died there of excessive blood loss and a severe head injury. Kumar, his family members said, had left home in Green View apartments of Sector 99 for an errand. He was metres away from Amrapali Sapphire in Sector 45 when the SUV crashed into his Royal Enfield (UP16BV-7668). He is survived by a wife. Although a few policemen saw the Fortuner zoom past them at high speed, the SUV hasn’t been tracked down even after 24 hours. "The accused sped past at around 100kmph. Some cops saw it," said an officer at Amrapali Sapphire police chowki. Pratap Singh, who was deployed at the police outpost at the time of the accident, said though the SUV passed a busy area, no CCTV camera could capture it properly. Only a camera installed at a general store has some footage showing the car, but it is unclear. An FIR has been registered against the unknown Fortuner driver under IPC sections 304A (death due to negligence), 279 (rash driving) and 427 (mischief causing damage). Meanwhile, as the Bullet lay at the accident spot till Saturday afternoon, its battery was stolen, Prabal’s colleagues alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/bhel-exec-dies-as-suv-hits-bike-from-behind/articleshow/83676827.cms||---

The government clarified that the new system would end corruption in urban local bodies and strengthen their finances. The government carried out a study on apprehensions raised by opposition parties and found these to be false. The municipal administration and urban development department released the study paper on the proposed reforms in the property tax system in urban local bodies. Stating that property tax constitutes the single largest source of revenue to the ULBs, the government said that Capital Value Based tax system would help reduce complexity among staffers and enhance transparency in levy of taxes. It said that prevailing Annual Rental Value (ARV) based system was only helping the influential meddle with taxation. In the existing tax system, property tax on building is levied based on the Annual Rental Value of the building, which will be fixed based on the location of the building, type of construction, plinth area, age of the building and nature of usage. The council of respective municipal body will determine percentage of tax on ARV of the building. Similarly, property tax on lands will be fixed with reference to the Capital Value of the land (market value as fixed by the stamps and registration department). It is 0.20% of the capital value in municipalities and 0.50% in municipal corporations. "This means that vacant land tax is being levied on capital value basis even prior to the amendments proposed to the existing property tax regime." said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/reforms-to-lower-urban-property-tax-ratesm-says-andhra-pradesh-government/articleshow/83680730.cms||Samdani MN

Affected by the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) project, people of five villages -- Palla, Pali, Chithehra, Kathehra and Boraki -- have been protesting for the past six months to highlight their problems before the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration but to no avail. Panchayat polls were held in Chithehra and Katehra recently. The land has been taken over by GNIDA, which is acting as the intermediary as the villages are notified under it. The authority is offering compensation at the rate of Rs 3,500 per sqm to the villagers. Manish Bhati, a resident of Kathehra village, said, “We want to highlight the anomalies in the land acquisition policy being implemented in the Dadri area. In the five villages, teachers appointed by the state government are getting house rent allowance as per the rural slab. Also, the electricity charges are being taken as per rural slab.” During the recently concluded panchayat elections, rural population staying in Kathehra and Chithehra polled to select the gram sabha. “What more evidence is needed to establish that we are still under the panchayati raj system?” asked Jasbeer Singh, a resident of Chithehra village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/farmers-hit-by-dmic-project-to-write-to-cm/articleshow/83676856.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It is our endeavour to get more than 10 lakh people vaccinated in a day in the vaccination campaign. This campaign will be possible only with the cooperation of religious leaders, voluntary organisations, social workers, political parties, MPs, ministers, MLAs, public representatives,” Chouhan said. CM appealed to everyone to cooperate in creating an environment for the vaccination campaign. He virtually addressed the dignitaries of all the districts of the state from his residence. Chouhan said, second wave of corona infection was more deadly than the first, the virus was more contagious; as a result we have suffered a lot. He said, the virus is not gone yet and added, “The possibility of a third wave is being expressed, then the number of positive cases may increase, but we cannot impose lockdown again and again. How long will we close business and employment? The poor are ruined, business is destroyed, industries suffer.” He said, a way has to be found by which the world can also keep running and infection of Covid can also be controlled. For this, cooperation of prominent personalities, religious leaders, voluntary organisations of the society is needed. Chouhan said, “We want to make you a partner in the strategy we have prepared and seek your cooperation. As part of the strategy, we will do a large number of tests. There will be 75000-80000 tests daily. The problem is that people think that when they are not sick, then why they should get tested. I appeal that you also tell people what is the problem in getting the test done.” Chouhan said that vaccination is the only thing which will save us even in the event of infection. He said, this Maha Abhiyan will not be ordinary. This is a campaign to save lives. This is a campaign to protect people from Corona, so that by September-October when the third wave arrives, we have already vaccinated most of the people of the state. CM said, that many misconceptions are being spread regarding vaccination; these misconceptions have to be cleared. “I We cannot watch our people die. We have suffered a lot in the second wave, now cannot bear it the third time,” he said. He said vaccination campaign will start from June 21 at 10 am; the target is to administer more than10 lakh vaccines in a day. Chouhan told the dignitaries, “All of you should upload your video with the message of 'Vaccine is safety'. Be a source of inspiration for vaccination. There will be 7 thousand motivators at 7 thousand vaccination centres of the state.” He said, there will be no crowd at the vaccination centres. The team will vaccinate elderly people who cannot come to the vaccination centre by going to their homes. Chouhan said that the villages which will be fully vaccinated, will be ranked, just as the ranking of cleanliness is being done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-seeks-peoples-support-for-mega-vaccination-drive-on-jun-21/articleshow/83680731.cms||---

A black pitcher has been fixed on the top. They also dug three foot at the site at Jind-Patiala-Delhi national highway and fixed iron pipes in cement. They constructed a stage with bricks on Saturday and only two lanes were kept open for commuters. Farmers asserted that their dharna would continue till their demands were met. Protesting farmers have been camping at the toll plaza since the agitation against the central three farm laws was launched after these were passed on June 5, 2020. The recent storm destroyed the site repeatedly, causing losses worth lakhs. Farmers from Bangar area, including women, reached the toll plaza to press their demand and were upset at the sight of the destruction. “Farmers have lost nearly 600 lives during the ongoing agitation and don’t care about financial loss but are ready to sacrifice everything for their demands,” BKU Jind district president Azad Singh Palwa and Khera khap president Satbir Pahalwan claimed. One of the protesters, Bijender Sandhu said, “We fixed the black pitcher to attract positive vibes at the protesting site this time as the government is crushing farmers day and night. When one purchases new vehicles, constructs a new home or starts any auspicious work, they fix a black item for positive energy. Now, farmers have constructed a pakka morcha and fixed cemented pipes till three feet on the national highway. With this, the storm will not harm the site and farmers will stage dharna for a long time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/protesting-farmers-make-brick-structure-to-face-storm/articleshow/83677193.cms||---

Terming it a part of propaganda against the farmers’ struggle, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) said it had already clarified that the incidents at Red Fort were “clearly a part of the conspiracy hatched by the central government to defame the farmers’ movement”. “Morcha is confident that the right to peaceful, democratic protest shall be recognised by the court and the diabolic design to criminalise dissent shall be exposed,” it said. SKM said it found Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s continuing defence of the three agriculture marketing laws “surprising to say the least”. His continuing statements that the government was ready to listen to point-wise listing of concerns of farmers, negated the fact that SKM leaders had already pointed out to the government the fundamental flaws in the central farm laws, the group claimed. “These laws leave farmers at the mercy of markets which are manipulated by big capital and corporates, without any protection being accorded by the government,” SKM alleged. “With fundamental flaws that lie in the very policy direction that has been adopted, with deficiencies that go against farmers’ interests and seek to protect corporate profiteering, why should the government again and again defend the laws,” asked the morcha, alleging the government was being “unreasonable” in asking the farmers to present options other than repeal. SKM said despite some recent unsavoury incidents, the protesting farmers and supporters would continue with their social boycott and opposition of BJP leaders and allied parties and not against all the political parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/supplementary-chargesheet-in-r-day-case-propaganda-against-stir/articleshow/83677306.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Amid local resentment, farmers find ways to counter efforts against protest||Bathinda: Aiming to counter allegations against the ongoing farmer protest, the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha has decided to involve the residents of villages near the protests on the Singhu border to showcase they have no problem from the struggle. The morcha has decided to reach out to villages, telling them about the forces bent upon to defame the ongoing protest. A two-wheeler march will be taken out in villages around Singhu border on June 21. Farmer leaders on Saturday held a meeting at Singhu border with residents of nearby villages, including the representatives of khaps, who assured support to the struggle and to take on those who want to defame the struggle. All this happened to counter the actions of some other residents of some nearby villages who are pitted against the farmer protest and are accusing it of damaging their businesses. Residents have announced a meeting against the farm struggle on Sunday. “An all-round campaign is being launched against farmer struggle to defame it by any means. BJP is taking along some residents of nearby villages who have nothing to do with farmer struggle. We will not allow such designs to succeed,” said Antil Khap head Hawa Singh, after a meeting with farmer leaders. SKM leader Darshan Pal said the BJP failed to uproot the farmer struggle, so it had started using negative means to defame the struggle. “Going by it, we have decided to undertake Sadbhavna mission involving locals. This practice is being adopted at all protest sites,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amid-local-resentment-farmers-find-ways-to-counter-efforts-against-protest/articleshow/83677574.cms||Neel Kamal

Scindia is scheduled to visit the state again on June 22, second time in a fortnight. Scindia, who is likely to get a ministry in the expansion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi cabinet, had met BJP state president Vishnu Dutt Sharma, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and discussed about the adjustment of his supporters that lost bypolls. Party sources said a final decision regarding the rehabilitation of Scindia supporters would be taken after the nod of central party leadership. Scindia is scheduled to come to MP on June 22 and will visit Shivpuri, Guna, Ashok Nagar, Sironj and Bhopal during his threeday stay. The first meeting of the MP BJP executive committee will also be convened on June 24. Party's national president Jagat Prakash Nadda will inaugurate the meeting. It would be the first time after the appointment of Vishnu Dutt Sharma as party's state chief and second time in three years that a meeting of the state body will be conducted. The meet would be held virtually due to corona. The party sources said Scindia supporters may have to wait a little more to get rehabilitated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/jyotiraditya-scindia-may-discuss-supporters-rehab-during-madhya-pradesh-visit-on-june-22/articleshow/83680903.cms||---
---||Puducherry||Puducherry BJP fights over ministerial berths||PUDUCHERRY: The mad scramble for ministerial posts among BJP MLAs came to the fore on Saturday when supporters of party MLA A Johnkumar picketed the party office and locked it after damaging party flags and banners demanding minister post for their leader. The supporters went berserk following reports that the BJP decided not to offer him a minister post as he was booked by the Income Tax department for evading tax of more than ?50 crore. They gathered in front of the party office in the town limits with posters of their leader and raised slogans demanding ministerial berth for him. Johnkumar, who was in Delhi along with his son Richard Johnkumar and another MLA P M L Kalyanasundaram to call on BJP leaders and impress upon them to include him in the cabinet, told a section of reporters over phone that he expected a ministerial berth as an elected MLA from a minority community. However, he claimed that he will abide by the decision taken by the party high command. The saffron party finally came out with a decision of offering ministerial posts on a rotation basis to cajole its MLAs who raised a banner of revolt. As per the arrangement, former Congress minister A Namassivayam will be offered a minister post and the rest four (after one MLA has been elected as the speaker of the legislative assembly) will serve as minister on a rotational basis. “The BJP has finally started paying the price of fielding turncoats and backstabbers as its candidates to contest the last assembly polls. It is true that the party fared exceptionally well winning six out of the nine seats but now faces humiliation as supporters of its own MLA started attacking its office,” said a political pundit. Kumar had quit the Congress ahead of the 2021 assembly polls and joined the BJP. He was earlier with the DMK. The IT officials raided his house in 2016 when he was with the Congress and seized several incriminating documents revealing that he had evaded tax to a tune of more than Rs50 crore. The IT department charged that Kumar, who is one of the multi-system operators (MSOs) in Puducherry, evaded tax by furnishing false accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/puducherry-bjp-fights-over-ministry-berths/articleshow/83680907.cms||Bosco Dominique

In a letter to all district education officers, the Haryana School Shiksha Pariyojna Parishad has said that parents of out-of-school kids need not produce Aadhaar cards or school leaving certificates to enrol them in schools again. The education department has directed the officials to identify the total number of school dropouts in their areas and enrol them in the nearest state-run schools at the earliest. “It is part of our programme to identify out-of-school children and bring them back to schools to expand the coverage of education in the state. We had received feedback from teachers and school heads that a lot of children want to join the schooling system but face hurdles due to the lack of documents like Aadhaar card or the school leaving certificate. So, we have decided to ease them and facilitate maximum admissions. School teachers can later get ensure that such children are issued necessary documentation,” said a senior official in the education department. In March this year, TOI had reported that the education department was planning to mainstream out-of-school children across 22 districts. A door-to-door survey in Gurugram had revealed there were around 4,100 such kids in the district. Of them, over 1,300 are aged below seven years. Officials said they would ensure kids below seven years were enrolled directly into Class 1 of the nearest primary school. Those in the age group of 8 to 14 years would be trained with a six-month-long bridge course and then allotted age-appropriate classes in the academic session starting March 2022. The bridge course will start in September this year. The department has also directed officials to ensure no teacher is tasked with any non-academic work and that they are engaged in enrolling as many out-of-school children as possible. The officials have been given a week to submit a report on the number of teachers who have been appointed for the admission process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/out-of-school-children-dont-need-aadhaar-for-admission/articleshow/83677617.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

As major cracks were identified in a recent study of the heritage monument which is protected by the ASI, an accretion wall is being removed to study the stability of the structure and carry out remedial measures. The Nayak-era structure was used for defence purpose by the British during the colonial rule and cannons were placed on the walls after making a few alterations. As no major maintenance work was not taken up in recent years, ASI has taken up the conservation work this year. Along with Bharathidasan University’s remote sensing department, it carried out a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey with advanced gadgets to survey the foundations of the the gate’s walls. “We found cracks that ought to be immediately focussed on to ensure its stability. An accretion wall (recently built) is being removed to study the structure’s foundation. We are probing the reasons for raising the wall with our experts and retired ASI officials. The process will go on for a month,” Dr T Arun Raj, superintending archaeologist of the circle, told TOI. The partial demolition of the wall that covered an arch-like opening in the structure sprawling for about 2,000 square feet triggered rumours among people. However, ASI clarified that the modification work was to ensure the stability of Main guard gate, an outer fortified wall to safeguard the Rockfort hillock that served as an inner fort once. After completing the maintenance work on one of the city’s icons, ASI will place information boards conveying the timeline and history of the protected monument. Officers also raised concerns over the presence of numerous shops bordering the Main guard gate walls as they could not carry out the emergency maintenance work. Social activists urged the ASI Trichy circle and Trichy corporation to invoke the protocols of the ancient monuments and archaeological sites and remains act (AMASR ACT) for safeguarding the heritage monument.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/asi-begins-work-to-strengthen-500-year-old-main-guard-gate-complex-in-trichy-city/articleshow/83680970.cms||Deepak Karthik

Earlier, former chief minister Kamal Nath had tweeted that the tests are being conducted on fake patients. On Saturday, state PCC spokesman Ajay Yadav said, “The state government’s corona statistics is a forgery. When the second wave was at its peak, tests conducted on suspected patients used to be between 35,000 to 40,000. Now, when the Corona second wave is on the way out, testing centres are either vacant or closed, but still the government data says that testing today is between 70,000 to 75,000.” Quoting government data, Yadav said that testing seems to have increased when the second wave is nearly over. “According to the government data, on April 12 testing was conducted on 38,000 suspected patients and around 6,500 were found positive. On May 8, testing was conducted on 66,000 suspected patients, of which 11,500 were found positive,” Ajay Yadav said. “On June 17, government statistics claim that 73,000 persons were tested and on June 18, another 72,000 tests were conducted. Government claims that 100 to 110 among those are positive cases, and therefore, positivity rate is constantly decreasing,” Yadav said. He said that corona care centres have been closed, testing centres are empty and desolate. Yet the government claims more and more are being tested for the virus when the crisis is over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/congress-doubts-madhya-pradesh-government-data-on-covid-positivity-rate/articleshow/83680904.cms||---

Official data said on the CoWIN portal, more than 30,000 were vaccinated in the city on Saturday. On Friday, around 28,000 had been vaccinated in the city, according to the portal. The corporation sources said that there continues to be a good demand in the city for vaccines. “ We have opened adhoc centres, three each in every zone, for vaccination. These are in places with lot of space like schools and colleges, where people can sit maintaining proper social distancing,” an official said. The civic body is also getting a lot of bulk vaccination requests from private companies and other entities in the city. “ However, supply continues to be a constraint. If we get a steady supply, vaccination can continue at the same pace,” the official said. According to CoWIN statistics, a little more than 26 lakh have already been vaccinated in the city. Of this, around 6.11 lakh have taken both doses. Demand is uniformly high across all age groups, the official said. “ Zones where population density is high, like Royapuram, Teynampet and Tondiarpet have the highest vaccination numbers,” the official said. G Satish, of Shollinganallur in south Chennai, said based on his experience, hesitancy among people for vaccination had reduced which had contributed to the increase in demand. Vasanthi Kannan, of Kodambakkam zone, said in their division (134), there was always a crowd at the vaccination centres due to a shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/vaccination-in-chennai-continues-to-be-steady/articleshow/83681017.cms||---

After the lockdown, large number of tourists from across the state and Nagpur are visiting the hill station during the monsoon, the best time to visit the queen of Satpura. After two months of lockdown, the hotels are full. In fact, many hotels are booked for the next 15 days. It started almost immediately after the lockdown when large turnout of tourists was witnessed in Pachmarhi. Even the hoteliers were taken by surprise. The MP tourism development corporation (MPTDC) hotels had a gala time with over 90% occupancy. “Those who could not get rooms in the hotels of MPTDC settled down with the private hotels. These days the occupancy rate is very high,” said a hotel manager in Pachmarhi. You call it people’s craze for the hill station, he said, or craving to take a breath in fresh air after over two months of lockdown tourists have been visiting on weekends despite the fact that Sunday’s are complete lockdown in Pachmarhi and markets are closed. “As all the tourist spots are also closed on Sunday lockdowns, people are too happy to remain within the four walls or the compounds of the hotels and enjoy the weather,” he said. Large numbers of tourists are visiting from Bhopal, Indore, Nagpur and Jabalpur among other places. Sanjeev Agrawal, a professional photographer who has visited Pachmarhi along with his family said, “After every shower, a number of waterfalls come alive on every hill. Weather is perfect and I am enjoying some quality time with my family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/unlock-mood-its-raining-tourists-in-monsoon-soaked-pachmarhi/articleshow/83681041.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: No respite in sight for inundated Behala area||KOLKATA: Thousands of residents in Behala, Kidderpore and Ekbalpore have been stuck indoors for over 72 hours, but the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) top brass had no hope to offer them even on Saturday. In fact, a sewerage and drainage department official made it clear even moderate rain on Sunday or Monday could spell more misery for locals in inundated areas. An abnormal delay in implementation of a drainage development project under Kolkata Environment & Infrastructure Improvement Project (KEIIP) scheme and clogged Manikhali and Churial canals, two outfall channels that carry storm water away from Behala neighbourhoods, were the primary reasons for the inundation. But locals are not willing to buy the KMC’s logic. Payel Kar, a Class XII student from Behala Rabindranagar who has an ailing parent at home, said, “We have no power or drinking water for four days now. After neighbours protested against waterlogging and power cuts, the power supply was restored for just an hour. How will we survive?” According to T S Kar, chairman of Shakuntala Park Housing Cooperative Society, the Sarsuna satellite township’s open drainage system has collapsed for want of maintenance. “The outfall canals are clogged due to encroachment and illegal constructions, leading to inundation throughout monsoon,” he said. With the entire neighbourhood remaining under water, there is fear of an outbreak of enteric diseases, said a KMC health department official. The civic body has started sending water tanks to areas in Behala that are submerged. Mohammed Sadhab, a businessman from Ekbalpore, has not been able to leave home for three days due to waterlogging and had to keep his shop shut. He criticized the lack of a comprehensive drainage development plan that could bring some relief every monsoon. Jayanta Das, from Mukundapur’s Purvalok, said, “I had to take my wife for check-up at a nearby hospital. But we have not been able to leave home due to the waterlogging outside.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-no-respite-in-sight-for-inundated-behala-area/articleshow/83681049.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Chennai||Chennai: Squatters make a comeback on Spur Tank Road along Cooum||CHENNAI: Encroachments have sprung up along the banks of Cooum river on Spur Tank Road (Mayor Ramanathan Salai) with temporary structures being erected. A couple of them are erected by nomadic families selling bamboo products. However, the authorities not securing the river banks by fencing or constructing a compound wall after removing encroachments more than a year ago has allowed the encorachers to have a free rein again. The public works department had spent thousands of crores of rupees in clearing encroachments from and along the banks of the river to facilitate work on the long pending Ennore-Maduravoyal elevated corridor. The construction bars from the unfinished columns from the river bed along Spur Tank Road remain the remnants of an incomplete project. “They started constructing a compound wall along the road a year ago. But, it was not completed. When asked, officials cited the pandemic,” said K Akshay, a resident of Chetpet. PWD officials said they have been notified of the encroachments and will ask the families to remove the structures. “One of the structures was removed recently. We will ensure that others are also clear from the bunds. Compound wall work along Spur Tank Road will also be completed,” said the official. The sidewalks along the road too have become unusuable as construction debris and other waste from the encroachments are thrown along the walking area. “In some area, there are railings, but they are worn out. The authorities should take up work soon as their efforts would go to waste if they do not act soon,” said L Raghavan, an activist. PWD sources also said the department will also take up the issue of a sewage treatment plant which is under construction near the junction of Spur Tank Road and Vallur Kottam High Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-squatters-make-a-comeback-on-spur-tank-road-along-cooum/articleshow/83681064.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: As Covid strengthens family bonds, Father’s Day to be close-knit affair||LUCKNOW: Familial bonding has always been there, but the devastating Covid-19 pandemic has made people realise its importance more than ever. Many youngsters, including those who lost one of the parents to the disease, are planning to celebrate Father’s Day on Sunday in a special way while keeping it a close-knit affair with full Covid restrictions. Celebrated each year on the third Sunday of June, the day marks the pivotal role that fathers play in their children’s lives; be it emotionally, mentally or even financially. Alice Peter (29), a resident of Viram Khand in Gomtinagar, said: “I bought his favorite pair of jeans and T-shirt for which I was saving money. We will watch movies of his choice together. Since the day falls on a Sunday, I won’t have office work and my whole day would be dedicated to him.” Like Alice, many try to spend more time with their fathers, others who are away from home call their father or visit him. A resident of Jankipuram Garden, Aril Agnes Victor (25), said: “My sister and I will cook a special lunch for our father and bake a cake at home as we are avoiding outside food. Our brother will join us from Qatar over a video call to cut the cake together.” “We are a joint family of 20 people, therefore, we wait for special days so that we can celebrate as a group. We made sure that everyone was vaccinated timely and this Father’s Day, the children of the family will keep up with the tradition by making special dishes of the choice of our fathers. We have also planned a round of dumbcharades,” said Aditi (25) and Akshay Shukla (20), residents of Rajendranagar. However, the day would be a bit different for those who lost a parent. Kashish Kushwaha (25) of Kalyanpur said, “I lost my mother to Covid-19 and my father tested negative last month. I am grateful that he’s alive. He still has anxiety and weakness so I’m taking extra care of him by talking to him, giving nutritious meals and medicines on time for his fast recovery.” Ananya Agarwal (20) of Hazratganj said, “I lost my father on April 28 due to Covid. Every year, I used to plan something special for him but this time, I am going to miss him a lot. I have made a promise to him to support my family financially, as he was the only breadwinner in the family. I will also look at my childhood photographs, revisit old memories with him and say a quiet prayer thanking him for all he did for our family,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-as-covid-strengthens-family-bonds-fathers-day-to-be-close-knit-affair/articleshow/83680911.cms||---

Each individual has received a Rs 1,000-worth grocery kit consisting of 22 items, enough for survival for a couple of weeks. The doctors inititated the project by providing the help for 40 visually-challenged people from Ilamanur village last month. When the information about the initiative spread, many groups approached them seeking similar help. They mobilized funds and relief materials and catered to every request. Dr R Balagurusamy, Dr R Amuthanilavan, Dr S Sabari Manikandan, Dr P Venkatesh, Dr Srividya Manjunath, Dr G Prabruram Niranjan and Dr C Sathish came together to form Aishwaryam Trust in 2014 to help terminally-ill patients with care and started a hospice in Vilachery. They have been taking care of patients abandoned on roadsides free of cost, while those who can afford make their own contribution for the treatment. Dr R Balagurusamy, managing trustee of the trust, said they verified the genuineness of every request they received by sending a person to check before making any commitments. “We reached out to 200 transgender persons from various parts of the city, 40 folk artists from Madhichiyam and Anna Nagar, 45 nagaswaram artists and differently-abled people in Kariapatti and 15 differently-abled people from Vilangudi,” hesaid. Apart from helping the needy, they also conducted sensitization activities to promote wearing masks and getting vaccinated. The team distributed free masks across the city in April. At least ?65,000-worth gloves, face shields, masks and PPE kits were sent to ESI hospitals in Chennai and Coimbatore and to a Covid-19 siddha care centre in Karur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tamil-nadu-doctors-lend-helping-hand-to-marginalised/articleshow/83681110.cms||V Devanathan
---||India||NGT halts CPCB, MoEF directions, directs study by expert panel for impact of Port in Dahanu||MUMBAI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) halted implementation of orders passed last year by MOEF and central pollution control board (CPCB) which effectively lifted ports out of a ‘prohibited’ category in Dahanu ecological fragile area, with no expert study conducted. The Tribunal directed that an expert panel must first study the impact of ports in such sensitive zones. National Fishworkers Union and other had petitioned the NGT to challenge these two directions contending that “are in a series of steps taken by the Central Government and its agencies to remove any potential impediments to the setting up of a port in Vadhawan.’’ The CPCB has last April directed a ‘harmonization’ of 242 industrial sectors into red, orange, green and white categories. The red category is the prohibited category and a revised classification placed ‘Ports’ in a non-industrial category. The Forum said Port are environmental pollutants and CPCB has pulled them out of the ‘prohibited’ list, with no prior study. The NGT principal bench in its order on June 15 said it “found merit in the contention that there cannot be an omnibus declaration of all ports and allied activities as ‘non-industrial’ so as to nullify the prohibition intended for protection of ecologically fragile area of Dahanu Taluka.’’ The NGT order said “classification’’ without first studying the impact of pollution of industrial activity in eco fragile zones would “defeat precautionary sustainable development principles’’. The expert panel must comprise at least five renowned experts, including expert in Marine Biology/Ecology and Wildlife Institute of India which may visit the site and interact with stake holders, directed NGT. Other members can be from EAC dealing with ports and harbours or otherwise. “Till such a study is carried out and fresh decision taken, the impugned direction and O.M. in so far as they apply to the Dahanu Taluka ecologically fragile area may not be given effect,’’ said the NGT order. The fishworkers Forum argued that the CPCB order would mean that Port can be undertaken in ecologically sensitive area, including the Dahanu Taluka ecologically fragile area, “though doing so is incompatible with the object of declaring such area as eco fragile and in violation of directions of the Supreme Court.’’ The MOEF directions would be against sustainable development, fishworkers argued adding, “having identified the TEPA as one such impediment given its order passed against the setting up of a port in Vadhwan previously, the MoEF has taken calculated steps to impair its effective functioning by withholding grants, moving the Supreme Court to do away with the DTEPA, appointing Secretary to Govt., instead of a retired high court judge, as Chairperson DTEPA,’’ the forum contended before the NGT. Ports and their operations including dredging, an intrinsic part, disturbs local ecosystems, brings sediments into the water column, and can stir up pollutants captured in the sediments, said the challenge. If port are considered ‘non-industrial’ activities, “they will evade environmental scrutiny,’’ they argued. The NGT order said, “The judgment of the Supreme Court in Bittu Sehgal v. UOI, mandates observance of Precautionary and Sustainable Development Principles for protection of the above ecologically fragile area in the light of NEERI report mentioned above. “ It added that the application shows that in the past there was attempt to set up big port which was found to be incompatible with the ecologically fragile area. Advocate Meena Kakalia appearing for the fishworkers Forum later said, “We welcome this order and hope that the committee constituted by the NGT reaffirms what has already been observed as far back as 1998 by the Dahanu Taluka Environment Protection Authority - that a port will have a deleterious impact on the environment in Dahanu and cannot be permitted in an ecologically fragile area.’’ The NGT said, “It is patent that there is no consideration to the issue of activities which cannot be allowed in the ecologically fragile area in terms of the Notification and judgment of the Supreme Court and also no study as to the activities which can be allowed having regard to the impact of pollution generated on the ecologically fragile area and added, "directions of CPCB and MOEF need to be revisited by undertaking assessment and evaluation by an expert group of impact of setting up port, on overall ecology of area." The NGT passed its order with no notice to MOEF and CPCB as it said it was “only directing compliance of pre-existing judgment of the SC.’’ But it gave both liberty to move the NGT if aggrieved by the June 15 order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ngt-halts-cpcb-moef-directions-directs-study-by-expert-panel-for-impact-of-port-in-dahanu/articleshow/83680976.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||India||Secy who boosted O2 supply while battling Covid dead||NEW DELHI: In early April, as the Covid case count was surging across the country, Guruprasad Mohapatra, secretary in the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT), was coordinating with states, other departments and the industry to scale up oxygen production to meet the rising demand, even as he himself tested positive. As the crisis deepened, Mohapatra — who died Saturday after spending almost eight weeks in hospital battling the disease and post-Covid complications — and his team members, some of whom had also been infected, made sure that oxygen supplies were scaled up to meet the unprecedented health crisis, including a plan to limit access to beyond the non-core sectors such as steel, oil and defence establishments. As the head of the empowered group of secretaries that was also dealing with critical medicine, he was working from home till he found it difficult to breathe and was hospitalised. As someone with abiding faith in the public healthcare system, he was one of the officers in the government who had warned about “overprescription” of certain repurposed medicines by private hospitals much before they were in short supply. Mohapatra was known to be a down-to-earth civil servantOver the last two months, colleagues of Guruprasad Mohapatra as well as seniors in the government a kept close watch on his condition, hoping against hope as his health deteriorated. As their worst fears came true on Saturday, a pall of gloom descended on the political and bureaucratic circles in the capital. PM Narendra Modi tweeted: “Saddened by the demise of Guruprasad Mohapatra, DPIIT secretary. I had worked with him extensively in Gujarat and at the Centre. He had a great understanding of administrative issues. Condolences to his family and friends. Om Shanti.” Over the years, the Gujarat cadre IAS officer had earned tremendous goodwill in the capital as a “down-to-earth” civil servant who would be approached by many looking to find solutions. Yet, the 59-year-old was known as someone who would not go along with decisions just because his superiors wanted him to. He spent last few years in Delhi, first as joint secretary in commerce department before moving to head the AAI. In 2019, he was appointed DPIIT secretary and had been working to promote domestic production of several essential products while also seeking FDI. “An outstanding bureaucrat, his work ethics and dedication to public service will remain worthy of emulation,” President Ram Nath Kovind said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/secy-who-boosted-o2-supply-while-battling-covid-dead/articleshow/83681131.cms||---

Students said the financial condition of many families has deteriorated due to heavy medical expenditure incurred on treatment of Covid-19 patients, the university should consider scrapping of examination fee and reducing fee charged under other heads. “Some law schools and technical universities across the country have reduced the fee and students have been refunded examination fee considering the pandemic situation. When there is no examination, why should the students pay examination fee,” asked Vishal Singh, a student of BA (Hons). The representatives of the All India Student Association also demanded fee waiver. “The social welfare department has still not released scholarships for poor students and a number of families are facing financial crisis. LU should consider giving concession on fee,” said BA student Devansh Krishna. “AKTU has declared that it would bear the expenses of students who have lost parents due to Covid and private schools are also giving fee concessions to students.

---||Delhi||Ballabgarh lynching: 4 years on, Junaid Khan's family is still waiting for justice||The Delhi-Faridabad highway, hazy with smoke from a thousand exhaust pipes and crammed with overloaded trucks, is a sign of an impatient city on the move. But off an exit, the highway tapers to a service lane and then to a dirt track, with putrid sewage water and garbage flowing from drains that were never completed. Time has stood still here. It’s been four years since the hadsa (incident) in which 15-year-old Junaid Khan was killed. But to his mother Saira Bano, it could have been yesterday. “Here,” Saira points to a bare verandah on the first floor of her barebricked home in Ballabhgarh’s Khandawali village, barely an hour from Delhi. “He was sitting here when he told me ‘Ammi jaan main kuch bada kaam karunga (Mom, I will do something big in life.)’” The sixth of eight children, Junaid had dreams of becoming an Imam at Delhi’s Jama Masjid and had already completed seven years of religious studies to become a hafiz from a madrasa in neighbouring Nuh. Three days later, on June 22, as he returned from a shopping trip with his brother Hashim and two friends, the dream was crushed. Ostensibly an argument over seats in a crowded Delhi-Mathura EMU (electric machine unit) train escalated to communal slurs, then to blows, and then worse. Junaid was allegedly knifed before being thrown out of the train at Asaoti station. By the time he was taken to hospital, it was too late. Saira remembers that day clearly. She was dressed in a red salwar kameez and had distributed bundi (a sweet eaten during festive occasions) outside her home. “There was so much happiness in the house. My sons had come home for Eid holidays and had got money from relatives to spend on new clothes,” she says. It was evening and the family was about to break their Ramzan fast when the calls started coming in. Her voice breaks and her eyes well up. The incident inspired #notinmyname protests across the country with many describing the mob lynchings as an assault on democracy. Little brother Adil misses him the most since Junaid looked after him. “I miss his laughter the most. He could make anyone laugh,” he says. The brothers talk of their missing sibling as someone who could charm the young and old, who learnt to ride a bike, loved chaat and biryani, and aspired for a better life. Within weeks of the incident, Junaid’s father Jalaluddin suffered a heart attack and had to be rushed to the hospital. He has two stents now and is a shadow of his former self. Between 2017 and 2018, six people were arrested in connection with Junaid’s death, and the weapon reported to have been used has been recovered. After some of the accused were let out on bail, the family approached the Supreme Court seeking a CBI investigation. The Supreme Court stayed the trial court proceedings in March 2018. By October 2018, all six were out on bail. Hearings have been on the back burner because of Covid-19. The family says that they have received some financial help but claim that the compensation promised by various political leaders did not materialise. There were reports of the panchayat trying to intervene to persuade the family to settle out of court. Recently, one of the accused was seen invoking Hindu pride at a function. “I fear everyone now. I do not send my boys very far. I would much rather see them safe at home even if it means less money to live on,” Saira says. The boys have strict instructions not to take the EMU and use the metro to commute if they do at all. When travelling outside the village, they wear trousers and shirts instead of the traditional kurta-pyjama and skull cap. But Adil says it has little effect. After the first lockdown he donned western clothes before approaching a neighbourhood factory for a loader’s job. “They asked my name. When I told them, they said we don’t hire Mohammedans,” he says. His older brother, 22-year-old Qasim, who is studying to be a Maulana says, “These days I find people get angry when they see us.” Despite the financial difficulties, the family plans to continue the legal battle. Saira says, “We cannot give up. Junaid must get justice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/four-years-after-junaids-lynching-his-family-is-still-waiting-for-justice/articleshow/83681295.cms||Himanshi Dhawan

Overall, 15% of the elderly were infected by Covid, while it was16.4% in Chennai. Delhi had the most cases followed by Mumbai and Chennai. More than half the respondents who were infected said they received lowest care and treatment, while more than 20% in Chennai said they witnessed a change in behaviour of their family members or caregivers during the pandemic. More than 35% of elders in Chennai said loss in businesses lockdown led to reduced family income, while 47% of youth caregivers in Chennai, mostly women, were not earning and 30.1% of young caregivers lost jobs, the highest, making it further difficult to provide for the elderly. At least 25.3% of caregivers said the elderly under their charge didn’t have the internet and found it difficult to buy essentials, while others didn’t take the effort to explain the basic smartphone features to the elderly with a smartphone so they could themselves reach out for help. While the elderly in Chennai had maximum awareness about vaccines against the virus, 47.5% said they were yet to get jabs. The report said 40% of young caregivers didn’t ensure elderly under them got vaccinated, onetenth said they did not provide Covid-related awareness to them and 6% said they didn’t ensure elderly wore a mask when visitors came. V Sivakumar, director Helpage India (Tamil Nadu), urged the state to work with communities and civil society groups to provide support to the elderly. “They must also ensure that every caregiver, even in old age homes, gets vaccinated.” Department of social welfare and women empowerment officials said volunteers were sent to check on the elderly daily. “They have a list of senior citizens and have shared their numbers,” said one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/1/5th-of-chennais-elderly-had-no-income-in-pandemic/articleshow/83681313.cms||Aditi R

An externment order was pending against Khan. He was arrested by a special team formed by SP Ghazipur. Apart from SO Karimuddinpur, two more cops have been suspended in this connection. ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan said, “On getting inputs regarding presence of Nanhe Khan at his residence despite an order of externment against him under Goonda Act on April 9, I had asked SP Ghazipur OP Singh to ensure his arrest.” The SP Ghazipur had initially asked SO Karimuddinpur Ram Nivas to probe the matter. However, the SO gave a report claiming that Nanhe Khan was not present in the district. When the police team raided the place of Khan, not only him but his son, who had thrashed a local youth two days ago, were caught. However, police faced resistance from locals from taking Nanhe Khan to the police station. “But, heavy police force foiled their bid and Khan was taken to police station,” said inspector Karimuddinpur, Balendra Yadav. Following this, SP Ghazipur suspended SO Ram Nivas, sub-inspector Sanjay Kumar Saroj and beat constable Dhirendra Nath Pandey in this connection. Officials said that further investigation against the suspended cops was continuing to know whether they performed laxity or had any nexus with Mukhtar’s gang members. Mukhtar aide’s ₹1.83Cr building seizedA building worth Rs 1.8 crore belonging to close accomplices of jailed don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari was confiscated in Bhiti area under Ghosi in Mau district on Saturday. With this, the cumulative financial loss inflicted on Mukhtar and his gang by government agencies has reached around Rs 289 crore. ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan said, “The two-storied building belonged to Suresh Singh and Divyanshu Rai. Both are active members of Mukhtar gang and had constructed this building with money illegally earned through extortion.” The seized building also houses a branch of Union Bank of India and UP Cooperative Federation office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/uttar-pradesh-khaki-moles-in-mukhtar-ansaris-gang-weeded-out-three-suspended/articleshow/83681302.cms||---
