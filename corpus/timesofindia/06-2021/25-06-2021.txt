Dave Smith, a retired driving instructor from Bristol in western England, said he tested positive 43 times, was hospitalised seven times and had made plans for his funeral.  "I'd resigned myself, I'd called the family in, made my peace with everybody, said goodbye,", he told BBCtelevision.  His wife, Linda, who quarantined with him at home, said: "There was a lot of times when we didn't think he was going to pull through. It's been a hell of a year".  Ed Moran, a consultant in infectious diseases at the University of Bristol and North Bristol NHS Trust, said Smith "had active virus in his body" throughout.  "We were able to prove that by sending a sample of his virus to university partners who managed to grow it, proving that it was not just left-over products that were triggering a PCR test but actually active, viable virus."  Smith recovered after treatment with a cocktail of synthetic antibodies developed by the US biotech firm Regeneron.  This was allowed on compassionate grounds in his case but the treatment regime is not clinically approved for use in Britain.  Results of a clinical trial published this month showed the treatment reduced deaths among severe Covid patients who are unable to mount a strong immune response.  "It's like you've been given your life back", Smith told the BBC.  He and his wife cracked open a bottle of champagne when he finally tested negative, 45 days after receiving the Regeneron drug and some 305 days after his first infection.  Smith's treatment was not part of an official medical trial but his case is now being studied by virologist Andrew Davidson at the University of Bristol.  A paper on his case will be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases in July, saying that his is thought to be "the longest infection recorded in the literature".  "Where does the virus hide away in the body? How can it stay just persistently infecting people? We don't know that," Davidson said.  Smith had a history of lung disease and had recently recovered from leukaemia when he caught the virus in March 2020.  He told The Guardian daily that since his recovery, he still gets breathless but has travelled in Britain and is teaching his granddaughter to drive.  "I've been down to the bottom and everything's brilliant now," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-man-tested-positive-for-virus-for-10-straight-months/articleshow/83820911.cms||---
---||World||Critic of Palestinian Authority dies after violent arrest||JERUSALEM: An outspoken critic of the Palestinian Authority who was a candidate in parliamentary elections called off earlier this year died after Palestinian security forces arrested him and beat him with batons on Thursday, his family said. Nizar Banat was a harsh critic of the PA, which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and had called on Western nations to cut off aid to it because of its authoritarianism and human rights violations. Earlier this week, another prominent activist was detained by the PA and held overnight after criticizing it on Facebook. The crackdown on dissent comes as the internationally-backed PA faces a growing backlash from Palestinians who view it as corrupt and increasingly autocratic, a manifestation of a three-decade peace process that is nowhere close to delivering Palestinian independence. Hundreds took to the streets in protest after word spread of Banat's death. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who was elected to a four-year term in 2005, has little to show after more than a decade of close security coordination with Israel. The 85-year-old leader has been powerless to stop the expansion of Jewish settlements, home demolitions, evictions in Jerusalem and deadly Israeli military raids, and was largely ignored during the recent unrest in Jerusalem and the 11-day Gaza war. Western nations nevertheless view the PA as a key partner for rebuilding Gaza, which is ruled by the militant Hamas group, and eventually reviving the moribund peace process. Mohammed Banat, a cousin who witnessed the arrest, said a group of men, some wearing masks, burst into the house where Nizar was staying and sprayed everyone with pepper spray. "They beat Nizar with batons on his head and body," he told The Associated Press. "They did not identify themselves and we did not recognize them. They arrested Nizar and disappeared." In a brief statement, the Hebron governorate said Nizar's "health deteriorated" when Palestinian forces went to arrest him early Thursday. It said he was taken to a hospital where he was later pronounced dead. The United States, the European Union and the United Nations called for an investigation, and Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh announced the formation of an investigative committee. Dr. Samir Abu Zaarour, a forensic pathologist for the Independent Commission for Human Rights who attended the autopsy, said the death was "unnatural" and ruled out a heart attack or stroke. He said final results will only be available after further testing. Pictures of the body released by the family appear to show bruising on his head and legs. Hundreds of protesters gathered in the West Bank city of Ramallah and tried to march to the PA's headquarters, chanting "The people want the downfall of the regime" and "Abbas, you are not one of us, take your dogs and leave." Palestinian security forces fired tear gas at the marchers and beat people with wooden batons. Tahani Mustafa, an analyst at the Crisis Group, an international think thank, said there's been "increasing repression" since the PA was sidelined and widely derided during the Gaza war. "At this point the PA can't really afford any level of criticism," she said. She added that the international community, which has trained and equipped Palestinian security forces, "needs to take some responsibility" and push for accountability and change. In early May, gunmen fired bullets, stun grenades and tear gas at Nizar Banat's home near the West Bank city of Hebron, where his wife was inside with their children. He blamed the attack on Abbas' Fatah party, which dominates the security forces. "The Europeans need to know that they are indirectly funding this organization," he told The Associated Press in May in an interview at a house where he was hiding out. "They fire their guns into the air at Fatah celebrations, they fire their guns in the air when Fatah leaders fight each other and they fire their guns at people who oppose Fatah." The EU delegation to the Palestinians tweeted that it was "shocked and saddened" by Banat's death and called for a "full, independent, and transparent investigation." The UN's Mideast envoy, Tor Wennesland, said the "perpetrators must be brought to justice." The US State Department echoed those calls. In a statement, it expressed "serious concerns about Palestinian Authority restrictions on the exercise of freedom of expression by Palestinians and harassment of civil society activists and organizations." Earlier this week, Palestinian security forces detained a prominent activist and held him overnight after he took to Facebook to criticize the PA's arrest of another individual. Issa Amro is an outspoken critic of both Israel and the PA, and has been detained by both in the past. "I feel that my life is in danger like Nizar Banat. I don't feel there is anyone who can protect me from attacks by outlaws affiliated with some security authorities," Amro said. "Unfortunately, there's a state of security chaos since the cancellation of the elections." A recent poll showed plummeting support for Abbas, who cancelled the first elections in 15 years in April when it looked like his fractured Fatah party would suffer another humiliating defeat to Hamas, which seized Gaza from Abbas' forces in 2007. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Abbas when he visited the region after the Gaza war last month, and the Biden administration is working to bolster the PA after relations fell to an all-time low under President Donald Trump. The European Union has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in direct aid to the PA over the years. Earlier this week, it signed an agreement to provide $425 million in loans to the PA and Palestinian banks. Mustafa, of the Crisis Group, said such initiatives will be "incredibly ineffective" unless the US presses for political renewal that allows the Palestinians to choose their own leaders. "Any pursuit toward the peace process will not be accepted by the majority of Palestinians if it's being done on behalf of a small cluster of people that they do not see as being representative or acting in their own interest, which is what we are seeing now," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/critic-of-palestinian-authority-dies-after-violent-arrest/articleshow/83820055.cms||---

The Diamonstein-Spielvogel Institute for New York City History, Politics, and Community Activism will chronicle "important political, social, and cultural moments from the mid-1900s to the present," the historical society announced Thursday. "We are so grateful for the initiative and support of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Foundation for this new endeavor, which will help scholars and the general public to understand how political and social movements, focused on balancing individuals' right to self-determination with their responsibility to one another, have shaped our city's history," said Dr. Louise Mirrer, the society's president and CEO, said in a statement. Initial contributions to the archive will include documents on the building of the High Line in Manhattan. The archive also will include materials already available at the society, including those on Occupy Wall Street. "The Diamonstein-Spielvogel Foundation is very pleased to initiate this vital enterprise," Dr. Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, the foundation's chair, said in a statement. "The Diamonstein-Spielvogel Institute for NYC History, Politics, and Community Activism addresses key issues in New York City. We will bring together collective memory and experiences for research and manifestations, so that present and future historians can place these multiple histories within a meaningful context." Diamonstein-Spielvogel, a former commissioner of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and former chair of the New York State Council on the Arts, is contributing her own papers to the archive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/archive-at-nyc-historical-society-to-focus-on-social-change/articleshow/83821953.cms||---
---||World||UN: 275 million people used drugs worldwide in 2020||BERLIN: Around 275 million people used drugs worldwide last year, while over 36 million people suffered from drug use disorders, according to the World Drug Report released Thursday by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna. The report also said many countries saw a rise in the use of cannabis during the coronavirus pandemic. In surveys of health professionals across 77 countries, 42per cent said cannabis use had increased. A rise in the non-medical use of pharmaceutical drugs was also observed in the same period. The report further noted that in the last 24 years, cannabis potency had increased as much as four times in some parts, even as the percentage of adolescents who perceived the drug as harmful fell by as much as 40per cent. This development came despite evidence that cannabis use is associated with a variety of health and other harms, especially among regular long-term users. "Lower perception of drug use risks has been linked to higher rates of drug use, and the findings of UNODC's 2021 World Drug Report highlight the need to close the gap between perception and reality to educate young people and safeguard public health,” UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly said. According to the latest global estimates, about 5.5per cent of those between 15 and 64 have used drugs at least once in the past year, while 36.3 million people, or 13per cent of the total number of people who use drugs, suffer from drug use disorders, the report said. Globally, over 11 million people are estimated to inject drugs, half of whom are living with Hepatitis C. Opioids continue to account for the largest burden of disease attributed to drug use, according to the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/un-275-million-people-used-drugs-worldwide-in-2020/articleshow/83822165.cms||---
---||World||Thousands of vaccines set to expire in Romania||BUCHAREST: Romania's national vaccination committee chief announced tens of thousands of doses of AstraZeneca vaccine are set to expire and will likely have to be destroyed. "On June 30, 35,000 AstraZeneca vaccine doses expire. We probably won't be able to use them. They will enter the destruction procedure," Valeriu Gheorghita said in a press conference Thursday. AstraZeneca is one of four authorized vaccines currently being administered in Romania but has faced a low uptake in the country of more than 19 million, where around just 23% of the population have been fully inoculated against Covid-19. In recent weeks, daily vaccinations have sharply dropped. In mid-May, around 100,000 vaccines were being administered a day, compared to around just 25,000 a day over the last week. Since the pandemic began, more than a million Covid-19 infections have been confirmed in Romania, and nearly 33,000 have died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/thousands-of-vaccines-set-to-expire-in-romania/articleshow/83822776.cms||---
---||World||US blocks solar panel materials from China over labour abuses||WASHINGTON: Chinese-made materials used in solar panels will be barred from the US market as part of a broader effort to halt commerce tied to China's repressive campaign against Uyghurs and other minorities, the Biden administration said Thursday. US Customs and Border Protection will immediately halt shipments from the Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd. and its subsidiaries under a law that bans the import of goods produced with forced labor. In addition, the Commerce Department will add six Chinese entities involved in the production of raw materials and components for the solar industry to a blacklist barring them from access to the American market, the administration said. These latest moves could make it harder for the US to meet renewable energy goals aimed at addressing climate change because about 45% of the global supply of the polysilicon used to make photovoltaic cells for solar panels comes from Xinjiang region. A CBP investigation found evidence that the industry is tainted by forced labor tied to the campaign against ethnic minorities. ``Our environmental goals will not be achieved on the backs of human beings in a forced labor environment,'' Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said at a news conference. ``We are going to root out forced labor and we are going to use alternative products that are manufactured legitimately in keeping with our values and our commitment to a fair market place.'' It's part of a campaign that has gained global momentum to apply economic pressure on the Chinese government over its forced assimilation of largely Muslim minorities in the far western Xinjiang region. The US has already banned cotton and tomatoes from the area and both Canada and Britain have also moved to restrict imports over the issue. The administration said the Labor Department will also update its list of goods known to be produced with forced labor to include polysilicon from China. That will put additional pressure on US manufacturers to remove Chinese components from their supply chains. CBP is still investigating the extent of Hoshine in the US market but direct shipments over the past 2 1/2 years totaled about $6 million while imports that include material from the company were about $150 million, said Ana Hinojosa, who runs the agency's trade enforcement team. The company's shipments to the country have declined amid expectations that the US would take some kind of enforcement action over abuses in Xinjiang. China denies allegations that it uses forced labor in Xinjiang or elsewhere and has broadly rejected the consistent and well-documented reports that Uyghurs and other minorities have been detained under brutal conditions, subjected to indoctrination and intensive surveillance intended to force them to assimilate into the dominant Han culture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-blocks-solar-panel-materials-from-china-over-labor-abuses/articleshow/83823256.cms||---
---||World||Election Day should be a 'day off': US President Joe Biden||WASHINGTON: Election Day should be a holiday for workers in the United States, President Joe Biden said Thursday. "If I had my way, and I think it is really important, every Election Day would be a day off," he said because people who work certain shifts cannot make it to the polls. Biden also told reporters he plans to travel the country to push voting rights, during remarks in the White House about a bipartisan infrastructure agreement. Election Day, traditionally the second Tuesday in November in the United States, is not a federal holiday, although some states require employers to give workers time off to vote. Federal holidays are created through Congressional legislation; last week Biden signed a bill to make June 19 a federal holiday commemorating the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans. How and when US citizens can vote has become a political battleground, as Republicans issue new bills that restrict voting hours, vote-by-mail and other measures designed to bring more people to the polls. A sweeping Democratic bill to expand voting hours and methods failed to pass Congress this week. Biden also had sharp words for state Republicans who he said are pushing for vote recounts when they don't like how the vote turned out. "Who in God's name, as my mother would say, died and left them boss?," Biden asked. "Your vote has to count when you cast it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/election-day-should-be-a-day-off-us-president-joe-biden/articleshow/83823288.cms||---

The cause of the crash near the hamlet of Korpikyulia, 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the city, has not been determined. The national guard said the Mi-8 helicopter was not carrying arms on the flight.

---||World||San Francisco to require vaccinations for all city employees||SAN FRANCISCO: San Francisco city workers will be required to be vaccinated against the coronavirus when a vaccine receives full federal approval.  The policy covering 35,000 municipal workers may be the first by any city or county in the US, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday.  Employees who refuse to get vaccinated and don't get a medical or religious exemption could be fired, the Chronicle said.  The three Covid-19 vaccines currently available in the U.S. are being dispensed under emergency authorization by the Food and Drug Administration.  They are expected to receive full approval in several months. San Francisco city employees will then have 10 weeks to get their shots.  San Francisco, a compact city of nearly 900,000 residents, has had some of the strictest pandemic-related restrictions in the country. The city was among the first in the nation to order a lockdown last year and its vaccination rates are some of the highest in the nation. At least 80% of residents are partially vaccinated and 70% of those 12 and older are fully vaccinated, according to Mayor London Breed.  The vaccination policy for city employees covers a wide range of jobs but it does not include teachers, who are school district employees.  "It's really a decision for the health and safety of our employees and our public that we serve," said Carol Isen, San Francisco director of human resources. "It's about protecting the city as an employer from what we deem to be unacceptable risk."  Starting Monday, employees will have 30 days to report to the city their current vaccination status, including showing proof of vaccination by uploading a photo of their vaccination card or the QR code generated by the state's digital verification system, Isen said.  About 55% of city employees have said they are at least partially vaccinated, according to the Department of Human Resources. About 5% of employees have said they are not vaccinated. The vaccination status of the remaining 40% is not known.  Mawuli Tugbenyoh, chief of policy for the Department of Human Resources, said that "repercussions (for refusing vaccination) go all the way up to termination. But we're focused on the education and outreach part of it now."  The city is the second-largest employer in San Francisco after the University of California, San Francisco. Earlier this month, the University of California reversed course said it will require all students, staff and faculty to be vaccinated against the coronavirus this fall.  UC has more than 280,000 students and 227,000 faculty and staff, and expects to return to mostly in-person instruction at its 10 campuses starting in August.  Dr. Grant Colfax, director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, said protecting the workforce was especially important with the highly infectious delta variant gaining traction across the United States.  "Given that the delta variant is here and likely to increase in terms of its prevalence across the city, we need to do everything we can to protect our city workforce and the public we serve, especially as the city reopens," Colfax said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/san-francisco-to-require-vaccinations-for-all-city-employees/articleshow/83823953.cms||---
---||World||Mayor-elect arrested in Mexico in killing of candidate||MEXICO CITY: The mayor-elect of a small town in Mexico has been arrested for allegedly masterminding the killing of the candidate he replaced in the June 6 elections, prosecutors said Thursday. Omar Ramírez Fuentes won the election in the town of Cazones because of the popularity of René Tovar, who was shot to death two days before the vote. Ramírez Fuentes served as Tovar's campaign manager and was officially listed as his substitute from the start of the race. Prosecutors in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz said Thursday that Ramírez Fuentes had his boss killed so he could take over as mayor. There has been some evidence that drug cartels may have been behind many of the killings of three dozen candidates murdered in the run-up to the June 6 elections for mayorships, governors and Congress. Most of the victims were running for local posts, and experts said the cartels want to co-opt local police and government because it makes it easier to operate kidnapping, drug and extortion schemes. But the killing in Cazones, a town of about 24,000 near the Gulf shore, suggests that motives in the killings may have been varied. Tovar and Ramírez Fuentes were running on the ticket of the small Citizen's Movement party. Another suspect has been detained who may have been the triggerman in the hit. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador referred to the case during his news conference on Thursday, saying, “According to the investigations, one of the possible suspects was his (Tovar's) campaign manager, so that he could take over the candidacy and win.” “We don't want this, this horror,” López Obrador said, The Veracruz state election board will meet in the next few days to decide how to fill the mayoral post. López Obrador also said Thursday that another suspect had been detained in the 2019 ambush slayings of nine US-Mexican dual citizens near the northern border, bringing to more than 20 the number of arrests in the case. “Practically all of those who participated (in the killings) have been detained," the president said. Adrián LeBarón, the father of one of the murdered woman, wrote in his Twitter account that the suspect arrested was known by the nickname “Tolteca” and was a leader of the gang, adding, “Today there is one criminal less on the streets.” The three women and six children from the extended Langford, LeBaron and Miller families were ambushed and slain by suspected drug gang assassins on November 4, 2019. Initial investigations suggested a squad of gunmen from a drug gang that originated in the border city of Ciudad Juarez set up the ambush to kill members of a rival cartel. However, relatives of the victims say that at some point, the gunmen must have known who they were killing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/mayor-elect-arrested-in-mexico-in-killing-of-candidate/articleshow/83823592.cms||---

Italy has registered 127,380 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the eight-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.26 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with Covid-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 2,027 on Thursday, down from 2,140 a day earlier. There were 12 new admissions to intensive care units, up from 4 on Wednesday. The total number of intensive care patients fell to 328 from a previous 344. Some 188,191 tests for Covid-19 were carried out in the past day, compared with a previous 198,031, the health ministry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/italy-reports-28-coronavirus-deaths-on-thursday-927-new-cases/articleshow/83823654.cms||---
---||World||"We have deal": Joe Biden, bipartisan senators on infrastructure||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden announced on Thursday that “we have a deal,” signaling a bipartisan agreement on a $ 953 billion infrastructure plan that would achieve his top legislative priority and validate his efforts to reach across the political aisle. Biden made a surprise appearance in front of the cameras with members of the group of senators, Republicans and Democrats, after an agreement was reached Thursday. Details of the deal were scarce to start, but the pared-down plan, with $ 559 billion in new spending, has rare bipartisan backing and could open the door to the president's more sweeping $ 4 trillion proposals later on. The president said not everyone got what they wanted and that other White House priorities would be done separately in a congressional budget process known as reconciliation. “We've struck a deal,” Biden then tweeted. “A group of senators – five Democrats and five Republicans – has come together and forged an infrastructure agreement that will create millions of American jobs.” The senators have struggled over how to pay for the new spending but left for the White House with a sense of confidence that funding issues had been addressed. Biden's top aides had met with senators for back-to-back meetings on Capitol Hill and later huddled with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. The agreement comes with a complex legislative push. Pelosi on Thursday welcomed the bipartisan package, but she warned that it must be paired with the president's bigger goals now being prepared by Congress under a separate so-called the budget reconciliation process. “This is important,” Pelosi said. “There ain't going to be a bipartisan bill without a reconciliation bill,” The Democratic leader vowed the House would not vote on it until the Senate had dealt with both packages. The major hurdle for a bipartisan agreement has been financing. Biden demanded no new taxes on anyone making less than $ 400,000, while Republican lawmakers were unwilling to raise taxes beyond such steps as indexing the gasoline tax to inflation. But senators departed for the White House Thursday with a sense of confidence that funding issues had been addressed. “We're still refining the details, but from my perspective, it is paid for," said Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican and one of 10 lawmakers who met with Biden for roughly 30 minutes. Republican Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said he was confident the agreement had Biden's backing. “We wouldn't be going there if he wasn't supportive of the deal,” said Cassidy, adding that the president ”wants to make it flourish. One member of the bipartisan group, Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, met privately ahead of the White House meeting with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell at the Capitol and said afterward that the Kentucky senator “remains open-minded and he's listening still.” Biden has sought $1.7 trillion in his American Jobs Plan, part of nearly $4 trillion in broad infrastructure spending on roads, bridges and broadband internet but also including the so-called care economy of child care centers, hospitals and elder care. With Republicans opposed to Biden's proposed corporate tax rate increase, from 21per cent to 28per cent, the group has looked at other ways to raise revenue. Biden rejected their idea to allow gas taxes paid at the pump to rise with inflation, viewing it as a financial burden on American drivers. The broad reconciliation bill would likely include tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, so a tension still exists over funding for some Republicans and business groups. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce came out Thursday applauding the bipartisan infrastructure agreement, but Neil Bradley, its executive vice president, warned that “some in Congress are trying to torpedo the deal” unless they get trillions in additional spending. “These are the kind of tactics that have created the mess we are in today, and they must be rejected,” Bradley said. According to a White House readout of the Wednesday meeting with Schumer and Pelosi, the leaders talked with acting Budget Director Shalanda Young, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice, and they discussed the two-track approach — the smaller bipartisan deal now emerging and the more sweeping plan of Democratic priorities. Schumer said the leaders “support the concepts” they have heard from the bipartisan negotiations. The Democratic leaders also insisted on the two-part process ahead, starting with initial votes in July to consider the bipartisan deal and to launch the lengthy procedure for the Democrats' proposal, now drafted at nearly $6 trillion. The Democrats' bigger proposal would run through the budget reconciliation process, which would allow passage of Biden's priorities by majority vote, without the need for support from Republicans to overcome the Senate's 60-vote threshold. It would require multiple rounds of voting that are likely to extend into fall. Like Pelosi, Schumer said, “One can't be done without the other.” That's a signal to both parties of the road ahead. Liberal Democrats have been wary of the bipartisan effort because they see it as insufficient and worry it will take the place of Biden's bigger plan. Republicans are also skeptical of passing a bipartisan bill only to be faced with an even bigger Democratic plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/we-have-deal-joe-biden-bipartisan-senators-on-infrastructure/articleshow/83823847.cms||---
---||World||Preliminary hearing set in Wisconsin bar shooting||KENOSHA, Wisconsin: A judge on Thursday set a preliminary hearing for a Wisconsin man charged with killing three people and wounding three others in a shooting at a crowded bar. Rakayo Vinson, 24, of Kenosha, faces three counts of first-degree intentional homicide and three counts of attempted first-degree intentional homicide in the April 18 shooting at Somers House Tavern in the village of Somers in Kenosha County. He would face life in prison if convicted on any of the counts. Kenosha County Court Commissioner Loren Keating scheduled a preliminary hearing for July 9 at 10:15 a.m. Keating also appointed Donald Bielski to serve as Vinson's attorney. Bielski declined to comment when contacted Thursday by The Associated Press, saying he had not yet read the criminal complaint against Vinson. The complaint alleges that Vinson got into a fight at the crowded bar before opening fire and fleeing. Video shows Vinson exchanging fire with one of the victims, Kevin Donaldson, outside the tavern, according to the complaint. Cedric Gaston, 24, Atkeem Stevenson, 26, and Donaldson, 22, all of Kenosha were killed. Bond for Vinson is set at $4 million cash. Somers is about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of Milwaukee, not far from the Illinois-Wisconsin border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/preliminary-hearing-set-in-wisconsin-bar-shooting/articleshow/83824408.cms||---
---||World||A look at high-profile cases over killings by US police||MINNEAPOLIS: Former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin faces decades in prison when he is sentenced Friday in George Floyd's death. A teenage bystander filmed Chauvin pinning Floyd to the street for about 9 1/2 minutes on Memorial Day 2020 as Floyd's ``I can't breathe'' cries faded to silence. A jury needed only parts of two days in April to return guilty verdicts on murder and manslaughter charges after three weeks of testimony. Legal experts have said 30 years is likely the most Chauvin, 45, could get without the judge in the case risking being overturned on appeal. And most of those experts thought 20 to 25 was more likely for the former officer. It has been rare to charge police with crimes in the death of civilians, and rarer still for them to be convicted. Here's a look at other high-profile killings by police and the outcome of the case: ERIC GARNER Eric Garner, 43, died in July 2014 in New York City after a white officer placed him in a chokehold when Garner refused to be handcuffed for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. A Staten Island grand jury declined to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo in December of that year. The Justice Department said in 2019 that it wouldn't file civil rights charges after a yearslong investigation. MICHAEL BROWN Michael Brown, 18, was fatally shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri, touching off weeks of sometimes violent protests. A St. Louis County grand jury declined later that year to indict Wilson in the unarmed Black teen's death, and the U.S. Department of Justice later also declined to charge him. Wesley Bell, the current St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, conducted a five-month review of witness statements, forensic reports and other evidence and announced in July that he would not charge Wilson. LAQUAN MCDONALD Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke shot 16 times at Laquan McDonald, killing the Black 17-year-old as he walked away from officers in October 2014. Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder the same day the city released the shocking dashcam video of the shooting. Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder in 2018 and sentenced to nearly seven years in prison. TAMIR RICE Tamir Rice, 12, was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer in November 2014 after officers responded to a 911 call from a man drinking beer and waiting for a bus who said a ``guy'' was pointing a gun at people. Tamir, who was Black, had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband and was shot after the officers' cruiser skidded to a stop just feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The U.S. Justice Department announced last year that it would not bring federal criminal charges, saying the quality of video of the shooting was too poor for prosecutors to establish what had happened. WALTER SCOTT Michael Slager, a white South Carolina police officer, shot Walter Scott in the back as the unarmed 50-year-old Black man fled following a 2015 traffic stop. In 2016, a mistrial was declared after the jury deadlocked over a verdict in Slager's murder trial. The next year, Slager pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott's civil rights and prosecutors dropped state murder charges. Slager was sentenced to 20 years in prison. FREDDIE GRAY Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black man, died in 2015 after he suffered a spinal injury while handcuffed and shackled in a Baltimore police van, sparking weeks of unrest across the city. Three officers were acquitted and prosecutors dropped the remaining state cases in 2016. The U.S. Department of Justice announced in 2017 that it wouldn't bring federal charges against the six officers involved in the arrest, saying it did not find enough evidence to prove the officers willfully violated Gray's civil rights. PHILANDO CASTILE Philando Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria worker, was shot five times by a St. Anthony, Minnesota police officer during a 2016 traffic stop after Castile informed the officer he was armed. The shooting gained widespread attention after Castile's girlfriend, who was in the car with her then-4-year-old daughter, livestreamed its gruesome aftermath on Facebook. Officer Jeronimo Yanez testified that Castile was pulling his gun out of his pocket. Yanez was acquitted of manslaughter. JUSTINE RUSZCZYK DAMOND Justine Ruszczyk Damond, an unarmed white dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia, was fatally shot in 2017 by Minneapolis Police Officer Mohamed Noor when she approached his squad car in the alley behind her home minutes after calling 911 to report a possible rape. Noor testified at trial that a loud bang on the squad car startled him and his partner and that he fired to protect his partner's life. He was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter and sentenced in 2019 to 12 1/2 years in prison. JORDAN EDWARDS Roy Oliver, a white Texas police officer, fired at a car full of teenagers as it drove away from a large house party in April 2017, fatally shooting 15-year-old Jordan Edwards, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. Police initially said the vehicle backed up toward officers ``in an aggressive manner,'' but later admitted that bodycam video showed the vehicle was moving forward as officers approached. Oliver was convicted of murder in 2018 and sentenced to 15 years in prison. BREONNA TAYLOR Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Louisville emergency medical worker studying to become a nurse, was shot several times in her hallway after three plainclothes narcotics detectives busted down the door of her apartment in the middle of the night in March 2020. A grand jury brought no charges against officers in her death, although one was indicted for shooting into a neighboring home that had people inside. Prosecutors said two officers who fired at Taylor were justified in using force to protect themselves after they faced gunfire from her boyfriend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/a-look-at-high-profile-cases-over-killings-by-us-police/articleshow/83824505.cms||---
---||World||New York to add 'X' gender mark on government IDs||ALBANY: New Yorkers will be able to designate their sex as "female," "male" or "X" on driver's licenses and birth certificates under a law that Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed Thursday.  Nonbinary New Yorkers sued in March arguing the state was discriminating against them by failing to provide the "X" option to indicate nonbinary, intersex, undesignated or other.  The new law will take effect in 180 days.  New Yorkers will no longer have to publish their name change, address, birth place and birth date in a newspaper, which the previous law requires within 60 days of a name change. They could also ask to seal sex designation papers because of the risk of violence or discrimination. And the law precludes courts from requiring the individual to notify federal immigration authorities about their sex designation change. Bill supporters, including Democratic sponsors Sen. Brad Hoylman and Assemblymember Daniel O'Donnell, said it's too hard for transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and intersex New Yorkers to obtain accurate ID documents needed to access health care, employment, travel, housing and education.  Nearly two-thirds of transgender New Yorkers said none of their IDs had the name and gender they preferred in a 2015 survey of nearly 1,800 New York residents by the National Center for Transgender Equality.  "The Gender Recognition Act won't just allow people to access accurate identity documents," New York Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Donna Lieberman said in a statement. "It will bring an end to the government-sanctioned stigma, red tape, and discrimination that has accompanied New Yorkers seeking identity documents that reflect who they are for far too long."  The law would also allow space on a drivers' license that indicates if an applicant is a veteran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-york-to-add-x-gender-mark-on-government-ids/articleshow/83824826.cms||---

Moroccan foreign minister Nasser Bourita warned of terrorist threats sweeping across parts of the continent. "(Africa) is not only the new ground of returning foreign terrorist fighters, but it has also become a homeland for terrorists that perpetuated last year alone, about 7,108 attacks that caused 12,519 victims," Bourita said. He said the new office in Rabat will seek to "unite our efforts to deal with the complex and evolving terrorist threat." Vladimir Voronkov, Under-Secretary-General of the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, said the office "will allow the United Nations to raise African countries' capabilities, especially in West Africa and the Sahel, where terrorist groups threaten stability and peace."

But while home minister Amit Shah, in response to insistence from the NC, PDP and Congress, did reiterate the Centre’s commitment to upgrade the UT, he made it clear that the immediate priority was early holding of polls after the delimitation commission had wrapped up the exercise to redraw the boundaries of assembly constituencies.

Crucially,Expressing his wish to remove “Dilli ki doori” (distance between Centre and J&K) as well as “Dil ki doori” (distrust), Modi said his government was fully committed to taking forward the democratic process in J&K against the backdrop of a three-tier panchayati raj system which is in place for the first time in the UT. Conduct of assembly polls, just like the DDC polls, was a priority, he added. Though the Centre’s action to nullify Article 370 was criticised, it was not a sticking point or a faultine in the discussions. Most leaders called for restoration of statehood, but did not insist on it being a prerequisite for holding polls or their participation in it.

Shah assured all for restoration of statehood.” However, indicating that statehood may follow only after installation of an elected government in J&K, home minister Amit Shah tweeted after the meeting, “Delimitation exercise and peaceful elections are important milestones in restoring statehood as promised in Parliament.” Shah gave an overview of development, transparency and people-centric initiatives undertaken in J&K since abrogation of Article 370. He said 90% saturation in central schemes had been achieved; road projects, seven new medical colleges set up; and a new Rs 28,400 crore industrial policy notified with the proposed creation of 4.5 lakh jobs.

Lou Leon Guerrero has been advised by her Physicians' Advisory Group to consider lifting the US territory's travel restrictions once 75% of the adult population has been fully vaccinated, the Pacific Daily News reported Thursday. Guam has already lifted travel quarantine and testing rules for fully vaccinated people. Everyone else must be tested within three days of their arrival to avoid quarantine. Currently, 72% of Guam's adult population is fully vaccinated, officials report. The islands could be just days away from 75%, the newspaper reported. At 80%, the governor said she will "liberate" people from the pandemic. Her goal is to reach 80% by July 21. "My vision for Guam after July 21 is to get back to normal," the governor said, adding that she would still encourage masks but plans to drop occupancy limits and social gathering restrictions. Guam's tourism economy has suffered amid the pandemic and the territory is looking for ways to jumpstart the business. "With more residents protected by vaccines, we've made great strides to shift from Covid-19 response to now, recovery,'' the governor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/restrictions-ease-as-guam-nears-75-of-adults-vaccinated/articleshow/83824465.cms||---

The Department for Transport said it expects to implement the new policy in phases later this summer. The change would apply to fully vaccinated people traveling to destinations on the government's "amber" list, which currently covers much of the world, including the US and most of the European Union.  The plans were announced after airlines and holiday providers demanded that the government ease restrictions on international travel that have crippled the travel industry. Protests took place around the country on Wednesday with pilots, hoteliers and travel agents demanding relief.  "We're moving forward with efforts to safely reopen international travel this summer, and thanks to the success of our vaccination program, we're now able to consider removing the quarantine period for fully vaccinated UK arrivals from amber countries - showing a real sign of progress," Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in a statement.  Almost 61% of the UK adult population is fully vaccinated, while 83% have received one dose.  The government also added 17 countries and territories, including Malta, the Balearic Islands and Madeira, to its "green" list of safe travel destinations. People traveling to these destinations will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days when they return to the UK.  The destinations added to the green list are: Malta, Madeira, the Balearic Islands, Anguilla, Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, Pitcairn Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands, Antigua, Barbuda, Dominica, Barbados and Grenada. The changes take effect at 4 am June 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-plans-to-ease-quarantine-rules-for-travel-to-us-eu/articleshow/83825381.cms||---

While the pandemic has led to a significant increase in biomedical waste generation, disposal facilities have not gone up proportionately, said the study. Global studies have associated increased Covid risks with a rise in biomedical waste (BMW). The 'Assessment of Bio-Medical Waste Before and During the Emergency of Novel Coronavirus Disease Pandemic in India: A Gap Analysis' study, published recently in the journal Waste Management & Research, highlights how most states fare poorly. The study said 23 of the 35 states and Union territories, including Maharashtra, still follow deep burial methods, restricted by the Centre. It said 70% of the states do not have well-established systems to monitor common BMW treatment facilities (CBMWTFs) and only 12 have upgraded as per new emission rules. Two hundred CBMWTFs are available across India, but are insufficient. Professor Aparajita Chattopadhyay from IIPS, who supervised the study, said: "All states which generate over 100 metric ton a month should be considered high priority." There should be special emphasis on hilly states, said Rahul Rajak, lead researcher, who studied the facilities along with Ravi Kumar Mahto and Jitender Prasad. Data from Central Pollution Control Board, used in the study, shows states such as Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Delhi, generated over 70% of the Covid waste in the country. Statistics showed India generated 32,996 metric tonnes of Covid waste from June to December 2020. Maharashtra was the worst offender (789.9 metric tonnes a month).

---||World||Taiwan 'needs to prepare' for possible military conflict with China, says foreign minister||TAIPEI, Taiwan: Taiwan's foreign minister Joseph Wu has said that China's escalating military intimidation of Taipei shows that the self-governed island 'needs to prepare' for a possible military conflict. In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Wu said: "As Taiwan decision makers, we cannot take any chances. We have to be prepared... When the Chinese government is saying they would not renounce the use of force, and they conduct military exercises around Taiwan, we would rather believe that it is real." His remarks come after Taiwan reported the largest daily incursion by Chinese military planes into its self-declared Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). The incursion by 28 Chinese warplanes including fighter jets and bombers was seen as a show of strength by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). Wu has been accused by China last month of being a "diehard separatist" after remarks he made during a news conference that Taiwan would fight "to the very last day" if attacked by China. In response, Wu told CNN he is "honoured" to be targeted by Communist authorities in Beijing. "Authoritarianism cannot tolerate truth. If they continue to say that they want to pursue me for the rest of my life, I'm not really concerned about that," he said. Wu also remarked that Taiwan cannot accept unification with China, especially as events in Hong Kong had shown that safeguarding Taiwan's sovereignty is crucial to protect its position as the world's only Chinese-speaking democracy. He noted the imposition of the draconian national security law in Hong Kong, drafted by the ruling elite in Beijing, has been used to silence the city's pro-democracy movement. "If you look at the situation in Hong Kong, it is a modern tragedy," said the Taiwanese foreign minister. Referring to Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily's shutdown, the minister said: "The Apple Daily in Hong Kong is a symbol of independent journalism, and the Chinese government's motivation is to knock down that symbol. It is very sad for me to see what's happening," Wu said, while stressing that Taiwan is already a democracy. Wu also stressed Taipei is willing to work toward achieving peace across the Taiwan Strait, and he called on Chinese leaders to jointly strive for a sustainable and peaceful coexistence. "The status quo would include Taiwan not run or ruled by the People's Republic of China... I think it is a joint responsibility between Taiwan and China to have a peaceful and civil relation between the two sides, and also for a dialogue to take place," he told CNN. He also accused China of using hybrid warfare to undermine public confidence in democracy on the island. "(China) uses cognitive warfare, disinformation campaigns and military intimidation to create a lot of anxiety among the Taiwanese people," he said. The foreign minister accused Beijing-sponsored entities of publishing fake news stories to divide Taiwan's population, including messages that exaggerated the island's Covid-19 death toll. "We have to engage in asymmetric warfare, so that China understands that there is a certain cost that it has to pay if they want to initiate a war against Taiwan," he stressed. Taiwan and mainland China have been governed separately since the end of a civil war more than seven decades ago. However, Beijing continues to view Taiwan as an inseparable part of its territory even though the Chinese Communist Party has never governed the democratic island of around 24 million people. A fragile status quo emerged almost 30 years ago, when Beijing and Taiwan's then-ruling Nationalists acknowledged a "one China" stance that has since been interpreted differently by the two sides. That has changed when Taiwan's current leader, President Tsai Ing-wen, came to power. Tsai and her party have long rejected what's known as the "1992 Consensus" and she has repeatedly urged Beijing to recognise Taiwan's sovereignty and the wishes of its people. Recently, the Group of Seven Seven leaders issued a joint statement, slamming China for a series of issues and underscored the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait - comments China condemned as "slander."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/taiwan-needs-to-prepare-for-possible-military-conflict-with-china-says-foreign-minister/articleshow/83825550.cms||---

Another suspect was detained earlier after being wounded during the apparently random gun attacks Saturday. Prosecutors in the border state of Tamaulipas said the latest arrests came during raids that also freed 18 kidnap victims, four of whom are believed to be US citizens. In one raid on a house east of Reynosa, police found 10 kidnap victims, two of them Americans. One man had been abducted three weeks ago and was still being held even though relatives had paid a ransom for his release, authorities said. A U.S. woman and her 3-year-old daughter from Edinburgh, Texas, were found in a raid on another house. They had been kidnapped when they entered Mexico to search for the woman's husband, who had disappeared earlier. The other 14 kidnap victims were Mexican citizens, ranging from nurses and an engineer to store and business employees, prosecutors said. Pickup trucks with homemade welded steel plate armor were also found in the raids, which targeted the "Scorpions'' and "Cyclones'' factions of the Gulf Cartel. The Scorpions were once a specialized security force for cartel leaders, Now they and the Cyclones operate their own smuggling, trafficking, and extortion territory east of Reynosa, in Rio Bravo and Matamoros. The two groups apparently joined up to attack Reynosa on Saturday in an apparent bid to weaken the rival Metros faction. The Metros have long dominated Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas. The area is a lucrative corridor for trafficking contraband and migrants across the U.S. border. All three factions _ the Metros, the Scorpions and the Cyclones _ were part of the Gulf Cartel, but struggles over leadership and territory have raged since the arrest of drug lord Osiel Cardenas Guillen in 2003 and the cartel's split with its former henchmen, the Zetas, around 2010. State prosecutor Irving Barrios said Tuesday that investigations suggested that pickup trucks carrying gunmen from the Scorpions and Cyclones drove into Reynosa and opened fire ``to destabilize Reynosa and gain territory there.'' He said their aim was "to create terror in a portion of the public so they could come in and take control.'' There is evidence that the groups of hitmen riding in a half-dozen pickup trucks sought to sow panic and also robbed people. Four of the suspects were killed in confrontations with the police and National Guard. On Monday, federal prosecutors said they were taking over the case, and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged "a thorough investigation.'' But the killings in Reynosa, and the latest nationwide homicide figures, suggest Lopez Obrador's "hugs not bullets'' crime strategy is doing little to decrease deaths. There were 2,963 homicides in May, the latest month for which figures are available, higher than May 2020 and well above the numbers that prevailed when Lopez Obrador took office in December 2018. The government says homicides declined 2.9% in the first five months of 2021, compared to 2020, but that may be because January and February of this year were marked by Mexico's worst coronavirus wave when public activities were curtailed. Lopez Obrador has sought to avoid confrontations with drug cartels, at one point releasing a top trafficker to avoid bloodshed. He prefers to focus on addressing underlying social problems like youth unemployment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/4-more-suspects-held-in-mexico-border-attack-that-killed-19/articleshow/83825352.cms||---

The external affairs ministry on Thursday also called on Pakistan to take credible, verifiable and irreversible action against terrorism as it responded to Pakistan foreign minister S M Qureshi's remark that India's presence in Afghanistan was "larger than it ought to be". The pointed reference at the SCO where his Pakistan counterpart was also present was intended to signal India's emphasis on anti-terror actions and the need for demonstrable measures. Read AlsoNSAs at SCO meet day after India slams Pakistan on terrorNEW DELHI: Indian NSA Ajit Doval and his Pakistan counterpart Moeed Yusuf participated on Wednesday in the meeting of SCO national security advisers in Dushanbe a day after India strongly criticised Islamabad for protecting and nurturing terrorists. The SCO meeting saw discussions on the politicalAs reported by on Thursday, the SCO NSA meeting in Dushanbe condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, called for shunning double standards in dealing with terrorists and reached an agreement for exchange of information on terrorists. The government, however, believes calling for action against specific terror groups is important for tightening the screws on Pakistan. "NSA proposed action plan against LeT and JeM as part of SCO framework," said a source. With the global terror watchdog FATF is currently reviewing Pakistan's compliance with an action plan to check terror-financing, Doval emphasised "adoption of international standards" to counter terror-financing, including in the form of an MoU between SCO and FATF. The NSA also emphasised on the need for perpetrators of terrorism, including cross-border terror attacks to be expeditiously brought to justice. As the meeting underlined the significance of UN's role in Afghanistan peace efforts, Doval said there was a need to preserve gains made in last two decades in Afghanistan and to give top priority to welfare of its people. He said India fully supported SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan and called for it to be more active. Following Qureshi's comments on Afghanistan, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, it was for the Afghan people to decide their partners, and the size of that partnership. "India has brought electricity, dams, schools, health clinics, roads, community projects to Afghanistan. The world knows what Pakistan has brought to Afghanistan," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-mounts-pressure-on-pakistan-at-sco-with-plan-on-let-jem/articleshow/83825858.cms||---

The report also said many countries saw a rise in the use of cannabis during the coronavirus pandemic. In surveys of health professionals across 77 countries, 42% said cannabis use had increased. A rise in the non-medical use of pharmaceutical drugs was also observed in the same period. The report further noted that in the last 24 years, cannabis potency had increased as much as four times in some parts, even as the percentage of adolescents who perceived the drug as harmful fell by as much as 40%. This development came despite evidence that cannabis use is associated with a variety of health and other harms, especially among regular long-term users. "Lower perception of drug use risks has been linked to higher rates of drug use, and the findings of UNODC's 2021 World Drug Report highlight the need to close the gap between perception and reality to educate young people and safeguard public health," UNODC executive director Ghada Waly said. According to the latest global estimates, about 5.5% of those between 15 and 64 have used drugs at least once in the past year, while 36.3 million people, or 13% of the total number of people who use drugs, suffer from drug use disorders, the report said. Globally, over 11 million people are estimated to inject drugs, half of whom are living with Hepatitis C. Opioids continue to account for the largest burden of disease attributed to drug use, according to the report. The report said that by drugs it referred to substances controlled under international drug control conventions, and their non-medical use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/275-million-people-used-drugs-worldwide-in-2020-un/articleshow/83825961.cms||---

Andhra too, later in the day, scrapped board examinations for Class 10 and intermediate. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari approved the decision taken by states and questioned the Andhra government for insisting on conducting the examination, which could expose students to the virus. "We direct all the state boards to ensure that the schemes are formulated and notified not later than 10 days and also declare results of internal assessment by July 31," the bench said. As the bench was not satisfied with the response of Andhra government's advocate Mahfooz A Nazki, it directed him to provide all the details on Friday on how the exam for six subjects would be conducted while following Covid norms. The bench made it clear to the state that it would pass order to scrap the proposed exam if it was not satisfied with its response. It also said the state will be held responsible in case of any fatality of students if it decided to conduct the exam. It said going by the compensation amount paid by some state governments, the Andhra Pradesh government may also have to pay compensation of Rs 1 crore in case of death of any student. On Thursday evening, education minister A Suresh said the state had decided to cancel the exams as it was difficult to adhere to the SC-set July 31 deadline for completing the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/declare-boards-marks-scheme-by-july-31-sc-directs-states/articleshow/83826304.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Nevertheless, it needs to be reasserted that Covid-appropriate behaviour must continue and the vaccination drive further speeded up.While a significant proportion of laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases were fully vaccinated, over 83% of them showed symptoms and only 9.9% of the symptomatic breakthrough infections required hospitalisation, the study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research shows, offering evidence that vaccines protect against severe illness.

---||World||Joe Biden calls closure of Hong Kong's Apple Daily 'sad day for media freedom'||HONG KONG/WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Thursday called the closure of Hong Kong's Apple Daily tabloid a "sad day for media freedom" and said it signaled "intensifying repression" by China, while vowing to maintain support for the people of the Chinese-ruled territory. In a statement following the news outlet's closure earlier on Thursday, Biden called on Beijing to stop targeting the independent press and release detained journalists and media executives. "People in Hong Kong have the right to freedom of the press. Instead, Beijing is denying basic liberties and assaulting Hong Kong’s autonomy and democratic institutions and processes, inconsistent with its international obligations," he said. Apple Daily was forced to end a 26-year run amid a national security crackdown that froze the company's funds. Its closure prompted snaking lines of hundreds of loyal readers at newsstands across the city. "It is a sad day for media freedom in Hong Kong and around the world," Biden said, adding that the publication had been "a much-needed bastion of independent journalism in Hong Kong." "Through arrests, threats, and forcing through a National Security Law that penalizes free speech, Beijing has insisted on wielding its power to suppress independent media and silence dissenting views," he said. BIDEN VOWS SUPPORT Biden vowed that the United States "will not waver in our support of people in Hong Kong and all those who stand up for the basic freedoms all people deserve." The shutdown deals the most serious blow yet to Hong Kong's media freedoms and could potentially destroy the city's reputation as a media hub after Beijing imposed the security law on the financial center last year, media advocacy groups say. UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet took aim on Thursday at the "negative consequences" she said Apple Daily owner Jimmy Lai faced for exercising his rights, criticizing the tycoon's detention. Speaking to the 2021 Society of Publishers in Asia press awards ceremony held in Hong Kong, Bachelet said the national security law was leading journalists to "self-censor" to avoid clashing with "vaguely formulated offenses." Lai has been in jail since December over unauthorized rallies during Hong Kong's mass pro-democracy protests in 2019. He is facing three national security charges, including colluding with a foreign country and is already serving several sentences for taking part in unauthorized rallies. Britain's foreign minister Dominic Raab called on China to respect its commitments to free media under an agreement with Britain over how Hong Kong would be ruled after its return from British rule to China in 1997. "We certainly view what's been happening in with the closure of the Apple Daily and the arrest of journalists very, very seriously," he said. "We call on China to respect the terms that it freely signed up to and we think that's a matter of trust as well as important for the people of Hong Kong." UNAPOLOGETIC TABLOID Apple Daily was an unapologetic tabloid that mixed pro-democracy discourse with celebrity gossip and investigations of those in power. It had been a thorn in Beijing's side. Last year, before Biden won the US presidential election, it published two articles on his son Hunter Biden and his ties to a Taiwanese businessman who the paper said was a purported broker "enabling Hunter Biden’s deals in mainland China over a decade". Lai said on Twitter in October he personally had "nothing to do with" a report on Hunter Biden's alleged China business links, but admitted funds from his private firm and had been used to fund it. ONE MILLION COPIES In anticipation of robust demand for its final print run, The Apple Daily printed 1 million copies, or more than 10 times its usual. Emotions ran high on Thursday among supporters of the paper, which has faced an unrelenting squeeze since Lai's arrest in August 2020. "I couldn't sleep well for the past few nights," said Tse, 60, a former medical worker, who leaned on a cart to support herself as she queued for a paper. "I hope reporters can stay true to their faith and keep working hard." Some Apple Daily staff expressed anger and frustration. "(After) today, there is no press freedom in Hong Kong," said Dickson Ng, 51, a designer at the paper. "I feel very disappointed and angry." Last week, 500 officers raided the newspaper's headquarters, sifting through reporters' notes and other journalistic material in scenes that drew international condemnation. Five executives were arrested, and two - chief editor Ryan Law and Cheung Kim-hung - were charged with conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country and denied bail. On Wednesday, a columnist for the paper was also arrested under the national security law. Officials in Hong Kong and China have repeatedly said media freedoms are respected but are not absolute. "Hong Kong is a society that has rule of law. ... No one or no organization is above the law," a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said. "All rights and freedom, including media freedom, cannot go beyond the bottom line of national security."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-calls-closure-of-hong-kongs-apple-daily-sad-day-for-media-freedom/articleshow/83826829.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi inflated oxygen need by 4 times during peak, says SC panel||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court oxygen audit team has put the Kejriwal government on the dock for exaggerating the oxygen requirement for Delhi by more than four times during the April 25-May 10 peak of second Covid wave and informed the SC that supply of excess oxygen to Delhi could have triggered a crisis in its supply of supply to 12 high caseload states. The report of the SC-appointed oxygen audit sub-group said, "There was a gross discrepancy (about four times). The actual oxygen consumption claimed by the Delhi government (1,140MT) was about four times higher than the calculated consumption as per the formula based on bed capacity (289 MT)." The Petroleum and Oxygen Safety Organization (PESO) told the sub-group that "National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD) had surplus oxygen, which is affecting liquid medical oxygen (LMO) supply to other states" and apprehended that if excess O2 was kept supplied to Delhi, it could lead to a national crisis. Read AlsoCovid-19: India must have strategic Oxygen reserve like petrol &amp; diesel, NTF tells SCThe Supreme Court appointed National Task Force has recommended building a strategic oxygen reserve, on the lines of petroleum products, to combat future waves of Covid pandemic while appreciating the Centre's hard work in maintaining the liquid medical oxygen (LMO) supply to states during theA bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud on May 5, agonised by the AAP government's shrill cries about oxygen shortage in the national capital, had directed the Union government to maintain supply of 700 MT of oxygen to Delhi even as solicitor general Tushar Mehta had presented a expert-devised calculation to peg the requirement at 415 MT of LMO. Read our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesHowever, the SC had also asked the audit team headed by AIIMS director Randeep Guleria to examine the model for 'optimum utilisation of oxygen" implemented in Mumbai, which managed with 275MT oxygen during peak caseload of 92,000 Covid patients. Delhi had demanded 900 MT oxygen for peak caseload of 95,000 patients on May 3. The oxygen audit sub-group also included Delhi government's principal (home) secretary Bhupinder S Bhalla, Max Hospital's Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, joint secretary in Union Jal Shakti ministry Subodh Yadav and controller of explosives Sanjay K Singh. In its interim report to the SC, the sub-group said it drafted a proforma to "calculate accurate oxygen requirement of NCTD" and circulated it among 260 hospitals. As many as 183 hospitals, including all major ones, responded with oxygen consumption data, which was analysed against three parameters - actual consumption of oxygen, requirement as per Centre's formula and Delhi government's formula. It said actual LMO consumption in 183 hospitals as per Delhi government was 1,140 MT, but according to hospital supplied information, the actual consumption was only 209 MT. If the Centre-recommended formula for oxygen allotment was employed, the requirement would have been 289 MT and as per the Delhi government formula it would have been 391 MT, it said. "The recommended LMO consumption as per Union government formula for total bed strength provided by the Delhi government on May 3 (highest till date: 16,272 non-ICU beds and 5,866 ICU beds) would have been 415 MT and, if the Delhi government's formula was applied for calculation, it would have been 568 MT of LMO," the report said and clarified that though the Delhi government had claimed that its formula was based on ICMR guidelines, no such guidelines were placed before the SC-audit team for scrutiny. Dr Guleria-led audit team said Singhal Hospital, Aruna Asaf Ali Government Hospital, ESIC Model Hospital and Liferays Hospital had "claimed extremely high oxygen consumption with very few beds and the claims appeared to be clearly erroneous, leading to extremely skewed information and significantly higher LMO requirements for Delhi... Actual consumptions were estimated by recalculation after replacing the claimed use figures for the four hospitals with expected use figures using the calculation formula," the report said. The sub-group noted that the "formula used by the Uniongovernment was devised by a group of experts and is used for making LMO allocation to various states. This formula assumes that only 50% of the non-ICU beds use oxygen. The Delhi government assumes that 100% of non-ICU beds use oxygen. Calculations were made using both formulae". Dr Guleria-led team said "Even though the hospitalisation policy is to admit only moderate to severely affected Covid patients, many do not require LMO during recovery but cannot be discharged due to comorbidities or a waxing and waning course. They continue to occupy 'oxygenated non-ICU beds' particularly if all the Covid beds in the hospital have oxygen capability or the non-oxygen Covid beds are full. This is the real life experience of all major hospitals including AIIMS. Thus, assuming that all patients admitted on 'oxygenated non-ICU beds' will need LMO for calculating the oxygen requirement will be an overestimation."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-inflated-o2-need-by-4x-during-peak-says-sc-panel/articleshow/83826948.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||HC gives relief to Twitter MD over Ghaziabad assault clip||BENGALURU/GHAZIABAD: In a relief to Twitter India MD Manish Maheshwari, the Karnataka high court on Thursday passed an interim order restraining Ghaziabad police from initiating any coercive action against him in connection with the probe into the assault on an elderly Muslim man in UP. Justice G Narendar added that if the UP police desired to investigate or examine the petitioner, they may do so in virtual mode. The matter has now been listed for further consideration and objections, if any, on June 29. Maheshwari had challenged the notice issued by UP police under Section 41A of the CrPC to appear in person at the Loni Border police station in Ghaziabad at 10.30am on Thursday. On June 15, Ghaziabad police booked the microblogging platform, a news website and some journalists over the circulation of a video related to the assault. The case has been registered under IPC sections related to incitement and criminal conspiracy, among others. "We received a mail from Manish Maheshwari on Thursday morning, saying he cannot appear at Loni border police station in response to the two notices issued to him under sections 166 and 41A of the CrPc," said SSP Amit Pathak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-gives-relief-to-twitter-md-over-ghaziabad-assault-clip/articleshow/83826979.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: India must have strategic Oxygen reserve like petrol & diesel, NTF tells SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court appointed National Task Force has recommended building a strategic oxygen reserve, on the lines of petroleum products, to combat future waves of Covid pandemic while appreciating the Centre's hard work in maintaining the liquid medical oxygen (LMO) supply to states during the critical second wave of Covid. "We should have strategic reserves of oxygen for the country to cover 2-3 weeks’ consumption, similar to the arrangement made for petroleum products. Similarly, all hospitals should have a buffer capacity for Emergencies," said the SC-appointed NTF in its report filed before the apex court. It said urgent efforts are needed to further scale up LMO production in preparation of the next wave of the pandemic. The NTF also recommended that 18 big cities, including Delhi and Mumbai, must have LMO infrastructure to meet at least 50% of their peak O2 requirement. "There should be a strategy to manufacture oxygen locally or in the neighbourhood for the big cities to fulfill at least 50% of their LMO demand, as road transportation is vulnerable. This may be taken up in respect of Delhi and Mumbai on priority, due to their population density. All 18 metro cities must be made oxygen independent, with at least 100 MT storage in the city itself," it said. Read AlsoCovid-19: Delhi inflated oxygen need by 4 times during peak, says SC panelThe SC oxygen audit team has put the Kejriwal government in the dock for exaggerating the oxygen requirement in Delhi by more than four times during the April 25-May 10 peak period of the second Covid-19 wave and informed the SC that supply of excess oxygen to the Capital could have affected supplyIt recommended "adequate procurement, filling, and timely supply of the oxygen cylinders to the hospitals and facilities in nursing homes, tier-2 and 3 cities, districts and rural areas, covid care centres, and other health care facilities specially created for Covid patients should be calculated and ensured." "As the rural hospitals are dependent on cylinders and concentrators (non-LMO sources), there is a need to shift pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants towards vulnerable areas. Cylinder turnaround time also needs to be efficient. Adequate number of cylinders must be kept as a buffer. The rural and semi-urban areas preparation should be prioritized henceforth. Oxygen cylinder filling and storage in rural areas is important; hence, central filling stations are to be considered in districts/rural areas," NTF recommended. On May 8, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah had faulted the Centre's oxygen allocation methodology during the Covid second wave and drew health experts from all over India to set up a jumbo NTF to devise a scientific formula for rational and equitable allocation of oxygen to states, audit O2 utilisation and recommend means to augment its production. Members of the NTF, convened by Cabinet Secretary, are Bhabatosh Biswas, ex-VC of West Bengal University of Health Sciences, Kolkata; Devender Singh Rana and Saumitra Rawat of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi; Devi Prasad Shetty of Narayana Healthcare, Bengaluru; Gagandeep Kang and J V Peter of Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu; Naresh Trehan of Medanta, Gurgaon; Rahul Pandit of Fortis Hospital, Mumbai; Shiv Kumar Sarin of Institute of Liver and Biliary Science, Delhi; Dr Zarir F Udwadia from Mumbai; and Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan. Giving statistics, the NTF said daily production of LMO increased from 5,700 MT per day in August last year to a high of 9,690 MT on May 13 this year. Daily LMO supply in February was 1,292MT and 1,459 MT in March, and was increased to 4,923 MTs in April and 8,520 MTs in May. "The NTF recognized the enormity of the challenge and appreciated the steps taken by the Government of India," it said. The NTF considered ideal daily LMO supply needed for a 100-bed hospital, with 25% ICU beds, and pegged the requirement at 1.5 MT (11,55,000 litres). As per the Central government methodology (an ICU bed needs 24lt/min and a non-ICU bed 10 lit/min), a 100-bed hospital with 25% ICU beds would need 19,44,000 litres of LMO daily. It said each hospital must have a round-the-clock oxygen monitoring team. It said, "Each hospital with 100 or more beds, should be encouraged to have an LMO installation. A cryogenic storage tank for LMO should be insisted upon for every hospital in metropolitan areas. All hospitals, including medical colleges and district hospitals, must have pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology to produce oxygen for inhouse consumption... All district hospitals should have PSA plants with compressors so that they can manage their own load as well as fill cylinders for CHC/PHC/Ambulances." "There is an urgent need to increase production of LMO from about 5% - 8% of gaseous industrial oxygen. Govt should support and subsidize concerned industries...Technology to be put in place to convert nitrogen plants to oxygen producing plants in case of an emergency situation...Focus should also be placed on cylinders, gaseous oxygen and arrangement of cylinder fillers. CO2 cylinders from beverage industries may also be converted to oxygen cylinders," it recommended. The NTF said, "In emergency, implementation of management of Oxygen Grid with 10-12 regional production sites is required . The storage hubs with state and district storage spokes should be in place for any emergent situation. Long haul connectivity through Rail from the production hub to the storage hubs, with the last mile connectivity as a spoke model transported by trucks. The LMO production hubs should be so located that the transport distance even by rail is preferably less than 24 hours." It recommended creation of a state oxygen dashboard, which will monitor both supply and demand, including real-time data on available infrastructure, beds & actual oxygen consumption at each health-facility. Each State should have access to reserve tankers depending on the dynamics of pandemic to meet demand supply mismatch, it said, but insisted that allocation of tankers to states during a pandemic may be taken over by the Centre in times of emergency. About 20% buffer capacity of the state’s requirement should be created for allocation over and above baseline demand for allocation to states with rising cases, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-india-must-have-strategic-oxygen-reserve-ntf-tells-sc/articleshow/83827026.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

While it was alleged that the candidate, Rishikesh Kumar (30) from Jehanabad, had earlier lodged a complaint with the BSEB and sought rectification, the BSEB claimed that the candidate, while filling his examination form, had deliberately uploaded the photo of the actress instead of his own. “The board will seek an explanation from the candidate for uploading his photo incorrectly and not rectifying the error despite getting several opportunities. Also, his candidature for STET 2019 will be cancelled for uploading the actress’s photo,” the BSEB said in a press release. Rishikesh had appeared for mathematics paper and qualified the STET by scoring 95.4 out of 150 before making it to the merit list in backward class category. One Dipankar Kumar, who had also appeared for mathematics but failed to make it to the merit list, had earlier told this newspaper that even the admit card for STET issued to Rishikesh in January last year had the picture of the same actress. Meanwhile, leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has slammed the BSEB over the matter. “After making Sunny Leone top Bihar’s junior engineer exam, now Malayalam actress Anupama Parameswaran has got the STET exam cleared (sic),” he tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/stet-has-malayalam-actress-as-candidate-bseb-says-not-its-fault/articleshow/83818647.cms||Faryal Rumi

Vigilance sources said raids were conducted at Lal’s two flats (106 & 604) in Kashyap Suman Apartment, another flat at Asha Double Diamond apartment at RMS Colony in Kankarbagh, Patna, his private residence at Daudpur Kothi under Bramhapura police station area in Muzaffarpur and the DTO office at Muzaffarpur. They said the transport department had handed over the additional charge of Saran DTO to Lal on March 9. Sources said Lal had joined service on March 9, 1999. Vigilance sources said movable properties worth more than Rs 1.11 crore were recovered during Thursday’s raids. They said valuation of immovable properties from seized documents was yet to be completed. “Overall disproportionate assets amassed by Lal are more than Rs 2.35 crore. This includes the disproportionate assets worth Rs 1.24 crore which had already been unearthed in an internal inquiry taken up against Lal in February this year,” a vigilance officer said. He said it was based on movable and immovable properties worth Rs 1.24 crore that a disproportionate asset case was registered against him with the Vigilance police station in Patna on June 22. Vigilance sources said Rs 42 lakh in cash, gold and silver ornaments worth more than Rs 60 lakh were recovered from flat number 106. “Another Rs 9.11 lakh was recovered from his flat at Asha Double Diamond,” a senior vigilance officer said, adding after bundles of money started tumbling out in flat number 106, a currency counting machine had to be requisitioned from a nearby bank. They said flat number 106 is registered in the name of the DTO and 604 in the name of his father-in-law Bhagwan Prasad. “The third flat is registered in the name of Lal’s mother. All three well-furnished flats were purchased in 2010. The combined market rate of the three flats is estimated to be much more than Rs 1.5 crore,” the officer said. Several land deeds, bank deposits and lockers, investment documents were recovered during the raids in Patna.

---||Business||RBI caps dividend payout by NBFCs||Mumbai: In a move that will increase transparency in respect of the financial health of finance companies, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has linked dividend payout to balance sheet parameters. Boards of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) have been asked to factor in RBI’s observation during supervision and the notes to accounts before approving a dividend. The new dividend distribution norms prescribed by the regulator apply to all finance companies, including core investment companies. The rules cap the maximum dividend payout ratio at 50% of net profit for all NBFCs, but allow a higher payout of 60% for core investment companies and primary dealership firms. The notification, which comes into effect from FY22, does not place any dividend cap on NBFCs that do not accept public funds and do not have any customer interface. However, all finance companies must be compliant with RBI regulations with regard to the maintenance of a reserve fund. In terms of balance sheet thresholds, NBFCs must meet the prescribed regulatory capital requirement for each of the last three financial years to pay a dividend. Also, the net non-performing asset (NPA) ratio shall be less than 6% in each of the last three years, including as at the close of the financial year for which dividend is proposed to be declared. The revised norms apply for both dividends on equity shares as well as convertible capital. If there is an overstatement of net profit for a particular period, the extent of overstatement must be reduced before calculating the payout ratio. The final guidelines have set a relatively relaxed criteria for dividend payout as compared with the draft guidelines. “Over the last three years, dividend payout ratios have been 10-20% for most entities, with few in the range of 20-30%,” said Manushree Saggar, VP & sector head, ICRA. She added that NBFCs are expected to comfortably meet the capital adequacy and NPA criteria and “dividend payout for most NBFCs is unlikely to be impacted”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-caps-dividend-payout-by-nbfcs/articleshow/83822811.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Police cast net for conman’s aides, lens on profit motive||KOLKATA: A day after an MP and the Kolkata Municipal Commissioner filed complaints against the 28-year-old conman who held fake vaccination camps across the city, three more complaints were filed on Thursday. Debanjan Deb was named in an FIR registered at the Amherst Street police station by North City College authorities for duping 72 people who received the shots on June 18. KMC approached Taltala police with a complaint alleging Deb had used his fake identity to get his name on a plaque of a bust of Rabindranath Tagore that was unveiled in the area by transport minister Firhad Hakim in the presence of other senior TMC MPs, ministers and MLAs on February 26. In a third complaint, a micro finance company alleged Deb had charged them Rs 1.1 lakh to arrange vaccination of 179 employees. As complaints mounted, detective department sleuths took over the probe from Kasba police, took the accused to the false KMC office at Kasba and questioned him about the motive behind his actions. “We wanted to know how many camps he had organized, where and how many people had been jabbed. We also wanted to know where he got the funds to maintain an office with so many staffers and a car with a driver and a security person. We have to find out about other frauds he may have committed,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Sources said cops were hopeful about cracking the case by Friday. “We are looking at everything. It is unlikely he was the only one behind this charade,” said an officer. On Friday morning, cops will question a woman who had close links with Deb. According to sources, though Deb called himself an IAS officer for the past four years, he began to use it for personal gain from the beginning of this year. Cops said Deb had been trying to enter into MoUs, charging money from various institutes and companies with the promise of arranging Covishield jabs. Deb got access to North City College through a former student to whom he issued a fake KMC job appointment letter. He connected to the students through his “relief work” after Yaas. Similarly, he promised Sarala Development & Microfinance Pvt Ltd 179 jabs before asking them to pay Rs 1.1 lakh, MD Pranab Rakshit said. Cops suspect that Deb used to conduct free mass vaccinations to popularize the drive and had begun sharing information about the camps on social media and WhatsApp groups. Meanwhile, the civic body is probing how he had used KMC banners and logos. According to a KMC health department official, a civic official had first spotted the camp nine days after the vaccination drive at Kasba was set up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-cast-net-for-conmans-aides-lens-on-profit-motive/articleshow/83820951.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Get early WHO Covaxin nod, Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee tells PM Narendra Modi||KOLKATA: Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s urgent intervention on Thursday for an early World Health Organisation approval for Covaxin. “You are aware that the Bengal government has taken up vaccination in right earnest and, till date, we have already administered more than 2 crore doses. We have been receiving both Covishield and Covaxin. A large number of students from all over the country travel abroad every year for higher studies and many of them have got themselves vaccinated with Covaxin,” Banerjee wrote in her letter to Modi. But there was widespread apprehension among students travelling abroad who had taken Covaxin because of WHO’s “non-recognition”, she said on Thursday while talking to the media about her letter to PM Modi. People “travelling abroad for jobs, education, business and other purposes” would benefit if the Indian government pursued the matter with WHO, Banerjee added in her letter to the PM. Covaxin maker Bharat Biotech and WHO have had a “pre-submission” meeting for international emergency use listing of the vaccine. Bharat Biotech spokespersons have said they have already submitted 90% of the paperwork required for getting the WHO nod. The Hyderabad-based manufacturer has said it is confident of getting the nod, “given its experience of getting other vaccines pre-qualified by WHO”. WHO’s emergency use listing is a procedure for assessing and listing new or unlicensed products that can be used during public health emergencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/get-early-who-covaxin-nod-cm-tells-modi/articleshow/83823917.cms||---

While the chairman moved from Mumbai to the Jamnagar site during the second wave of Covid-19 to oversee the supply of medical-grade liquid oxygen for patients, the place has always been at the centre of the company’s big-ticket investment plans. After setting up the world’s largest refining complex, building a large petrochemical complex and giving shape to its oil to chemicals strategy, Jamnagar was once again in focus on Thursday as the RIL chairman unveiled plans for launching a new initiative for renewable energy business. Ambani said the company has started work on developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex on 5,000 acres in Jamnagar. This will include solar manufacturing facility, battery factory, fuel cell-making factory and an electrolyzer unit. It will be amongst the largest such integrated renewable energy manufacturing facilities in the world, Ambani said while adding, “Jamnagar was the cradle of our old business strategy. Jamnagar will also be the cradle of our new business strategy.” Over the next three years, RIL plans to invest over Rs 60,000 crore in renewable energy business in the next three years which includes setting up four giga factories near Jamnagar. Ambani said his oil-to-telecom conglomerate will invest another Rs 15,000 crore to provide infrastructure and utilities to manufacturing ancillary materials and equipment needed to support the four Giga factories. The company will also build a facility for the production of solar energy where RIL will build an integrated solar photovoltaic module factory. Another factory will be for the storage battery while the third facility will be for production of green hydrogen that can be used as a fuel in automobiles. The fourth will be a fuel cell factory for converting hydrogen into motive and stationary power, according to Ambani. For FY 2021 RIL’s consolidated total revenues were Rs 5,39,238 crore. Around 60% of the total revenues for this period came from O2C (oil to chemicals) segment, a strategy adapted by the company two years ago for Jamnagar, said sources in the know of the matter. The company’ Jamnagar complex will provide infrastructure and utilities to manufacture ancillary material and equipment needed to support these Giga factories so that all critical materials are available in time. RIL will invest an additional Rs 15,000 crore in value chain, partnerships and future technologies, including upstream and downstream industries. “Thus, our overall initial investment from our own internal resources in the New Energy business will be Rs 75,000 crore in 3 years," said Ambani. The company had last year set a target of becoming a net-zero carbon company by 2035, a shorter time frame compared to the 2050 cutoff self-imposed by many of its global peers, including BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. In lines with Prime Minister Narendra Modi ambitious target to achieve 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, RIL said it will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy by 2030. “With these new initiatives, Reliance will put Gujarat and India on the world solar and hydrogen map," he said. "All our products will proudly proclaim: Made in India, by India, for India and for the world!"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ril-to-invest-rs75k-cr-in-clean-energy-business-in-jamnagar/articleshow/83821730.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Summer of 2021: A ‘cooler’ affair for Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: It was not the summer when Gujaratis worried over scorching heat, desperately looking for coolers namely ice creams, popsicles and mango juices – April and May recorded the worst death tolls during the ongoing Covid pandemic and set new records of daily positive cases. The partial lockdowns also ensured that the citizens remained indoors. But these were not the only reasons why the state felt less hot. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) data said the summer of 2021 was less harsher as far as the mercury levels were concerned. This year, the maximum temperature across the weather stations was 44 degrees Celsius recorded in Gandhinagar. To put the figure in perspective, the maximum temperature in the summer of 2019 had shot up to 46.8 degrees. Even in 2020, the maximum temperature almost touched 45 degrees at 44.9 degrees Celsius at Deesa in north Gujarat. Manorama Mohanty, in-charge director of IMD Gujarat, said that in the past five years, the maximum summer temperature was comparatively lower. “We generally take a long-term average of 30 years to assess whether any weather station has reported any major rise or fall – on that count, the variation is not much. Gujarat has recorded up to 48 degrees Celsius temperature in the past, too,” she said. “One of the possible reasons could be less pollution levels compared to previous years.” Climate experts said that this year, the comparative number of heat waves were less for the region, and so were the average temperatures. OGIMET, an international climate data aggregator, indicated that the average mean temperature for Ahmedabad in May was 32.7 degrees Celsius, which was 35.3 degrees in 2020 and 34.3 degrees in 2019. The maximum May temperature for Ahmedabad was 44.8 degrees Celsius in 2018, which this year got reduced to 43.5 degrees Celsius. Cyclone Tauktae brought in rains in May for the state, along with pre-monsoon activity in June, which resulted in cooler days for Ahmedabad, and Gujarat at large. Monsoon also arrived on time on June 15 in the state, said Met department officials. The hypothesis is corroborated by EMRI 108 data that indicated less number of heat-related emergencies in 2021 compared to previous years. “But one must also take into account the exponential rise in Covid cases during the peak summer months,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/summer-of-2021-a-cooler-affair-for-guj/articleshow/83821833.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Can this happen to us too? Housing complex residents seek more info on vaccination agencies||KOLKATA: The vaccination scam unravelled in Kasba has triggered panic and hesitancy among those due to receive their jabs in the next few days. Many residing in gated communities are asking the residents’ associations about the credentials of the agencies that will conduct the drives and asking where they are procuring the vaccines from. Healthcare experts said the Kasba incident, where it is not known what the recipients received, may fuel anti-vaccine theories and give rise to rumours, which might delay the drive in many pockets. Individuals have already started asking if this could happen to them. “It is such a shocking and scary incident. Vaccines are being said to be one of the biggest solutions against Covid, but if the vaccine is not genuine it can cause more harm than good. I am scared to get the shot now,” said Rajeev Singh, a resident of New Town. “The incident has made many people sceptical about vaccination. A lot of anti-vaccine theories have started doing the rounds on social media too. This doesn’t augur well for the vaccination drive which is not only important to fight the virus but also to stop the third wave, which is being predicted to be more lethal than the second,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News, an NGO which has collaborated with several RWAs in New Town to carry out vaccination. In a high-rise in New Town where 750 people were vaccinated earlier this week, recipients have not received their certificates yet. They have started calling up the residents’ association after reading about the Kasba incident. “It was conducted by a reputable hospital. They will take some time to upload the data, after which the certificates will be available online. This has been the norm with other complexes too. But after the Kasba incident, residents are asking how the vaccines were procured and why they have not received the certificates,” said the secretary of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/can-this-happen-to-us-too-hsg-complex-residents-seek-more-info-on-vax-agencies/articleshow/83820977.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Lucknow||After no from teachers, Lucknow University mulls skipping common minimum syllabus||LUCKNOW: Unlike other state universities, Lucknow University may not implement the Common Minimum Syllabus (CMS) in its present format drafted by the higher education department for the next academic session that begins in September. Barring the education faculty, all faculties – arts, science, commerce and law – have rejected the CMS describing it as inferior to the syllabus currently taught in LU and against the spirit of NEP, which mandates more autonomy to universities — to design their syllabus as per the social, geographical and industry requirements. LU’s faculty of education has approved the CMS but it cannot be implemented because the arts faculty has said no to the draft. Dean, education, Prof Tripta Trivedi said CMS has content for four-year integrated bachelor of education (Bed) course – dual degree course combining BA and BEd or BSc and BEd. However, it is not being taught at LU or its affiliated college at present, she added. “We have given the acceptance that if in future, LU introduces BEd integrated course, we will incorporate CMS after modifying as per the guidelines of the National Council of Teachers Education,” she said. At present, LU offers the conventional two-year BEd course. Prof Trivedi said education as a subject is also offered along with various subject combinations at the undergraduate level in the arts faculty. “Our board of studies has approved CMS for BA course with small changes, but it can be implemented only if other subjects of arts faculty are also within the same framework or structure,” she added. The higher education department had asked state universities to include at least 70% of the CMS’s content in their syllabus in April this year. However, as reported by TOI, LU’s arts and science faculties rejected the CMS following stiff opposition from the teachers. Recently, the commerce and law faculties had also rejected it. Dean, commerce, Prof RK Maheshwari, said, “Commerce faculty has three departments — business administration; applied economics, and commerce. The teachers of the first two departments rejected the CMS in the faculty board meeting stating that it has ‘deficiencies’ and important topics that offer greater employability to students have been given a miss. The commerce department said vocational courses prescribed in the CMS cannot be taught at the colleges due to lack of infrastructure.” Dean, law, Prof CP Singh, said, “We have to follow the syllabus of the Bar Council of India and national law schools to make our students compete at the national level.” Lucknow University Teachers Association has also opposed CMS and conveyed the same to deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, who is also education minister and a professor in LU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-no-from-teachers-lu-mulls-skipping-common-min-syllabus/articleshow/83825417.cms||---

Satin Creditcare Network said its collection efficiency for March 2021 was 105%, which marginally dipped to 93% in April, 2021 and fell lower to 75% due to the extended lockdown in May 2021. In June, the micro financier hired over 1,000 collection agents to fasten the recovery process of hard-bucket delinquency — loans overdue for more than 90 days. Satin Creditcare chairman and MD H P Singh said, “Disbursement has slowed due to the lockdown and will gain momentum in the coming months. Our cost of borrowing has remained consistent and is around 11%. Our GNPA in Q4FY21 was at 8.4%.” For Asirvad Microfinance, a subsidiary of Manappuram Finance, collection efficiency dropped to 80-85% in June, as against 90-95% in March 2021. Its NPA level has also gone above 2.5% in the April-June quarter, as compared to 1.2-1.5% in the previous quarter. For Spandana Sphoorty Financial, collection efficiency dipped from 96% to around 80% in April-May, and disbursements have been on a pause and approach will be calibrated in the near term, according to a Yes Securities brokerage report. Yes Securities lead analyst Rajiv Mehta said, “Collection efficiency has dropped to 60-75% for the MFI sector in May, which depends directly on the geographic profile of the loan portfolio like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and even parts of Maharashtra, faced extremely strict lockdown.We do expect revival of collections in June, but not significantly high, as travel restrictions are gradually getting lifted and the MFI sector revolves around a physical collection model.” No profit for 73% small cos in FY21Nearly 73% of small businesses did not report profits in FY21 and 59% of them shed manpower due to adverse impact of Covid, a survey has shown. The survey conducted by Consortium of Indian Associations and covering 81,000 entities showed that nearly 88% of the respondents could not avail of the stimulus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mfi-collections-down-since-april/articleshow/83822017.cms||Mamtha Asokan

These included chairs, desk and a sofa set. Ajay Jagga, a member of the Heritage Protection Cell, has written a letter to the Union minister for external affairs to look into the matter and approach the law-enforcing agencies to find out how these items reached the auction house. He said bidding on smuggled heritage items should be checked and the matter may also be raised with UNESCO, this being trafficking of cultural goods. In the past, the UT administration had prepared an inventory of as many as 12,793 heritage items belonging to Chandigarh. As per the report, there are 190 different categories of heritage items, including drawings, murals, models, tapestries, chairs and tables, among others. The entities, including furniture, tapestry, drawings and some other things, that were designed, made and used by city’s creator French architect Le Corbusier, his cousin Pierre Jeanneret and others associated with the founding and planning of Chandigarh in the 1950s and 60s, fall under the category of heritage items.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/four-heritage-furniture-items-sold-for-rs-1-crore-in-belgium/articleshow/83820921.cms||---

The increase followed price revision by oil marketing companies for the fourth time in a week. Petrol prices were increased by 31 paise per litre and diesel by eight paise a litre, according to a price notification of city-based fuel retailers. Since June 1, a hike of Rs 2.91 per litre was seen in petrol and Rs 2.90 per litre in diesel prices. Petrol is now being sold at above Rs 100 per litre in 30 districts in Bihar, including Sitamarhi (101.8), Bettiah (101.4), Banka (101.3), Kaimur (101.3), Bhagalpur (101.3), Motihari (101.2), and Lakhisarai (101). Fuel prices differ from place to place depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. The fuel outlets in the city said continuous hike in prices has affected sales. Ashok Kumar, proprietor of a fuel station near Dak Bunglow, said the sales have gone down by 20% in last few weeks. He claimed that the petrol prices in Patna had never touched Rs 100-mark. Prabhat Kumar Singh, president of Bihar Petroleum Dealers’ Association, said petrol prices in 30 districts in the state have breached Rs 100. “The petroleum minister has said that the Centre has been increasing the prices of fuel to support welfare schemes. Hence, there is no comparison with the international rate of crude oil with the change in prices of local fuel. The fuel prices at international market now stands at 75.37$ per barrel. Accordingly, the prices of petrol and diesel should not have been more than Rs 80 per litre,” he said. Residents too are worried as prices of essential commodities like cooking oil, vegetables and fruits have increased due to fuel price rise. Abhishek Kumar, teacher at a government school, said, “Prices of essential items have increased manifold over the last few days. We can do cost cutting on other non-essential things, but we cannot reduce the expenses on food items.” Dilip Kumar, who works in a private marketing firm, said his salary was reduced by up to 25% due to Covid pandemic and rise in prices of essential commodities has made life difficult for him. “The government should spare the common people,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/petrol-breaches-rs-100-mark-in-30-districts/articleshow/83818820.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Business||Aramco chief to be first foreigner on RIL board||MUMBAI: Reliance Industries (RIL) will appoint Yasir Al-Rumayyan, chairman of Saudi Aramco and governor of the Kingdom’s wealth fund, to its board as an independent director. He will be the first foreigner on the company’s board, which, according to chairman Mukesh Ambani, will be the “beginning of internationalisation of Reliance”. Al-Rumayyan’s appointment is a precursor to Aramco finalising its investment in RIL’s oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business. Two years ago, Ambani announced to RIL shareholders that Aramco will acquire a 20% stake in RIL’s O2C unit for $15 billion. As part of the deal, Aramco will get one seat on the board of RIL and will have the right to appoint its executives in key managerial positions in the O2C unit. The Aramco investment, however, got delayed due to the Covid pandemic and its impact on energy demand. “Despite several challenges due to Covid, we have made substantial progress in the past year in our discussions,” Ambani informed RIL shareholders on Thursday. “Our partnership is expected to be formalised during this year,” he said. RIL and the Kingdom have an over two-decade old relationship, with the former sourcing crude oil from Aramco for many years and the latter, through its wealth fund Public Investment Fund (PIF), recently invested in the Indian company’s retail, telecom (Jio) and fibre-optic units. Harvard-educated Al-Rumayyan, 51, will replace Yogendra P Trivedi, 92, who has expressed a desire to retire from the board, Ambani said. Trivedi, the oldest independent director in a listed company, was inducted in the RIL board by founder Dhirubhai Ambani in 1992. Ambani, who addressed shareholders through a video link from the O2C complex in Jamnagar, said RIL will benefit from Al-Rumayyan’s experience of running one of the world’s largest companies (Aramco), and also one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world (PIF). Al-Rumayyan also serves on the boards of SoftBank and Uber Technologies. The “conversion of RIL and the Kingdom’s long-standing relationship into a perpetual partnership” will be important at multi-levels — Aramco will get increased access to India, the fastest growing consumer market, and can lock in long-term oil sales, while RIL could use the extra cash to expand the O2C business as well as pay down part of its Rs 2.5-lakh-crore ($34-billion) debt. Besides, both are pivoting towards green energy, with Ambani announcing Rs 75,000 crore investment in this space over three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/aramco-chief-to-be-first-foreigner-on-ril-board/articleshow/83823033.cms||Reeba Zachariah

He said since the new variant, scientifically known as B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1, has already struck Maharashtra and some other states, there is no reason to think that Bihar would remain spared by it. “As per the information available from other places, the rate of transmission of the Delta Plus variant is much higher than Delta and it could also prove more fatal,” Dr Singh said. He, however, added following Covid-appropriate behaviour even after relaxation in the lockdown might save people from infection. “All viruses tend to mutate to get stronger for their survival. Though scientific evidences on effects of Delta Plus are yet to come, the new variant is stronger. It has the ability to affect lungs, the principal organ to facilitate exchange of gases through respiration. Once invaded by this mutated virus, the affected person may feel severe problems in breathing and develop other unknown symptoms,” he said. There is no scientific study on the effects of two vaccines -- Covaxin and Covishield – in providing protection against the Delta Plus variant. Dr Singh, however, said the antibodies developed after immunisation would offer protection to a large extent. “As large number of students, professionals, traders and others from the state frequently visit different states, they may emerge as the new spreaders of the Delta Plus variant. Hence, there is a need for their proper screening,” Dr Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/threat-of-delta-plus-variant-looms-in-bihar-cautions-aiims-patna-director/articleshow/83818564.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Vaccination drive: Giving its best shot, Bihar among top 10 states||PATNA: Bihar stands at the sixth position among all the states administering the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccines to beneficiaries in the age group of 18 to 44 years. It also stands at the eighth position among the 28 states and eight union territories in the country in terms of inoculating people in all the categories. According to the data available with the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, altogether 45.96 lakh people in the age group of 18 to 44 years have been administered the first dose of vaccines in Bihar. The four states, which are ahead of Bihar, include Uttar Pradesh (71.62 lakh), Madhya Pradesh (69.69 lakh), Rajasthan (56.49 lakh), Gujarat (59.99 lakh), and Karnataka (49.83 lakh). In terms of overall inoculation, 1.46 crore people have received their first and second doses in Bihar. Maharashtra (2.86 crore), Uttar Pradesh (2.71 crore), Gujarat (2.30 crore), Rajasthan (2.20 crore), Karnataka (2 crore), West Bengal (1.96 crore), and Madhya Pradesh (1.67 crore) are ahead of Bihar in this category. With the second wave of Covid-19 wreaking havoc on the state, a large number of people are stepping out of their houses to get themselves inoculated. The state government has also set a target of vaccinating 6 crore people in the next six months. “The vaccine is very effective and decreases the fatality rate. Hence, we are motivating people to get themselves inoculated,” Patna civil surgeon Vibha Kumari told this newspaper on Thursday, adding that camps were also being organised at the panchayat level. Asked about the shortage of vaccines, Dr Vibha replied, “There is absolutely no shortage of vaccines in Patna. On the contrary, we will begin a mega vaccination camp in the district from Friday and try to inoculate 86,000 people in a day.” Apart from the government, efforts are being made by several international agencies like the United Nations (UN) to motivate people to get vaccine shots. The UN’s ‘Verified’ campaign, for instance, aims at delivering trusted information, life-saving advice and countering misinformation. In Bihar alone, over 400 youngsters and 10,000 teachers, professors, doctors and other experts have been roped in to spread information regarding the vaccination drive and bust all related myths. Juhi Kalam, a vaccine volunteer at Forbesganj in Araria, pointed out, “Many people do not let volunteers like us talk to women in their families. Thus, gender-specific campaigns, communication materials, verified information, access to healthcare providers and teleconsultation play a pivotal role.” Common people, who may or may not have lost their loved ones during the pandemic, are also rooting for the Covid vaccines. A resident of Danapur Cantonment, Anjana Singh, said, “I received both my doses without any problem. Although I was sceptical at first, crowd management at the vaccination centre was excellent.” Echoing similar views, Harsh Sahay, a collegian, claimed, “The site was not crowded and the vaccination process was swift. It took me only 20 minutes to get my first shot.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vaccination-drive-giving-its-best-shot-bihar-among-top-10-states/articleshow/83818307.cms||---

He said the qualified candidates who did not find place on the merit list released by Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) would be accommodated in the next phase. The minister’s announcement came after hundreds of STET-qualified candidates, who were “let out” of merit list, staged protests here on Wednesday. The minister told this newspaper that the qualified candidates of STET 2019 should not be worried for not being on the merit list. “A decision has been taken that the qualified candidates will not be deprived from the teachers’ recruitment process. A notification regarding the same will be issued by the department soon after completion of required procedures. The education department completely follows National Council for Teacher Education’s guidelines. In this regard, the state has extended the validity period of the STET 2011 and 2019 candidates from seven years to lifetime,” Choudhary said. He added, “Those who had passed the STET in 2011 would also apply for the seventh phase of recruitment process.” On Wednesday, hundreds of STET-qualified candidates had blocked the road here to register their protest with the BSEB. The STET 2019 was conducted for 15 subjects by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB). The results of 12 subjects were declared in March and three more subjects on June 21.

---||Patna||Infrastructure for Covid treatment: Patna HC asks ESIC hospital to file reply||PATNA: The Patna high court on Thursday asked the ESIC hospital, Bihta, to file a reply detailing its sanctioned strength of beds, manpower, equipment and infrastructure. A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar allowed a week’s time to ESIC dean to file the reply before June 30. The bench was hearing a batch of PILs filed by Shivani Kaushik, Rohit Kumar and Gaurav Kumar Singh, during which it found that the counter affidavit of the ESIC dean, Soumya Chakraborty, lacked adequate information. The court was concerned following complaints of lack of infrastructure at the hospital as the experts have predicted third wave of Covid in the state. After the second Covid wave struck, a three-tier system had been started at ESIC-Bihta and it was converted into a Covid-dedicated hospital. One section was run by the hospital, another by Army Medical Corps (both having ICU and ventilator facilities) and the third, an isolation centre, by the state government. The court said in case of failure to file the affidavit, the dean would have to appear before it on June 30. In the counter affidavit submitted before high court on Thursday, the ESIC submitted that no Covid patient is undergoing treatment at the hospital at present and that Army is no more assisting the hospital. The high court was also apprised that the outdoor and indoor departments as well as intensive care unit would be available to all patients from July 1. It was also apprised that CT-scan machine would be installed at the hospital within six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/infrastructure-for-covid-treatment-patna-hc-asks-esic-hospital-to-file-reply/articleshow/83818671.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The other members of the panel, which is headed by Magadh University’s vice-chancellor (VC) Rajendra Prasad, are the VCs of Patna University and Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University, Girish Kumar Chaudhary and Neelima Gupta. According to sources, the committee has been reconstituted due to the retirement of its former chairman. Nearly four years ago the chancellor had constituted a three-member committee to draft a new statute for promotions under the CAS. The statute was drafted in 2019 taking into consideration all the provisions prescribed in the UGC regulations, 2018. The file remained stuck with the education department for sometime amid the Covid-19 pandemic and was returned to the chancellor’s secretariat with certain queries recently. Now, changes in the new statute in light of these queries can be made only by a duly constituted committee. The promotion of teachers under the CAS in Bihar is still being done according to the provisions of the statute approved by the then chancellor more than two decades ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/governor-reconstitutes-panel-to-examine-changes-in-statute/articleshow/83818750.cms||---

Current regulations required lenders to recover gold loans dues in rupees equivalent to the value of the yellow metal borrowed. Banks that have got the permission to import gold and are participating in the gold-monetisation scheme are allowed to extend gold loans, which are availed by jewellers and exporters. The move is expected to help with import substitution, promote Indian refined gold and help jewellers meet their liabilities through gold holdings. The option will be available only for prospective borrowers as RBI rules require the loan agreement to mention that the option is available to the borrower, and it should include the standard of gold required. The repayment has to be made through locally sourced Indian gold delivery standard metal and has to be delivered to the bank by the refiner or the central agency on behalf of the borrower.The gold-monetisation scheme was launched in 2015 by the government after imports of the yellow metal neared a peak of 1,000 tonnes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gold-loans-can-be-repaid-with-gold/articleshow/83822865.cms||---

Banks in Gujarat saw their deposits swell by Rs 1.21 lakh crore to Rs 8.81 lakh crore in 2020-21 from Rs 7.6 lakh crore in 2019-20, states the latest data released by the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC). “Due to the lockdown, the economic and commercial activity was drastically reduced. Hence, withdrawals took a hit as people did not have many avenues to spend money. Even as the lockdown eased, the economic activity remained slow both for companies as well as individuals. Consequently, the bank deposits grew,” said M M Bansal, convener, SLBC – Gujarat. Sources also said that due to job losses as well as slowed growth in business, consumer confidence took a major hit, which curtailed overall spending. “Pandemic brought uncertainty and therefore, people were faced with both financial as well as health-related emergencies. As a result, most people understood the importance of savings, which also boosted the surge in bank deposits,” Bansal further added. The last time the growth in deposits was so high was in 2016-17, soon after demonetisation. At that time, bank deposits showed a growth of Rs 85,654 crore, according to SLBC. SINGLE UPI transactions up 120% in 9 mths Online education and work from home are not the only indicators of a rapid shift to the digital world but a surge in online payments too is a strong indicator of this paradigm change. In last three quarters of fiscal 2021, transactions made through Universal Payments Interface (UPI) jumped by 120% in Gujarat from 12.75 crore as of June 2020 to Rs 28.12 crore by March 2021, shows data released by the state level bankers’ committee (SLBC) – Gujarat. “Due to the pandemic there was a great deal of reluctance among the general public in using cash. Moreover, most of the banks-PSU and private--onboarded the UPI platform, which pushed up such transactions,” said Bansal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/muted-eco-activity-bolsters-states-bank-deposits-growth/articleshow/83821599.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Goa||BJP doesn’t endorse Laxmikant Parsekar, Vinay Tendulkar candidature: Goa president Sadanand Shet Tanavade||PANAJI: Days after former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar and Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar made their intentions clear of contesting the assembly elections scheduled early next year, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said on Thursday that the party does not endorse the claims made by individuals. “Nobody should announce their candidature and if someone has announced it, then BJP does not endorse it,” he said. Tanavade said the party’s state units don’t have the right to declare candidates for assembly elections and they can only make recommendations to the BJP parliamentary board, which will decide on the candidates. “Before recommending the names, we consult the party workers of the constituency and depending on the feedback we get—whether it is a single name or multiple names for a seat—we send them to the parliamentary board for a final decision,” he said. “When the party grows, the list of aspiring candidates also grows,” Tanavade said, trying to downplay the claims made by Parsekar, one of the seniormost functionaries of the party in the state, and former state president Tendulkar. He said the assembly elections have not yet been declared and these claims were too premature. Tanavade said there was a time when BJP had to search for candidates to give tickets to contest assembly elections, but today in each constituency everyone thinks that he should get the party ticket. Tendulkar had recently told TOI that he was even willing to resign from his Rajya Sabha seat if assured a ticket. Tendulkar said that he has told the party about his aspiration to contest the next assembly elections. Later, Parsekar had said there was no question of BJP denying him a ticket and he had already informed party national general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh about his desire to contest the next assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-doesnt-endorse-parsekar-tendulkar-candidature-state-prez/articleshow/83824469.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Goa||No. of women pursuing PhDs in Goa up over 5 times in 3 years||PANAJI: Over the last three years, the number of women pursuing PhD programmes in Goa has gone up more than five times — from 41 in 2017-18, to 216 in 2019-20 — as per the latest All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE). While the number of men pursuing doctorate studies in Goa has also risen, the increase is steady considering the backlog of students as PhDs are often pursued over a long period of time. The number of men taking up PhD studies more than doubled from 71 in 2017-18, to 167 in the following year, whereas for women, it was more than three times higher, from 41 to 129 during the same period. This number rose further to 216 in 2019-20. Academicians said the numbers are reflective of a changing mindset and also appear to be driven by a desire for promotions in female teachers after changes brought in recently by the Union education ministry made PhD a mandatory qualification for career advancement. “The education scenario is changing, parenting is also changing. There is a general change of mindset in society. Pursuing PhD requires long-term commitment and now, many are seen pursuing it after marriage with support from their husbands,” said principal of Government College, Khandola, Purnakala Samant. “Also, as per the new directives, by 2021, all teachers have to get PhDs to be promoted from assistant to associate professor level. Though this rule applies to men too — as the proportion of female teachers at college and university level is higher in Goa — the number of women pursuing PhDs will see a bigger rise,” said Samant. Females constitute more than 60% of Goa’s gross enrolment ratio in higher education. Similarly, more than 50% of the teachers employed as lecturers in Goa’s colleges are females. However, until last year, the number of men pursuing PhDs outnumbered women in Goa. Also, only 56 of the 227 professors in Goa are females. Former Goa University registrar Vijayendra Kamat said this situation too is set to change soon in Goa. “To become a professor, you need 12-16 years of experience and as the recruitment of men was higher earlier, more ended up qualifying as professors. A few years from now, the situation will change as the number of women appointed as teachers in higher education in Goa in recent years is higher than men,” said Kamat. He said that under the VIth Pay Commission, there was also a capping of 10% per college for promotion of teachers to the post of associate professor. The capping was removed by the VIIth Pay Commission and after recent implementation of this change in Goa, 25-30 teachers got promoted as professors, many of them women. “The increase in more females taking up doctorate studies is a very healthy sign and something we could have predicted, as the percentage of female enrolment is almost 68% in higher education in Goa. As they will enter the vocation of teaching, they will increase the representation of women in the field of research,” said Goa University registrar Radhika Nayak. She said that the increase in PhD seats in recent years in Goa as well as the availability of more guides has helped. “Teaching is seen as a good option for girls, and when they want to teach in colleges, PhD is an important qualification now as it is linked to career advancement,” said Nayak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-of-women-pursuing-phds-in-goa-up-over-5-times-in-3-yrs/articleshow/83824829.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Goa||Goa retail may take 15-18 months to recover if third wave hits: Industry||PANAJI: Job losses, massive loss of revenue and negative consumer sentiment has pummelled Goa’s retail sector, which was just about recovering from the after effects of the first Covid-19 wave. While industry bodies are yet to count their losses, stakeholders said that the second wave and the consequent state-wide curfew has cause a huge revenue loss for the organised and un-organised retail sector. Now, with experts predicting a third wave, industry captains fear that it could take as long as 15-18 months for the sector to recoup and return to normalcy. Given that the government has turned a deaf ear to entreaties for relief and support, the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) expects Goa’s retail sector will see several big brand stores and retail outlets shutting down soon. “The priority is to restart, and if by July-end the sector can reopen and stay open, then growth will be 10% over what it was in the first wave,” said Hari Kaul, the chairman of GCCI’s retail committee. “If there is a third wave, shops and establishments will be shut and we will have to wait for at least 15 months to recover.” The festive season begins from August and continues till December, a period which accounts for most of the sales revenue for the retail sector. Goa’s retail sector is largely unorganised, and includes several verticals such as groceries, branded apparel, sporting goods, pharmacies, formal and festive clothing, electronics and home appliances, furniture and luxury goods. Grocery stores have been able to weather the storm and even post some growth during the pandemic, particularly those that pushed digital payments and home deliveries. The impact has been the most on luxury goods, as discretionary spending on high-value watches, shoes, bags and clothing has dropped. The Reserve Bank of India’s consumer confidence survey results released in May showed that consumer sentiment has hit an all-time low as consumers remained pessimistic about the economy and the employment scenario. “Undoubtedly, the damage is huge for the retail sector,” said Manoj Caculo, GCCI president and chairman of the Caculo Group. “On one hand, purchasing power of the public has gone down and people’s earnings have gone down. On the other hand, fixed costs are very high. Rent, property tax, sanitation fees, salaries, minimum electricity charges, and other fees have to be paid,” said Caculo. GCCI had approached the government as well as the Corporation of the City of Panaji seeking waiver of taxes for the retail sector. The government has yet to respond to the appeal. “What will happen is that a lot of businesses will close because of the government’s attitude, especially in the retail sector, restaurants and non-essential goods segment,” said Caculo. For now, retailers are focusing on getting their staff vaccinated. They hope to analyse their losses in the coming month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/retail-may-take-15-18-months-to-recover-if-3rd-wave-hits-industry/articleshow/83824614.cms||Newton Sequeira

She appealed to people to wear masks and move out only when it is urgent. The move came after the number of Covid-19 cases saw a slight increase in the district in the last few days. For instance, Patna registered 71 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday against just 34 on June 16. However, on Thursday, the district reported 39 cases. On June 22, the district had reported 55 new cases. State IMA senior vice-president Dr Ajay Kumar said, “With easing of relaxations, there will be some increase in the number of cases. People should not panic and continue to maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour to stay safe,” Dr Kumar said. Dr Kumar, however, expressed concern over crowding at vegetable and fruit markets. “Vegetables and fruits should be pre-packed so that people spend least time in these markets,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-tests-to-be-ramped-up-in-patna-district-civil-surgeon/articleshow/83818744.cms||Sheezan Nezami

On the other hand, around 5,71,354 people in all age groups were administered Covid vaccines in the district till Wednesday,” Dr Verma said. “Purnia is also among the five districts to have received RT-PCR van from the state government for conducting tests. A mobile van can conduct 1,000 tests per day. The district has its own RT-PCR lab also. The mobile units provide results within 8 hours,” he said, adding as per the directive of the principal secretary (health), the van will be tagged with Kishanganj and Araria districts soon. On the possibility of a third wave and steps being taken in this regard, Dr Verma said, “We are preparing for the impending third wave. Since children are likely to be affected the most in the third wave, we are in the process of setting up a 100-bed paediatrics facility at Purnia sadar hospital and Dhamdaha and Banmankhi sub-divisional hospitals. Of the six paediatricians, two will be deputed at the sadar hospital and two each at Banmankhi and Dhamdaha hospitals. In addition to this, the Indian Paediatrics Association (IPA), Purnia branch, has offered help if the situation warrants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/purnia-tops-chart-in-giving-jabs-to-45-people-cs/articleshow/83818366.cms||---

The fresh dates will be uploaded to the university’s website by June 30. PPU registrar Jitendra Kumar told this newspaper that a decision regarding the extension was taken by the university’s acting vice-chancellor (VC) Surendra Pratap Singh at a high level meeting with the officials concerned on Wednesday. “The university will maintain full transparency during the interview and the selection process of research scholars from different subjects in all streams,” Jitendra said. PPU has also decided to call NET/SLET/BAT/CSIR-qualified candidates, who had applied online for the interview. The university’s media incharge B K Manglam said PPU has 25 constituent colleges located in Patna and Nalanda districts. “After the bifurcation of PPU from Magadh University (MU) in March 2018, the university will conduct the interview for the first batch of scholars,” he added. The university has also asked the candidates to prepare research synopses that they will present during the interview. “Based on their performance, names of the selected candidates will be sent to the departmental research council (DRC) and PG research council (PGRC) for final approval,” Manglam said, adding that the selected candidates will then get enrolled for the PhD work as per the UGC guidelines. According to PPU PhD cell officer on special duty (OSD), R U Singh, more than 2,000 candidates will be interviewed at the university’s PG departments. “It will be a challenge for us to conduct interviews of such a huge number of students, keeping in mind all the Covid safety precautions,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ppu-extends-dates-of-pre-phd-interview/articleshow/83818939.cms||Kumod Verma

To combat the stigma and raise awareness regarding the condition, World Vitiligo Day is observed on June 25. The date has been chosen as a tribute to the famous singer, Michael Jackson, who suffered from this condition until his death on June 25, 2009. “Vitiligo is not a disease. It’s just a loss of pigment in the skin. Vitiligo is non-contagious and it cannot spread with touch. All skin conditions which become either hypopigmented or somewhat white are not vitiligo. To confirm whether it is vitiligo or not, the patient must consult his/her nearest certified skin specialist and get the correct diagnosis done,” said Dr Vikas Shankar, assistant professor, skin and venereal diseases department, Patna Medical College and Hospital. Dr Ravi Vikram Singh, a city-based dermatologist, said, “People need to understand that vitiligo is not communicable in any way. It does not cause any damage to the patient’s health since it is a cosmetic condition. However, people who suffer from it are often ostracised and segregated. This should change.” “Micropigmentation has emerged as a corrective procedure that can camouflage the patches caused by vitiligo in the best, most subtle possible way. The results resemble the use of concealer without the possibility of it washing off. Similarly, microblading can recreate eyebrows for those fighting with such conditions and at least give them back some confidence,” said Dr Joohi Chandra, a Delhi-based cosmetologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vitiligo-non-contagious-cant-spread-with-touch/articleshow/83819092.cms||---

The RJD put up posters in front of its office on Beerchand Patel Marg here, slamming PM Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre. The posters having pictures of the PM took a swipe at the NDA government for its failure to check the prices of fuel and essential commodities. The posters were put up a day after leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav reached Patna from New Delhi. Tejashwi had said the top leadership of the BJP was maintaining a silence over unprecedented hike in the prices. “The BJP will have to pay a heavy price for the people’s sufferings in the days to come,” he had said. Reacting to the price rise, Congress state spokesperson Asit Nath Tiwari said it has adversely affected common people, especially the poor. “The party is gearing up to raise the issue and expose the NDA government at the Centre,” he added. Another Congress spokesperson, Jaya Mishra, said people are facing the brunt of inflation owing to faulty policies of the NDA government. RJD set to celebrate its foundation day on July 5: Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav held a meeting with senior leaders, including state president Jagadanand Singh, on Thursday to review the preparations for the 25th foundation day celebrations of the RJD on July 5. The celebrations are likely to be attended by RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who is currently staying at the house of his eldest daughter Misa Bharti in New Delhi. “If his health condition allows, Laluji will be present at the foundation day celebrations,” a senior party leader quoted Tejashwi as saying at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-congress-slam-centre-over-rise-in-fuel-prices/articleshow/83818881.cms||Ramashankar

---||Business||BharatPe to give fintechs platform with PMC play||Mumbai: BharatPe has said that partnering Centrum Finance in a new bank, as part of the PMC Bank rescue, will enable it to provide a tech platform for all fintechs. Resilient Innovations, the tech company that owns the BharatPe trademark, will bring in half of the Rs 900-crore startup capital that will be needed to set up a new small finance bank together with Centrum Financial Services, which will take over the failed PMC Bank. Centrum will contribute its share, which will include assets of the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) that will be transferred through a slump sale to the proposed small finance bank. Speaking to TOI, BharatPe group president Suhail Sameer elaborated how the banking operations will dovetail with BharatPe’s merchant-acquisition business, which will be distinct from the bank. According to Sameer, the new bank will be truly digital and solve the banking technology and stack issues that fintechs face by providing them application programming interface (API) integration. “What we will bring is the tech platform. This allows us to build products that will be relevant for the fintech universe… build products that a Cred or Zeta could use and benefit the wider ecosystem. Given that we own the bank one way or the other, the benefits will flow to us,” said Sameer. For BharatPe, the integration would mean that merchant acquisition becomes seamless by addressing issues such as KYC, which currently takes time. “Our loan offer generation and closure will become seamless. Generating deposits for the bank will become easier by creating current accounts and savings accounts,” said Sameer. He added that this will enable BharatPe to offer products like credit cards and overdraft facilities for merchants, which they were not able to do earlier. “We can democratise credit to the small merchant and share customers with the bank without fear of losing them. The bank, meanwhile, can rely upon us for credit underwriting as we are 50% shareholders. The integration will improve the bank’s underwriting ability,” he added. While the new bank will start with a stock of loans due to the integration of Centrum, both partners are clear that the way forward will be digital. This will require an overhaul of the IT system, but the new bank will run on the existing core banking platform and add functionality by adding IT services from other providers. BharatPe expects to start on-boarding merchants to the bank within six months. “We acquire around four lakh merchants every month. Even if a fourth of them are on-boarded to the bank, it will be one lakh additions a month,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bharatpe-to-give-fintechs-platform-with-pmc-play/articleshow/83822962.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Fake vaccination camp participants may’ve got antibiotic shots||KOLKATA: Hundreds of people who were “inoculated” at multiple fake vaccination camps organised by arrested fraudster Debanjan Deb might have been administered Amikacin Sulphate, an antibiotic. The vials seized from Deb’s Kasba office were not Covishield, the KMC confirmed on Thursday.. “We had reasons to believe that the vaccines administered at the fake Kasba camp were spurious. After examining a vial, our doctors have confirmed that the recipients of the camp were administered fake vaccines,” Atin Ghosh, member, KMC BoA in-charge of health, said on Thursday. The vials seized by cops from the Kasba camp had Çovishield labels without the mandatory batch number, manufacturing or expiry date. “The vials were smaller in size and had only four doses. An original Covishield vial contains 10 doses. The Covishield label was also fake,” a KMC health department official said. It was also found that the Covishield label was stuck over another label, that of Amikacin Sulphate 500 mg, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the urinary tract, bones, and joints, lungs, brain, blood, among others. Common side effects include injection site reactions and increased blood urea. But whether the contents of the vial were actually Amikacin Sulphate is yet to be ascertained. The seized vials have been sent to the State Food and Drug Testing laboratory for chemical analysis, Swasthya Bhavan officials said. The Kolkata Police detective department, which is interrogating Deb, said on Thursday that the accused had claimed that he had administered Amikacin, which he procured at Rs 13 per dose. “We raided Deb’s offices and home and recovered vials of Amikacin injection from his office. We took Deb along with us to lead us to the evidence. We have also recovered fake labels of Covishield from his house. We have seized his computer and sent it for forensic tests. We have found that he had designed the fake labels on his computer,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Cops said the accused used to replace the Amikacin labels with Covishield labels both at his residence and his office at Kasba. While administering a jab, his employees ensured they kept the injections ready before allowing a recipient inside. This is the reason why he would not allow anyone inside the vaccine room with a phone and did not allow anyone to take a selfie after getting jabbed,” said an officer. In fact, this had led to an argument between him and some students of City College during a camp Deb organised there. At one of the camps, Dispovan syringes – which are used for regular injections and for drawing blood - were used. Vaccine syringes are thinner and smaller. “We need to ascertain if his employees were aware and willing partners as Deb paid them anything between Rs 25,000-35,000 per month,” the cops said. Health department officials on Thursday said the process of procuring Covid-19 vaccines were entirely transparent. “All vaccine vials go to the vaccine depot at the Central Family Welfare store in Bagbazar. The health department then decides where the vaccines will be sent. The entire process is a systematic one and every step is recorded. Each vial bears a batch number, manufacturing date and an expiry date, which were not there on these vials,” a health official said. “We have a stringent template through which organisations have to apply for off-site camps. Each has to apply through the CoWin portal. So, we can trace every vial,” said a State Urban Development Authority official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-vax-camp-participants-mayve-got-antibiotic-shots/articleshow/83823996.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Delta may outfox even fully vaccinated: Doctors||KOLKATA: Covid could turn more severe for those affected during the third wave of the pandemic, including for around 5% to 10% of third-wave patients who would be fully vaccinated by then, because of mutations like Delta and Delta Plus, experts have warned. But, on the brighter side, the third wave itself could be much shorter than the second, with fewer catching the virus. Experts fear that the mutations — first detected in India — could neutralise the protection provided by existing vaccines during the next wave, which is expected to strike between September and October. Variations of the virus are the results of mutations that routinely take place during a prolonged pandemic, said Raja Dhar, director of pulmonology at CMRI. But they are far more potent than existing ones, and the third wave will include these, he added. “The virus changes to survive and even though these alterations are minor, they may turn out to be fatal, as the existing vaccines are not designed to counter them,” he told TOI. “With the relaxation of restrictions, there will be more travel and transmission. People from one city will infect those in another, which is called the ‘drift phenomenon’. With every transmission, the virus changes and eventually this leads to variants.” He added that the ‘shift phenomenon’ — people from one country or region affecting those in others — could also be at work during the third wave. “More severe pneumonia, fibrosis and cytokine storm are likely in the third wave,” he predicted. Most mutations take place inside the ‘S gene’ or the spike protein, pointed out Bhaskar Narayan Chowdhuri, microbiologist, Peerless Hospital. “In mutant strains, the S gene will be different from the previous strains. Inactivated vaccines (such as Covaxin) seem to offer better protection against this. But it has to be remembered that all vaccines offer some protection and may restrict the disease to a mild one,” said Chowdhuri. He, however, warned that the Delta Plus variant was more transmissible and had been found to have an “affinity for lung tissues”. “This could be dangerous since so far we have seen Covid affecting the upper respiratory system more than the lungs. If the trend changes, the disease will be more severe and the mortality higher,” he said. Souren Panja, an interventionist at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), agreed with Dhar and called for screening of mutant viruses. “The entry of Delta and Delta Plus has complicated the scenario. These may not be cured by medicines that we are now using, namely remdisivir or steroids. More importantly, vaccines may not stave off these strains, which could be dangerous. So, we need wider screening facilities for mutants, which we don’t have now.” The saving grace was that the number of Delta cases were still few and restricted to a few states, adding, “The entire Covid strategy may have to be changed but unfortunately we may not have adequate time for that.” Dhar pointed out that according to a theory, it is advisable to vaccinate just 60% of the population, since that may prevent mutations. “The more you vaccinate and resist the virus, the more it will change to survive. It has started happening,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/delta-may-outfox-even-fully-vaccinated-docs/articleshow/83823871.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Rs 6 graft, bus conductor’s 18-year legal battle goes in vain||AHMEDABAD: A GSRTC bus conductor fought a legal battle for 18 years to no gain after the department stopped his increment for six months as his punishment for not issuing ticket to a passenger even after charging him Rs 6 towards the fare. The Gujarat high court last week cancelled a tribunal's order of quashing his punishment saying charging fare and not issuing ticket was not an act of not just misconduct but corruption. The case involved Rameshbhai Kodinariya, who was a conductor in a bus on Jamnagar-Kalawad-Dhoraji route. On August 5, 2003 during a trip, it was found that Kodinariya had collected Rs 6 from a passenger but did not issue him a ticket. An inquiry was held. The conductor was found guilty of irregularity and he was punished by the department with stoppage of his increment for six months with permanent effect. Kodinariya moved the industrial tribunal against the punishment but did not question the outcome of the inquiry. In August 2014, the tribunal quashed the punishment order and directed the department to fix pay after considering notional pay during the period in question and pay him all consequential benefits. The tribunal even quashed the inquiry. The Rajkot divisional manager approached the high court against the tribunal’s decision and said that the tribunal had quashed the inquiry, though the conductor had not challenged the inquiry process and its outcome. The department cited the Supreme Court’s observation in service matters that a tribunal cannot weigh the quantum of penalty in golden scales. When the inquiry was legal, the tribunal cannot interfere on the aspect of punishment. After hearing the case, Justice A P Thaker observed, “…the conductor enjoys the position of trust and confidence and acts as a trustee of the Corporation and it is his duty to safeguard the interest of the Corporation. The act of the conductor in not issuing the tickets after receiving the amount from the passenger is not an act of not only misconduct, but it is corruption.” The HC quashed the tribunal’s decision of quashing Kodinariya’s punishment and said that the tribunal’s getting into the merit of department inquiry was beyond tribunal’s scope because the conductor had not challenged it at all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-6-graft-bus-conductors-18-yr-legal-battle-goes-in-vain/articleshow/83821570.cms||Saeed Khan
---||Patna||Hold test, hire commerce teachers in schools: HC to Bihar govt||PATNA: The Patna high court on Thursday asked the state government to assess its requirement and conduct Secondary Teacher Eligibility Test (STET) for candidates with commerce background within six months. Candidates with commerce degree were not allowed to take part in the STET conducted last year. A bench of Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyay asked the state government to determine the number of vacant posts for commerce teachers at secondary and senior secondary government schools across the state. “Notify the vacant posts within three months and send the requisition to Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) asking it to conduct STET for such candidates,” the court told the government. The bench simultaneously disposed of the writ petitions of Mohammad Afroz and several others who had moved high court in August last year after candidates with commerce background were left out of STET-2019, which was conducted in the state after a gap of nearly nine years. The high court’s order for conducting STET for commerce candidates is expected to provide relief to around 20,000 teacher aspirants in the state. Petitioners’ counsels Ritika Rani, Dinu Kumar and Ritu Raj submitted that even if the test had already been conducted, the rights of the deserving candidates of commerce stream cannot be snatched. They informed the court that more than 1,095 posts of commerce teachers are lying vacant in secondary and senior secondary schools in the state. The BSEB informed the court that it only conducts the test as per requisition sent by the state government against vacancies. Counsel Gyan Prakash had appeared for the exam board. The state government, on its part, informed the court that there was no requirement for commerce teachers when the STET was conducted last year. Standing counsel Jitendra Kumar Roy and Vinita Singh, who appeared for the state government, submitted that required infrastructure is being developed for appointing commerce teachers in the government schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hold-test-hire-commerce-teachers-in-schools-hc/articleshow/83819632.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Kolkata||Civic body, Kolkata cops tighten watch on off-site camps||KOLKATA: The civic body and Kolkata Police top brass on Thursday asked officials at borough offices and officers at police stations to ensure that no unauthorized off-site vaccination camps are held. The directives came in the wake of the fake vaccination camps that have come to light after the arrest of conman Debanjan Deb. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) top brass on Thursday alerted all borough executive health officials and medical officers to keep a close watch on all off-site vaccination camps organized within their jurisdictions. The borough health officials were also asked to keep the local police stations informed about them. “We have made it mandatory for organizers of all off-site Covid vaccination camps to apply online. We will scrutinize the applications and documents relating to the purpose of such a camp and give approval only to those which are bona fide,” said a KMC official. Deb had used KMC banners and logos on stationery at the camps. Health officials in Borough XII, under which the camp was held for 10 days, said they were ignorant about it. The Kolkata Police top brass has also asked all police stations to check the authenticity of each off-site vaccination camp in their respective areas to ensure they had been mandated by KMC. The communications to DCPs was sent from Lalbazar on Thursday evening. The Kasba PS had not been informed about the fake camp. “Each camp has to mandatorily have permission from KMC or the state health department. In case the permission is not in place, the camp has to be flagged,” an officer said. However, cops deployed at police stations said the job will not be easy. “There are hundreds of such special camps each day. If these are just half-day or day-long programmes, it might not always be possible for us to verify details. While the idea of the portal — as proposed by KMC — will be a big relief, we would want the health department to make it mandatory for all health camp organizers to inform us about Covid vaccination drives beforehand,” said an officer. With KMC requesting police for a list of all recipients at the camps organized by Deb, cops have decided to ask the organizers to try and provide at least the number of people who are getting vaccinated. These camp organizers, cops said, must keep a database of all recipients so it can be produced to cops whenever asked. The cops will also visit the homes of recipients to check on them if required. With reports in Mumbai of over 2,500 people receiving fake jabs after the accused met the housing societies to offer camps, the police are also likely to meet RWAs and ask them to be careful if they receive such offers. “We will advise them to get in touch with borough offices and local coordinators before taking the final step,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/civic-body-cops-tighten-watch-on-off-site-camps/articleshow/83820995.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Three arrested under new ‘love jihad’ law||VADODARA: City police have arrested three men under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021 that came into force on June 15. This is the second case registered under the ‘love jihad’ law by the cops within a week in the city and third in the state. A 23-year-old woman approached the Fatehgunj police on Wednesday accusing her husband of forcefully converting her religion. The complainant told the cops that she had first met accused Mohib Pathan in 2018 when she used to attend her tuition classes. They both exchanged phone numbers and started talking with each other. She said that 25-year-old Pathan proposed her for marriage and promised that she would be free to follow her religion. The duo had registered marriage in August 2020 following which she shifted to Pathan’s house in Chhani. “The woman said that within a month of the marriage, Pathan called a Qazi and performed marriage rituals as per his religion. She said that he also forced her to change her name,” the police said. In her complaint, the woman alleged that Pathan would demand unnatural sex and thrashed her if she refused. The woman added that he didn’t allow her to pray as per her religion and also threw away an idol she had brought with her. Her plaints before Pathan’s father Imtiyaz Pathan and elder brother Mohsin Pathan, too fell on deaf ears, she alleged. The woman also accused the elder brother of trying to molest her when she was alone at home. Her husband didn’t protest even when she informed him about the incident. She said that Pathan was further enraged when she named their baby, born three months ago, as Shiva, and thrashed her. Pathan got violent again on Wednesday, and the woman left her house and approached the police. “We have arrested the father and his two sons. Investigations are on to find out if anyone else is involved in the incident,” said Paresh Bhesania, ACP. The accused have also been booked under IPC sections 354 for outraging woman’s modesty, 498-A for domestic violence and 377 for unnatural sex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/three-arrested-under-new-love-jihad-law/articleshow/83817038.cms||---

---||Delhi||Five mini-forests to come up in north Delhi in a fortnight||NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has initiated work for developing five mini-forests in the middle of congested areas in the capital this monsoon. The project, which is being taken up with the help of Rotary Club, is aimed at contributing to ecological restoration. The mini-forests will be developed in 1.5 acres each at C-Block Park in Azadpur Mandi, Sultanpuri B-4 Block, Prashant Vihar G-Block and Rohini’s Sector-24 and Sector-25. The north corporation commissioner, Sanjay Goel, said that the project had been taken up under ‘Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain’ programme and the sites would be developed in the next 15 days. “Monsoon is expected to reach Delhi within a couple of weeks and we want to utilise this time for planting saplings for mini-forests besides the regular plantations in parks, gardens, central verges, etc. There is a plan to plant at least 6,000 saplings of indigenous trees at these sites,” he said further. The civic body had started the drive to develop such forests in the middle of congested areas two years back and three such mini-forests have so far been developed in Keshavpuram and two in Karol Bagh. After five years, these sites will be developed into dense green areas. “We are making efforts to develop more green spaces so that citizens can get clean air and a pure environment even in and around congested areas. Last year during monsoon, we planted 27,330 trees and 37,000 shrubs and proposed to plant 20,000 trees and 30,000 shrubs this year,” said Goel. A senior north corporation official stated that a total of about 16 acres of area would be converted into mini-forests. “At these places, we will plant indigenous saplings like neem, pilkhan, pipal, jamun, fig (ficus carica), etc because their survival rate is high. Arrangements for water supply have already been made,” he said. Differentiating these sites to normal parks, he said that the saplings are planted close to each other in mini-forests and there is hardly any sitting arrangement. “The areas have proper boundaries and gates and no benches are installed to dissuade walkers from sitting unnecessarily. Chances of saplings getting damaged are also low,” the official said, adding, “while sites were identified early this year, the pandemic delayed the work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/5-mini-forests-to-come-up-in-n-delhi-in-a-fortnight/articleshow/83823456.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Pandemic hit mental state of 30-39 age group more||CHANDIGARH: A comparative study of pre- and post-pandemic times conducted by a group of doctors from GMCH-32 on the pattern of admissions in a psychiatry ward found an increase of 14.52% of patients in the age group of 30 to 39 years in 2020 than 2019 and maximum were housewives from Chandigarh. Besides, there was an increase of 4.4% in divorced individuals seeking treatment last year. However, there was an overall decrease in total patients of all age groups. The study was conducted by a team of Dr Ajeet Sidana, Dr Vibha Goel and Dr Sahildeep Kaur. The experts observed that most patients seeking treatment in 2019 were in the age group of 20-29 years, but in 2020, those in the 30-39 age group were more in number—a significant increase of 14.52% from 2019 in the age range. Men outnumbered women in all categories. The experts said the objective was to study the pattern of admissions in the psychiatry ward during the pandemic and compare the sociodemographic and clinical profiles of patients admitted in 2020 with that of 2019. The report said the case record files of an inpatient psychiatric unit from March 23 to September 22, 2019, and March 23 to September 22, 2020 were retrieved. Sociodemographic data, admission criteria of the patients, clinical diagnosis, duration of stay in the ward, and details of capacity assessment were studied. The data was tabulated as per a coding system and examined and compared using statistical analysis system software. Of a total of 312 admissions, 236 were in 2019 and 76 in 2020, which was a significant decrease. More patients admitted in 2020 were in the age group of 30-39 years and included residents of Chandigarh, housewives and those with income less than Rs 3,500 per month. The results show that the number of admissions to the psychiatry ward in 2020 were significantly lower than pre-Covid 2019, and the predominant reasons for admission were complicated withdrawals due to psychoactive substance abuse and noncompliance to treatment. Also, the mean duration of stay was longer in 2020 compared with the previous year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pandemic-hit-mental-state-of-30-39-age-group-more/articleshow/83820912.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The 1.75-acre plot, which will be divided into two parts, faces two historical monuments — Red Fort on one side and Jama Masjid on the other. While the first rectangular part measuring approximately 5,000 sq metres will have an entrance plaza, sunken sitting area, baradari, landscaped courts, open air amphitheatre, fountain, stage and washroom, the second triangular section measuring about 2,000 sqm will have a huge lawn covered with interlocking tiles. The civic body aims to conduct light and sound shows here, if all goes according to the plan. Former north corporation mayor and councillor from Sadar Bazar Jai Prakash said, “The project costing Rs 4.7 crore was conceived two years ago. Funds were allocated through MPLAD, but due to the pandemic and other reasons it could not be carried out. Most of the funds either lapsed or could not be released. However, we still have Rs 50 lakh left from the MPLAD fund. The remaining amount is being arranged by the civic body.” On Wednesday, former Union minister Vijay Goel and commissioner Sanjay Goel visited the site to take stock of the situation.” The site is currently being levelled and the project is expected to be complete by December. “We started work immediately after getting permission from Delhi Disaster Management Authority. The engineering department is currently levelling the plot. The park will have white sandstone, red sandstone, marble, Dholpur stone, etc so that it looks similar to the two historical monuments,” said Prakash. “The park will have a 400m boundary wall constructed with RCC pillars and bricks. The finishing will be done with Mehrab made of red stone, decorative stone jalis, etc,” added the former mayor. A corporation official said that permission had been obtained from all agencies concerned for the project. “While visiting Jama Masjid and Red Fort, visitors can come and relax here. Apart from developing the lawn, we will be planting saplings of indigenous trees, like amaltas, peepal and banyan. To make the place look elegant at night, we plan to install artistic lampposts in the corridors. For giving easy access, pavements will be constructed around the park,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/heritage-park-to-be-walled-citys-new-charm/articleshow/83823482.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Corbett, Rajaji to stay open all year, experts flag threat to tigers' mating season||DEHRADUN: The four-month window during which the Corbett and Rajaji tiger reserves would be shut has been done away with. The reserves will now remain open all year round, state forest minister Harak Singh Rawat announced on Wednesday. While the state sees the year-long eco-tourism as a major revenue earner in pandemic-hit times, scientists and environmental activists flagged concerns about its impact on the ecosystem — disturbance of breeding season, increased human-wildlife conflict and disruption of the monsoon rejuvenation cycle. Corbett is home to 231 tigers and Rajaji, 37 — among the highest tiger densities in the country — besides elephants, leopards, ungulates and several species of birds endemic to the Shivalik and lower Himalayas. The reserves are usually open between November 15 and June 15, shutting visitors out during monsoon months, which coincide with the animals’ breeding season. “During that time, the majority of species mate while others give birth. With human intervention, the chance of human-wildlife conflict would multiply because the animals are protective of their young ones,” Padma Shri Anup Shah, former member of the Corbett Foundation, told TOI. Reenu Paul, a green activist, added, “In those months, the animals turn aggressive and need complete isolation.” A tourist influx wouldn’t allow that. Shah gave an example. “Once, at Bijrani (in Corbett), someone spotted a tiger. He called up other people. Other safari vehicles sped to the spot to catch a glimpse, causing a jam in the reserve. We have to be very watchful so these incidents don’t recur. Animals need silence and zero disturbance,” he said. Increased traffic would also erode the soil in the long run. “We have kachcha roads in the reserves. Constant plying of vehicles through them would cause soil erosion. That needs to be taken care of,” said senior scientist at the Wildlife Institute of India, YV Jhala. “NTCA guidelines also need to be followed.” Monsoon is also when the flora of the reserves is rejuvenated. “Nature is in full bloom. Food for animals is abundant, which is why most species breed during monsoon. That would get disrupted if the reserves are never shut,” said Shah. Besides natural restoration, activists said other work might also need to be done. “The forest department needs time for maintenance. If the reserves are always open, when will they do that?” asked Paul. Taking this into account, tiger conservationist K Ullas Karanth said, “If the reserves have to be open all year, the primary concern is logistics — managing the show well without causing a hindrance to both wildlife and tourists.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/corbett-rajaji-to-stay-open-all-year-experts-flag-threat-to-tigers-mating-season/articleshow/83818400.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BEST wait time to reduce with 39 new e-buses, 100 more on way||MUMBAI: In what is likely to ease the long wait at bus stops, BEST plans to expand its fleet from 3,242 buses at present to more than 4,000 soon. Announcing this, BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra said 39 brand new AC electric buses have been inducted into the fleet on Thursday and will hit the roads from Monday followed by another 100 electric buses soon. BEST wants to give a push to electric vehicles. In a statement issued to the media, Chandra said, “We at BEST will provide more and more electric buses in Mumbai to reduce the air and noise pollution and improve the passenger service experience in the near future.” BEST also expects new AC Mini buses—around 200—in a few weeks and 200 more thereafter, an official said. At the same time, the city can expect 400 CNG buses which are being procured for Rs 1,942 crore for a 10-year contract. Chandra said he wants to make the fleet efficient, with rationalisation of routes and ensuring maximum buses on busy routes. “We want to reduce the wait at bus stops and put an end to commuter woes.” The recent reduction in the overall fleet of over 1,000 buses and the government rule barring standees in a bus has led to scores of commuters waiting for buses in long queues (for 30-45 minutes) daily. With ridership set to increase from 21 lakh to 25 lakh soon, commuter frustration is bound to increase, said a transport expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-wait-time-to-reduce-with-39-new-e-buses-100-more-on-way/articleshow/83823486.cms||Somit Sen

Fuelled by unusual high demand from China, farmers got high returns from the groundnut crop. As the sowing season started this year, it came as no surprise when farmers of the region went for large scale groundnut cultivation. The groundnut crop area of the state increased to 20 lakh hectares last year from an average 16 lakh hectares. And the trend is expected to continue this year. Gujarat’s total groundnut production was around 33 lakh ton out of which 40% was consumed by the export market. In the domestic markets too the price of groundnut oil rose by 25%. With the new crop set to hit the market by October, the farmers are expecting a windfall this year too. According to exporters, last year the groundnut oil export was around 2.25 lakh tonnes which was five times more than normal exports of 40,000 tons. Thanks to the good export demand, the market price of groundnut remained high last year resulting in lowest procurement at the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) in the last four years. Even if the market price goes down, groundnut growers won’t be at much loss, informs Pravin Patodiya, a farmer of a village near Jetpur in Rajkot district. “Last year we got good prices in the market so we didn’t sell our crop at MSP centres. This year if the market price is low we can bank on the government to procure our crop,” Patodiya said. The MSP of groundnut was Rs 1,055 per 20 kg last year. Those in the know of the international groundnut business say farmers can expect good demand this year too. China exported huge quantities last year as its groundnut crop was damaged due to the floods. Experts say that this year too China will import from India in the initial months of the new season, which will start from October. “We can’t predict China’s demand. Sudan and Senegal are our major competitors but their crop will come in December-January so in that case we expect good export demand from October to December,” said Samir Shah, president of Gujarat State Edible Oils and Oil seeds Association. Apart from the high price the crop fetched, the other reason why so many farmers from the region are opting for groundnut is the pink bollworm that has been infesting the cotton crop. “I generally cultivate cotton but this year I have sowed groundnuts on 20 bighas of my farm. Last year my cotton crop got damaged due to pink bollworm. Also, if I cultivate groundnuts I can take a winter crop, which is not possible in the case of cotton,” said Haresh Buha, a farmer from Amreli. According to sources the new groundnut crop will hit the market by October but currently there is no sufficient stock in the market that can last till October. The government has around 1.75 lakh ton stock while oil millers require around six lakh ton in next three-four months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/gujarat-farmers-go-for-groundnut-again/articleshow/83818522.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Pune||Demand rises for Covaxin first dose, but sites remain limited||Pune: Over the past few weeks, there has been a surge in the demand for Covaxin across the district. But a first dose remains hard to come by due to the limited number of sites offering the shot. Due to shortages, government sites are currently administering only the second dose, meant to complete vaccination schedules of those who have already received the shot. On Thursday, CoWIN showed there were only three private hospitals in the district giving both doses of Covaxin (out of 69 vaccination centres). Citizens said it could be days before they're able to get a first dose. Interest in Covaxin rose after some doctors started recommending Covaxin over Covishield, in people with certain health conditions. In May, data on adverse events showed there is a very minuscule but definitive risk of thromboembolic events after vaccination by Covishield. At the time, the health ministry had said the events were rare in the country — around 0.61 per million doses. But citizens TOI spoke to said their doctors have recommended Covaxin to cut chances of clotting in at-risk individuals. Sanil Mahajan, a city-based working professional, said, "A family member, who is undergoing a non-Covid treatment, was advised by his doctor to only take Covaxin. Even the remotest chance of a blood clot would not be good in his case. Unfortunately though, Covaxin first shots are not easily available in Pune. My relative is over 60 and he needs a vaccine." Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association, Pune, said, “There is a general view that Covaxin may be better in patients who have experienced major blood clotting, in combination with low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). But this is just advice because ultimately, it is the recipient’s voluntary decision. Such patients should consult their physician for a risk-benefit assessment before taking the vaccine.” Others cited different reasons for their interest in Covaxin. Shantanu R, a working professional, said people who have taken Covaxin have reported lower incidence of post-vaccination fatigue. "But the first dose is hard to come by. As of Thursday, CoWIN showed more than 200 unclaimed slots (free government slots) available for the same day for a second dose of Covaxin. I have seen that demand for a second dose of Covaxin at government sites has reduced and slots remain unbooked. Authorities should then open Covaxin slots for first-dose recipients in the 45-plus category,” he said. Mayur Kakade, an IT professional from Sinhgad Road, said, "I got a Covaxin first dose slot after trying for 15 days. The few private hospitals giving both doses of the vaccine have limited slots per day and they're being booked in seconds," he said. Health officials, who confirmed that they've been receiving numerous requests for first doses of Covaxin, said the state currently allows only second doses to be administered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/demand-rises-for-covaxin-first-dose-but-sites-remain-limited/articleshow/83823491.cms||Neha Madaan

The numbers were down over the January-March period, but higher than the corresponding months in 2020 when the lockdown was severe. The Anarock report revealed that Mumbai finished first in sales over the period, followed by Pune (see graphic), which collectively took up nearly 46% of the seven major markets in India — the four metros, plus Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Observers attributed the drop in the numbers from April to June from that of the January-March period to the expiry of the stamp duty reductions (after March) in Maharashtra, the second wave of the pandemic since mid-April and the ensuing lockdown-like restrictions in the state. The sales figures from April to June this year were higher than that of the same period in 2020. “The second Covid-19 wave impacted the residential property market in the April-June (2021) period. But compared to the corresponding period of 2020, the sector displayed remarkable resilience. In the backdrop of developers adopting technology in their businesses, there was a huge annual jump in both new launches and sales. Importantly, the localized lockdowns and restrictions did not dent activity as much as the complete nation-wide lockdown last year,” Anarock chairman Anuj Puri said in a statement. A Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai) official said the sales in the April-June period were also “dampened by the lack of site visits”, but expressed optimism about sales in the coming months. “People are still a bit scared to come out of their houses and check out the available options. With the fast vaccination drives and continuing low bottomed out sale rates of real estate, we expect sales to pick up in the next three-four months. This had happened last year after the first Covid wave,” Credai Pune Metro president Anil Pharande said. Industry observers said another stamp duty cut, which was executed by the state government in two phases from September 2020, could revitalize sales. “We saw brisk sales in the first three months of the year due to the stamp duty cut. Sales dropped from April as the stamp duty cuts expired. The second Covid wave set in from mid-April. Raw material prices have gone up by up to 60-70% in the past few months, which should be looked at. The government has been largely looking at the aspect of supply. It now should focus on demand as well. Another stamp duty cut will definitely help in increasing sales once again,” said Paramvir Singh Paul, the Pune branch head of Knight Frank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-mum-account-for-half-of-april-june-housing-sales/articleshow/83820983.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The court also held that it prima facie appeared that Patil played a role in getting the fraudulent Letters of Undertaking (LOU) issued. While denying bail, the court also said that Patil was among those who played a role in moving and hiding documents in the office of law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, and that there are allegations of clandestine efforts to destroy the documents.

Mousumi Pal, a homemaker from Rajdanga Main Road, said she had been having a constant headache ever since she took the shot three days ago. Deb reportedly held a 10-day vaccine drive in Kasba, besides several others, including one at City College on Amherst Street on June 18, where he allegedly supplied Sputnik V. A TOI photographer who was present at the camp on June 18 at City College was barred from taking pictures of the vaccine vials. After examining around 70 people who got their “vaccines” at the Kasba camp, Debasish Barui, a KMC medical officer at Borough XII, pointed out that most of the recipients were suffering from panic attack after police booked the organizer on the charge of holding fake vaccination camps. But a KMC health department official at the headquarters made it clear the civic body had decided to extend all sorts of medical assistance to the recipients if they fell ill. “If need be, we will organize medical camps in Kasba to take care of the recipients who might fall ill,” the official said. Read AlsoMP, MLA try to decode the man behind the charade: Nothing about him looked amissDebanjan Deb, the man who arranged for fake vaccination camps —all of them free — across the city and suburbs, had perfected the look of a civil servant that had fooled everyone, from celebrities, politicians, college principals, policemen and corporate officials.Barui was sent to examine the health of the recipients and dispel doubts about the ill-effects of a fake vaccine. “I interacted with around 70 recipients, most of whom showed signs of nervousness. Some of them were scared about the effect of the liquid administered to them as the so-called vaccine is likely to be proved fake. Sensing that such a behaviour was triggered by a panic attack, I assured them there was nothing to be worried about,” Barui told TOI. Some who got their shots at the camp apparently felt a bit suspicious when they felt no side-effect after taking the shot. Jhantu Das, owner of a garments shop at Kasba New Market, said, “I thought something was amiss as I did not have any of the signs of being vaccinated, like mild fever or pain in the arm. I started doubting what was administered to me a week ago.” Read AlsoKolkata: Fake vaccination camp participants may’ve got antibiotic shotsHundreds of people who were “inoculated” at multiple fake vaccination camps organised by arrested fraudster Debanjan Deb might have been administered Amikacin Sulphate, an antibiotic. The vials seized from Deb’s Kasba office were not Covishield, the KMC confirmed on Thursday..Students at City College were equally scared as they, too, had received their “vaccine’ from Deb’s camp. Raja Bhattacharya, a former student, said, “The organizers told me I was administered Sputnik V. Now that the man is found to be a fraud, I am feeling anxious.” Debjit Majumdar, a current student and a resident of Maniktala, was worried about how to get the real vaccine. “More than my health, I am worried about how to get a real vaccine before the third wave hits,” he said. According to the college authorities, there was no way they could see through Deb’s fraud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/what-did-we-get-ask-worried-vaccine-recipients-across-city/articleshow/83823631.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Bhopal||Schools make vaccination mandatory for staff, hold camps||Bhopal: Even before opening the campuses, several schools at their individual level have launched full vaccination for their teaching faculty and staff. Schools aim that they will be able to be 100 percent vaccinated by July 30. Schools said that they have launched their preparations at their own level. “Everyone knows the importance of vaccination. We know that schools will also be opening in the near future. We have launched vaccination of our staff to ensure safety of each member associated with the school. We will achieve 100% vaccination on our school campus before July 30,” said D Ashok, principal, Gyan Ganga International Academy. He added that the school will ask parents also to follow the same. “Several schools have been made centres for vaccination. Such schools can urge the parents to be vaccinated if they wish. In this way schools can play a big role in achieving a full vaccination scenario,” he said. School principals have made it mandatory for their staff to be vaccinated. “We are taking all possible steps to ensure safety of the staff and students in the future when campuses open. Our goal is to join the movement and support the government to achieve 100% vaccination. I think every organisation should make it mandatory. Through this way we will be able to vaccinate all in quick time,” said group director, IES Public School, Manisha Kawathekar. Even parents have hailed the initiative. “This is a good idea adopted by the schools. As everyone is talking about the third wave, such a step has become very important to ensure vaccination for all. I will also join their initiative,” said Anshul Kale, father of a class 10 student. Notably, schools have demanded to open the campuses as keeping them closed for la ong time will put locks permanently. State govt is also planning to open the campuses soon, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/schools-make-vaccination-mandatory-for-staff-hold-camps/articleshow/83821047.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Lucknow||AIMIM will contest 100 seats in Uttar Pradesh assembly polls||LUCKNOW: The AIMIM will contest at least 100 seats with dominant Muslim population in the assembly eletions next year. The party has already identified these seats, which are in the western, central and eastern region of the state. “We have only one agenda which is development of Muslims, but that does not mean we are averse to others. We have started screening candidates and we want good candidates, not necessarily only Muslims,” said state party president Shaukat Ali. In recently held zila panchayat election, the party had fielded at least 59 non-Muslim candidates. “We are not the BJP that ignores Muslims completely,” he said. The UP unit of AIMIM is almost done with its ground work to raise a strong organization in the state at the booth level. Ali said that in the coming four days he would take up the review of every Vidhan Sabha constituency to plug holes, if any, in the organizational structure. This is the second assembly election that AIMIM would contest in the state. On the other hand, the party has also invited applications from candidates. “We have sought details about the background. We do not want to field those who do not have a clean past and image,” said Ali. In 2017, the party had contested 32 seats on its own. Though the AIMIM had cornered about 0.2% votes, it remained runner-up in Sambhal and in at least three constituencies the party polled considerable votes to end up at the third spot. What has really spirited up the party workers in UP, this time is its good show in the panchayat election. The party supported candidates won at least 24 seats and ended up as runners-up at over 50. Second, the party’s good performance in Bihar assembly elections last year has also boosted the workers’ morale. The AIMIM has been active in Uttar Pradesh since 2014. “We want to check BJP from coming to power. But, at the same time, we are upset with the parties which we thought were our own parties and would work for us. We are fighting for ‘daavedaari’ not ‘hissedaari’,” he said. As of now, the party’s alliance with Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha led by SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar is continuing in Uttar Pradesh. “Akhilesh Yadavji has said that he would have an alliance with smaller parties. But the parties that he has named are lesser known and some of them like the RLD have got its presence reduced to only five districts in the state. Any alliance to stop the BJP is not complete without us,” said Ali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aimim-will-contest-100-seats-in-up-assembly-polls/articleshow/83825494.cms||Neha Shukla

The letter states, ‘Only because the parents have failed to pay fees causing loss of studies/education, committing physical or mental harassment of students, giving inferior treatment to students is a crime.’ The letter has also asked school managements to ensure that none of the students are denied online education for not being able to pay school fees. Citing sections of The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act or Right to Education Act (RTE), Kumbhar stated that the fees should be finalised while following all the norms and in consultation of Parents Teachers Association. When contacted, Kumbhar said, “Breaking out of pandemic and imposition of lockdown to control the spread of infection, has caused serious personal, professional and financial losses to the masses.” The officer said that the crisis also resulted into many parents not being able to pay school fees. As a result, many students are allegedly being denied online education and are being removed from class groups formed on Whatsapp. Citing the series of complaints being received by Beed district collector office and ZP office against the school managements, Kumbhar appealed to the managements of private, partially aided, trust-run and self financed schools to be considerate in the current situation. While asking the schools to charge 50% fees for academic year 2020-21 and 2021-22, the letter has appealed to the schools to take cognizance of the current financial difficulties being faced by parents and take a considerate view as a part of social responsibility. The letter has also asked the schools to not to opt for any forceful steps for collecting fees and, at the same time, has instructed them to allow parents to pay the remaining portion of fees in instalments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/beed-zp-ceo-asks-private-and-partially-aided-schools-to-charge-only-50-fees/articleshow/83818532.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The state health department has issued detailed guidelines to these districts to ramp up testing and contact tracing. Among the 27 districts, Hingoli, Nandurbar, Palghar, Dhule, Buldhana, Nanded, Parbhani, Kolhapur and Raigad feature at the bottom with an average of 1.5 lakh tests per 10 lakh population, state health officials said.“With the emergence of the Delta plus variant, districts have to increase testing and contact tracing,” said director of health services Dr Archana Patil. Patil has outlined the need for ILI/SARI surveillance in the areas of the index cases. So far, the Delta plus variant has been found in seven districts, including nine cases in Ratnagiri, seven in Jalgaon, two in Mumbai and one each in Palghar, Thane and Sindhudurg. The CM in his review meeting held on Thursday directed Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Hingoli districts to stay cautious and increase testing and contact tracing ahead of the impending threat of the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mahrashtra-experts-call-for-increased-testing-as-27-districts-lag-state-average/articleshow/83823528.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP replaces Unnao zila panchayat chief poll candidate after uproar||LUCKNOW: Caught in the middle of a row after its decision to back Arun Singh -- an accused of plotting the murder of Unnao rape survivor -- for the Zila Panchayat chairman elections, BJP replaced him on Thursday. It will now support Shakun Singh, the wife of slain SP MLC Ajit Singh. The Unnao gang rape survivor had said earlier on Thursday that she had written to President Ram Nath Kovind, PM Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath, accusing the BJP of giving tickets to those who wanted to kill her. She later thanked the PM and the CM for cancelling Singh’s ticket. BJP’s Unnao district president Raj Kishore Rawat said that the decision to cancel Arun Singh’s candidature was taken following instruction from the state and regional leadership. Incidentally, it was Shakun, who was made BJP-supported candidate in the recently concluded zila panchayat members’ elections from ward number 22, Fatehpur Chaurasi after cancelling the candidature of Sangeeta Senger, the wife of expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Senger who was accused to raping the minor and having an alleged role in death of victim’s father in police custody. While BJP general secretary and in charge of ZP chairman elections, JPS Rathore could not be contacted for comments despite repeated attempts, sources said that the decision to back Arun Singh, who contested without any official political backing, was taken in view of a larger support he wielded in the region given his close proximity to Senger family. The decision to back Arun was seen as BJP’s covert attempt to cash in on the influence of Senger -- who is serving a 10-year jail term after being disqualified from UP assembly membership -- to consolidate its position in the region in run up to UP assembly elections due next year. The candidates in all 75 districts will file their nomination on Saturday (June 26). Polling and counting of votes will take place on July 3. Zila panchayat chairpersons are elected from among the elected members of Zila panchayats of various districts. Though the ZP elections are not contested on party symbols, BJP formally announced its supported candidates, triggering a political frenzy in the opposition camp which started throwing its weight behind other candidates. The rural local bodies elections attained larger political dimensions after getting pitched as a semi-final before the next assembly elections. Even as the BJP faced a formidable challenge from the opposition, mainly the Samajwadi Party, in the ZP ward elections, the party charted out a deft strategy of backing Independent candidates who have greater possibility of winning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-replaces-unnao-zp-chief-poll-candidate-after-uproar/articleshow/83825527.cms||Pankaj Shah

Due to public participation, about 17 lakh people were inoculated against Covid in one day. On the second day of the campaign, MP remained the leader in the entire state by vaccinating more than 11 lakh people in the state.Chouhan said that the state government is preparing to face the possible third wave of Corona by adding to the strategy with which it controlled the second wave. All necessary arrangements are being ensured, so that people of the state stay protected from the third wave. The vaccination campaign is also one of those arrangements. He further said that the initiative taken to make Madhya Pradesh self-reliant in oxygen generation has now started showing results. The work of setting up more than 100 oxygen plants has already started two months back. Some of these oxygen plants have started functioning. Work on the remaining plants is going on at a brisk pace. Chouhan said that Corona virus is polymorphic, which is affecting humans in different forms. We are receiving news about different countries including India being affected by the new Delta variant of Corona. According to experts, the Delta variant is far more infectious and deadlier too. Concrete arrangements are being made to ensure that it does not spread in Madhya Pradesh. The CM said that after control over the second wave of Corona, unlocking has begun in the state for the convenience of the general public. With this employment and business have started again. The need of the hour is that there should be no negligence in the unlock process. Even the slightest callousness can be an open invitation to Corona. He said that an awareness campaign is also being conducted in the entire state with public participation to remain alert and with Corona appropriate behaviour. Chouhan said that the virus has claimed lives of our loved ones. Being the head of the state, I will make every effort to ensure that such a time is not repeated in the state now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mps-public-participation-model-a-matter-of-pride-cm/articleshow/83821076.cms||---

The corporation has slapped a memo to stop the renovation work on the synagogue, a dilapidated structure which may collapse anytime. Though the government issued an order for acquiring the structure and 3.51 ares of land in October 2019, the process has not been completed so far. Considering the fact that the structure, which is of monumental value, may come down in a couple of hours’ rain, the government asked the archaeology department to do the urgent renovation works to ensure that the structure doesn’t collapse. When the contractor deployed by the government started the works, some of the local residents objected to it. Corporation authorities issued a notice to stop the work. “So, the renovation works have been stalled. Some parts of the structure had already collapsed. It may not withstand the rains this summer,” said C Karmachandran, a researcher in Jewish studies who worked for the protection of synagogues in the state. The woman who now owns the synagogue and 3.51 are of land had mortgaged the property with a financial institution. Then, the government gave the sum required for clearing the loan. The government also allotted the amount for giving compensation to the land owner. Kochi corporation’s reluctance to give nod for the state government’s plan to take over the structure and land is one of major hurdles in the way of acquisition. Though the issue came up for the consideration of the corporation town planning standing committee a couple of months ago, the committee decided to put the agenda on hold. “The proposal to make the structure a monument is part of a plan to sabotage the development plans of Mattancherry. Once it is made a monument, no construction activities can be done on the 200-metre surroundings of the structure. That’s why we object to the takeover,” said corporation health standing committee chairman T K Asharaf. “We are not against protecting it without making it a protected monument,” he said. At the same time, experts are of the opinion that there is no ground for the apprehensions of the local residents. “It is true that construction will be banned on the 100-metre surrounding of a protected monument which is taken over by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). But the Kadavumbhagam synagogue is not being taken over by ASI. It is the state archaeology department which will take over the synagogue. There is no construction ban on the surroundings of monuments taken over by the state archaeology department,” said ASI former director general Babu Rajeev. “The acquisition of the structure will only help development of the area,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-throws-a-spanner-in-govt-plan-to-take-over-synagogue/articleshow/83821105.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

After coming to know about Laxman’s visit, the accused reached the farm and assaulted him before escaping from the spot. Laxman, who was seriously injured, was taken to hospital in Ghogha where he succumbed to the injuries. “Teja is cousin of Laxman and they had a common well in their farm. In December 2019, Teja’s grandsons died after accidentally falling into this well. Since then, Teja’s family suspected that Laxman’s wife was responsible for the deaths and their relationships deteriorated,” a police official informed. “Both families had been at loggerhead since then and Laxman even moved to nearby Malnka village with his family. On Wednesday, when Teja’s family came to know that Laxman was visiting his farm, they attacked him and murdered him,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/52-year-old-man-hacked-to-death-by-relatives/articleshow/83818572.cms||---

Apart from administering vaccine shots to its residents, the initiative also focused on educating people about Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and how they can adapt to the new normal, while taking all safety precautions. The drive was organised by Ashwin Kumar, executive vice-president of the United Federation of RWAs (U-FERWAS) — umbrella group of all RWAs in the city – in association with The Times of India, Hyderabad. Conducted within the premises of the Shantinagar Club, the campaign saw impressive participation from locals, cutting across all age groups. Along with many elderly residents of the colony, some above 80 years, who came to get the Covid-19 vaccine shot, there were several youngsters too who joined the drive. The initiative was welcomed by residents as they urged others too to get vaccinated and follow safety protocols, to tackle the deadly virus. “We need to unite to win this battle against Covid-19,” said N Purendra Prasad, professor of Sociology at the Hyderabad Central University, even as K Vinod, a retired employee of MMTC stressed the importance of wearing masks and maintaining social distance. “All of us need to adhere to these norms strictly, especially in public places, to keep the virus at bay,” he said. Lauding TOI’s efforts to educate people about these protocols, 42-year-old businesswoman, Sripada Prabha, said: “At this point, this campaign is extremely important as it can help in saving lives. What TOI is doing is highly commendable.” Residents like G Sudhakar agreed and highlighted how such campaigns are the need of the hour. “Following safety precautions and taking the vaccine are the only ways we can tackle Covid-19. If all of us join hands, we can certainly win this fight,” said Ashwin Kumar.

The HC bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni recorded its “satisfaction at the progress made’’ in prisons to ward off Covid-19 after state advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted the latest status update in a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL). The PIL was taken up after news reports showed over 200 Covid cases among prison inmates. “The figure of active cases was over 60 last date and now it is 20 (for jail staff the figure is down from 46 to 26),‘’ said Kumbhakoni placing compliance with the HC’s June 10 order. “We need not refer to all such compliances in great details since Professor Vijay Raghavan, criminologist associated with Tata Institute of Social Sciences has fairly submitted that there have been substantial and significant improvements in the conditions of the correctional homes as well as the inmates’’ said the HC order. The HC said an issue of an alleged ban by the State on recruitment for vacant posts in Prisons, may be raised separately and not in the PIL which is primarily to de-congest prisons during the pandemic. The HC granted Raghavan to make a representation before the high power committee to strictly apply the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act to enable greater de-congestion. The HC expressed faith that the HPC would take a swift and appropriate decision and adjourned the PIL to July 22 for further hearing and compliance updates. The attorney general said 2706 prisoners were granted interim bail and 518 were given emergency parole to decongest jails. More than 3500 Staff have also been vaccinated.

Yogi called for India to be united once again, the way that Maharaj Suheldev had rallied it to give a befitting reply to Salar Gazi, the nephew of Mohammad Gaznavi, a thousand years back. “Several attempts were made to distort history in order to cloud over the contribution of Suheldev but he lived on in the country’s folk tales and folk music. A memorial to Maharaja Suheldev and a museum are being constructed near Chittora Lake so that the future generations could take pride in his history,” he said. Speaking at a programme to mark Maharaja Suheldev Vijayotsav, Yogi added that this was not just a day when Suheldev defeated Syed Salar Gazi but this was a victory for all of India. “History is witness to the time when Gazi came to India with 3 lakh soldiers, destroying places of worship and kings and their kingdoms before reaching Chittora. However, there he died at the hands of Maharaja Suheldev. For 150 years after this, no foreigner dared even look at India,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-suheldev-inspiration-for-our-unity/articleshow/83825551.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A Police probe revealed that one of the accused was the boyfriend of the victim’s niece. In fact, based on the tip-off from the girl, the accused carried out the loot. Police have Gurmit Singh Sardar (20), who works as a cleaner, and one minor boy for carrying out the loot. The incident occurred at around 2 pm on Tuesday afternoon when Kulvant Kaur Sardar (55) was alone at her residence and the accused, their faces covered with masks, entered the house and robbed the gold chain from her. “Since the beginning we suspected an insiders’ role in the loot. After scanning CCTV footage, we arrested Gurmit Singh and his associate for the crime. During the questioning, Gurmit confessed that he had received a tip off from his girlfriend, who is the niece of Kulvant kaur. The girls told Gurmit that her aunt used to be alone at home during the afternoon time and that it was the best time to carry out the loot,” a police official said. Police said that they will soon arrest the victim’s niece in this case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/minor-among-two-held-looting-gold-chain/articleshow/83818618.cms||---
---||India||Judge reserves order on Mamata Banerjee plea to recuse himself||KOLKATA: A single bench of the Calcutta high court heard Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee's application on Thursday urging the judge to recuse from hearing her Nandigram poll-related petition but reserved its order. Banerjee made a virtual appearance in court following its directions of June 18. The CM's counsel, Sanjay Basu, had made the application to Justice Kausik Chanda on Wednesday, a week after he wrote to the acting chief justice's secretary praying for reassignment of the case to another bench. The application was made because Banerjee apprehended "likelihood of bias" due to the association with BJP that Chanda had had as a lawyer before becoming a judge. After hearing the application on Thursday, Justice Chanda said: "Let me think it over." During the hearing, the judge asked CM's counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi: "This case was listed before me on June 18. On that day, no one mentioned in this court that the petitioner had sought reassignment of the case apprehending bias. Is it not the duty of the counsel to point it out?" Singhvi submitted that the letter to the acting chief justice didn't mention recusal. The judge then asked if the counsel would wait for the administrative order or proceed judicially. Singhvi left it to the judge to decide but pointed out there was a "conflict of interest". "Is it worth continuing a case like this with so much controversy? I am not saying that your lordship's shoulders are not broad enough to bear it. But what is the worth?" Singhvi said. He then cited some instances of the judge's "close, personal, professional, pecuniary and ideological relationship" with BJP. Singhvi submitted that Justice Chanda was yet to be appointed a permanent judge of the high court and mentioned that the CM had conveyed her objections and reservations to such confirmation. Justice Chanda didn't deny his taking up BJP petitions such as the one related to permission for BJP leader Amit Shah's public meeting in front of Victoria House. The judge recounted his personal experience as a lawyer when he moved a BJP petition in HC. "The judge asked which party I am appearing for. I said the Bharatiya Janata Party. He once again asked which party and I repeated. (Eventually) I said BJP, he said 'oh BJP'," Justice Chanda said. He held that it was not unusual for lawyers to have political connections and affiliations and cited Singhvi's Congress affiliation as a case in point. Singhvi urged the judge to recuse from hearing the case "graciously". Justice Chanda wanted to know from the CM's counsel if recusing wouldn't look like he had been influenced by the media trial that started from June 18. "There is a media trial already going on before this issue came to this court. Hundreds of tweets have already been posted saying I should recuse. If I recuse now, will I be giving in to this media trial?" the judge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/judge-reserves-order-on-mamata-banerjee-plea-to-recuse-himself/articleshow/83827175.cms||---

The party said the government is shying away from holding a proper legislative session as it is afraid the opposition will expose its corruption across departments. BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil said, “The government is not concerned about ordinary citizens, and corruption has reached its peak. The motto of this government is power will be lost tomorrow, earn today,” he alleged at BJP’s executive committee meet on Thursday. Most members attended online including BJP’s national general secretary C T Ravi. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis too alleged huge corruption in the MVA. “Every minister behaves like a king of his department and every department has a ‘Waze’ (referring to dismissed API Vaze who alleged that ex-home minister Anil Deshmukh had set him a Rs 100 crore monthly collection target).

---||Lucknow||21-year-old BA student in race for zila panchayat chief’s post in Uttar Pradesh's Balrampur||LUCKNOW: Hailing from a small town, she has big dreams not only for herself but for all girls in her home district. Being the most educated individual in her family, she aspires to become a teacher. Meet 21-year-old Aarti Tiwari, a BA third-year student who last month became district council member in Balrampur—a feat not many women as young as her have achieved. Now, Aarti is set to contest the district council president elections with the support of BJP. She will file her nomination on June 26 for the contest, in which she is the youngest among 40 district council members. The election will be held on July 3 under the supervision of the district magistrate. Speaking to TOI, Aarti said, “Villages in Balrampur district are extremely under-developed. Take the example of my village, Parsha Karnaiti. Till date, no leader could build a bitumen road which could connect to the district headquarters or arterial road of the district. The nearest government hospital from my village is 9km away, while school is 5km away. Literacy among girls is very low. I want to bring a change in my district and ensure every girl receives education and all villages have roads and better health infrastructure.” Drawing inspiration from her father Sidhant Tiwari, a farmer, and uncle Shyam Manohar Tiwari who, an active member of BJP and former pradhan, Aarti said, “My father is illiterate and only knows farming. But he always believed in educating girls. I am the only one in the family who is pursuing graduation. My uncle is a social worker, his hard work has always inspired me to help others. I don’t know exactly what they saw in me to let me contest the elections, but I believe that with their help, I would be able to bring a change in my village and district and help other girls grow.” Aarti’s younger siblings are currently in school. Her sister Radha is in class 6 while brothers Santosh, Shivam and Ramji are in classes 8, 3 and kindergarten, respectively. Their mother Shalini Tiwari is a house wife. “The reason behind letting Aarti contest the elections for district council was to bring in youthful energy there, encourage her thoughts and carry forward the government’s ambition to promote the girl child. Our party leaders in Balrampur have unanimously chosen Aarti to contest with BJP support,” siad Shyam Manohar Tiwari. Pradeep Singh, the district president of BJP’s Balrampur unit, said, “We have decided to promote youth, specially girls, to lead from the front and bring changes with their efforts. We will be there to guide them. Aarti is a perfect candidate for us.” After graduation, Aarti wants to pursue an MA in Sanskrit and Hindi and later become a teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/21-yr-old-ba-student-in-race-for-zp-chiefs-post-in-balrampur/articleshow/83825610.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Folk singer Geeta Rabari, farm owner booked for hosting ‘lok dayro’||RAJKOT: Of late, popular Gujarati folk singer Geeta Rabari has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. Kutch’s Paddhar police booked Rabari for performing during a ‘lok dayro’ on Tuesday night. The event was attended by over 250 people in violation of the Covid-19 guidelines. Sanjay Thakkar, owner of the farm house where the event was held, was also arrested for organizing the ‘lok dayro’. Thakkar during questioning told the police he had invited Rabari to sing folk songs at the event. Organizing ‘lok dayro’ on the occasion of the first harvest of ‘kharek’ or date palm plantation is an age-old tradition of the Kutch region. Thakkar too was celebrating the first harvest of his date farm, cops said. The incident came to light after a video of the event, in which a large crowd was seen in attendance, went viral on social media. After probing the matter, assistant sub-Inspector Mukesh Dangi lodged a complaint against Thakkar and Rabari under various sections of Epidemic Diseases Act. Earlier this month, Rabari had courted controversy by tweeting photos of taking Covid-19 vaccine at her home. The post had invited a lot of criticism from the online community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/folk-singer-rabari-farm-owner-booked-for-hosting-lok-dayro/articleshow/83818703.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Jagathi formed a year after alleged Ramky-AP officials’ meet: Counsel||Hyderabad: CBI court principal special judge BR Madhusudhan Rao on Thursday said he will hear on July 2 the version of the CBI on why it made Jagathi Publications an accused entity in Ramky pharma city chargesheet of quid pro quo case. Supreme Court senior counsel, Sidharth Agarwal, concluded his argument urging the court to discharge Jagathi publications from the case. The case against Ramky Pharma City is that it got undue benefit by getting the green cover around the pharma city reduced drastically by the state government. There should be a green cover of 250 metres all around the pharma city. This was reduced to a mere 50 metres to benefit the promoter because that would give him more space to sell. The promoter invested in Jagathi in lieu of this benefit is the case of the CBI. This reduction happened after Ramky management met the authorities of united Andhra Pradesh thrice in 2005. For this, Agarwal said, the CBI makes Jagathi an accused disregarding the fact that Jagathi was not even born as a corporate entity by that time, he said. “Jagathi was incorporated as a company in November 2006, exactly a year after the alleged deliberations between Ramky and the state of AP. So the theory of conspiracy as was alleged by CBI cannot be hurled against an entity that was not even born at the time the conspiracy was planned and executed,” Agarwal said. Another ground urged by the senior counsel was that Section 9 of the prevention of corruption Act cannot be applied against companies. This section speaks about exerting personal influence on the public servants to get unlawful things done. “The Supreme Court has made it clear in its judgment in the Standard Chartered Bank case, which said that Section 9 cannot be applied against the companies because it is individuals that can exert pressure and not companies. Companies cannot bring such influence on individuals,” he said. Agarwal refuted the allegations that Jagathi secured Deloitte audit report to justify its high share value through unlawful means. He said the methods, known as discounted cash flow methods, employed by firms like Deloitte are technical in nature and that it would be better for courts to leave such things to experts rather than venturing into technical terrains to examine such things, which are in the domain of experts. Agarwal said, “Suffice to say that internationally reputed firms like Deloitte won’t lose their integrity for the sake of new entities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jagathi-formed-a-year-after-alleged-ramky-ap-officials-meet-counsel/articleshow/83823571.cms||---
---||Lucknow||BJP backs Apna Dal on two seats in zila panchayat chairman poll in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Days after BJP ally Apna Dal (S) chief Anupriya Patel met senior BJP leader and Union home minister Amit Shah, the state BJP on Thursday agreed to back the Kurmi-dominated political outfit on two seats — Jaunpur and Sonbhadra — in the ensuing zila panchayat chairman elections. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh told TOI the party was committed to cordial ties with allies, signalling its pro-active stand to mollify restless partners and keep the flock together ahead of high-stakes assembly polls next year. During the panchayat polls in April, the twin allies had, however, backed their own candidates. Apna Dal sources said, the party high command will soon announce names of candidates who will file their nomination on Saturday. The development comes a day after BJP ally and NISHAD Party chief Sanjay Nishad ruffled feathers by asking the BJP brass to project him as deputy CM in the run-up to polls. This will help BJP to consolidate the most backward caste vote, essentially Nishad, Bind, Kewat and Mallahs, who account for 17% of the OBC block in east UP. Sanjay Nishad, who held separate meetings with Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda earlier this month, is learnt to have flexed political muscle and sought accommodation of party workers in corporations and boards. UP cabinet minister Sidhartnath Singh, who serves as a bridge between Nishad and the BJP brass, told TOI “we have been together and we will remain together.” Nishad’s son Pravin had challenged the might of saffron party in 2018 by defeating BJP candidate Upendra Shukla while contesting as a BSP-backed SP candidate in the bypoll in Gorakhpur, the seat vacated by Yogi Adityanath after he assumed charge as CM. Rumblings in the saffron camp in the wake of a stunning defeat in Yogi’s backyard did not last long after Sanjay Nishad merged his party with BJP. In 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Pravin won from Sant Kabir Nagar as a BJP candidate. BJP’s outreach to Apna Dal comes amidst former BJP ally-turned rebel Om Prakash Rajbhar’s threat to sabotage BJP’s prospects by weaning away the Rajbhar community, who account for 7% of the OBC population. BJP, however, has neutralised the Suhaildev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief by propping up other Rajbhar leaders, including UP minister Anil Rajbhar and Rajya Sabha MP Sakaldeep Rajbhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-backs-apna-dal-on-two-seats-in-zp-chairman-poll-in-up/articleshow/83825634.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Bhopal||BJP resolution urges workers to expose Cong lies on vaccines||Bhopal: With an eye on the upcoming civic elections, Madhya Pradesh BJP has decided to reach out to the masses and expose the lies and false propaganda of Congress against the state government and its vaccination drive. This was stated by state BJP president Vishnu Dutt Sharma at the party state working committee meeting on Thursday.Highlighting the deliberations at the meeting, Sharma said two resolutions were passed- political and Covid-19 crisis - to chalk out the future roadmap and action to relieve the public from day-today problems.The political resolution tabled by the BJP highlighted the decisions taken by the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government during the past 15 months. Chouhan took charge in March 2020 and announced to revive all welfare schemes stopped by the previous Congress government led by Kamal Nath. "BJP leadership relieved the public from a corrupt and inactive government that betrayed all sections including the farmers, youth, women and labour class. Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced several new schemes, launched projects and even provided financial relief to the poor to help them recover from distress," read the political resolution. The resolution also mentioned coordination between the government and the organisation, role of BJP workers in the welfare schemes like Sambal, laptop to meritorious students, loan on zero interest to farmers, Ayushman health scheme and honorarium to farmers. "Government had spent Rs 92,000 crore on the farmers, passed an anti-religion conversion law and acted against mafias. The central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi abrogated Article 370, 35 A from Jammu and Kashmir, brought farm laws for reforms in agriculture," stated the resolution.The BJP also criticised Congress for tool kit, clubhouse chat and calling Corona as Indian variant. Sharma said the resolution of Covid-19 crisis highlighted the work done by the central and state governments to effectively control the Covid-19 infection. Five schemes by the government received appreciation. The Kill Corona drive which increased testing facilities and expansion of health services, arrangements for oxygen during the crisis increased the number of beds in hospitals, he recalled.Sharma said that BJP national president JP Nadda in his address called upon the party workers to review and monitor all the schemes and make sure they reach up to the public under `Sewa Hi Sangathan' drive. "BJP workers will contact people in every block to know the problems and highlight the welfare schemes launched by the government. We will also ensure that the public should not get misinformed or misled on any issue," said Sharma.The political resolution was proposed by state general secretary Shardendu Tiwari. State general secretary Kavita Patidar proposed a resolution on works done by the BJP and the state government during Covid-19 crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bjp-resolution-urges-workers-to-expose-cong-lies-on-vaccines/articleshow/83821150.cms||---

Taufiq Attar, an assistant teacher at Islampur high school in Walwa town of Sangli district, died on October 19, 2020. Attar, who had joined the school in June 2019, was assigned duty at Kanegaon checkpost. Two weeks prior to his death, he developed symptoms of the virus and was admitted to hospital. The state government on June 21 issued a notification on compensation to Attar’s wife Minaz. The compensation cames as the central government last week ruled out grant of ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh for persons who died of Covid-19 in the country. The affidavit was in response to two PILs listed before Supreme Court. The PILs by lawyers Gaurav Bansal and Reepak Kansal referred to two central government notifications. The March 14, 2020, notification declared Covid-19 as a notified disaster under National Disaster Management Act. The April 8, 2015 notification quantified ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh to victims killed in a notified disaster. Though teachers have not been given status of frontline workers, they were included in the state government compensation scheme. Over 300 teachers in the state, including 15 in Mumbai, have lost their lives to Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-family-of-first-state-teacher-to-die-of-covid-gets-rs-50-lakh/articleshow/83823576.cms||Sandhya Nair

The department has decided to give 10% weightage to their performance in the exams conducted in Class XII, 50% weightage to their performance in Class X and 40% weightage to the Class XI performance. The committee has given its report to the state government and is waiting for them to issue a government order in this regard. According to the committee members, the objective criterion has been made in a way to evaluate the students fairly. However, the state secondary teachers' association has slammed the proposed objective criterion chosen by the committee and has asked for a different evaluation formula. In another development on Thursday, higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat held a meeting with the officials of his department in Dehradun. It was decided in the meeting that the students of various state universities and colleges will be provided with their marksheets, degrees and other documents through the DigiLocker app. Meanwhile, the Uttarakhand education department is mulling to allow schools — both government and private — to run offline classes from next month, according to sources.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai faces steady rise in pollution during summer||Mumbai: India rejoiced in the silver lining of clear skies during the Covid-19-induced lockdown of 2020 and 2021 but an analysis by a climate communications initiative, Climate Trends, shows pollution levels in Mumbai increased year on year during the months of March, April and May from 2019 to 2021 though staying within permissible limits.Researchers compared Central Pollution Control Board air quality data for Delhi, Lucknow, Mumbai and Kolkata over March, April and May in 2019 with 2020 and 2021 when there was a complete lockdown. The study revealed that except Mumbai, all cities showed a dip in PM 2.5 levels in 2020 over 2019. Mumbai’s average concentration of PM 2.5 went from 21.7 ug/m3 in 2019 to 31.3 in 2020 and 41.3 in 2021, but remained in the safe limits. “Mumbai being a coastal city has a mixed effect of local meteorology and prevalent conditions of large scale motions including that of cyclones…cyclones such as Tauktae act as a washout/cleaning effect on the atmosphere,” said professor S K Dhaka, Rajdhani College, Delhi University. The steady increase in the city’s pollution levels is usually attributed to dust from construction and road projects apart from burning of waste and automobile exhaust.Delhi’s PM 2.5 concentration was far higher: it was 95.6 ug/m3 in 2019, fell to 69 in 2020, and was back to 95 in 2021. Lucknow’s too was on the higher side: 103 ug/m3 in 2019, dipping to 92 in 2020 during the lockdown and further to 79.6 in 2021., Kolkata’s PM 2.5 concentration swayed from 41.8 ug/m3 in 2019 to 27.9 in 2020 and 37.3 in 2021.Dr G C Kisku, chief scientist, CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research said the lockdowns reduced traffic and consumption of fossil fuels. “Closure of industrial establishments …also added to it. But the levels are still relatively higher this year. The good thing is that there has been a decreasing trend in PM10 levels from 2017 onwards.”— Chittaranjan Tembhekar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-faces-steady-rise-in-pollution-during-summer/articleshow/83823600.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Dehradun||I am innocent, have proof, says owner of firm accused of fake Covid tests at Kumbh||DEHRADUN: In one of his first interactions with media after the Covid-19 test scam at the Kumbh Mela broke, Sharat Pant, owner of Max Corporate Services----the agency under scanner for the fake tests---- told TOI on Thursday that he is “completely innocent and ready to prove it.” Pant, who has been in the eye of a storm for bagging the contract for Covid testing at Kumbh -- without any previous experience of working in the health sector -- allegedly because of his proximity to ruling BJP, claimed that he had no political backing. Calling himself “just a social worker”, Pant said, “I am ready to co-operate in the entire investigation. I have all the proof. I am innocent and also ready to become a state witness if required.” Pant claimed that his company was in negotiations only with the mela administration and not the district administration. “I have no idea how the Haridwar CMO or district administration is saying that my expression of interest was initially rejected by them. I never approached them. I was in communication only with the mela administration that approved my expression of interest on March 12. We got the contract towards March-end and on April 5, the two labs associated with us got the user ID and password to access the ICMR portal where they could upload test reports,” Pant said. Alleging that he “had no idea how the scam happened or the people behind it,” Pant claimed, “Our firm was only facilitating the two labs----Dr Lal Chandani and Nalwa Path Labs. We neither had any workforce on the ground nor access to the ICMR portal so that we could check the data that they were uploading.” On allegations that he was awarded the contract because pressure was put on the mela administration by some BJP politicians – his social media profile is replete with pictures where he is posing along with ruling party politicians -- Pant said, “One of my relatives has worked in the party and hence as a social worker, I keep on meeting politicians. But that doesn’t mean I know any of them personally. I am just like any other common man who likes to get clicked with big shots.” He added that news of him trying for a BJP ticket from Dwarahat in Almora for the forthcoming assembly polls was “baseless.” When queried about the allegations of Dr JP Nalwa, one of the owners of Nalwa Path Labs, that he had cancelled the MoU with Max Corporate Services after receiving complaints of fake tests, Pant said that he never received any letter from Nalwa and added that he has all the proofs to show that the lab was on the ground, doing testing during the mela. Dr JP Nalwa had earlier told TOI that “not a single person from my lab has ever been to Haridwar or conducted a single test during the mela.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/i-am-innocent-have-proof-says-owner-of-firm-accused-of-fake-covid-tests-at-kumbh/articleshow/83818753.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Rajkot||Rajkot monsoon plantation drive enlists kin, Covid-hit patients for O2 parks||RAJKOT: As a reminder to people about the importance of oxygen in human lives, the social forestry circle Rajkot aims to rope in public, especially those who lost their near and dear ones to Covid, to plant trees and strengthen city’s lungs this monsoon. Forest department officials in Rajkot and Morbi districts are asking people to plant trees and create oxygen parks in every village. The social forestry circles of the forest department across the state plant trees before every monsoon. However, this time they want to enlist people’s participation to drive the message home about the importance of breathable air in our lives. Talking to TOI about his unique idea, deputy conservator of forest Rajkot circle Ravi Prasad Radhakrishna said, “People have understood the importance of oxygen and that’s why this year we have started creating an oxygen park in every village. We are especially asking those families to do physical work (shramdan) by planting saplings in the memories of their lost kin or if any critical family member had recovered with oxygen support. Only they would realize better the importance of oxygen to save life.” He further said that people will be asked to plant a tree and also maintain it. “This will also serve the purpose of maintenance of the tree. We can also put a board in that park stating that it’s a Covid victims’ memorial park,” Radhakrishna added. The forest department started the campaign since June first week and has planted more than 6,000 trees so far in nearly 12 villages of Morbi, Tankara, Dhoraji, Upleta, Kotda Sangani and Vicchiya talukas of Rajkot and Morbi districts and continue the exercise. Hitesh Serathiya and his brother Girish, both residents of Kalana village in Dhoraji taluka, had tested positive for Covid two months ago. While Girish succumbed to the virus in a private hospital of Rajkot, Hitesh survived after remaining on oxygen support for a few days. After recovering, Hitesh along with deceased Girish’s wife and their 16-year old son, participated in planting a tree in memory of their dear one in an oxygen park that has 500 trees in the village. “Nobody would understand it better than me about the importance of oxygen in surviving. We planted a tree in the memory of my brother and we will maintain the tree to ensure that these trees grow bigger and keep the memory of our dear one alive in our hearts and minds,” said Hitesh. According to villagers, around 300 people had tested positive in this village of whom 20 lost their lives. Trupti Joshi, range forest officer (RFO) Rajkot said, “People have now understood how they had to struggle to get oxygen during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. We explained to them about the importance of trees and the families of Covid victims agreed to provide their help in planting trees. They promised not to make this a lipservice merely but continue work to maintain the trees.” N J Rojasra RFO Morbi said, “People believe that they are planting the trees for the peace of departed soul. They also took oath of maintaining the trees planted in the memory of their loved ones.” The forest department is providing saplings for free and in most villages, residents had asked for specific species like fruits, flowers, tulsi and other species. The department is planning to cover maximum villages of both the districts in this monsoon season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/monsoon-plantation-drive-enlists-kin-covid-hit-patients-for-o2-parks/articleshow/83818800.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

It also asked AP to get the project appraised by the KRMB and the Central Water Commission (CWC) and sanctioned by the apex council. KRMB member HK Meena conveyed this in a letter to secretary of water resources department of AP. KRMB’s move comes after the Telangana government asked the board to intervene and stop the RLIP works undertaken by the AP government. In his letter, Meena said the special chief secretary of Telangana’s irrigation department had clearly pointed out to AP proceeding briskly with the construction of RLIP in violation of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) orders. Meena said: “To implement the directions of NGT, Chennai, to visit the project site, a team was constituted and it was supposed to visit the site on February 26, 2021, to check if there were any violations of NGT orders. The team leader and member of KRMB have requested the AP government several times to nominate a nodal officer and facilitate the visit of the team to the project site. The AP government has so far not facilitated the visit of the team citing various reasons.” Ministers and political leaders of Telangana and AP have been indulging in a war of words in the last couple of days over the RLIP. The Telangana cabinet, which met recently, had protested against the RLIP and proposed a couple of new projects on Krishna river to ensure irrigated water to erstwhile Mahbubnagar and Nalgonda districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-work-on-rlip-sans-report-krmb-tells-ap/articleshow/83823597.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: FIR against news portal, its 3 scribes for ‘fabricated video’||LUCKNOW: Barabanki police on Thursday lodged an FIR against news portal 'The Wire', its three journalists and others for sharing a video which allegedly had potential to disrupt communal harmony, spread misinformation resulting in hatred in the society. The video was related to the demolition of a structure which the police claimed was illegal. The FIR said the content of the video in question was fabricated. The FIR was lodged in connection with a video documentary uploaded by ‘The Wire’ on Twitter on June 23. The documentary was related to the demolition of a structure at Ramsanehi ghat that the district administration claimed was done as per court orders. However, locals have claimed that the structure in question was a mosque which was in existence for decades. The matter is before the high court. District Magistrate, Barabanki, Adarsh Singh, told TOI that some of the content in the documentary was false and misleading. He said prima facie it appeared that the facts were twisted to disrupt communal harmony. “The video in the starting shows that sacred books were seized by the policemen who then dumped them into the river and drain,” the DM said, adding that this was completely baseless and fabricated to mislead people in order to create bad blood in the society. “We have lodged a case against those behind making of the video and those responsible for uploading it,” he said. Lodged by sub-inspector Mahendra Singh, the FIR names Siraji Ali, Mohammed Anees, Mukul Chuahan -- all journalist with The Wire, one Mohammed Naeem and others as accused. "The accused have deliberately tried to show the lawful demolition of the structure at Ramsanehi Ghat in a bad light. The video contains misleading information based on wrong facts and the documentary seems to have been shot to disrupt communal amity of the region," the FIR says. The video was shared by a number of handles on social media including 'The Wire' and its journalist Siraj Ali, police said. “This documentary which is based on fabricated events seems to be the handiwork of some individuals as part of a criminal conspiracy,” SI Mahendra Singh stated in the FIR. The accused have been booked under charges of conspiring to cause panic in public and promote enmity between religions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fir-against-news-portal-its-3-scribes-for-fabricated-video/articleshow/83825675.cms||---

The incident came to light on Wednesday after 470 teachers were issued certificates by the government training institute in Jabalpur. State PCC media vice-president Bhupendra Gupta said, “The thirst for making world records is responsible for such a shameful faux pas when four teachers who died of Covid have not only been trained but also had their attendance marked.” Recently, the state made a new record with nearly 17 lakh persons vaccinated on a single day when the government organized the Vaccination Maha Abhiyan on June 21. “For God’s sake, please stop making world records,” Bhupendra Gupta appealed to the state BJP government. “They created another world record planting one crore saplings on a single day. And when the Congress came to power, we kept looking for those trees,” he said. Bhupendra Gupta further alleged, “The state government is engaged in making world record for all sorts of ‘forgery’. Government that is so busy in creating records on paper, should claim making world record in creating the mafia as well. It has already made record in manufacturing fake plasma, spurious remdesivir injections, selling the same and even stealing the life-saving drug, selling poisonous liquor, utilizing spurious drugs, supplying sub-standard injections for treatment of black fungus disease.” He also accused that now ministers of the government have fake OSDs in their offices. Bhupendra Gupta was referring to an incident in which a man claimed he was OSD in the office of cabinet minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia called a woman project officer posted in Seoni and promised to get her transferred if she paid Rs 25,000. The woman was duped and later registered a complaint with the police. Gupta said that according to CRS (Civil Registration System), more than 1.9 lakh persons died in the state during the Corona second wave. Can this be considered as record achievement too?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/chasing-world-record-govt-issues-certs-to-4-dead-teachers-cong/articleshow/83821190.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat morally a ‘bhagoda’ in phone tapping case, says Mahesh Joshi||JAIPUR: Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi on Thursday equated Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to a “bhagoda” (fugitive/absconder), accusing him of failing to appear before the Rajasthan police in the phone tapping case that rocked the Ashok Gehlot government during the rebellion by Sachin Pilot last year. In a tit for tat, Shekhawat tweeted late night, "'Bhagoda' are those who sneak to Bangkok, Thailand. #Congress." The reference is apparently to Rahul Gandhi's trip to Bangkok in 2019. भगोड़े वो होते हैं जो छुपते छुपाते बैंकॉक, थाईलैंड निकल जाते हैं।#Congress— Gajendra Singh Shekhawat (@gssjodhpur) 1624554723000After Joshi’s statements, Congress workers shouted slogans against Shekhawat outside the PCC headquarters here. BJP state president Satish Poonia reacted sharply and said Joshi was taking out his frustration for being summoned by the Delhi police crime branch in another case related to the same phone tapping. Mahesh Joshi, on the other hand, challenged the legality of the crime branch’s notice. The Congress leader was asked to appear before the special operations squad-I in Prashant Vihar on Thursday, but he has written back saying that CrPC Section 160 under which the notice was sent required the police to go to the senior citizen's house for questioning. Joshi, who is 66 years old, further cited corona safety guidelines, his busy schedule as chief whip and the short notice for not appearing before the police. “Shekhawat has advised me to face the Delhi police. Shekhawat sahib, first you face the Rajasthan police, give your voice sample and cooperate in the probe, otherwise people will call you ‘bhagoda’,” Joshi told reporters here. “For a public figure, people's perception is very important. I don’t know if the police will declare him a ‘bhagoda’ or not, but in the people’s eyes he is a ‘bhagoda’. One is not a bhagoda only if the police declare so. When one absconds morally, then too one is considered a bhagoda,” he added. Joshi claimed the audio clips, based on which the case was lodged against him in Delhi, had the voice of Shekhawat and the Rajasthan police needed the Union minister’s samples to investigate the same matter registered here too. BJP state president Satish Poonia said, “Slogans against the Union minister are condemnable. Congress leaders have been real fugitives in this country since the British times. They may have raised the slogans in remembrance of their ancestors. Will someone become a fugitive by shouting slogans?” Poonia added, “When a man gets agitated and uses abusive words, it shows there is some sin in him and his wrong is being caught. Phone tapping and spying (of MP/MLAs) in Rajasthan is proved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/shekhawat-morally-a-bhagodain-phone-tapping-case-joshi/articleshow/83823637.cms||Bhanupratap Singh
---||Ahmedabad||100 medicos to knock on HC’s doors||Ahmedabad: As many as 100 doctors practising in the city are likely to approach Gujarat high court against the orders issued to medical officers on June 20 to direct the police to register FIRs within a day against 799 bonded doctors, who have apparently failed to join Covid-19 duty. Sources said that 100 doctors are to file a petition in high court, demanding that the order for registration of FIRs should be quashed because it might adversely affect their reputation and future practice. During the surge of Covid-19 cases and feeling acute shortage of doctors to meet the crisis, the state government on May 4 issued orders calling 1,415 bonded expert doctors to join Covid-19 duty and for their appointment as Class-1 posts of experts. After getting a lukewarm response from doctors, the commissioner of health, medical services and medical education issued an order to all district health officers and medical officers of the municipal corporations, asking them to direct concerned police stations to lodge FIRs against these doctors under provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. The commissioner’s order said there are 799 bonded doctors who are liable to face action for not reporting on Covid-19 duty. It also mentioned that 213 doctors work in private hospitals. The order said that with the rise in Covid-19 cases, services of these doctors became very essential. “They studied in government medical colleges by paying nominal fees. It is their moral duty to serve the society and the state. They have not shown interest and tried to escape from their responsibly which is very unfortunate,” the order reads. The commissioner further said that those expert doctors, who had executed bonds during their admission in medical courses, are liable to face action. The order is for registration of FIR against defaulting bonded doctors in one day and report back on June 21. It was also mentioned that those health officers who failed in this task would be liable to face disciplinary action under the state’s service rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/100-medicos-to-knock-on-hcs-doors/articleshow/83821187.cms||---

Praising the work of monitoring committees, the CM has said that they played an important role in the Covid management work. “They have helped to identify people showing symptoms of Covid and distributing medicines.

With experts advising the government to increase the pace of vaccination before the onset of the expected third wave, the CM has said that vaccination and sanitisation is crucial to protect people, especially children from Covid and other kinds of infectious diseases. For this, he has asked pradhans to “encourage people to take Covid vaccine and address any concerns that they may have about the vaccine or the process”. He has also asked for the contribution of pradhans in protecting villages from JE/AES and other infectious diseases by carrying out “special cleanliness, sanitation and fogging drives and making people aware about the necessity to consume clean water”. The CM has also asked pradhans to actively participate in the government’s tree plantation drive and to carry out tree plantation in all empty and other appropriate places in their villages. In the letter, the CM has congratulated the pradhans for their recent victory and discussed the ongoing pandemic. “You are aware that not just the country but the entire world has been dealing with the Covid pandemic since March 2020.

Key sources in the state government close to the development said, “Government has started internal consultation to discuss the pros and cons of reopening colleges, universities and schools as the number of daily Covid cases has come down considerably. However, considering the possibility of the likely third Covid wave, the government is taking very conservative view." Most of the senior officials and experts have suggested to reopen colleges, universities and higher secondary schools. The government will shortly start dialogue with various stake holders also. “It is of the opinion to allow reopening of 9th to 12th standards and keep 1st to 8th standards closed, at least till Diwali,” said a senior official. “The decision on opening colleges, universities and schools will be taken by the CM-led high level core group, and the state cabinet will take the final call,” sources added. Jatin Bharad, vice-president of Self-financed School Associations, said, “Last year, when the government reopened schools, there were around 600 cases per day. Now it’s below 250 cases. If in that wave the government can reopen schools, why can’t it reopen schools now.” Bharat Gajipara, president, Gujarat State School Management Association, said, “Government has not initiated any formal talks with us, however we have learnt that the government is considering to reopen colleges and schools. We are ready to open schools as per the government guidelines.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-begins-consultations-to-reopen-schools-colleges/articleshow/83821191.cms||---

Opposition leader V D Satheesan, who is also the chairman of the UDF, said the team comprises environmentalist Prof E Kunhikrishnan, former special government pleader at high court Susheela Bhatt and retired IFS officer O Jayaraj. The committee has been appointed after having discussion with all the constituent leaders and the report prepared by the expert committee will be published before the people of the state, said Satheesan. Satheesan also inaugurated the state-wide protests organized by the UDF seeking a judicial probe into the illegal tree felling and also to find out the role of the CPI ministers in this. KPCC president K Sudhakaran said it was shocking to know the reports that the illegal tree felling has happened with the knowledge of the then forest minister’s office. Flouting all the norms, the forest department had helped the forest mafia for the illegal tree felling for which the minister’s office had given all support. It has become evident that the people who masterminded the illegal tree felling had influenced the minister, said Sudhakaran. The CPM and CPI had utilized the crores of rupees which they received through this deal in the elections and hence there has to be a comprehensive probe to bring out the truth before the people of the state, said the KPCC president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/udf-appoints-3-member-committee/articleshow/83818905.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Netas & activists cry foul over Petit Trust plot de-reservation||Mumbai: The state government’s decision to remove public amenity reservations on a prime 2.2-acre plot owned by Petit Trust behind Carter Road in Bandra has kicked up a storm. BJP MLA from Bandra (W) Ashish Shelar on Thursday accused the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of perpetrating a “land scam” in this western suburb. “I had opposed the dereservation of this plot. Open spaces and the facility of a public market were needed here. By not giving any opportunity to residents and the area MLA, the government, instead, expedited the deletion of the reservations,” he said. Shelar said the earlier government led by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had stopped the proposal. “I demand that the decision be reversed by the government and BMC must acquire the plot for residents.” Shelar said he plans to move court if the government does not reverse it decision. Housing activist and former MLA Chandrashekhar Prabhu, said: “Dereservation of amenity plots has become the staple diet for fueling corruption within the political system for some time now. The megapolis and its residents require amenity spaces, and these are vital for their survival and well-being. But when greed supersedes public interest, decadence prevails.” Prabhu said trusts meant for public welfare have become targets of those who spare no efforts to usurp them for personal gains. “Such acts must be condemned, and the judiciary should take suo moto notice.” Advocate Khushru Zaiwala said owing to skyrocketing property prices, public charitable institutions like Avabai Petit School which have land worth thousands of crores, have become sitting ducks. “Trust property was specifically created by charitable minded donors a century ago for the specific purpose of welfare of society and humanity, and not for commercial exploitation,” he said. Zaiwala, who has campaigned against sale of Parsi trust lands, said the government has made a mockery of protecting minority trust properties at the behest of the builders’ lobby. He said the state has amended Section 36 of the Maharashtra Public Trust Act, which earlier protected such trust properties. “Under Section 36, it was mandatory for trustees of a charitable trust to take prior permission of the charity commissioner to sell any trust property. The new amendment to Section 36 allows trustees to sign away trust properties to builders and register them without the consent of the charity commissioner,” Zaiwala said. Civic activist Zoru Bhathena said to lose scarce playgrounds and school land zones to real estate development is “shocking”. “Our values mustn’t change based on real estate prices. The fact that 1 lakh sq ft of land is released from reservations clearly shows that it is only a real estate deal, and nothing to do for the benefit of the trust or school,” he said. On Thursday, TOI reported that the Bai Avabai F Petit Tr-ust, which runs Avabai Petit Sc-hool, plans to develop the vacant land into a residential complex. It has entered into an agreement with a builder, KBK Realtors (Kotharis). The trust claims it will use the proceeds to improve the school’s infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/netas-activists-cry-foul-over-petit-trust-plot-de-reservation/articleshow/83812252.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

Four trainers licensed by RWITC packed their bags this week and are leaving for Madras Race Club (MRC) citing poor prize money at the premier racing centre in the country. “It is becoming difficult to sustain at RWITC due to poor prize money,” said trainer Adhirajsingh Jodha, who decided to shift base. The others are S K Sunderji, Vishal Gaikwad and Deepesh Narredu. “My owners are not into gambling, they entirely depend on prize money to meet expenses incurred for keeping horses,” said Jodha, a third generation trainer from a family based at RWITC for over five decades. “MRC offers good prize money for winners and they didn’t reduce it during the pandemic. It makes sense to move there,” said Jodha, who has 55 horses under his care. Minimum expense to train, feed and care for a horse is around Rs22,000 a month, excluding medical expenses at RWITC. “The pandemic has thrown everything out of gear. I needed to think about the horses and my owners’ welfare, so I decided to move to Chennai,” said Deepesh Narredu, who at 27 is perhaps the youngest trainer in the country today. “They never came to us or indicated their intentions,” RWITC chairman Zavaray Poonawalla told TOI. “But now that we are aware of it, we will look into it,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-low-prize-money-forcing-trainers-to-leave-rwitc/articleshow/83825954.cms||Shailendra Awasthi

At a media briefing, MEA spokesperson, Arindam Bagchi said, "It has been the Chinese actions over the last year, including amassing of a large number of troops close to border areas in the western sector, and trying to unilaterally alter the status quo along the LAC, which have seriously disturbed peace and tranquility in the border areas." It was in response to Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian who said on Wednesday that China deployed troops at the border to prevent India from encroaching its territory and that New Delhi's "aggressive" policies are to blame for the ongoing tension along LAC. Bagchi said China's actions were in "violation of our bilateral agreements, including the 1993 and 1996 agreements that mandate that the two sides strictly respect and observe the LAC and that two sides will keep their military forces in the areas along the LAC to a minimum level".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lac-mea-hits-back-blames-china-for-standoff/articleshow/83827572.cms||---

Clean-shaven and with perfectly parted hair, Deb was always seen in full-sleeved white shirts and a sleeveless jacket on it. An armed guard trailed him, opening his car door whenever he would alight from MUV, which was fitted with a blue beacon and banners of KMC. A team of “staff”, sporting KMC badges, travelled in a separate car. The beacon, the official badges and banners —albeit them being fake—and Deb’s behaviour won people’s confidence. His staff would always hand out his visiting card, which had ‘IAS’ printed after his name. The card said he was the Joint Secretary I & CA and P & AR departments of state government. Deb’s Facebook profile has journalists, social media influencers and government officials on his friend-list. In his eight-month-old Twitter profile, Deb introduces himself as a “public servant” and shares multiple photos with several MLAs and MPs cutting across party lines. His profile picture is that of him, along with a senior IPS officer, inaugurating possibly a blood donation camp by cops. The event, held four years ago, was attended by councillors and celebrities. Police suspected it was this poise that brought him close to celebrities and influencers and that he used philanthropic work—distribution of masks and sanitiser and holding vaccination drives, though it is yet to be determined whether the shots were genuine or not— to gain people’s trust. Deb used his purported proximity with social media influencers to arrange money from corporates, police said. Cops added that at the Kasba office, which was passed off as a KMC office, he had multiple staff members, who were paid salaries of Rs 25,000 to Rs 35,000 a month. His armed guard was also paid a handsome salary. “Deb acted with such confidence that it was difficult to think he was a fraudster. I met him at a programme he had organized to distribute masks and sanitizer. At that time, I had asked him which batch of IAS he belonged to, but he had dodged the question,” said Lovely Maitra, actor and Sonarpur South MLA. Actor and Jadavpur MP Mimi Chakraborty, who had flagged off the fake vaccination camp at Kasba, where she had taken a shot on Tuesday, said when Deb had asked her permission to take a photograph with her, nothing seemed amiss. "During a very brief chat, he was quick to drop the name of a senior leader. He also said to me that he wanted to do more vaccination camps within my constituency," said Chakraborty. After taking the so-called vaccine at the Kasba camp, organized by Deb, when Chakraborty did not receive a certificate even four hours later, she sent her staff to the camp and found out no registration was being done. It was she who alerted police, following which Deb was arrested. Sheetal Chatterjee, principal of City College on Amherst Street, where Deb had organized a vaccination camp, said the first time he had visited the college was to distribute free masks and sanitisers. The principal, multiple professors, several students as well as residents of the area received so-called vaccines at a camp he held there. “He looked like a genuine officer. They even set up KMC banners,” said Chatterjee. “Our HR manager had received a message on a WhatsApp group about a vaccination camp being held at Kasba by KMC. He met Deb but never suspected he was not a senior IAS officer. We presented him with an official letter, which was signed by him with a seal of KMC joint municipal commissioner that looked genuine. We received communication from his office, with a list of our employees on KMC notepad,” said Sarala Development & Microfinance Pvt Ltd MD Pranab Rakshit. Their 171 employees took shots from Kasba and the firm paid over Rs 1 lakh for the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mp-mla-try-to-decode-the-man-behind-the-charade-nothing-about-him-looked-amiss/articleshow/83823812.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The doors of the Jagannath Temple in Assi locality will remain closed for devotees during this period. According to traditions, before the beginning of the famous three-day Rathyatra festival, Lord Jagannath takes a bath on Jyestha Purnima that makes him fall ill, and thus unfit to give ‘darshan’ to his devotees. During the sickness period, he is served herbal hot food particularly ‘kadha’ made of ‘parwal’ and Tulsi, which is believed would heal the lord of fortnight-long illness, during which viewing and worshipping is banned for devotees. After recovering from illness, the Lord gives ‘darshan’ to his devotees and also makes a visit of the city with his siblings — elder brother Balbhadra and sister Subhadra — on a chariot marking the beginning of the Rathyatra festival. A day before the beginning of the procession, devotees throng Jagannath temple to offer prayer and catch a glimpse of the idols of the deities. These idols are placed in decorated palanquins to begin the procession from the temple in the evening. The procession passing through various localities reaches Rathyatra, the fair area, where the idols are placed at Pt Beniram Bagh for a night stay. A special puja and aarti of the ‘rath’ (wooden chariot) are performed at Rathyatra Crossing. Later, devotees pull the cart to Mahmoorganj Road, where it is placed for three days. The next day the idols of Lord Jagannath and his siblings are placed on the chariot after a special puja in the early morning to mark the start of Rath Yatra festival. Like last year, this year too, the city will miss the centuries-old Rathyatra Mela, which is a replica of the famous Rathyatra festival of Puri, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “The Rathyatra Mela was started in Varanasi in 1802, and since the city had been celebrating the festival with all the gaiety and enthusiasm,” said trustee of Sri Jagannath Mandir Trust, Deepak Shapuri, adding that the festivity has been cancelled in view of corona pandemic. However, the traditional religious rituals will be performed by the priest only at the temple, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/doors-of-jagannath-temple-to-remain-closed-from-today/articleshow/83825891.cms||Binay Singh

Old guards in the BJP and local party workers are not convinced with Eatala who, they felt, is always giving the impression of him taking on the ruling TRS instead of the BJP taking on TRS. Sources in the party said Eatala is always talking about self-respect and not highlighting BJP’s fight and ideology. “Some leaders like E Peddi Reddy have openly opposed his joining the saffron party and a few others are upset that they were not taken along with Eatala when the latter met BJP national president JP Nadda in Delhi,” sources said. Despite his strong face value and cadre support in Huzurabad, a section within the BJP wants Eatala to talk about the TRS government’s misdeeds instead of focusing on how he was booted out by the TRS. During the election incharges’ meeting on Thursday, ex-MP AP Jithender Reddy said despite the differences all leaders and workers should come together and put up a united fight against the TRS. Jithender told TOI that “People of Huzurabad like him. We are still trying to bring coordination between Eatala’s associates and the BJP cadres.” Meanwhile, the party announced election incharges for the bypoll. Dubbak MLA M Raghunandan Rao will be incharge for Huzurabad town, Revuri Prakash Reddy will be Huzurabad rural incharge, former MLA Dharma Rao is incharge for Jammikunta rural and Nizamabad MP D Arvind will be Jammikunta municipality incharge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rumblings-in-bjp-over-eatala-playing-victim-card/articleshow/83823752.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The locker at SBI branch near Poruvazhi, where Vismaya’s gold ornaments are kept, was also sealed. The gold and car given to Kumar during the wedding would be made material evidence in this case. Police have already taken two phones used by Vismaya into custody and will now seek Kumar’s custody for questioning. Kumar had destroyed one of her phones. Meanwhile, the investigation team was silent on the autopsy report. Earlier, IG Harshita Attalluri had said that she could offer a comment only after talking to the doctor who did the procedure. Meanwhile, women’s commission chief MC Josephine and panel member MS Thara visited Vismaya’s parents in Nilamel and sought the details of the physical and mental harassment their daughter had to undergo after marriage. Later, when the media questioned Josephine about her controversial remarks to a woman, who had called her up to complain about domestic violence during a TV programme, Josephine said she did not intend to hurt that person.  “I didn’t make derogatory remarks. My remarks were in response to the woman’s reply that she hadn’t filed a complaint before the police,” she said. When the issue turned into a controversy and people on social media criticized her, Josephine formally expressed her regret. Higher education minister R Bindu and MP NK Premachandran also visited Vismaya’s family.  “Such incidents shouldn’t have happened. We need to evolve a society that gives equal status and rights to women,” said Bindu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kirans-bank-locker-sealed-a/c-frozen/articleshow/83819090.cms||---

They assured that there was no side-effect to taking vaccines. They also told people that vaccination was free for those above 18 years of age,” said sources. AMC officials said that Union home minister Amit Shah while laying the foundation for an urban forest on Sindhu Bhavan Road on Tuesday had urged BJP workers and party leaders to help in boosting vaccination. The officials said it has been decided that AMC will seek support of society office-bearers and ask them to ensure that all residents get vaccinated. The councillors are also going to play a major role as they will be contacting their workers and ensuring that those who have not received their jabs are taken to the vaccination centre.

---||Kochi||NSS: Fix limit on bride’s jewellery||Kottayam: Nair Service Society (NSS) wants the Centre to fix a limit on gold jewellery and other valuables worn by the bride during her marriage and anything above this limit should be considered as dowry-on-demand, said general secretary G Sukumaran Nair. He was presenting a resolution asking the Centre to make amendments in dowry prohibition rules during the presentation of the annual budget of NSS on Thursday. He also wanted the state to enforce existing rules. He asked Centre to make amendments and bring gifts, including gold, under the purview of dowry prohibition rules. Presently, valuables –given as gifts to a new couple including valuable documents, cash, jewellery, vehicles, movable and immovable properties – all come under the definition of Dowry Prohibition Act. According to the Act, valuables given as ‘gifts’ during marriage without demand are exempted from punishment. Gold, which is demanded as dowry, is usually given as ornaments for the bride during marriage. So, many families that give huge quantities of gold during marriage escape punishment. This is why a limit should be fixed by Centre for the gold worn during marriage, added Sukumaran Nair. He said that the punishment fixed for giving and receiving dowry was inadequate and must be increased. It is the responsibility of state government to implement the clauses of Dowry Prohibition Act, he said.  State government has authority to make necessary rules to implement the Act efficiently. It had formulated rules under Kerala Dowry Prohibition Rules-2004 and issued a notification, he added. He explained that as per these rules, there is provision to post regional dowry prohibition officers in three regions of Kerala and RDOs can be given this responsibility. These officers have powers to stop visit marriage venues, collect details of gold jewellery, inspect and infer if dowry was given in secret and stop such crimes. Though these officers can stop such crimes and prosecute those who indulge in dowry-related crimes, the move is not seen in state, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nss-fix-limit-on-brides-jewellery/articleshow/83819127.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

On June 16 in Bareillly, Maurya had left the political circles abuzz by stating that “BJP Parliamentary Board and its national leadership will decide under whom the next assembly election will be fought in the state”. However, this was followed by a lunch he hosted for Yogi and some top RSS functionaries, including Sarkaryawah Dattatreya Hosabale and Sah Sarkaryawah Krishna Gopal, to send an ‘all is well’ message across political spectrum. “The opposition is facing a draught of issues to raise against BJP-led governments at the Centre and state due to which it is making false claims and fanning rumours. The results of zila and block panchayat elections will make it clear who is enjoying maximum support of people,” said Maurya stating that “those who have maximum seats in zila and block panchayats will win”. Commenting on the issue of religious conversions, Maurya said: “UP is not a grazing yard for those who are involved in giving lucrative offers or misleading innocent people to get converted. Such elements will face stern action. The government is also mulling the introduction of a law for population control.” Earlier, Maurya dedicated and laid the foundation of 516 projects of over Rs 500 crores to be executed by the public works department (PWD) and UP Bridge Corporation at the function organised at the GIC ground. Addressing a public meeting on this occasion, Maurya claimed that “BJP will retain UP by winning over 300 seats in the 2022 assembly polls.” He said, “Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav should stop day-dreaming as people had refused his previous experiments of forming alliances with Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party in past elections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/our-relations-are-fabulous-maurya-on-his-ties-with-yogi/articleshow/83825939.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Woman accuses occultist of raping her in dreams||PATNA: In a peculiar case, a woman reached the Town police station at Aurangabad on Wednesday, accusing a man of “repeatedly raping her in her dreams” and seeking action against him. The police, in turn, interrogated the man and released him on a personal bond! The woman told SHO of Town police station, Anjani Kumar, that her “ordeal” started in January this year when she met the man, an occultist, at Kali Bari temple in Aurangabad for the treatment of her ailing son. Chaturvedi suggested her to recite a “mantra” and perform certain rituals for speedy recovery of her son. “I followed his instructions religiously, but lost my son after 15 days. After that, he started harassing me in my dreams. There had been occasions when he even raped me in my dreams,” she told the SHO. The police officer summoned the occultist at the police station to ascertain if the woman had ever visited him. A police officer said the occultist admitted that the woman had met her in the temple once. “What happened to her later is not known to me. She appears to be a bit depressed after losing her son,” the police officer quoted the occultist as saying. “I called the occultist to show the woman that action was being taken against him as she was adamant on her demand. Moreover, I had to verify the fact as well. We asked the man to fill personal bond just to convince the woman. Under which section should we institute case against the man when the incident never happened?” the SHO asked. Aurangabad deputy superintendent of police (headquarters) Lalit Narayan Pandey said prima facie the woman appeared to be mentally unsound. “The police officers are in touch with her relatives and have asked them to get her admitted for proper treatment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-accuses-occultist-of-raping-her-in-dreams/articleshow/83819561.cms||Ramashankar

---||Surat||Rahul Gandhi denies defaming any community||SURAT: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi appeared before the court of chief judicial magistrate AN Dave in Surat on Thursday and denied making any defamatory remarks against people with ‘Modi’ surname. A criminal defamation case was filed against him by BJP MLA from Surat West seat Purnesh Modi in April 2019 over the Gandhi scion’s remarks made during a rally at Kolar in Karnataka in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. When the magistrate asked him if he had said Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave Rs 30 crore to an industrialist, Gandhi told the court that being a national leader, he keeps raising issues of corruption and unemployment in his addresses in the interest of the nation, and it is his right to raise do so. Gandhi’s lawyer Kirit Panwala said, “The complainant in the case has submitted three different applications to stall the process of registering further statements of Gandhi. But the court rejected the applications.”  “There is no community with the name of Modi, hence it is not possible to defame it,” Gandhi said in the court, according to Panwala. Gandhi also denied that he ever said that people with Modi surname are thieves, an allegation levelled by the MLA in his complaint. Besides, to most of the remaining questions related to the evidence and statements of witnesses in the case, Gandhi said "I don't know". Earlier, the Congress leader had appeared before the court in October 2019 and pleaded not guilty for his comment. A week back, CJM Dave directed Gandhi to remain present on June 24 to record his statement in the case. Meanwhile, the legislator has approached the Gujarat high court seeking to call Kolar district collector and a videographer, who recorded the speech, as witnesses in the case. Next hearing in the case is scheduled on July 12. Gandhi arrived in a chartered flight from Delhi and directly went to court. After the court proceedings, he left for Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/rahul-gandhi-denies-defaming-any-community/articleshow/83819207.cms||---

Assembly polls will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 2022. The paintings put up by Samad carry SP’s symbol ‘bicycle’ and slogans ‘Ummid ki cycle’ and ‘2022 mein Khela Hoyi’, and have been catching attention of passersby on the busy Maqbool Alam Road since Thursday morning. Regarding the slogan, Samad said, “SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has released the party's slogan for forthcoming assembly election — ‘Do hazar bayees me bicycle (Bicycle in 2022)’. Considering the mood of the people in the Bhojpuri belt of east UP, we also created a slogan ‘Do hazar bayees me khela hoyi’ as people are upset due to lies and promises of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They are enthused after TMC taught a bitter lesson to BJP in the recently held WB election.” Samad had won the assembly poll on SP ticket for the first time in 2007 from the City North assembly seat but he lost in the 2012 election. In the 2017 assembly election, when SP had an alliance with Congress and the City North had been allotted to junior alliance partner, Samad had been fielded on Congress symbol. After the 2017 assembly poll results some groups started claiming that Samad had joined Congress. Samad said, “I had contested on Congress symbol on the order of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav. But, some of my rivals inside SP started a false campaign against me to create confusion despite the fact that I am dedicated to SP only.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/2022-mein-khela-hoyi-says-former-sp-mla/articleshow/83825968.cms||---

After directions issued by the Telangana high court in April to impose restrictive measures, the government declared a total of 63 containment zones, in specific geographic areas in GHMC, where Covid-19 positive cases are found in large numbers. However, residents say that the lack of any measures being implemented by the authorities to decrease the number of containment zones, despite the decline in total number of cases, is leading to an information vacuum for many. “One of the containment zones listed on the GHMC website is near our house. It was declared a containment zone in April this year and continues to be one. We have no idea if the number of cases in that apartment complex have increased or decreased. How can there be no drop in the number of containment zones if the total number of cases in GHMC are coming down?” asked T Murthy, a resident near Malaysian Township in KPHB colony of Kukatpally zone. A total of 10 containment zones were declared in Kukatpally zone in April when GHMC recorded over 900 Covid-19 infections, the highest at that time in the second wave. The 10 containment zones continue to remain in the list even as there is an 84% decrease in the number of cases, as per the state government’s medical bulletin. GHMC recorded 137 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday. Similar is the case with the remaining containment zones, spread over all the six zones of GHMC, that are put on display on the civic body’s website. Of the total, 12 containment zones are in Charminar, 11 in Secunderabad and 10 each in Kukatpally, LB Nagar, Khairatabad and Serilingampally. “The residents of our apartment complex have voluntarily imposed restrictions on inviting guests or frequently moving in and out of the community when this area was first declared a containment zone in April. Now, people come in and go out of apartment complex throughout the day and we have no information from the GHMC if this place is still a containment zone,” said Padma Lakshmi, a resident of Attapur. According to the officials, the perimeters of containment zones were decided based on the number of positive cases in the area, contact tracing history and population density. “Even though the number of cases in these containment zones have come down, we have not stopped sanitisation measures in these areas. As a preventive measure to contain the spread of virus, we take some time to drop the area from the containment zone list,” said Dr A Rambabu, chief entomologist, GHMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-of-containment-zones-in-ghmc-remain-same-despite-dip-in-cases/articleshow/83823845.cms||Moulika.KV

The protests had died down on the Ghazipur border due to the second wave of pandemic, but it continued at the other border points where farmers from Punjab were camping. Now, after BKU leader Naresh Tikait’s call, the famers from western UP are coming out to re-launch the stir. The tractor rally is being dubbed as the beginning which will take hundreds of farmers to Ghazipur border point on Friday, where a mahapanchayat will be held. It started from Saharanpur on Wednesday and will reach Ghazipur border on Friday evening. On Thursday, the farmers were in Muzaffarnagar where scores joined them. The rally will cut through Meerut and Ghaziabad on Friday where a large number of farmers are expected to join it. BKU spokesperson Dharmendra Malik said, “Hundreds of tractors from Muzaffarnagar district will also join the rally. It will take a halt at the Sewaya toll plaza in Meerut on Thursday night. They will reach the Ghazipur border at 5pm on Friday.” BKU leader Naresh Tikait said, “A mahapanchayat will be organised at the Gazipur border on Friday.” While BKU’s national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said, “It is a kind of drill, a beginning to send across an ultimatum to the government.” Rakesh said that the government is not listening to the farmers in spite of several shocks. “The first jolt was given in West Bengal. The second will be from UP and Uttarakhand where elections are due. If the disease is serious then the treatment will also take some time.” BKU had assigned targets to their district presidents to mobilize farmers. BKU leadership has been holding meetings with district and divisional presidents. Besides the Delhi borders, protests are also planned at the local level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/hundreds-of-up-farmers-set-out-for-delhi-border-as-bku-relaunches-protests-against-3-farm-laws/articleshow/83816645.cms||Mohd Dilshad

A team of geologists conducted the survey of the village a few days ago. The village is known as the cradle of the Chipko movement and is the native place of Gaura Devi, one of the protest pioneers. "There are a total of 55 families living in Raini. We have identified areas in Subhai and Dhaak villages for rehabilitating the families at risk,” said Nand Kishore Joshi, disaster management officer, Chamoli. Chamoli district magistrate Swati Bhadouria said, “We have given them two options under the makeshift and permanent rehabilitation categories. Four areas at different places have been geologically surveyed to relocate them. So, we are doing things at a rapid pace despite limited resources." The team of geologists who conducted the Raini village survey and the areas identified for rehabilitation are expected to submit a report by Monday, an official told TOI. However, the local villagers remain unimpressed. They are demanding expediting the process in view of the monsoon season. Gaura Devi's grandson, Soban Singh Rana told TOI, “The monsoon is set to begin, and the rehabilitation works are yet to start. We continue to stay in our homes or at relatives’ places whenever it rains heavily. Urgent steps need to be taken as every family has small children and elderly who cannot be shifted promptly in case of an emergency.” “The administration must ensure that our animals are also moved with us,” Rana said. Notably, the villagers of Raini are demanding rehabilitation as they claim that Alaknanda river is continuously eroding the river bank and moving towards the village, thus putting the families at serious risk. Incidentally, the villagers first reported instability in the village on June 4 and that’s when the administration swung into action, according to Bhadouria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/chipko-village-raini-hit-by-chamoli-flash-floods-to-be-rehabilitated/articleshow/83819173.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Speaking at the inaugural address at the orientation programme for the legislative assembly members, organized by Kerala legislative assembly media and parliamentary study centre, the chief minister said that there should be cooperation among the members and they should stand together for development and building a new Kerala. He said that it should be the interest of the people that should be raised in the assembly and not vested interests. He said that though the members are of different political outlook, the rules are applicable for everyone alike. As the matters brought in the assembly are considered as authentic documents, the members have the responsibility to ensure the authenticity of the matters presented in the assembly, he said. He added that the members should do proper homework before presenting matters in the assembly and not like making political speeches. For this, the members should make full use of the assembly library. While maintaining the timeframe in the assembly, the members should also be active while they are present in the assembly, he said. Stating that the matters being raised should not be meant for the media attention, the chief minister said that the members should have active involvement in subject committees and the select committees. He said that the members should be role models inside and outside the assembly. Speaker M B Rajesh, who presided over the function, said that the assembly has a long history of people-centric law making. He said that such training programmes will help improve law making. The legislature secretariat is striving to ensure that the assembly becomes a completely paperless one by November this year. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said that the members should ensure that all those matters concerning the public but have not come to the notice are raised in the assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/interests-of-people-should-be-raised-in-assembly-cm/articleshow/83819176.cms||---

People moving around and gathering at eateries and hotels without masks and maintaining social distance is a common sight. Crowded places such as Charminar, Laadbazaar, Gulzar Houz, Falaknuma, Purnapul, Karwan’s Sabzi, Tappachabutra, Jhirrah, Asifnagar and Mehdipatnam see the most violations of Covid-19 norms. Mohammed Ahmed, TDP, GHMC minority vice-president told TOI that people are rushing to markets and ignoring Covid norms as if there is no pandemic. He urged the police, health officials and GHMC to ensure there is awareness about Covid-appropriate behaviour so that people take preventative measures to stay safe and keep others safe. “It is really a matter of concern,” Ahmed said. “Ignorance may prove costly in coming days. Citizens should not forget the sufferings of people who lost their loved ones since the outbreak.” He added, “People assume that with lifting of lockdown, everything has become normal. This is not the case. Even if the lockdown is lifted, the pandemic has not ended.” Mohammed Abdul Rahman, a shopkeeper, told TOI that many people visit his shop without a mask, or wear it improperly. “When we tell them to wear a mask or to wear it properly, most do not take it seriously.” He said, “After the lifting of the lockdown, people think the pandemic is over. Most people visiting the Old City are without masks or are not wearing them properly. The rules should be implemented strictly, else there is a danger of third wave hitting soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/crowds-gather-masks-slip-as-old-city-ignores-norms/articleshow/83823874.cms||Omar bin Taher

In a review meeting convened by mayor Arya Rajendran here on Thursday, feasibility of the project was pointed out. Town planning department has already raised queries regarding the need for a subway as well as a foot overbridge (FOB) at East Fort. The civic body is tying up with private partners to construct a FoB at East Fort. Besides this issue, the vulnerability of the area due to waterlogging and flash floods was also discussed which further led to officials flagging the possibility of flooding in the subway.Although the project report had taken care of maximum flood level, Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Ltd (SCTL) pointed out that the periodic cleaning of Amayizhanjan and Pazhavangadi canals which often swell and overflow during showers cannot be included in the scope of work. The pumping system was also integrated in the project however in the incidence of heavy flooding, the operational capacity will have to be ascertained, it was cited in the meeting.The city corporation will now invite suggestions from councillors in area-based development zone included under smart city scheme. A new proposal will be communicated to SCTL. The decision regarding the subway project will be presented in the next board meeting. The integrated transit node includes four major components — subway, smart road, restoration of Gandhi park and construction of bus queue shelter. The road around Gandhi park would be developed as smart road which will have storm water drain and underground multi-utility ducting. The area in the Gandhi park which would be affected by the project will be restored under the scheme. As per the scope of work in request for proposal document, the integrated transit node at East Fort envisions a well-connected, safe and accessible city centre with the integration of all public amenities like religious, commercial as well as city-level functions in a more cohesive and continuous way. The focus is on ensuring pedestrian safety in a place with high pedestrian footfall and recurring conflicts of pedestrian and vehicular movement, the document notes.Traffic management during the construction has also been included in the scope of work. SCTL had retendered the project three times before the work was awarded. The tenders issued earlier had received a single bid and the amount quoted was excessively higher than the project estimate. The contractor had reportedly quoted high price for the project taking into account various risk factors involved in undertaking a project in a spot with high traffic volume. The project was proposed to be implemented at a cost of Rs 22 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/smart-city-subway-project-at-east-fort-to-be-scrapped/articleshow/83821606.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Significantly, Uttar Pradesh was one of the first states in the country to launch the helpline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-uttar-pradesh-uttarakhand-launches-elderline-helpline-to-aid-senior-citizens/articleshow/83819292.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Almost no Covaxin available for 18+, no supply expected anytime soon||NAGPUR: Though Covaxin is the costliest among the three vaccines, the fact that it offers a shorter gap between two doses means all 100 slots for it were booked as soon as they opened for the first time in private sector for 18+ age group on Thursday. The indigenous vaccine is unlikely to be available for 18+ age group at government centres anytime soon. Sputnik V – the other vaccine whose second dose is allowed after a month’s gap — won’t be procured by the government, said officials. As per central government permitted rates, Covaxin costs Rs1,410, Covishield Rs780 and Sputnik V Rs1,145. Among the eight private hospitals, Covaxin is available only at one. Top health and civic officials said Covaxin is still not available for the 18+ group due to insufficient stock in government vaccination centres. “The government has asked us to offer Covaxin only to 45+ age group, and only for second dose of 18+ group. The supply is erratic,” they said. Sputnik too is available in the city but not for walk-ins, and only for corporate employees under exclusive arrangements. If not Sputnik, at least Covaxin must be made available in the same quantity as Covishield, say activist and doctors. Activist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani said the government projected that youths would be affected in the third wave, which is expected to hit soon. “It becomes the duty of all elected representatives and administrative authorities to ensure Covaxin is available in the city. They must use their good offices to get Covaxin like they did for others. We are also facing the threat of new variants and a vaccine having shorter gap between two doses must be procured on urgent basis,” she said. VHA convenor Dr Anup Marar said, “The government has increased the gap between two doses of Covishield. They must have scientific reasons for prolonging the gap. However, the gap between two doses of Covaxin remains less. Regardless of the reason for the different gap, it would be prudent that Covaxin is made available at enough centres so that 18 to 45 age groups, who go out more and can cause spread of Covid, are vaccinated with both doses of Covaxin quickly within specified duration.” Dr Marar added, “This will be of great help to control anticipated third wave as complete vaccination of 18 to 45 year age groups will go a long way in controlling spread and mortality, as this age group detests Covid-appropriate behavior and are carefree.” Civic officials said, “State government has already conveyed that Covaxin supply will be very less. As per government orders, Sputnik won’t be covered in government supply.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/almost-no-covaxin-available-for-18-no-supply-expected-anytime-soon/articleshow/83821503.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The SSP said that he would be giving such envelopes to the SHOs after every periodic meeting with them. “The idea is to encourage the SHOs to order snacks and tea and pay for it when they have a visitor or they are meeting locals in the field,” said the SSP. “I will be giving such envelopes to the SHOs after every meeting.” Police sources, however, said the SSP had warned his subordinates against accepting bribes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ssp-gifts-rs-1000-to-shos-for-expenses-on-snacks-on-their-return-journey-after-meeting/articleshow/83816798.cms||---

According to the complainant, as he made a call on the number provided by the SBI’s customer care cell, his mobile number was hacked and money was withdrawn from his account. Pipraich police, on orders of the SSP Gorakhpur, lodged an FIR and launched a probe. While talking to TOI, Dharmesh Upadhyaya (40) said that on June 13 he had applied for a credit card. On June 17, on inquiring about the credit card at the customer care number the executive provided him numbers 1800180290 and 8601801290 for further inquiry. The first number was not working and as soon as he called on the second number, his phone number was hacked as he found many apps being installed on his phone. He immediately registered a complaint at the SBI helpline asking them to lock his account but somehow they failed to do so and Rs 14 lakh were withdrawn from his account on June 17 and 18. “At the cyber cell they refused to lodge my FIR as there was no inspector and Pipraich police station also refused saying that the case was of cyber cell. Finally I went to the SSP office and after his orders, the police registered a case on June 19. I have lost all my savings.” “A case has been registered against SBI customer care Bangalore and an unidentified scammer under sections of 419 (Punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property)IPC and 66 C IT Act (punishment for Identity theft). Probe has been initiated in the case,” said SHO Pipraich Suryabhan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/man-duped-of-rs-14-lakh-in-gorakhpur/articleshow/83826063.cms||---

A meeting was held on Thursday with many doctors and management representatives, under the aegis of Telangana Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (THANA), to discuss in detail about the new tariff orders given by the state government. “We met state government representatives earlier and submitted a proposal of tariffs from our side. They have ignored it completely, and gave order with almost no changes from the directives given last year,” Dr Kishan Rao, president of THANA, told TOI. We will ask the state to consider tariff combining rates from our proposal and the rates fixed by them. It is not possible for us to give treatment at that cost, he added. The government, in its orders, fixed Rs 4,000 as the per day charges for routine and isolation wards. The charges for ICU without ventilator have been fixed at Rs 7,500 per day and charges per day for ICU with ventilator (plus isolation) are fixed at Rs 9,000. THANA had earlier requested the government to fix the rates between Rs 10,000 as minimum cost for even general ward to Rs 20,000 per day charge depending on the services rendered. “When the state government at one point of time announced that they are spending lakhs of rupees on each Covid-19 patient in government hospitals, how can they expect us to provide services at such cheap rates when prices of medicines and services have gone up,” a hospital manager, who was in the meeting, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/unhappy-with-new-tariff-directive-pvt-hosps-seek-change/articleshow/83823981.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Delhi||70 rapid teams to tackle water complaints||New Delhi: With the monsoon delayed and temperatures continuing to soar, the demand-supply gap in water supply in the capital remains high. Seventy assembly-level emergency response teams are being set up after Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha reviewed the situation on Thursday. Each five-member team is headed by a chief engineer and the turnaround time to sort out complaints has been fixed at four days. Weekly reports on vulnerable regions have been sought by the headquarters. Chadha said, “We need to find a way to supply the available raw water in an equitable way either through a piped network or additional tanker trips. DJB officers need to ensure that the complaints received are redressed promptly without fail.” A DJB official said the review of all constituencies for the past three months was done on parameters like dirty/contaminated water complaints, leakage in pipeline, low pressure, no water and wastage of water. Chadha said, “All chief engineers are required to visit their respective areas that are facing problems along with the local MLAs and formulate a working plan and submit weekly reports to the vice-chairperson’s office.” He further instructed officials that the constituency-wise analysis of the database, in terms of amount of water received by DJB installations, has to be carried out at regular intervals to find out the demand-supply gaps. In areas receiving maximum complaints, the matter will be dealt with severely, Chadha said. A DJB official said orders had been issued for deployment of emergency response teams consisting of chief engineers and superintendent engineers, who would draft localised plans for critical areas in consultation with area MLAs and after site visits. “These plans will be submitted to the board member (water) for verification and further action,” he added. Chadha said, “It was high time to focus on targeted areas for a long-term, viable solution. We have to find a way to supply available raw water without any loss till the end point and aim for maximum consumer satisfaction.” He also took stock of flowmeter installations and directed each chief engineer to submit a detailed status report. “Flowmeters are necessary to measure the flow of water from a particular point. They also help in rationalisation along with reduction in loss of potable water supply by finding out any possible leakage,” Chadha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/70-rapid-teams-to-tackle-water-complaints/articleshow/83821593.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They also alleged the probe was "one-sided" and will hold a massive protest if the order is not revoked. Acting on the directions of CM Tirath Singh Rawat, the state government had suspended two executive engineers - Jeet Singh Rawat and Shailendra Mishra as well as assistant engineer Anil Chandola - for the mishap in which a part of the approach to the Barasi Bridge on Raipur-Thano highway collapsed on June 18. The three engineers will have to now serve their suspension period by spending their deputation at the regional PWD office in Pauri. The engineers have been accused of approving the structural drawing, made by a consultant firm, without getting it verified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/3-engineers-suspended-for-bridge-damage-engineers-group-hold-stir/articleshow/83819344.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Vaccine at limited government centres today for want of doses||NAGPUR: After stupendous performance on last two days, the Covid vaccination drive will come to a halt at most of the government centres on Friday as the division has ran out of doses. The drive may continue at limited centres but won’t be able to run full day unless replenishment is provided before noon. Meanwhile, the division’s vaccination figures fell by 31% to 72,153 on Thursday after crossing the 1 lakh mark on Wednesday. Of these, over 55,000 beneficiaries (77%) were from the 18 to 44 group. In Nagpur district too, the figures came down to 37,054 after touching its highest ever-tally of over 42,000 on Wednesday. Here too, over 29,020 (78%) beneficiaries were from the 18 to 44 age group. Officials from deputy director of health services (DDHS) office, which supplies vaccines to all six districts in the division, told TOI that there was no stock left in its depot while the doses at all centres were almost over on Thursday evening The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will carry on the drive only at GMCH, IGGMCH, AIIMS, Daga Hospital, Mahal Diagnostic Centre and Ambedkar Hospital at Indora. Vaccination at over 200 centres would depend on supply from the DDHS depot. Private centres may continue vaccination for corporate and open for all in paid service on Friday. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI that the DDHS has assured supply of vaccines. “If we get does by 12 noon, we would be able to resume vaccination for second session. If delivery gets delayed by 3pm to 4pm, then centres can function only on Saturday,” he said. Joshi added that around 1,500 doses of Covishield would be available at AIIMS, Daga and IGGMCH government centers. GMCH, Mahal and Ambedkar Hospital are exclusive centres for Covaxin where only 45+ age group and second dose for 18 to 44 age group is given. Joshi feared the conducting the vaccination drive to limited centres may drive the crowd to places where doses are available. Since the start of vaccination for 30+ group and subsequently the 18+ age group a day before, the centres have seamlessly managed to avoid crowding. Joshi said the new feature in Co-Win allows centre admins to increase the slots. “So, even if more people turn up than the day’s target at a centre, all are accommodated and it helps in avoiding crowding,” he said. Teams working on the drive are also now used to the system making the process further smooth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-at-limited-govt-centres-today-for-want-of-doses/articleshow/83821576.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Complaints against the company had been forwarded from the Prime Minister’s Office. With the use of a website and a call center run from Indore, the fraudsters were cheating buyers of biodiesel who believed their story. Senior police inspector of Rakhial, J V Rathod said all accused have been booked under IPC Section 406 (criminal breach of trust), 507 (intimidation by anonymous communication) and Section 114 (abettor present during offence). Two kingpins, Niraj and Rita Tiwari, both residents of Indore were arrested by cops who went to Madhya Pradesh. Another 12 accused are absconding. After raiding the office of Inter Global Resources Top Petroleum Products in Indore, police seized seven bank accounts, nine mobiles, and a computer. They found Rs 10 lakh in bank account of the fraud company. Police said the fraudsters had made a contract for office at Rakhial to show an address in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and there was no operation of the company here. Achal Tyagi, DCP Zone-V, said the fraudsters used to give recruitment advertisements for biodiesel salespersons. They used to offer Rs 10,000 as salary. One Nagesh, who is the mastermind of the racket had made the contract for the Rakhial address, and he used to conduct final communication with the fraud victims once they fell in their trap. “In case any of the salespersons complained about non-delivery of the biodiesel, he was immediately sacked. Several complaints about the company were received by the PMO, the chief minister’s office, and even at the police station,” Tyagi said.“Once we began the probe in earnest, Nagesh switched off his phone and became untraceable,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/biodiesel-cheater-racket-busted-two-held-from-indore/articleshow/83821883.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Brief spell of heavy rain brings Prayagraj to halt||PRAYAGRAJ: The city was in a gigantic mess on Thursday as a brief spell of heavy rain once again exposed the civic body’s lack of preparedness of monsoon. Most parts of the city, including Chowk, Katra, Mutthiganj, Alopibagh, Niranjan Bridge Road, Allahapur, Civil Lines and Colonelganj witnessed waterlogging, which brought traffic to a grinding halt. Although overcast conditions prevailed since early morning, heavy rain started only in the evening. According to the meteorological department (Indian Air Force), the city received 9.8mm rainfall between 8am and 6pm . With fresh rainfall, the water level of Ganga and Yamuna in Phaphamau, Chantnag and Naini was recorded as 77.21 m, 71.26 m and 72.55 m. The rain brought welcome respite from sulty weather prevailing for the past few days, with the maximum temperature was 33.7 degrees Celsius and the minimum at 25.3 degrees Celsius. The relative humidity was recorded as 100 per cent. Haseeb Ahmad, an old city resident, said: “A brief spell of heavy rain brought relief from sultry weather, but it also exposed the tall claims of Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) of cleaning the drains and nullahs.” He said, the residents of the old city areas, including Nakhas Kona, Ranimandi, Khuldabad, Aatala, Luckerganj, Akbarpur, Guas Nagar, were inundated due to chocked drains. Senior Congress corporator Mukund Tiwari alleged that majority of city drains were chocked and as a result, locals had to face the wrath of the rainy season. He added that a brief spell of rains on Thursday exposed the clear picture of the smart city. Residents of Mutthiganj, Alopibagh, Allahapur, Katra and old city areas also complained about bad condition of roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/brief-spell-of-heavy-rain-brings-city-to-halt/articleshow/83826152.cms||---

Stating that this “failed to fit into the rules” as he and his colleagues occupied university residences, he set aside the proposal and the decision taken. TOI had reported about the “controversial” matter on Thursday. As the management council meeting began on Thursday and the minutes of the previous meeting came for approval, Pednekar set the item aside. He said he would soon set up an inquiry committee to crack down on any other campus resident who may be claiming HRA despite living in a university provided home. “The V-C decided to set aside the item from the minutes. He said that after going through all the rules and regulations, he was of the opinion that the same did not fit into the rules,” said senior officials from the university. “It is good that the university has rejected this proposal. Next time, rules must be checked before introducing such items,” said chancellor’s nominee and management council member Deepak Mukadam. The management council had proposed to pay house rent allowance to three of the senior-most officers of the university—vice-chancellor, pro vice-chancellor and registrar—who are living in rent-free furnished accommodation provided by the university. While Pednekar lives in the V-C bungalow on Kalina campus, pro V-C Ravindra Kulkarni lives in the lodge provided by the university at Marine Lines. Registrar Baliram Gaikwad is provided residential accommodation on the Kalina campus. In the previous management council meeting on May 29, this item was not originally a part of the agenda distributed among members. But as the online meeting was about to end, a member, Pradeep Sawant, raised the issue and stated that the HRA matter ought to be looked into. In the minutes of the meeting distributed among members on Wednesday evening, for Thursday’s meeting, the decision was printed as: “According to everyone, a decision has been taken to pay the HRA retrospectively for the date of appointment to the V-C, pro V-C and the registrar.” In response, varsity officials said: “The minutes have not been confirmed yet. Only when they are confirmed in the management council meeting that will be held on Thursday, will this become a resolution.” HRA payout is 40% of the basic salary, and if paid retrospectively, could amount to several lakhs for the V-C. Officials said no other V-C, pro V-C or registrar who lived on campus residences claimed HRA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-v-c-rejects-hra-allotment-proposal-for-officials-living-in-univ-residences/articleshow/83826171.cms||Hemali Chhapia

An analysis of the annual review of state laws 2020 by an independent research group has shown that the Telangana state legislative assembly had an average sitting of just nine days post lockdown in 2020 as against 25 working days in a year between 2016 and 2019. But, Telangana seemed to have done much better when compared to states like Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh which had only 2-5 working days of their assemblies in 2020 post lockdown. Many states, however, had better number of average working days of assembly than Telangana during 2016-2019, the analysis revealed. Interestingly, states like Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka and Bihar had reported more average working days of 10-12 days post lockdown 2020. For the purpose of the analysis, the research group took March 24, 2020, as a cut-off date when India went into a lockdown mode to combat Covid-19. The research group, in its report, also said that Telangana assembly brought out 20 Acts in 2020. It also also enacted 18 laws and passed four important ordinances during this period. During the pandemic, a few states had enacted laws to amend the Epidemic Diseases Act (Telangana also made one), while some states notified temporary regulations under the 1897 Act or promulgated ordinances. A few states also enacted laws to bring changes in elections to local governments. Maharashtra enacted a law to postpone the elections to the offices of the mayor and deputy mayor of some municipal corporations. Kerala amended its panchayat and municipal laws to facilitate postal and direct voting for persons affected by Covid-19 or those in quarantine, the research group said. Other legislative actions triggered by the pandemic included reducing salaries of legislators (like in Telangana) and amendments to labour laws to enable longer shifts in factories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-assembly-had-only-9-days-of-sitting-post-lockdown-2020-report/articleshow/83824000.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Pune||Delta-plus threat calls for more scientific unlock process in Maharashtra: Experts||PUNE: The emergence of the Delta-plus variant — classified as a “Variant of Concern” by the Centre this week — calls for a more scientific way to unlock regions, state task force member Dr Shashank Joshi has said. He said that factors such as pace of vaccination and population-wide adoption of precautions should be considered before curbs are lifted. “We must vaccinate 70% of a region's target population, have zero tolerance for violations of Covid protocols and an area should show a positivity rate of less than 5% for two weeks before curbs can be eased,” he said. Health experts TOI spoke to said the state's five-level unlock process, which came into effect on June 7, has no scientific basis. A task force member, who didn't wish to be named, said the group had never recommended any “levels” for unlocking, especially the oxygen-bed occupancy factor. Cities and districts with less than 5% positivity rate and less than 25% occupancy of oxygen beds fall under Level 1 — free of most restrictions. “There should be more proper parameters for assessment in the wake of the new (Delta-plus) variant,” the task force member said. State additional health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said the government has decided to review the unlock process. A senior official said the state may explore another “trigger” — besides bed occupancy and positivity rate — given the threat from the new variant. The current restriction trigger states that if state-wide oxygen-bed occupancy goes beyond 35,000, a level-3 lockdown would automatically set in across Maharashtra. “While the current trigger for the state mainly deals with oxygen beds, another trigger specifically addressing Delta-plus, especially in affected districts, may help,” the official said. Virologist Dr T Jacob John said district-wise data should decide where it is on momentum graph, numerical graph and active cases' graph. “It is only after all three have peaked and the mortality curve also begins to decline can lockdown conditions be eased. Immunizations should continue without any let up,” he said. He added that weekly positivity and number of patients requiring oxygen are inappropriate parameters as they do not tell you the epidemiology of transmission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/delta-plus-threat-calls-for-more-scientific-unlock-process-experts/articleshow/83823995.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Anti Narcotics Cell (ANC) superintendent of police, Mahesh Gaonkar said that the police has a zero tolerance policy to the drug trade and will act against those involved. Gaonkar also said that since the tourism industry took a hit due to the pandemic there have been lesser number of drug seizures as compared to the corresponding period last year. “We attribute the less number of seizures due to fall in the number of tourists, domestic as well as foreigners,” he said. The police also arrested 55 persons including seven foreign nationals for illegal possession of narcotics during the first half of 2021. Of the 55 narcotic raids, 30 cases itself were booked by North Goa police which is the higher than cases filed by South Goa police jurisdiction, ANC and crime branch put together. He also said that 80% of the arrests in drugs raids are non-Goans, adding that most of the drugs seized are natural, like ganja and charas. The ANC chief also said that the police have booked truck drivers who tried to get narcotic substances into the state and drugs have been confiscated from passengers travelling to Goa by bus and train. “Sometimes Goa is used as transit point for drugs,” he said while appealing to students to keep away from narcotic substances. Gaonkar also urged parents to seek counselling immediately for their children if they suspected addiction to drugs. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had earlier said that the police department has “full freedom to destroy the entire chain of the drugs trade in Goa”. MLAs had also raised the issue in the assembly about drugs reaching the hinterlands and in schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/100kg-drugs-worth-over-rs-2cr-seized-in-first-6-months-of-2021/articleshow/83824043.cms||---

Earlier, the SIT had interrogated Dr Navtej as well. SIT head Rakesh Rawat told TOI, “Dr Navtej Nalwa was asked several questions regarding testing and agreement. We will question the owners of Max Corporate Services on Friday." Meanwhile, Mallika Pant told media persons after coming out from the CDO office, “We are cooperating with the investigation. Our firm did not conduct any testing directly. We are just a facilitator and all the testing was done by Nalwa Laboratories and Dr Lal Chandani labs. Both the labs are responsible for any misconduct that has happened.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/owners-of-max-corporate-services-get-their-statements-recorded-at-haridwar-cdos-office/articleshow/83819396.cms||---

Two guards stand alongside watching patiently. It’s a peaceful afternoon at the crematorium, with no signs of gloom at least for the day. Not a single pyre was burning there. The worker and the guards, who did not want to be photographed, said they are enjoying the leisure time, after the hectic activity in April and June. “We hardly had any spare time, each days 40 to 50 bodies were cremated. Covid bodies have almost stopped now,” said a guard. The NMC staffer at the office also appeared relaxed. A month ago, the same place was dotted with NMC workers in PPE kits burning the Covid victims. “In June so far, we have had 126 cremations here out of which Covid dead were 22. The numbers were much higher in earlier two months ago, the entire area was full,” the staffer said. Only one cremation had taken place on the day TOI visited Ambazari ghat. At Gangabai Ghat in the eastern part of the city, five pyres were burning with kin gathered around only two. “Since March, I have come here not less than 15 times. Each time it was for last rites of a relative who died of Covid. Finally, today a 95-year-old has died of old age, and not Covid, and I was here for her funeral,” said Vaibhav Ramteke, who is in his twenties. “A number of those who died were in their 40s and the families have lost earning members. I remember the scene here those days, it’s nothing compared to it now,” he says, also complaining of the charges levied on firewood. A little further, the workers there can be seen resting, all agreeing that the stressful days are behind them at least for now. A middle-aged man and woman, meanwhile, found Mokshadham crematorium the right place to spend some time, away from the world. “We work close by and had just come down to sit for a while,” said the man, not wishing to be identified. Close by sat a packaged water vendor hoping some customers turn up. Business was good when deaths were at a peak, as many came down, he says. The workers, including those engaged by contractors, were glued to their mobiles while some were seen napping. It’s a well-earned rest, they say. “In Covid days, we hardly got a moment to rest. We were busy throughout the day. There is not much to do these days, so we are all relaxed,” said a worker. “Suna hain teesra lot ane wala hain (have heard of a third wave),” said one them, adding that he hopes the old times don’t return. The Covid dead here included an eight-day-old child and a 66-year-old. The child’s parents were from Saoner. The Muslim and Christian graveyards are located opposite each other at Jaripatka. Akram Ali Ghazi digs graves at the Muslim cemetery and Sheena David offers services on the Christian side. “Those days, I dug 5 to 6 graves in a day. Today, there was no burial,” says Ghazi. “I engaged workers for digging, it’s all quite now. During the peak, I had to request others to take up the job, some of them charging hefty amounts. It’s back to normal now. Even during Covid, all I got in hand was Rs500 a burial, after paying other expenses,” says David, whose family lives in the graveyard premises itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/staff-at-crematoria-burial-grounds-finally-rest-in-peace/articleshow/83821582.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Pune||Cheating case: Total value of complaints so far against Pune builder pegged at Rs 48 crore||PUNE: The economic offences wing of the city police on Thursday pegged the total value of the cheating complaints received so far against arrested builder Amit Lunkad at Rs48 crore, while the individual investments were in the range of Rs20 lakh to Rs1 crore. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale told TOI, “We received complaint applications from three more investors today (Thursday), taking the total number of such pleas to 38 and involving an overall amount of Rs48 crore.” Lunkad, a director of the Lunkad Realty firm in Kalyaninagar, is lodged in the temporary jail at Yerawada since Tuesday after a special court (MPID Act) remanded him in magisterial custody following his arrest on Monday evening. He has been accused of promising 14% per annum to 15% per annum returns on fixed deposit investments made by depositors in his firm and failing to deliver on the promise. The builder’s lawyer informed the special court that his client had refunded the dues payable to the five investors initially mentioned in the FIR and was prepared to return money to all those approaching his firm for the same. Subsequently, the police received 33 more complaint applications against Lunkad in the last two days. A senior police officer said, “Though the number of complaint applications is increasing, we have not yet taken a call on approaching the court with a fresh plea for Lunkad’s remand in police custody. We shall wait for the next few days before making this decision.” The police also have, so far, not visited the builder’s Kalyaninagar office in the wake of the builder having refunded money to the five investors mentioned initially. The TOI on Thursday attempted to speak to an official from the Lunkad Realty firm at the police commissioner’s office but he refused to make any comment. The TOI also tried to reach out to Amol Lunkad, one of the other directors in the firm, over the company’s repayment plan to its depositors but all text messages and calls went unanswered. Lawyer submits regular bail plea Senior lawyer Sudhir Shah, representing builder Amit Lunkad, told TOI, “We have submitted a regular bail plea on behalf of our client with the sessions court’s registry on Thursday. According to the prevailing Covid SOPs, our plea will get a registration number on Friday and placed before the special court for issuance of notice to the police and the prosecution for their written say on the matter.” Asked if the police could seek his client’s custodial remand, Shah said, “The special court has once rejected the police’s plea for seven-day custodial remand. Now, they will have to approach the Bombay high court for such a remand.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/total-value-of-complaints-so-far-against-builder-pegged-at-rs-48cr/articleshow/83824026.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Nagappattinam hospital denies patient died of oxygen cut||NAGAPPATTINAM: A 36-year-old Covid-infected man died due to alleged interruption in oxygen supply at the government headquarters hospital in Nagappattinam late on Wednesday. However, the hospital administration denied it saying the death was caused due to dip in his SpO2 level. G Rajesh of Nagore, who passed away around 10 pm, was admitted to the hospital on June 12 with a low SpO2 level, according to his brother-in-law R Sudhakar. “After nearly 12 days of treatment, his health condition was slowly improving. We were hoping for his recovery, but there was a sudden malfunction in the oxygen supply system in the hospital. As soon as the supply stopped, his health condition deteriorated leading to his death,” he alleged. Sudhakar also claimed that the interruption in oxygen supply lasted an hour leaving more than 20 patients gasping for breath. He alleged that negligence on the part of the hospital administration had cost Rajesh his life. Denying the charge, Dr V Vishwanathan, dean of the under-construction Nagappattinam medical college hospital, who is in charge of the GH, told TOI: “Oxygen supply was uninterrupted in the hospital. There were 20 patients receiving oxygen in the hospital at that time. The patient was sick when he was admitted. His health condition deteriorated and he died.” Rajesh is survived by his wife R Subashini, 34, and two daughters aged 10 and four. Nagappattinam collector A Arun Thamburaj visited the hospital and inquired about the matter with doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/gh-denies-patient-died-of-oxygen-cut/articleshow/83823998.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Covid fear prevents cancer patients from seeing doctors, taking timely treatment||NAGPUR: Many cancer suspects and those already undergoing treatment have reportedly developed advanced stage of the disease after their investigations, evaluations and therapies got abruptly discontinued due to travel restrictions imposed in March last year to keep Covid in check. Many patients, fearing Covid, also decided to postpone doctors’ visits for follow-ups after the first visit or delayed first consultation in hope that the pandemic would ebb. Oncosurgeon Dr Sudhir Deshmukh categorized such sufferers as those already undergoing treatment, new suspects and Covid patients whose chest CT scan and other investigations showed indications of cancer which was waiting to be diagnosed. “Many missed their scheduled chemotherapies and such treatments due to unavailability of transportation, fearing corona or other lockdown hurdles,” said Dr Deshmukh who is also president of Nagpur Surgical Association. Dr Deshmukh further said the suspected patients postponed their treatment by 3-4 weeks due to travel restrictions and Covid fear. “A 32-year-old woman had come to me around two months ago suspecting cancer. I had asked her to come back after 10 days for proper evaluations and detailed investigations. She did not turn up for several days. Later, she was diagnosed with cancer,” he said. “Few patients were suspected of having cancer during Covid investigations but their treatment could start only after they recovered from the viral infection,” he said adding that chronic diseases must not be ignored for any reasons. Oncophysician Dr Vaibhav Choudhary, head of cancer department at Wockhardt Hospital, said Covid restrictions hampered general screening, wellness and other check-ups, leading to drop in early detection of cases. “Surgery is curative if the disease is operable. But delays often make it inoperable. We have witnessed stage IV cancer at an early investigation when the cancer is more symptomatic and advanced,” he said. “The delays or discontinuation of treatment make many patients ineligible for chemotherapy too. The adjuvant therapies should follow the surgeries but it cannot be postponed inordinately,” said Dr Choudhary and added, “Now, we are creating awareness about vaccination among cancer patients which will not only help prevent Covid but also not interrupt their treatment.” Minimal access and cancer surgeon Dr Prachi Mahajan said patients, especially with breast cancer and other gastrointestinal malignancies, did not visit doctors due to Covid fears. “They are now presenting with advanced stages in which patient needs more of palliative adjuvant therapies rather than curative surgeries,” she said. Dr BK Sharma, senior honorary consultant, RST Regional cancer hospital, said around 80% of their patients were from rural areas. “They might have been in dilemma about travelling to city but the hospital’s social workers’ team ensured they were motivated to visit. We had organized cancer camps at rural places, engaged Asha workers to motivate patients and also have a mobile van unit visiting the rural places,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-fear-prevents-cancer-patients-from-seeing-docs-taking-timely-treatment/articleshow/83821618.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Flyers testing positive, but no watch on their movement||NAGPUR: Though Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) continues to screen flyers arriving from six Covid hotspot cities, the civic body’s policy of allowing those testing positive to remain in self-isolation may prove disastrous, say experts, citing cases of Delta-plus variant being found in different Indian cities. Flyers testing Covid positive should be kept in government set-up or even hospitalized, if need be, say experts. Air travellers from Ahmedabad, Goa, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Delhi who arrive without mandatory negative RT-PCR report are asked to take Covid test at the airport itself. At least 26 such flyers have tested positive in city so far since May, reveals data disclosed by the NMC. These flyers were asked to go into self-isolation, but the NMC has not ensured they stay in quarantine till their infection period is over. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, “We will remain vigilant. Passengers are not just from Nagpur but other places in the region. We keep tracking them with new variants coming to fore. We are following the government norms.” Doctors in the city said as the number of positive flyers is low, they can be quarantined at government set-up and genome sequencing must be done on their RT-PCR samples. Senior pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat said we need to know the strain such patients are carrying. “Delta-plus variant, if it comes, will be deadly. Now, it is very important to know the enemy and how damaging it can be. We were caught unawares in the second wave because we didn’t know which variant we were fighting with and how virulent it was. Unless such studies are done, we won’t be able to effectively tackle the next wave,” he said. Dr Arbat added that passengers at all entry points — road, rail and air — should be properly screened. A doctor, whose lab is among those testing flyers at Nagpur airport, said the city may again face the same problems like two months ago. “We didn’t know what was happening in Amravati. Later, the virus load shifted to Nagpur and gradually the Delta variant has surfaced with another mutation. We are not aware of the international travel history of flyers coming to Nagpur. They are likely to bring new strain to the city,” the doctor said. Critical care specialist Dr Imran Noor Mohammad said 90% people don’t follow quarantine norms. “Unless they are quarantined at a government facility, containment measure won’t work. Those having international travel trail must be restricted at the entry point itself for 14 days. Samples of those flyers testing positive must be studied for genome sequencing,” he said. Consultant pulmonologist Dr Vikram Rathi said flyers should be placed in quarantine and all their close contacts be traced and tested. “If required, they should be hospitalized,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/flyers-testing-ve-but-no-watch-on-their-movement/articleshow/83821602.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CBI searches premises of Thapar, co ex-directors in Rs 2k-cr loan fraud case||Mumbai: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) searched the premises of former directors of C G Power & Industrial Solutions Ltd (CGPISL) in a Rs 2,435 crore loan fraud case on Thursday and collected documentary evidence for examination. In the FIR filed earlier this week, CBI named C G Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd, former CMD Gautam Thapar, former CEO & MD K N Neelkanth, former ED and CFO Madhav Acharya, former director B Hariharan, former non-executive director Omkar Goswami, former CFO Venkatesh Rammoorthy and unknown public servants. In 2019, C G Power had ousted Thapar as chairman after the fraud was detected. CGPISL had taken loans from a State Bank of India (SBI)-led consortium of 12 banks after allegedly fabricating documents, stated a CBI press release. CGPISL was not reachable for comment. The CBI press note stated they registered the case against the company and its former senior executives, including the CMD, the CEO, the CFO and then its directors along with unknown bank officials, for causing Rs 2,435 crore loss to the consortium. The accused allegedly cheated the consortium by way of diversion of bank funds, sham transactions with related parties, borrowing funds from the bank by misrepresentation, fabricating books of accounts and entries to siphon off funds. In his complaint to the CBI last month, SBI’s general manager (industrial finance branch, Mumbai) Suresh Pareek requested for registering a fraud case against former promoters and directors of CG Power & Industrial Solutions. After examining the details, the CBI registered the case on Tuesday. The Mumbai-based CGPISL is into the management of electrical energy and was earlier a part of Avantha Group, promoted by Gautam Thapar. CGPISL’s power-industrial system facilities are located in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Indonesia and Hungary. In 2019, the company had appointed an independent law firm to inquire about certain suspicious transactions. The inquiry revealed some of its assets were provided as collateral to the bank for unrelated loans. The inquiry also found after obtaining the loans, immediately the money was routed out of the company. It was stated those transactions were allegedly carried out by company executives and key management persons after breaching the rules. When the issue was highlighted in the media, the lenders came together to follow up on the issue after appointing SBI to lead them. In 2019, the SBI-led consortium had appointed a firm to conduct a forensic audit of CGPISL for a period between April 2015 and August 2019. The audit found the accused had allegedly signed the required letter of comfort without authority and certifying the false resolution, which was never passed by the board of directors to siphon off the funds (including the unrelated loan).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-searches-premises-of-thapar-co-ex-directors-in-rs-2k-cr-loan-fraud-case/articleshow/83826218.cms||Vijay V Singh

Goyal was speaking at a seminar organised at the circuit house of the city to mark the conclusion of the Atulya Ganga Yatra. The yatra, which started from Prayagraj on December 16 last year, culminated on Wednesday at Samudrakoop of Jhunsi. Goyal further said that the team, which has undertaken an extensive journey on both the banks of Ganga and mapped several important components including the polluting drains, should share the information with the administration of those districts through which the Ganga passes so that appropriate steps could be taken. He also suggested that the youth of Gram Sabha should be connected in Ganga Yatra following which there will be more awareness among the youth regarding the river and the means to protect it. He suggested preparing a proposal for a mini forest in every village. Distinguished speaker IG KP Singh said that today the need is to clean all the rivers of the Ganga basin, not just Ganga and continuous efforts are being carried out in this direction. "The day is not far when the rivers will be clean," he said. DIG Sarvashresth Tripathi said that the efforts of the nine members of the Atulya Ganga team are like the Bhagirath as these people are contemplating the purity and the aviral (continuous) flow of the Ganges. Colonel (retired) Mike Keshwar laid the outline of the 190-day Ganga Yatra. He told how the journey passed through its various stages. During this, the second phase of the corona epidemic also struck. Many people got infected but some still resolved to complete the journey. Gopal Sharma, a founding member of Incredible Ganga, told how in 1987 he had dreamed of this journey, which has now been fulfilled. He said that it is not only about the cleanliness of the Ganga. Close to 40 per cent of the country’s population lives on the banks of the Ganges or the tributaries of the Ganges. Today, when we talk about saving the Ganga, we talk about the 40 per cent of the population that is living here. The team members also suggested that they feel public participation is necessary for the cleanliness of Ganga. Land should be registered in the name of Ganga and plantation should be done there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/small-forests-to-be-developed-for-environmental-protection/articleshow/83826189.cms||---

Consultation with experts to devise a plan for the training is under way. The programme will be finalised in a few days,” Balakrishnan told TOI. It was revived in the backdrop of the death of a man who was thrashed by a cop at Ethapur in Salem. Director general of police J K Tripathy also convened a video conference with top police officers on Thursday evening over the Salem incident. “Not only police personnel who misbehaved with the public but many who were addicted to alcohol will also be roped in. We want to have a comprehensive programme for each category,” said the IGP who took charge a few weeks ago. He had found after a survey that 95 personnel had poor public relation skills and 102 were addicted to alcohol in the nine districts of the zone including Trichy rural. “Such corrective measures will not happen in one or two days. It should change your belief system and it should become the habit. It will take at least 21 days to develop any habit. So, I am planning for one-month training,” the IGP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ig-revives-corrective-training-for-violent-alcohol-addicted-cops/articleshow/83824033.cms||Gokul Rajendran

Thanjavur district saw incidents of paddy heaps and sacks stacked at DPCs getting spoiled in Wednesday night’s rain at Neivasal, Ponnapur and Vandaiyariruppu. District collector Dinesh Oliver Ponraj convened a meeting with farmers’ association leaders on Thursday to take stock. Raising issues regarding paddy procurement at the 226 DPCs in the district, the farmers appealed to the collector to keep sufficient number of tarpaulin sheets ready to protect the paddy. They said power shortage was disrupting the functioning of DPCs, and demanded battery-operated weighing machines as well as installation of CCTV cameras. The collector promised to take up their demand with the government. Collector Ponraj later told reporters that Thanjavur district procured 7.8lakh metric tonnes of paddy in the 226 DPCs at the rate of 5,000metric tonnes daily. “Steps will be taken to keep the paddy safe and expedite the procurement process in the days to come,” he said. General secretary of Tamizhaga Cauvery Vivasayigal Sangam P R Pandian said lack of proper planning and infrastructure has affected farmers. “Though the southwest monsoon has set here, there is no proper storage facility for the paddy sacks or tarpaulin to cover them at DPCs,” he said. He demanded the central government provide godowns of central warehousing corporations (CWCs) to Tamil Nadu civil supplies corporation (TNCSC) for storing the procured paddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/harvested-paddy-getting-drenched-at-dpcs-farmers/articleshow/83824032.cms||---
---||Delhi||Lack of segregated waste posing Covid-19 threat to garbage pickers||NEW DELHI: It is easy enough perhaps for sanitation workers to sift through dangerous hospital waste from healthcare facilities and Covid care centres, with Central Pollution Control Board mandating colour-coded bins and yellow bags for disposal. But aren’t garbage segregators at risk when handling trash from Covid-isolated households, with soiled masks, gloves and other contaminated stuff mixed with domestic waste? Waste-management experts say the recent Covid wave has affected waste pickers more adversely than last year. Because of this, changes are needed to ensure their safety. As Chitra Mukherjee, the head of advocacy and policy at waste-management NGO Chintan, pointed out, “In the first wave, the severity of Covid was lesser and the isolated houses were marked too. In the recent resurgence, there were no posters at Covid houses and numerous people underwent quarantine without others knowing about it. In these circumstances, the sanitation worker is unknowingly handling Covid waste and risking infection.” Mukherjee also pointed out that safai karamcharis often wear an overused mask or segregate waste without pulling on gloves, putting them at significant risk. “It’s, therefore, important to warn them by designating garbage from isolation houses as Covid waste,” she added. While waste from healthcare and Covid care centres is collected and sent to a common biomedical waste treatment facility, the trash in the form of masks, PPE suits and gloves at the household level is being sent to waste-to-energy plants. To prevent this, Swati Sambyal said a good start would be to not only segregate household garbage into dry and wet stuff, but also into a third category of domestic hazardous waste. Sambyal said, “We need to educate households to segregate waste and instruct RWAs to mandate segregation in colonies into these three categories. This reduces the risk for sanitation workers, who will know which garbage bag has hazardous contents. The workers may also require PPE kits, masks and gloves while handling waste.” The waste-management expert added, “We need to set up systems and infrastructure to handle biomedical and PPE waste from households. At present, everything comes to a dhalao and goes to a centralised facility. Decentralising the process is the need of the hour.” Jai Prakash Chowdhary, general secretary of Safai Sena, a union of sanitation workers, agreed that while there was more awareness about the risks, something had to be done at the household level to prevent exposing garbage handlers to hazardous materials. “In some parts of Delhi, masks are disposed of in separate bags. That makes it easier for sanitation worker,” said Chowdhary. “However, manual segregation is risky and if there is indeed a third wave of Covid-19, we need to consider this danger.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rags-to-risks-story-of-waste-pickers/articleshow/83821696.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Already launched through e-commerce portals, logistics issues had led to the delays in the innovative product arriving in the city. The product, priced at Rs250, is promoted as useful and easy means of testing for symptomatic patients and those who have come in contact with positive patients. Sources in the trade also said that over-the-counter (OTC) products like CoviSelf generally come with a profit margin of 30-45% for the entire chain, with some variation for each player. CoviSelf, which comes with a simple test procedure, had been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) as the only rapid antigen self test kit in the country. The product takes 15 minutes to show the result. Rahul Patil, CEO of Mylab Discovery Solutions, said 30,000 kits have been sent to the Nagpur distributor, which will be available in the market soon. “Symptomatic patients who cannot reach the testing centre will be helped by our kit. They will not only help themselves but others too can take precaution after seeing their results,” he said. The product promotion displays of CoviSelf generally come with an ICMR advisory that negative results of the rapid antigen test should be followed up with a RT-PCR test to rule out infection, and one should remain in home isolation until it is confirmed. The advisory also said that if the test kit suggests positivity, then it should be treated as confirmed report without going for subsequent RT-PCR. Qualified doctor-turned-pharmaceutical stockist Kartik Tanna, whose firm Amtrex Enterprises is the sole distributor for the product, said he has already received advance booking for CoviSelf from 40% of the pharmacies he supplies. “After seeing the initial response, we would start promoting it vigorously via social media and so on. Messages would be sent to all retailers and hospitals too,” said Tanna. “After getting rough data regarding reviews, we can focus on the target audience.” Tanna also said the maximum retail price of Rs250 for CoviSelf will not create a hole in the pocket of commoners. “Not only at home, it can also be taken along during travel, as one may need to test after commuting in public transport or after a gathering attended by a large number of people,” said Tanna. Trade expert Vikrant Darwhekar, whose firm Biosys deals in diagnostic tools, said users of this product must be cautious with it bio-hazard properties and hence dispose it off properly after use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/countrys-first-antigen-self-test-kit-soon-in-city/articleshow/83821672.cms||Soumitra Bose

The six-foot deep swimming pool, established in the Nachiyarthoppu garden with support from devotees and donors, is spread over 400sqft. Temple officials said that they had employed their workforce to minimise the labour costs. HR&CE revamped an underutilised borewell to draw water for filling the pool that can accommodate 50,000 litres of water. Two motors will be used to fill and drain water. The used water will be drained to the temple garden. Granite stones were used to establish a ramp for a length of 25ft to help the jumbo enter the pool. “During summer, Akila has to be given a proper bath at least two times a day to keep her relaxed. During trial runs in the swimming pool, she refused to come out of it,” Se Mariappan, assistant commissioner, Thiruvanaikoil temple said. The swimming pool was established in 25 days at a cost of Rs 3.5 lakh of which 75% was provided by donors. HR&CE has also provided a walking track for Akila in the adjacent garden dotted with coconut trees. The 19-year-old Akila holds a special place among the devotees and locals as she socialises well. It is to be noted that Akila already has a Rs 1 lakh worth shower facility at her shed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/temple-jumbo-akila-gets-exclusive-pool/articleshow/83824049.cms||---
---||Trichy||Long wait for Covaxin second dose continues in Trichy||TRICHY: The waiting time for the second dose of Covaxin, after the due date, for people in the district has been getting longer by weeks. Although the district only receives a limited stock, there are many people who prefer Covaxin for their first dose which is putting those who wait for their second jab in the lurch. Since only limited centres have Covaxin, there is crowding at these centres. Till now, only 30% of the total vaccines allotted for the district by the directorate of health services was Covaxin. 5,400 to 6,200 Covaxin doses were available the district in the two recent allotments in the last week. There is a perception among locals, particularly among senior citizens, that Covaxin has lesser side effects. Apart from it, the waiting period between two dosages is only a month and those who have no plans to go abroad were preferring it. As there are people who are waiting for their second dose, the vaccination camps offer no separate queues for them. A large number of beneficiaries in the exclusive Covaxin camps were taking the first dose. A section of people waiting for their second jab on seeing the serpentine queues return home and prefer to try later. “It has been two weeks since I have been trying to get my second dose of Covaxin. I had tried the camps organised in the city but the tokens were exhausted quickly,” said G Gnanavelan, an IT worker from Samayapuram. As a large number of beneficiaries getting the first jab were senior citizens, health officials said that they were unable to reserve the doses for second jab takers. As only 40-50% of vaccines received is allotted for the city, residents opined that tokens were exhausted within a few hours as people were desperate to get vaccinated after the second wave. “We cannot wait for the second dose takers to come and also cannot deny vaccines for those coming for the first dose. As there is a request, we will definitely consider a separate queue and health staff to vaccinate people waiting for their second dose of Covaxin in the camps,” a senior health official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/long-wait-for-covaxin-2nddose-continues/articleshow/83824036.cms||Deepak Karthik

Police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said, “We have given two QR codes each to 32 police stations and 27 traffic divisions to collect the fine amounts through online means, such as debit or credit cards and e-wallets. The new facility helps in maintaining accounts of the fine collected on a daily basis.” The violators now have two options to pay the fine — either via QR code or in cash and obtain receipts. “We will start encouraging the violators to use the online means,” Gupta told TOI.“We had started collecting fines, on behalf of the Pune Municipal Corporation, from people not wearing face masks following the outbreak of Covid last year. Policemen often faced problems if violators were not having cash to pay the fine of Rs 500,” he said.“The policemen then started using shorter means, such as asking the violators to transfer cash via online for instance in a shop owner’s bank account. The policemen then collected cash from these persons and deposited it with the civic body. We then decided to launch the QR code system,” he said.Senior inspector Dilip Shinde from the Koregaon Park police said, “Some people would wonder if the fines collected are going to the PMC kitty on seeing policemen and special officers accepting the penalties via online mode in their personal bank accounts. The QR code will stop such fears.” Cyber expert Riyaz Nadaf said, “Accepting fines through the QR code system is easier and a transparent process. The manual system of issuing receipts to violators should be stopped because there is a fear that one can come in contact with the Covid-19 virus while handing over a fine in cash and accepting receipt. In the new system, the chance of coming in contact with the virus is less.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-launch-qr-code-system-to-collect-fines-from-face-mask-rule-violators/articleshow/83824038.cms||Asseem Shaikh

While not operational yet, final tests will be carried out over the next month, with the tower expected to be operational by August — the same time as the smog tower will be inaugurated at Connaught Place, officials claimed. Standing at a height of 25 meters, the tower has been built using Adaptive Clean Air Network (ACAN) technology, in collaboration with the University of Minnesota and will be releasing 864 m3/s of clean air every second, influencing a total area of 1 sq km, an official said. “The concept is to utilise a downdraft flow of air, which replaces the updraft technology Solar Assisted Large-Scale Cleaning System (SALSCS). The clean air can be delivered directly at the ground-level to benefit local residents. It requires a compact land area of only 20m x 20m, in addition to safety and utility area,” said Rajib Mondal, assistant vice-president (operations) at Tata Projects. Funded by the Centre, the tower has been built in collaboration with IIT-Bombay and University of Minnesota. Tata Projects claimed the total air flow through the ACAN system is estimated to be 960 m3/s, with a system filtration efficiency of 90%. “The Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) will be 864 m3/s. Based on large-eddy simulations (LES), which is not specific to any site, proposed system performance is evaluated and it is found that suspended particulate matter is reduced by 72% to 83% at a distance of 70m from the tower. This, along with continuous operational and flow of air, will benefit the local residents. One can argue that reduction in PM 2.5 exposure results in improved health outcomes that can be translated into other related benefits,” said Mondal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/anand-vihar-gets-smog-tower-will-be-operational-by-august/articleshow/83821711.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

This will come into effect from Friday, as the turnout for vaccination has been increasing every day in the city even without much promotion. As there was only one centre for each of the four zones so far, people belonging to the wards from 15 to 18 in each of the zones had been depending on the centres that are nearer to them. All the vaccination centres have been witnessing good crowds despite the poor promotion. Meanwhile, often medical professionals, including nurses posted at the centres, had to face the wrath of people when they were denied tokens due to the lack of vaccine stocks. The civic body officials under pressure have identified three vaccination centres for each of the four zones. Schools and colleges in the corporation zones were also chosen as vaccine centres. “Decentralisation is the best method to reduce the crowd within the ward they belong to. As we are getting doses on alternative days, a long-term plan is needed,” a medical professional said. While there are 74 corporation schools in the city, the civic body was approached by only a few schools to utilise their campus for vaccination. Corporation sources said it restricted the number of vaccination centres owing to the lack of health workers. To overcome the shortage, the civic body was told to make use of trained nursing students from private nursing colleges as done by NGOs at vaccination camps. “We will disclose the locations of vaccination camps in advance, besides taking measures to streamline the crowd,” S Sivasubramanian, commissioner, Trichy Corporation, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/as-crowds-grow-trichy-increases-vaccine-centres/articleshow/83824039.cms||Deepak Karthik

Many principals said they have conducted meetings with admission committees and head of various departments to work out admission details. Since the process will be online, several colleges are going to launch separate websites for admission so that applicants do not face any problem and the process is not delayed. “If the results are published on time then we can start accepting applications from the first week of August. If there is any other notification from the higher education department then we might have to make necessary changes,” said Siuli Sarkar, principal of Lady Brabourne College. In pre-pandemic times colleges would start accepting applications by the end of May and new session would commence in July. Last year, pandemic forced boards to cancel examinations which delayed the admission to UG courses. This year, too, CBSE, ISC and HS have cancelled the Class-XII examinations and using an alternative formula to evaluate the students. They have claimed to publish the results by end of July. “If all the boards publish results by the end of July, colleges can start accepting applications from the first week of August. If the entire process can be wrapped in four to six weeks, both students and teachers will get some more time to complete the syllabus,” said Tapan Kumar Poddar, president of the Calcutta University chapter of All Bengal Principals’ Council and principal of Vivekananda College.

South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has issued a list of 93 localities from where only segregated waste will be lifted from September. Trainers and officials from the sanitation department will hold meetings with the residents till July 10 following which phase-wise enforcement will be carried out in West zone’s 10 wards. The areas include Janakpuri, Rajouri Garden, Subhash Nagar, Tilak Nagar and Punjabi Bagh. The West zone administration issued an order on Tuesday asking 93 residential colonies to provide segregated wet and dry waste. A senior official overseeing the waste management said SDMC would stop collecting mixed waste from these areas. “Although it is mandatory to provide municipal solid waste in segregated form as per Delhi Solid Waste Management Bye Laws 2016, the corporation will first carry out an awareness and training campaign,” he added. The campaign will be carried out between June 24 and July 10. An official said that after the campaign, all 10 wards would be declared compliant with the segregation rules. “Earlier, this campaign was run in Najafgarh and West zones, but had faced resistance due to penal provisions. The implementation was disrupted by the pandemic.” The order includes 11 colonies in Punjabi Bagh’s Ward 2, four in Raja Garden’s ward 3, 15 in Rajouri Garden’s Ward 5, 11 in Subhash Nagar’s Ward 9, 10 in Nangal Raya’s Ward 10, 11 in Keshopur’s Ward 12, one in Tilak Nagar’s Ward 13, eight in Janakpuri West’s Ward 15, seven in Janakpuri South’s Ward 16 and 15 in Vikaspuri’s Ward 20. Some of the selected RWAs are West Punjabi Bagh, Punjabi Bagh Extension, Raja Garden, and those representing various blocks of Rajouri Garden and Hari Nagar. Delhi currently generates 12,350 tonne solid waste daily, out of which 55% ends up in three overflowing landfill sites in Okhla, Ghazipur and Bhalswa. Moreover, it is estimated that only 85% of the generated waste is collected by the corporations. Common household waste comprises of wet compostable waste like leftover food items; dry waste like plastic bottles, bags; and hazardous components like sanitary napkins, diapers, syringes. Out of the total waste collected, about 79% is wet waste and 21% dry, a large part of which can be recycled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/south-corpn-to-resume-waste-segregation-in-93-localities/articleshow/83821852.cms||Paras Singh

The state public prosecutor Deepak Thakare informed the HC that over 2,053 people received fake Covid vaccination shots, and 8 persons were arrested so far, with 400 witness statements recorded by police investigating the cases registered. Thakare showed a rough chart. It said in Malad (W), 30 people got fake-jabbed on May 25, 122 in the next two days in Thane, and 514 in Borivli (W). At Lower Parel on May 29-30, 207 persons and then 390 at Hiranandani Heritage in Kandivli on May 30 fell prey to fake shots. On June 1, at Andheri (W), 150 were ‘vaccinated’, around 200 in Khar on June 3, around 225 in Borivli (W) and then again in Andheri (W) on June 6, 220 persons were given shots at nine such camps. Senior civic counsel Anil Sakhare said when people realised certificates were from 3 different hospitals in one camp, BMC started questioning the hospitals. The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni expressed its anxiety over the issue and instructed BMC to find out what was the effect of this “fake vaccine” on people. “Have to do tests? Do they have antibodies? Were they given saline or water?” the bench asked and said, “They should be taken care of now.” The HC asked, “Did none of the society members suspect anything?” —||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/spell-out-new-guidelines-on-camps-in-mumbai-hc-to-state-bmc/articleshow/83826328.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Sparse in praise, he once said son’s pic stood apart||Thiruvananthapuram: Photographer Sivan, who was always measured in his praise for his children, once gave the biggest compliment to Santosh Sivan. He told one of his friends that among the pictures of his wife Chandramani, it was Santosh's photos that stood apart. There was something about it. "I felt so happy to hear it from him, our mother had passed away and he was looking at old pictures when he said this," says Santosh. Sivan was always a family man, moving around with his wife and children in their Volkswagen car. He took the children to places where he went for assignments and would tell them about culture and society. Even with the pictures on calendars, he would trigger the imagination of his children. When he began his studio at Statue, he wanted someone among his sons to help him. "Achan was my Guru. When I was a student, he would send me to take group photos in Women's college and other colleges. We would actively discuss technological innovations. He was so updated about it,'' says Santosh Sivan. Decades ago, the city, its people and the images shaped the destiny of Sivan. An old Veltaflex camera dotted with some holes and a manual for exposure; a young Sivan who desperately wanted to be a photographer couldn't make much out of the gift he had received from one of the houses where he would go and sing, regularly at noon. The family was so impressed that they suggested he became a musician. Sivan barely showed any interest, although he had imbibed skills in painting and music from his mother, Bhavani Amma. It was then that the family head gifted him a camera. Sivan fiddled with it for days, taped the holes and knew that it was ready for use. The sole guide to him in photography was an article in which he read that photography came naturally to painters. He knew painting, so photography should come, the callow mind assured him. There was another challenge for him. To take eight pictures in a single exposure, and he needed a film roll. They placed bets on ball badminton game, he won the bet and he soon bought a roll of film from a studio opposite the Secretariat. An untrained, ignorant, but passionate guy was ready for his first photograph. A group of Tamil people living in front of a theatre piqued his interest. They were kind to the photographer. Some of them would come to his house, where his mother would feed them and give them oil and a soap bar. In gratitude, they didn't mind him focusing on their lives. The photos came out good, he was thrilled. He rushed to a daily where he was told that the photographs were too brilliant to be published. They handed him a cheque of Rs 90 and a piece of priceless advice; "never ever think of doing another job". Sivan followed the advice verbatim. "He was born to be a photographer. There was always something special about his photographs. We would easily know it was Sivan's photo. While shooting for Chemmen, we would never know when he would be taking pictures. Such was his craft. He had so much depth of knowledge in cinema and photography," says actor Madhu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sparse-in-praise-he-once-said-sons-pic-stood-apart/articleshow/83821885.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Goa||‘Channel below Borim bridge safe’||Ponda: A study has revealed that the river channel below the Borim bridge is safe for navigation of river vessels. A Mumbai-based agency conducted the study under supervision of hydrographic surveyor of the Captain of Ports (CoP) Ram Asare Gupta. The study revealed that the fallen span lies on the river bed over 8m deep during the low tide and cannot affect marine vessels navigating through the channel. A 60m-long span of the 50-year-old Bailey bridge at Borim had collapsed recently raising concerns that the span could touch the bottom of marine vessels passing over it. Following the incident, CoP also had asked the marine vessels to avoid passing through the channel. Vishwamber Bhende, an executive engineer of the water division, Margao, said the survey had used sophisticated equipment – Single Bean Eco Sounder to ascertain the exact position of the span underneath. Another source added that any object at 8m depth cannot affect even a fully loaded barge as the lower portion of a loaded barge goes only 2.7m deep. A 33KVA electricity cable that was also seen hanging and posing a threat to marine vessels has also been cut off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/channel-below-borim-bridge-safe/articleshow/83824179.cms||---

The students said that they had not performed so well in their school exams but they would have done better in boards because they had worked very hard in the last couple of months. But since the marks will be drawn up on the basis of school performance, they might be hit. But, they agreed that in these times, this is the best that the boards could have done. “My performance in IX-X was not so good but I have improved my studies for the boards. So, I could have got a better score had I written the ISC. I am expecting to score 90%,” said Sarah Roy, an ISC humanities candidate of La Martiniere for Girls, who has secured admission in Trinity Western University, Canada. Audrija Dutta, an ICSE candidate from Modern High School for Girls, felt that she would never experience the thrill of writing her first board exam and get external examiners to assess her answers. “I am a tad disappointed. But I am lucky that I am in Class X and do not have the apprehensions that an ISC student would be facing,” she said. Some students who had applied abroad got their schools to give them a predicted score that they could send to the foreign universities. Take the case of Darsh Chopra, a CBSE XII student who has secured admission in Purdue University with mathematics and statistics. “My predicted score was 93-94%. I know where I stand but I hope the final outcome of the calculations would remain there too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-fret-over-no-exam-boards/articleshow/83821920.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Delhi||Genome sequencing lab at Delhi's Lok Nayak Hospital from July to identify Covid-19 strains||NEW DELHI: To identify variants of coronavirus, a genome sequencing laboratory is likely to start at Lok Nayak Hospital by the first week of July. The machine required for genetic sequencing has already been imported from Singapore, officials said. Earlier this month, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that two genome sequencing laboratories to identify variants of coronavirus will come up at Lok Nayak Hospital and Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. Setting up of these two laboratories is part of the Delhi government’s preparations to tackle a possible third wave of coronavirus, which many feel may be triggered by the Delta plus variant that has been declared as a “variant of concern” by the Union health ministry. Around 40 cases of the Delta plus variant have been detected sporadically in Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh. “We are planning to start the genome sequencing lab by the first week of July. We have virology and microbiology departments here so we already have the manpower. There are 10-15 ICMR projects going on at the hospital so we have the scientists here to carry out research,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, the medical director of the hospital. He added that an order for the genome sequencing machine was placed by them two months ago. “We realised the need for this machine when UK and Brazil variants were reported,” Dr Kumar said. Lok Nayak Hospital was designated for Covid-19 management during the first and the second wave. During this period, the hospital treated several patients, most of them with history of travel to other countries, who were confirmed positive for Covid-19 caused by the variants of SARS-CoV2 that were identified first in the UK and Brazil. Genome sequencing allows tracking of small mutations in SARS-CoV2 virus so that chains of transmission can be identified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/genome-sequencing-lab-to-identify-virus-strains-at-lok-nayak-from-july/articleshow/83821909.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Nearly 5 crore illiterates in Uttar Pradesh to be taught to read & write under Padhna Likhna Abhiyan||PRAYAGRAJ: With an aim to improve the literacy rate of the state, the government has decided to make the population of 4.82 crore illiterate people of the state, aged 15 years and above, literate. Through the active participation of the serving and retired teachers, shikshamitras, students, cadets of NCC and volunteers of NSS across the state, the state government is gearing up to teach this large population to read and write. This mission will be undertaken across the state under the ‘Padhna Likhna Abhiyan’ or PLA scheme launched by the central government. Although, the scheme was launched in 2020-21 itself, nothing substantial was done owing to the outbreak of the pandemic. Now, with the Covid-19 situation under considerable control, the state basic education department has begun preparations to undertake this drive with renewed zeal. As per the 2011 census, there are 4.82 crore illiterate persons in UP, aged 15 years and above. Moradabad, Sitapur and Prayagraj have the lowest literacy rate among the 75 districts of the state. Moradabad has around 14.55 lakh illiterate persons aged above 15 years, while Sitapur has a population of 12.74 lakh illiterate persons, and Prayagraj has 12.62 lakh illiterates. “Under this mission, after identifying the illiterate persons, they will be taught to read and write with the help of volunteers and teachers,” said basic shiksha adhikari (BSA), Prayagraj, Sanjay Kumar Kushwaha. He added that a list of illiterate people in the district, aged 15 years and above, was being compiled, and further steps would be taken in accordance with the state government orders. For this mega mission, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has prepared a dedicated 120-hour course material which aims at transforming illiterates into literates. The state government can even get its own course prepared from SCERT as per the guidelines issued by the central government. A senior official of the basic education department informed that this would be done by forming small groups of eight to 10 illiterate persons in the targeted area, and teaching them the course in four months’ time. In order to achieve eradication of illiteracy, this scheme of Adult Education (Padhna Likhna Abhiyan) will focus on the basic literacy component. The programme will specially focus on women, people from SC/ST communities, minorities, other disadvantaged groups and aspirational districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/nearly-5-crore-illiterates-in-up-to-be-taught-to-read-write-under-padhna-likhna-abhiyan/articleshow/83826314.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Stranded in Karachi, yet 2 brothers attend school in Bhopal||NAGPUR: Mohammed Taha has sought a special permission to join the online classes slightly late. It’s 7.15am in Karachi while his school, which is in Bhopal, commences at 8.30 in the morning. Both Taha, a Std VIII student, and his younger brother Mohammed Talha, are in Karachi since March. Though left stranded in Pakistan after the borders with India again closed due to Covid, both haven’t missed their classes. With the pandemic spurring more innovation in education, online classes have not only provided option for brick and mortar schools but also made borders irrelevant. Their father Mohammed Faisal has a business in UAE. His family including wife who is a Pakistani citizen and their two children live in Bhopal — which is Faisal’s hometown. In March, Faisal’s wife and the two kids went to Karachi seeking a visa under a special case as her father was suffering from a heart disease. Faisal joined them later. Since the first wave of the pandemic, hundreds have remained stranded and also repatriated in batches from time-to-time. Notwithstanding the closures, the travel across the borders has continued with more people getting stranded and sent back. A batch of 400 is slated to return on June 28, but in Faisal’s family only his son Taha’s name is on the list. He has mailed the embassy requesting other names to be included. As the family waits for its turn to return, one thing that has continued as usual is the children’s education. The brothers are conveniently attending the school back at home in Bhopal. “We had requested the teacher to allow us late, but the delay is not beyond some minutes,” says Taha. “Our school was going on when we reached Pakistan. Vacations started a few days after the bridge classes. We started attending the new session from Karachi. This makes it almost a month of online classes from Karachi,” he says. Taha’s subjects include English, social studies, maths, science, Hindi and Sanskrit. “The chapters include earth’s structure, democracy, and in Sanskrit it is mainly grammar,” he says. “Mine are maths, English, EVS and Hindi,” says Talha, the younger one. “The experience so far has been good,” say the brothers and add that none of the classmates ask about Pakistan but other friends do. “The class teacher knows that we are in Pakistan, and she is fully cooperating,” said their mother. Meanwhile, Faisal has sent is documents to the Indian embassy and waits for their turn to return. “Even if online classes are going on, they will have to return for other formalities,” says Faisal whose rest of the family including mother is in India. There are a number of others in whose case names of some or other family members are missing. They taken to Twitter to air their grievance. One of them, Humayun Shaukat, tweets, “My wife is a NORI holder. Her name is not on the list but that of my children are. High Commission of India is not picking calls,” says another tweet. Among the 400 who are set to cross the border, include 10-month-old Riyansh Udasi and his mother Sonya. TOI has reported about their case regularly. The child was conceived in India and born in Pakistan, leading to complications in his return after borders were shut. Rajesh Jhambia of Sindhi Hindi Panchayat says it’s a positive step from Indian government and now Pakistan too should initiate repatriation of its citizens stranded here. Umesh Kewalramani had gone to meet his ailing father who was in last stage of cancer in December. “The plan was to bring him back but his condition worsened and travel was not possible. He passed away later on,” said Kewalramani. He had gone with his wife and two children on a no-objection return to India (NORI) visa. As they return, the airline officials allowed only the wife and children saying there were some problems in his documents. He now looks forward to returning on June 28. Gurindo from Mumbai had gone to Sukkur town in Sindh from Punjab to attend his brother’s wedding and hold his son’s thread ceremony in November. He is also slated to return on June 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stranded-in-karachi-yet-2-brothers-attend-school-in-bhopal/articleshow/83821889.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Bareilly||On the run for 18 years, kingpin of Bawariya gang held from Rajasthan||BAREILLY: Arrested in 2002 while committing a robbery in Sirouli town of Bareilly district, Rajesh — the kingpin of a notorious Bawariya (a nomadic tribe) gang — who had escaped in 2003, was on Wednesday nabbed in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur district where he had been living with a changed identity and had even managed to get an Aadhaar card issued to his name. Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan had announced a cash reward of Rs 25,000 on information leading to his arrest. Rajesh alias Matru, now 42, was booked under sections 394 (voluntarily causing hurt while committing robbery) and during investigation, a woman named Mamta, who claimed herself to be his wife, applied for his bail in 2002. The ID proof recovered from Rajesh, which showed the address of Powayan in Shahjahanpur, couldn’t be verified and section 420 (cheating) was also slapped against Rajesh and his bail plea was also rejected. On May 7, 2003, Rajesh managed to escape from police custody while he was brought to the court for a hearing in Aonla. Another FIR was registered against him under sections 223 (escape from confinement or custody negligently suffered by a public servant) and 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) at Aonla police station. Despite several efforts, he was never arrested again. He was arrested from Kachchi Basti locality in Bharatpur area of Rajasthan by a team of Aonla police who went there in plain clothes. Divulging details about the operation, additional SP (rural) Rajkumar Agarwal told TOI, “We were working on all the pending cases and found that Rajesh alias Matru had been absconding for nearly 18 years. This was a big challenge as we didn’t have his recent photograph. So we collected information about the marks on his body from jail records. Multiple teams were deployed for the operation. All his records were scanned when we found that Mamta had applied for his bail application in 2002. We tried searching for Mamta in the Powayan area of Shahjahanpur and managed to find her after over a week. She said that Rajesh was married to her cousin and lives in Rajasthan. The information was correct and we found our man. “He was working as a labourer as a cover-up and we have also recovered a country-made pistol from him, which suggests that he might still have been involved in criminal activities. He has been sent to jail,” the ASP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/on-the-run-for-18-years-kingpin-of-bawariya-gang-held-from-rajasthan/articleshow/83814401.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Interactive sessions help ramp up vaccination in rural areas||PRAYAGRAJ: Joint teams of health, administration, and education department are holding interactive sessions with rural residents to address their reservations against vaccination at the village and block level. This is being done to speed up vaccination and facilitate the cluster plan which aims to reach out to each and every recipient in villages, blocks and slums of Prayagraj district from July 1. Although the turnout of people during the start of the Near Home Vaccination drive was poor, subsequent interactive sessions, meant to clear the doubts of rural residents with regard to vaccination, yielded fruitful results. As of now, around 75 per cent eligible recipients are turning up at special vaccination centres set up at primary schools, gram sabha bhawans and panchayat bhawans in 92 villages of six blocks of the district. Joint teams of ASHA/ANM workers, anganwadi workers, teachers, kotedars, panchayat secretaries, teachers and pradhans are visiting the doorsteps of rural recipients and briefing them about the importance of Covid vaccination. Additional chief medical officer and district immunization officer (DIO), Dr Teerath Lal, told TOI, “We are trying our best to encourage the rural population to get vaccinated against the deadly virus. There was hesitancy among villagers initially, but now around 75 per cent of recipients are arriving at vaccination centres to receive the jab.” Data also claimed that on the first day of the launch of Near Home Vaccination (June 21), the number of recipients was 3,214 against the set target of 9,200. However, it later increased to 5,729 and 6,945 on second and third days respectively. Officials of the district health department have set a target of administering around 39.87 lakh beneficiaries, including 27 lakh recipients aged between 18 and 44 years, and 12.87 lakh aged above 45 years. The Covid vaccination drive has undoubtedly gathered pace in the Sangam city. As many as 7,81,324 jabs have already been inoculated to recipients of all age groups till June 23. While 6,52,032 beneficiaries have taken the first dose of vaccine, a total of 1,29,292 recipients have also received the second dose. Officials said the vaccination exercise is currently going on at 90 sites across the district. The ACMO, meanwhile, admitted that the special pink booth for women and the abhibhavak special booth have failed to yield desired results. He, however, said, “On an average, we are covering 15,000-16,000 beneficiaries of all age groups in a single day, and efforts are underway to cover more crowd.” “A total of 16,465 vaccine shots were administered to recipients of all age groups in the past 24 hours, which included 15,977 recipients of the first dose and 488 of the second dose,” said the ACMO, adding, “More and more people are getting themselves registered on the health department portal for vaccination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/interactive-sessions-help-ramp-up-vaccination-in-rural-areas/articleshow/83826352.cms||---

Thursday's FIRs concerned a drive at a Parel based educational centre where 207 staff were given shots, a nationalised bank in Malad where 40 people took jabs and a stocks advisory in Borivali where 514 people were given shots. More than 1700 people have been given jabs, according to data in the FIRs, and the police believe the numbers will rise. The Borivali drive has been the largest so far. The BMC filed a complaint about a camp being conducted at Mansi Share and Stock Advisors on May 26 and 27 where staff and their families were given shots. Mastermind Mahendra Singh and organiser Sanjay Gupta, both already in police custody, have been booked along with two employees of a travel firm, Shrikant Mane and Seema Ahuja, who assisted them. The beneficiaries were charged Rs 1000 per person. This is the second FIR at Borivali in two days-- on Wednesday the police had booked executives from the management of Aditya College along with the gang that carried out a bogus drive in the institute. At Parel, Singh had conducted a camp at Podar Education Centre and collected Rs 2.44 lakh from the beneficiaries. The scam came to light when beneficiaries read newspaper reports. "Many of these people received vaccine certificates with names of different hospitals while some did not receive any certificates at all, which raised suspicion in their minds," said DCP Vijay Patil. Bhoiwada police arrested Mane and Ahuja who assisted with this drive as well, besides three unknown individuals. Mane and Ahuja told the police that they were not earning much in the lockdown as the travel sector was making losses and so they got involved with the vaccination drives. "Shankar Kesri, an official with Podar Education Centre, gave a complaint about vaccination drives being carried out on May 28 and 29 at Parel. The beneficiaries were told they were being administered Covishield. Vaccination certificates mentioned the names of Nanavati and Lifecare Hospitals," said a police official. At Malad, Singh targetted acquaintances he had made at Bank of Baroda's Link Road branch where he held a current and savings account since 2013. "Singh had the staff's trust as he was a member of the Malad Medical Association at that time. After the pandemic struck, he offered help with vaccination for the bank's staff as they were frontline workers," an official said. On April 1, in Singh's presence, 10 of the bank's staff were given shots at a Kandivali hospital and their certificates were generated. A few weeks later, another three employees were given shots at the same hospital but their certificates were not generated. In phases on April 20, April 23 and May 25, another 27 staff and their families were given shots-- some at the Kandivali based hospital and the rest at the Malad branch of the bank-- but again no certificates were not generated. The last drive on May 25 was in the presence of Singh and a paramedic student Kareem Ali. Besides these two, the Bangur Nagar police have booked Dr Manish Tripathi, also accused of procuring vaccines in the Hiranandani Heritage fraud camp. A sum of Rs 30500 was taken from the beneficiaries. They approached the police after reading newspaper reports about the scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-more-firs-in-a-day-in-vaccine-drive-fraud-514-had-got-jabs-in-borivli/articleshow/83826383.cms||Nitasha Natu

The Panchasayar police have registered a case after the victim — identified as Habibul Mondal (28) — alleged that over a dozen persons had assaulted him on charges of committing theft near a local club at Shahid Smriti Colony. The incident took place around 9.30 am on Tuesday. Mondal lodged his complaint a day later after being discharged from the hospital. “The law is strict against any attempt of lynching. We’re investigating the actual circumstances leading up to the incident including personal enmity. The MLC report has been sought in this regard,” said DC (East) Gaurav Lal. According to Mondal, a resident of S block of Shahid Smriti, at least six men accosted him initially and asked him to explain why he was stealing in the area. Mondal claimed some of the accused had personal enmity with him and tried to make false accusations against him. “The accused persons had made an unlawful assembly during Covid restrictions and allegedly wrongfully restrained the complainant before assaulting him. He was treated and eventually discharged from the hospital. The probe is on,” said an investigating officer. Two years ago, rumours about child lifting had led to at least three similar incidents in south suburban and east Kolkata off EM Bypass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/panchasayar-mob-thrashes-man-after-theft-slur/articleshow/83822055.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Drone cameras have been installed across the vital junctions for security purposes. The President is expected to attend several functions and meet his family members and friends during his four-day visit to Kanpur and Kanpur Dehat, his native district. Cops deployed at Kanpur Central railway station NSG and CRPF, besides RPF have deployed special units for the security of the President. An Integrated Command Post has been created at the Circuit house for exchanging information for forces. President Kovind will leave Delhi’s Safdarjung railway station in Presidential train at around 1.30 pm and reach Kanpur at 7 pm. “On the way, the train will make two stop-overs, at Jhinjhak and Rura of Kanpur Dehat, where the President will interact with his old batch-mates from his school days and from early childhood days,” said a Rashtrapati Bhavan release. The stop-overs of Jhinjhak and Rura are close to the President’s birthplace, Paraunkh, where two functions to felicitate him are scheduled on June 27. On June 28, the President will board the train at Kanpur Central railway station to reach Lucknow for his two-day visit there. The next day, he will return to Delhi on a special flight.

After a long gap of 15 years, an incumbent President is making a train journey. The last time was in 2006 when Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam boarded a special train from Delhi to Dehradun to attend a passing out parade of cadets at the Indian Military Academy. The country’s first President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, often undertook train journeys. Soon after taking office as the President, he visited his birthplace Ziradei in Bihar’s Siwan.

Saifful Islam, 40, and Mannan Mollal, 31, who were Bangladeshi nationals working in garment units, often visited Gazi. When Manikandan demanded Gazi to submit the photocopies of his valid documents on Wednesday, the latter gave him a fake Aadhaar card. Immediately, Manikandan asked Gazi to vacate the house. Irked Gazi along with Islam and Mollal assaulted Manikandan and threatened him with dire consequences.

---||Coimbatore||This Vijay Sethupathi is a villain: Coimbatore police||COIMBATORE: The youth who was arrested on Wednesday for pushing a college girl to suicide, was a ganja addict and had a violent streak who would habitually beat college students and extort money. A native of Sivaganga, Vijay Sethupathi alias Kesavakumar, 22, was kicked out of a private college in Coimbatore a few months back for his bad behaviour. But he stayed back with his college friends in the city and continued his acts. In March this year, he was arrested along with his friends for brutally beating four college students demanding money. Police said the victims hail from various places but came to Coimbatore for college studies and were staying in a room at Ramanujam Nagar in Singanallur. On March 13, Keshav and five of his friends barged into the room and started assaulting them. “Keshav, who brandished a knife, assaulted us with a cricket bat and kicked us on our face. They asked us to kneel, thrust a ganja packet in our hands, took videos and threatened that they will complain to the police that we are selling ganja,’’ one of the victims told TOI. The gang snatched away gold chain, laptop, mobile phones, watches, Rs 21,500 cash as well as shirts and pants from the students. Police had booked Keshav and his friends under two counts and arrested three of them, while two managed to obtain bail and one is still at large. It was following the arrest that Keshav’s mother telephoned the college girl and asked for Rs 10,000 to take him out on bail. When the girl refused, the woman abused her. Soon after his release on May 2, Keshav too abused the girl for not parting with the money when he was in jail. He threatened that he would morph her photographs into obscene ones and upload them on the internet. The girl eventually gave him a three-sovereign gold chain and Rs 35,000. When he kept harassing her for more money, she committed suicide on June 13. Subsequently, the Singanallur police arrested Keshav and his mother Mangayarakarasi for abetment of suicide. Police have also got hold of a shocking video where Keshav, along with his roommates, is seen punching another college student repeatedly demanding him to share a video the latter had purportedly taken with his girlfriend. Police have seized two more videos of Keshav, brandishing a sword. Police however said Keshav’s was not a case of sexual abuse and that there were no women victims but for his girlfriend who committed suicide. “During the preliminary interrogation, we came to know that he did not threaten any other women. We have received a few footages of the youth beating others. We are collecting the victims’ details for further investigation,” assistant commissioner of police (law and order, east sub-division) Arun said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/this-vijay-sethupathi-is-a-villain-police/articleshow/83822065.cms||A Subburaj

On Thursday, nadaswaram player K Nanjappan, along with his troop, performed in front of a temple at Chinnavedampatti in the city to attract the attention of authorities towards their plight. “I have been playing nadaswaram for 45 years and never faced a similar situation. Without a source of revenue, we are dependent on the state government’s Covid assistance fund and ration products,” the 60-year-old man told TOI. The players are booked for functions including marriages, temple festivals and ear-piercing ceremonies. They receive the most bookings during the wedding season and based on the revenue earned during those months, manage their expenses for the rest of the year. A troop consists of five players, each of whom earns about Rs 2,000 per function, according to Nanjappan. “But in the last one-and-a-half years, we hardly receiving any bookings. People were scared of the Covid-19 pandemic and were conducting marriages in a simple manner at nearby temples with minimum attendees. So, we were not invited to play. As the months when the lockdown norms were relaxed were not wedding season, we hardly played at four functions.” V Chandra, a 60-year-old nadaswaram player, said that people would book her troop six months in advance. “Now, due to the lockdown, programmes are cancelled at the last minute. We are not even getting 25% of the orders. I could not find work in May. If the lockdown is extended further, it is going to be very difficult for us,” she added. Nanjappan requested the government to arrange loans for the players to survive the tough times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/nadaswaram-thavil-players-out-of-jobs/articleshow/83822072.cms||Nivedha Selvam

A team of city police officials took custody of Richard from Hong Kong and brought him to Vadodara on Thursday. Richard, who has origins in China but is a Canadian citizen, will be produced before the court on Friday. According to the police, after fleeing from the city on April 28, 2011, Richard went to Nepal. He was arrested by the Nepal police but he again fled from their custody and flew to Canada where he got a bogus passport. He used this passport to fly down to Hong Kong. “Richard was then held in a money laundering case in Hong Kong and was jailed for four years in 2012. When the city police learnt about his arrest in Hong Kong, we began the process for his extradition,” the police said. A proper appeal to extradite Richard was made through the Ministry of External Affairs in 2015 and Hong Kong agreed to hand him over to India on February 7, 2018. “Richard had appealed against the extradition order but it got rejected in May 2021. Our team went to Hong Kong and brought him back on Thursday. He will be handed over to NCB (Narcotics Control Bureau),” said Shamsher Singh, Vadodara police commissioner. Richard was arrested by the NCB along with two others in 2008 on Vadodara-Ahmedabad highway with 1.5 kg of methamphetamine — a stimulant drug. He was lodged in Vadodara central jail during the trial. He was brought to SSG Hospital for medical treatment in April 2011 from where he escaped when the guards were having snacks at the food stalls nearby. The escape was pre-planned as Richard fled on a motorbike that was arranged for him. Before his escape, interrogation of Richard had led NCB to Sakhi Organics in Savli where they found 110 kg of methamphetamine. He had convinced Kirit Shah, owner of Sakhi Organics to manufacture methamphetamine for earning quick money. Shah too was nabbed by NCB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/drug-dealer-who-fled-from-custody-extradited-after-10yrs/articleshow/83817602.cms||---

Reviewing the progress of infrastructure development at Karwar under "Project Seabird", along with Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh, the minister said the base will not only further bolster the country's operational military readiness, but also help in augmenting trade, economy and humanitarian aid operations in the region. Already the home base for several frontline warships, including aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, the completion of the ongoing Phase-IIA of Project Seabird will enable Karwar to berth 32 major warships and submarines. The base provides the Navy with both strategic depth and operational flexibility on the western seaboard, especially against Pakistan, while also helping in the endeavour to decongest Mumbai, as was earlier reported by TOI. The Navy has played a key role in enhancing India's ties with its maritime neighbours as well as ensuring stability and security in the Indian Ocean Region in accordance with PM Modi's vision of 'Sagar', he said. He also praised the Navy's efforts in providing humanitarian aid to not just the country, but the entire region during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/funds-no-bar-will-make-karwar-asias-largest-naval-base-rajnath-singh/articleshow/83827690.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cab, bike-taxi fares surge, make travel a nightmare||Kolkata: The fare of a bike taxi ride from Bhawanipur to Ultadanga cost over Rs 300 on Thursday, nearly five times the regular fare. The cab fare from Behala to Sector V at 9am was over Rs 700 nearly twice the usual fare. The peak hour transportation costs clearly have gone beyond the affordability of the middle class. Ever rising fuel costs and an absence of public transport have given a room for fleecing hapless commuters, who are growing exponentially, with offices resuming operations. Transport woes continued to plague the commuters on Thursday with cabs — both app-cabs and metered ones — taking advantage of the massive demand-supply gap. People helplessly waiting for hours for a conveyance has become a common sight in the morning and evening. Some school buses, which were ferrying passengers, were too little for the demand and were over-crowded. “I am now spending almost five to six times what I used to pay normally. But getting conveyance is a nightmare. Most of the time, cabs are not available. Even if I am lucky to get one, the fare is exorbitant,” said Anita Sinha, an employee with a foreign exchange agency at Camac Street. Her office has resumed full-fledged operation, yet coming to office and returning home has become such a big challenge, she said. Gautam Dasgupta, an employee with a retail chain, on Thursday paid Rs 330 to a bike taxi operator. “It is not that the biker wanted higher fare, the app was showing such an exorbitant fare. I used to pay Rs 70-75 for the same trip even in May before the restrictions were imposed,” said Dasgupta. “Higher fuel costs have made trips expensive more than earlier,” said an official of a bike taxi aggregator. “The transportation costs have gone beyond the affordability of middle class daily commuters. A majority of them are forced to go to their workplaces to save their jobs. The job market is in a bad shape. It is a bad time to lose a job. So people are running to their workplaces by whatever means, often by borrowing money,” said Angshuman Adhikari, a transport economist, who has been studying the crisis. Autos, which are allowed to ferry people on health emergencies and vaccinations, are ferrying office-goers at a premium. “From Taratala to Garia, they are demanding anything from Rs 150 to Rs 300 per passenger for a distance less than 8 km,” said Md Akram, an employee with a recovery agent of a bank at Sonarpur. “Mostly, I walk more than 5 km from my home at Akra-Santoshpur and then take a couple of autos to reach my office,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cab-bike-taxi-fares-surge-make-travel-a-nightmare/articleshow/83822102.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kanpur||Doctor, two others booked for overcharging kin of Covid victim||Kanpur: Three persons including doctor of a private hospital were booked on Thursday for overcharging the attendant of a Covid victim after his death, despite warning against overcharging and capping on the bill amount by the state government. A complaint in the matter was lodged by one Atul Dev of H block of Kidwai Nagar on Thursday. The accused doctor has been identified as Pushpendra Gupta, said the police. The doctor and his two associates work at a private hospital located in the Gwaltoli area of the city, the police added. The doctors and their hospital charged Gita Gupta Rs 19,00,000 for Covid-19 treatment in April. The patient passed away on May 16 after allegedly being administered wrong injection. Inspector KK Dikshit, however, said, “After the death of the patient, the family was charged a certain amount. While the family paid the amount, they suspected that the hospital had overcharged them going by the charges laid down by the prevailing government norms. It was when the victim’s son questioned the doctor, he was assaulted and threatened with dire consequences by the accused. The complainant has also accused the doctor of administering the wrong injection to his mother following which she died.” Three persons including a doctor -Pushpendra Gupta, have been charged under Indian Penal Code sections 304 (A) (causing death by negligence), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 352 (assault or use of criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation) and section 56 of disaster management act 2005 (any officer, on whom any duty has been imposed by or under this Act and who ceases or refuses to perform or withdraws himself from the duties of his office shall, unless he has obtained the express written permission of his official superior or has other lawful excuse for so doing, be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine), said the official. “We have launched a probe in the case,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/doctor-two-others-booked-for-overcharging-kin-of-covid-victim/articleshow/83826434.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Dakshineswar reopens with Covid-safety protocols||KOLKATA: Despite the fact that it was Snan Yatra, the usual scene of long queues of devotees turning up to offer puja to Ma Bhavatarini — as goddess Kali is popularly called in the Dakshineshwar temple — which re-opened on Thursday after the May closure due to restrictions, was missing. It was also the foundation day of the temple and it is considered a special day in the annual calendar when thousands turn up for darshan and puja. Masked entry, temperature checks, hand sanitisation, distanced standing areas — right from the gate to main temple and other temples within the sprawling complex — were strictly monitored, though the crowd was thin. Restrictions were there as far as entry to sanctum sanctorum is concerned and devotees could come up to a point outside it to offer puja without flowers and incense sticks. A sanitised basket with sweet boxes were handed over to helpers of priests, who did necessary rituals and handed them back to devotees. People were allowed to visit other temples like the 12 Shiva temples, too, following restrictions but no one was allowed to go to the ghat or Panchavati greens. The temple opened for four hours in morning — from 7am to 11am — and for two and a half hours in the evening — from 4pm to 6.30pm. Restoration is also on in full swing. Shops selling sweets in the arcade outside temple were also allowed to open but the temple kept a vigil on them to ensure that there was no crowding. Rajendra Pratap, who is preparing for his IAS, had come to offer puja. “I have come back from Delhi and am headed to Bihar. I had a ‘mannat’ to fulfil,” he said. “Most of the visitors were locals or those who came by cars. Lack of public transport will remain a problem for many,” said Kushal Chowdhury, temple trustee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dakshineswar-reopens-with-cov-safety-protocols/articleshow/83822156.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

A division bench comprising justices Avinash Shukre and Anil Kilor observed that the government seems to have discriminating with the backward regions like Vidarbha. “The state shall ensure that its reply is filed by utilising additional time given to it and at least three or four days before the next date of hearing after two weeks,” the judges said. According to the petitioners — Nitin Ronghe and Kapil Chandrayan — after expiry of former members’ tenure on April 30, 2020, the government has failed to appoint new members for over a year. Through senior counsel Shreehari Aney and Akshay Sudame, they pointed out deputy CM Ajit Pawar’s statement that the cabinet would reconstitute development boards only if Koshyari accepted proposed names of 12 persons for vacant MLC seats. Earlier, government pleader Ketki Joshi informed that she received a communication from the deputy secretary of planning department that advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhkoni would be pleading the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-flays-govt-over-delay-in-filing-reply-on-vsdbs-reconstitution/articleshow/83822121.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The unit aims to provide support by addressing Covid-19 and mental health-related queries. Organizer of the unit Gladston Xavier, associate professor of Loyola College, said the unit was set up in addition to the control room. As many as 10 volunteers along with two coordinators would work in two shifts from 8am to 7.30pm every day. “We will address issues like people’s fear and misconceptions about the Covid-19 infection and anxiety they are dealing with. There are several uncertainties related to pre and post Covid scenarios and many of them do not even know what to do if tested positive. We would help the public in all these situations,” he said. “In addition to attending calls, we would also be making calls to Covid patients who are isolated in houses to check on their health and to ensure that they have not developed any symptoms. We will follow-up such cases for 14 days from the day they tested positive. We have decided to make at least 70 such calls a day.” “We have roped in volunteers – lecturers and graduates from the master of social work department – for counselling. In case of medical queries, the caller will be connected with doctors,” Xavier said. The unit can be reached at 0422-2201824, 2201825, 2201826, 2201828 and 2201829.

---||Pune||Maharashtra plans offline optional CET for Std XI by early August||PUNE: The offline optional Common Entrance Test (CET) for admission to Std XI in all schools and junior colleges affiliated to Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education will be held two weeks after the SSC board results are declared. Since the results will be declared tentatively by July 15, the CET would be conducted in the last week of July or the first week of August, said a government resolution (GR) issued on Thursday. The decision on a CET was taken after the state board decided to cancel the SSC board exam for the academic year 2020-21. The Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) based single question paper exam will be of two-hour duration. There will be 100 questions in total with 25 marks each dedicated to English, mathematics, science, and social studies. The examination will be based on the state board syllabus. Since the CET is optional, after the result of SSC, the State Board / Examination Council will provide an option to students to enter the CET examination portal. While students of the state board need not pay extra for the exam, the students of other boards would need to pay an examination fee to appear for the CET. During the FYJC admission process, students who have appeared for the CET will be given priority in all the junior colleges based on merit in the CET. This means that in the first phase of the FYJC admission process, the students who have appeared for the CET will be given priority admission according to their merit. Post their admissions, entry will be given to students who have not opted for the CET based on their Std X merit. The work of uploading marks of SSC students is underway. The state is evaluating SSC students on a 50:50 ratio of Std IX and X scores. The state has clarified that all students will get admission in class XI as data for 2020-21 shows 32% of first-year junior college seats were vacant last year after the admission was completed. Std XI admissions for the academic year 2020-21 had stretched to March this year. All SSC students have been promoted to Std XI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-plans-offline-optional-cet-for-std-xi-by-early-aug/articleshow/83842173.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Chandigarh||UK MPs to debate Jaggi detention in House of Commons next week||London: British MPs are going to debate in the House of Commons the detention of Scottish Sikh activist Jagtar Singh Johal in India. Johal’s MP, Martin Docherty-Hughes, has secured a debate in Westminster Hall on June 30 to discuss his ongoing detention in Delhi’s Tihar jail, after successfully tabling a request to the Speaker’s Office. The debate will take place at 4.50 pm local time for one hour and will be broadcast on “BBC Parliament”. A government minister will attend and respond on behalf of the UK government. “The UK government promised ‘extreme action’ in response to the appalling reports of torture faced by my constituent Jagtar Singh Johal. But after more than 1,300 days of detention in India without trial, Jagtar and his family feel let down and forgotten about by Boris Johnson’s government,” Docherty-Hughes told TOI on Wednesday. “I have secured this debate in Parliament to remind ministers that they have a duty to Jagtar as a British citizen. The ‘Free Jaggi’ campaign has the support of a cross-party group of 140 parliamentarians. It’s time now for the foreign secretary to take meaningful action to end Jagtar’s arbitrary detention and bring him home to his family,” he said. Johal (34) — known as Jaggi — from Dumbarton, Scotland, is accused of conspiring in the murders of Hindu right-wing leaders in Punjab, including that of RSS leader Ravinder Gosain, gunned down in October 2017. Johal denies the charges and claims he has been tortured while in police detention. Johal was hooded and forced into a police van whilst out shopping in Rama Mandir, Jalandhar, with his wife on November 4, 2017, just weeks after they got married in Punjab. His wife Gurpeet Kaur has been living in Dumbarton with Johal’s family since April 2019. Johal’s brother Gurpreet Singh Johal, who lives in Dumbarton, told TOI: “I am looking forward to hearing the minister address the concerns raised by his MP and other MPs in Parliament and to hear why the government is not calling for the release of my arbitrarily detained brother.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/uk-mps-to-debate-jaggi-detention-in-house-of-commons-next-week/articleshow/83810523.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Nagpur||Sarus cranes number goes down in Gondia||NAGPUR: With the number of sarus cranes, the tallest of the flying birds in the world, going down in Gondia and adjoining Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh, the NGO, Sustaining Environment and Wildlife Assemblage (SEWA), which is monitoring the birds since 2004, has called for policy-level interventions to save the bird. A joint estimation by SEWA and Gondia forest division between June 13-19, has recorded 88 sarus cranes with a margin of error of 4-5 birds. Of this figure, 39 were in Gondia, followed by 47 in Balaghat and 2 in Bhandara. However, in 2020, 104 sarus cranes were recorded. This included 45 in Gondia, 2 in Bhandara and 1 in Chandrapur, besides 56 in Balaghat district. Gondia and Balaghat is divided by Bagh and Wainganga rivers and the sarus habitat is somewhat similar on both sides and hence the estimation is done on both sides. Gondia and Bhandara are the only two districts in Maharashtra where sarus cranes are found. “If policy-level interventions or a joint action plan to conserve the birds is not prepared, it will meet the same fate as the Great India Bustard (GIB). The GIB has virtually gone extinct in the state,” said Sawan Bahekar, honorary wildlife warden and president of SEWA. On reasons for the decline, Bahekar said, “There is a change in habitat as the small water wetlands are vanishing fast. Due to the illegal excavation of sand from riverbeds their roosting places are being destroyed. Besides, the tall birds are also facing threat from pesticides and electrocution due to powerlines. Destruction of their eggs is also one of the main reasons.” Over 23 teams scanned at least 80 locations in Gondia and 70 in Balaghat. In Bhandara, honorary warden Shahid Pervez a Khan counted two birds. “There are 8-9 newborn chicks every breeding season but there is an equal number of deaths which has almost kept the sarus numbers stable,” says Bahekar. These birds are listed in Schedule IV of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 and are declared as ‘vulnerable’ in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). “We have over 80 ‘Sarus Mitras’ and also honour farmers for their efforts to save these birds. Yet, a conservation action plan is needed to save sarus,” says Mukund Dhurve, honorary wildlife warden of Gondia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sarus-cranes-number-goes-down-in-gondia/articleshow/83822251.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

When a joint team of administration, police and health department reached Nagla Kadheri village in Kasganj district for vaccination on Tuesday, they were met with stiff resistance. Residents hid in their fields, some took shelter on trees and others locked themselves up in their homes. Aadhaar Kumari“We went door-to-door but no one was ready to listen to us,” said tehsildar Ajay Kumar Yadav. No one, but Aadhaar Kumari, that is. When the authorities approached the 96-year-old woman, she was sitting outside her hut. They explained to her the benefits of getting vaccinated and she willingly took the shot while calling out for others to do the same. “After getting vaccinated, she stayed on, talking to residents and telling them not to believe vaccine-related rumours. She told people that she was feeling completely fine despite her age. She also ensured people wore masks and maintained social distancing,” said Yadav, adding that her appeal “worked like magic”. By Wednesday evening, all 176 residents over the age of 18 in the village had taken their shot, said a health department official. Talking to TOI, the nonagenarian said, “I wanted to lead by example. I'm not educated but I know that we can only fight this disease if we are together,” said Aadhaar Kumari, who lives alone since her son abandoned her years ago. Kumari’s ‘pep talk’ seems to have inspired not just Nagla Kadheri, but also residents in nearby villages, who have come forward to take the vaccine in large numbers. “When people in other villages in Soron block heard that everyone in the village had taken the vaccine, including a 96-year-old woman, they were more willing to take the shot,” said the health department official. Over 7,000 people in villages in Soron block have taken their first shot in the last two days, according to Dr Harish Kumar Singh, superintendent of Soron block community health center. “We are thankful to Aadhaar Kumari for helping us out. It was on her appeal that residents voluntarily took their first dose,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/96-yr-old-shows-way-convinces-175-scared-villagers-to-get-the-shot/articleshow/83817358.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore city corporation engineering department to issue vaccine tokens||COIMBATORE: Covid-19 vaccine tokens will now be distributed by the city corporation’s engineering department and sanitation department staff, instead of it being under the sole purview of the sanitation department. Commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara on Thursday ordered distribution of tokens for vaccine at corporation schools by ward junior engineers and zone assistant engineers of the department after complaints poured in from the public that despite waiting from 4am, not all the allotted doses of Covishield and Covaxin were administered. “This led to altercations with supervisors of the sanitation department and police,” said a corporation official. The commissioner told TOI that he had “received complaints of non-officials distributing tokens at the school and sometimes corporation officials not reaching on time to distribute the tokens themselves. So, the main instruction is that only corporation officials must distribute tokens,”. Corporation’s health department officials said when an inquiry was launched into why tokens were not given to the public, supervisors said DMK members bypassed the token system to get vaccine for their dear and near ones. “Not just DMK members, even Congress members harass our supervisors. They come at 9.30am and demand we vaccinate their recommended people before we start vaccinating the public with tokens,” said a senior official. “We can give tokens for only the remaining doses, angering public.” The problem seems most concentrated in added areas in north and east zone, say officials. “On Tuesday, there were complaints about DMK members ensuring that only people with local addresses on their Aadhaar cards and from the same locality got tokens at Cheran Managar Corporation School. This happened at Vellakinar also,” said an official. On Thursday, a scuffle broke out between the public and officials in front of Ondipudur Corporation School after many people waiting since 2am failed to get tokens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-engineering-dept-to-issue-vaccine-tokens/articleshow/83822181.cms||---

Saravanakumar, assistant conservator of forests, said private land owners were allowed to fell 500 silver oak trees on the patta land near Gudalur last October when they approached the authority seeking permission to fell 1,800 oak trees. Pointing out that trees were felled for the past nine months, he said the land owners had cut down 200 native species illegally. After receiving complaints from the local residents, a team of forest officials inspected the land. Subsequently, I Anwardeen, additional principal conservator of forests, placed forest range officers Siva and Kumar, who were on additional duty in the Naduvattam forest range when the trees were felled, forester Dharuma Sakthi and forest guard Narsees Kuttan under suspension. The official said a departmental inquiry against the four was underway. “We have also registered a case against the land owners and timber contractors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tree-felling-4-forest-staff-suspended/articleshow/83822206.cms||---

According to an order released by principal secretary medical education Alok Kumar, Dr Sanjay Kala, acting principal of Government Medical College, Agra has been appointed as principal of GSVM medical college. Dr Kamal has been made principal of Moti Lal Nehru medical college Prayagraj. Dr Kala had earlier held a post of head of general surgery, GSVM medical college. Later, he was made the officiating principal of Government medical college, Agra. To recall, a major scam has surfaced at the GSVM medical college-run Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) hospital wherein Remdesivir injections were issued in the name of dead patients during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. It came to fore during a probe that injections were removed from the store allegedly by the nursing staff in the name of the dead patients. Later, a probe was ordered and a three-member committee of GSVM medical college recommended suspension of sister-in charge of Covid hospital, Manjulika Mishra and pharmacist Nagendra Bajpayi after they were found accused of involvement in the Remdesivir injections scam at LLR hospital. Besides, a show cause notice was issued to eight other nursing staff members. Also to recall, even chief minister Yogi Adityanath had expressed displeasure with Ganesh Shankar Medical College authorities over the reservation of Covid beds at their institute during his visit to the city in the month of May. Sources had informed TOI that the CM reprimanded GSVM medical college authorities for allocating only 350 beds for the Covid patients at the institute which houses 1,700 beds. Meanwhile, chief medical superintendent of LLR Dr Jyoti Saxena was also removed from her posts in wake of anomalies with regard to wrong and delay in data feeding of Covid-19 cases in the district. She has been attached to the health directorate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/gsvm-college-principal-shunted-for-anomalies/articleshow/83826462.cms||---

As per the complaint, the suspect, on the pretext of renting her flat, said he would transfer money to her bank account on May 27 and instead, transferred money out of her account. “The woman, working in a private firm, had posted an advertisement on two property search portals that she wanted to rent out her flat in Rahatni. The fraudster, posing as an Army official officer, called and said he was interested in renting the flat, claiming he was transferred to Pune,” senior inspector Yunus Shaikh said on Thursday. Shaikh said the woman never met the suspect in person. “He said he was in urgent need of a flat and agreed to pay the woman Rs20,000 per month as rent and a refundable deposit of Rs60,000. He asked her to share her bank account details so that he could transfer the money,” he said. “The woman’s son used two e-wallets and forwarded a link to a QR code to the suspect and asked him to scan it and transfer the money to his mother’s account. However, minutes later, the woman received SMS alerts from her bank, informing her that over Rs 1.64 lakh had been debited from her account. That was when she realised, she had been cheated,” Shaikh said. On the delay in filing an FIR, inspector Ajay Waghmare (crime) said, “The woman had submitted complaint applications with the Yerawada and the cybercrime police.

The district administration recently unearthed a Rs 5.80 crore scam in which several ineligible beneficiaries had pocketed the government grants. The ineligible beneficiaries received funds under the marriage grant and Parivarik Labh Yojana. District magistrate Alok Tiwari has directed the chief development officer to recover the funds from ineligible beneficiaries by issuing recovery certificates. According to the district administration sources, a sum of Rs 1.87 crore had been usurped in the marriage grant scheme being run by the social welfare department, backward class welfare department and minorities welfare department. A sum of Rs 3.93 crore was disbursed among ineligible beneficiaries under the Parivarik Labh Yojana . The district administration sources said the matter came to light by the social welfare department when during the verification, ineligible beneficiaries were not found at the given addresses. As many as 1,106 beneficiaries were not found at the given addresses for Parivarik Labh Yojna. Similarly, under marriage grants, as many as 702 beneficiaries were not found at the given addresses. The district magistrate has asked for the list of verification officers who had verified the forms. District magistrate Alok Tiwari said the action to be taken for recovery of funds would be decided by the chief development officer. The bank accounts of ineligible beneficiaries could be seized as the money was transferred to their bank accounts. Meanwhile, a committee headed by ADM (civil Supplies) Basant Agarwal, is sorting out the names of officials who had verified the bona fide of ineligible beneficiaries . The forms are being minutely observed to spot the lekhpals who had made ineligible persons eligible for the funds, the source further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/admin-to-recover-funds-from-ineligible-beneficiaries/articleshow/83826488.cms||---

This was decided at a meeting of Tollywood’s stakeholders with state minister Aroop Biswas, chairperson of Trinamool Congress’ cultural cell and MLA Raj Chakraborty and actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee on Thursday. In the recent past, the Bengali television industry has been plagued with controversy regarding shooting of serials. On June 17, Biswas, Chakraborty and Chatterjee had held a meeting with members of Welfare Association of Television Producers (WATP), Federation of Cine Technicians & Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI), West Bengal Motion Picture Artists Forum and channel heads. While a decision was taken to resume normal shooting from Friday, some issues remained. Exactly a week later, 20 stakeholders met on Thursday. “Shooting has already begun and we have been able to create a good working environment. We heard out everyone at the meeting. While there have been flaws in all quarters, it is pointless to rake up issues from the past and dwell on the bitterness. Since we need each other to work in this industry, it is important to let bygones be bygones,” said Chakraborty, who is also the chairman of the I&CA, Sports and Youth Standing Committee of the state assembly. The most crucial point has been the signing of the long-pending MoU that is expected to rule out all causes of friction while shooting serials. Chakraborty said, “By July 20, WATP will sit separately with FCTWEI and Artists’ Forum to formulate industry guidelines regarding shooting of serials. The three of us will again sit with them in case of disagreements. This MoU will be signed by July 31. The guidelines will also be published in the form of a book,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tolly-to-get-a-rulebook-on-industry-guidelines/articleshow/83822223.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Situation not yet conducive for train resumption: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Commuters continued to block railway tracks and stop special trains when they were not allowed to board them amid growing demand that suburban train services be resumed. CM Mamata Banerjee, however, made it clear that the situation wasn’t yet conducive for suburban trains to resume. After Wednesday’s blockade, south section of Sealdah division witnessed an intense track rage on Thursday with commuters demanding resumption of train services to end their perennial transport woes. The Sealdah south section got crippled for more than four hours because of this blockade. Eastern Railway AGM Aneet Dulat on Thursday wrote to home secretary B P Gopalika and even spoke to him after the unrest and prolonged protests by railway commuters against suspension of local trains. The AGM urged the state government to step in and take necessary action. ER is increasing the number of staff specials from around 420 to around 500. Passengers on Thursday first put up a blockade at Mullickpur between Subhasgram and Baruipur at around 7.45am. A large number of passengers, mostly women, stayed put on the track. GRP and RPF personnel reached the spot to bring situation under control. When police threatened the protesters with forceful eviction, the agitators started pelting stones at police. Vehicles of GRP were vandalised. One police personnel sustained head injuries while some others escaped with minor injuries. Baruipur force led by additional SP Baruipur reached the spot along with IC Baruipur and IC Sonarpur police station. After some persuasion, the blockade was withdrawn. SRP Sealdah, BV Chandrashekhar, said: “The blockade led to suspension of train operation for over four hours. Commuters were demanding resumption of suburban services.” ER spokesperson Ekolabya Chakraborty said, “We are ready to run the services. But it entirely depends on the state government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/situation-not-yet-conducive-for-train-resumption-cm/articleshow/83822164.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu agricultural university studies use of drones in applying nano area liquid||COIMBATORE: The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) is conducting field trials to study the feasibility of using drones to apply nano urea liquid on crops at their agricultural research station in Bhavanisagar area. If drones could be used to apply the fertilizer on several acres, it would be helpful for farmers. Last year, the Indian Farmer Fertilizer Cooperative (Iffco) had developed nano urea liquid that could be sprayed on the foliage. Unlike the commercial urea, which comes in 50kg bags with 46% nitrogen, of which plants absorb only 30%-35%, nano urea liquid comes in 500ml bottle and does not affect the soil’s composition much, said K S Subramanian, director of research and founder head of nanotechnology department, TNAU. Iffco claims that the 500ml bottle could be mixed in 200 litres of water, which would suffice for one acre. The cost of nano urea is yet to be fixed for commercial use in the country, TNAU officials said when asked for a cost comparison. TNAU is studying the effectiveness of using drones by assessing the quantum of increase in yield and health of paddy and maize plants to check how well the nitrogen is absorbed by the leaves “We need to check whether 500ml is actually adequate for one acre, whether the drone can successfully lift and fly around effectively with that load, whether wind will affect the spraying and whether nitrogen is effective for the plant when sprayed from above at this quantum,” Subramanian said. Given the labour shortage, this could be revolutionary for farmers who grow millets, pulses and groundnuts, etc., he said. “Using nanotechnology, we have reduced nitrogen usage and wastage of fertilizers.” Last year, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research had helped conduct field trials of nano urea liquid, which was manually applied in 11,000 locations across the country through Krishi Vigyan Kendras. It was not only easy to use, but also the yield increased by 7% to 8% in comparison to the conventional practice. There weren’t any associated environmental concerns as well. TNAU, which had helped the Union government’s department of biotechnology develop guidelines for the use of nano products in agriculture and food products, has scientifically validated the biosafety of nano urea. Subsequently, the agriculture ministry had notified the product this February. TNAU and Iffco are trying to create more awareness on nano urea liquid through virtual programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tnau-studies-use-of-drones-in-applying-nano-urea-liquid/articleshow/83822172.cms||---

---||Delhi||Four men arrested in Kargil for planning terror act in Delhi||NEW DELHI: In a joint operation with the Intelligence Bureau, the Special Cell of Delhi Police apprehended four men from Kargil on charges of planning and attempting to execute terrorist acts in the capital. The four men are also the prime suspects in the case of the minor explosion near the Israel embassy in January. The quartet apprehended are Aiaz Hussain (28), Nazir Hussain (26), Zulfikar Ali Wazir (25) and Muzammil Hussain (25), all residents of Thang village in Kargil district of Ladakh. While Aiaz claimed to be a former Ramjas College student, another claimed to be an IAS aspirant. While as of now it is unclear if these men matches the suspects of the Israeli embassy blast captured on CCTV cameras and whether the DNA fingerprinting has thrown a match, their involvement is hinted at, according to the cops, from the crucial clue that the phones of two of the suspects were switched off around the time of incident. They had come to Delhi in November last year and left in March, it is learnt. DCP Chinmoy Biswal confirmed the arrests. “Details about the case will be shared in due course,” he said. The four men were produced before a magistrate for remand on Thursday. The operation to nab the quartet was conducted by a team led by Neeraj Thakur, office in charge, Special Cell. Thakur was questioning the suspects till late on Thursday. With the case to be probed by the National Investigation Agency, the suspects will be handed over to them for further investigation. A week ago, NIA announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh each for the identification of two suspects captured on CCTV cameras around the site of the embassy blast. The low-intensity explosion on January 29 caused no casualties or injuries, but damaged the windows of three cars. The day marked the eve of the 29th anniversary of the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between India and Israel. An envelope with “Israeli Ambassador” written on it was recovered from the spot. Inside, a note suggested the blast was in retaliation to the killing of an Iranian military general. However, it was believed that seeming handiwork of Iranians was a ruse meant to deflect attention from the real perpetrators. Sources confirmed the use of ball bearings and ammonium nitrate. On February 13, 2012, the wife of an Israeli diplomat had been targeted by a man who had stuck a magnetic bomb at the rear of her Innova SUV on Aurangzeb Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/four-men-arrested-in-kargil-for-planning-terror-act-in-capital/articleshow/83822458.cms||---

The accused in his bail application has adduced that he was innocent and had not committed any crime. He had been falsely fabricated in the case. Therefore, bail should be granted to him. Sushil Kumar Verma, additional district government counsel, in his pleading countered the statement of the accused and said that victim’s mother had lodged a report and had alleged that Neeraj and Vishal and one Ayush had enticed her minor daughter around 3.3.0 p.m. on February 11, 2021. The ADGC in the girl’s statement recorded under section 164 CrPC had stated that her age was around 15 years and had passed high school. She used to talk on mobile with one Vishal Yadav, who resided near her house. In compliance of parents, order she had stopped talking to Vishal. Vishal then started threatening her. Vishal threatened her to pour acid and kill her. On February 8, 2021 when she was going to her school he intercepted and forcibly took her to his house. There he forcibly established physical relations with her. On February 11, he once again intercepted her when she was going to coaching and sent her with one Neeraj to Gujrat. They had threatened to kill her if she raised an alarm. She had told her tale to one noble person at Daman, who informed the police and Kanpur police brought her back on March 2, 2021. The ADGC pleaded the offence committed by the accused was of serious nature. Therefore, the bail application must be rejected. The judicial official in his order observed that without making any comment on the merits of the case there were no grounds for bail hence bail application was being rejected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/bail-plea-of-rape-accused-rejected-by-pocso-court/articleshow/83826506.cms||---

The decision, which was part of the poll promise of Trinamool Congress, was approved in the cabinet meeting. The CM said that the new Krishak Bandhu card has already been launched, also in accordance with her party’s poll promise, and it will enable the farmers to get Rs 10,000. The new credit card will help students get a credit up to Rs 10 lakh from the banks without personal guarantor, as the state government will provide the guarantee. “It will be for students from Class X onwards. In Class X we have around 12 lakh students and in XII we have over 9 lakh students,” the CM said. There are various schemes for the students like Kanyashree for the female students, Aikyashree for the minority students and Sikshashree for the SC students, the CM said. According to her, the new scheme will also come as a relief for parents of the students. “Earlier, the parents used to sell off their property to fund higher studies of their children, but no more they have to do it now. Parents need not have to worry any more as the project will be launched form June 30.” “From professional courses, diploma to post graduation and PhD and post-doctoral courses, they can pursue their dream with the help of this credit card with a limit of Rs 10 lakh,” the CM said. “It is a soft loan for the students,” she said, adding that the students can refund the money within a period of 15 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/student-credit-card-to-roll-out-by-june-30/articleshow/83822235.cms||Debashis Konar
---||Goa||Plant species unlike any in its genus discovered in South Goa||PANAJI: Scientists and researchers from the University of Calicut, together with their counterparts from the Goa University, have discovered a new plant unlike any other in its genus, at Chandreshwar hills in South Goa. They have named the species ‘Sonerila konkanensis’, referring to the Konkan region where it was discovered. Sonerila konkanensis grows in wet humus and on damp rock crevices, between elevations of 210 and 280m. It is a tuberous species with angular stems, lime green leaves, pale pink flowers and anthers that are acuminate (tapering into a long, drawn-out point) to rostrate (having a beak-like projection). This species is further characterised by its large, leaf-like, persistent bracts that are not reported in any other Sonerila species from India. In fact, Sonerila konkanensis is currently known only from Chandreshwar hills. After vegetative growth and flowering, the tubers undergo a period of dormancy within the humus-rich rock crevices, but develop new shoots when the monsoon arrives. Flowers and fruits have been observed from August to September. Calicut University professor Santhosh Nampy, researcher Resmi, and the researcher from Goa University Akshatra Pracy Fernandes, discovered the species belonging to the family Melastomataceae and the genus Sonerila during field surveys to Chandreshwar hills. They found that it was unlike any of the known species. A total of 90 mature individuals were found. With Chandreshwar hills being a tourist destination, and considering the possibility of further ecological disturbances of this restricted range species, the researchers have provisionally assessed the new species as ‘vulnerable’ according to IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. Details of the species are now published in the international journal, Candollea, of the Conservatory and Botanical Garden of the City of Geneva. “Many plants are being extinguished from Earth due to the exploitation of nature. We discover new plants and conduct an in-depth study into the specialities and conservation requirements,” Nampy said. The researchers said around 50 species of Sonerila were identified from the Western Ghats, one of the major centres of diversity for the genus. They also said it is likely that more populations in similar habitats in the same hill are not yet known and suggested further surveys to determine the exact distribution range of this species.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/plant-species-unlike-any-in-its-genus-discovered-in-south-goa/articleshow/83824406.cms||---

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B has approached the urban development department in Mumbai to allow recruitment for the vacant posts of firefighters in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)’s fire and emergency services department. A senior official from the fire department said that in May 2020, when the pandemic hit the country hard, the Maharashtra government had stalled all recruitments other than in health and police departments. The fire department has sought permission to allow the NMC to recruit 285 firefighters in the vacant posts. At present, the city has only nine fire stations with 55 firefighters. Sources said the department has sanctioned 872 personnel’s posts. Of them, only 174 posts are filled. With the nine fire stations functioning in the city, the department requires at least 611 workforce members. Apart from attending to fire calls, the department also answers many other emergency calls including drowning, building collapses and cleaning of wells. Since NMC’s fire department is the biggest in the region, it is routinely directed to rush outside the city limits to control fires in industrial areas including Butibori and MIDC Hingna (despite both the industrial areas having separate fire stations). Even Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA), whose area is expanding rapidly, does not have its own firefighting force and here too, the department often steps in. With the existing workforce strength, on an average the department attends to approximately 1,000 emergency calls in the city itself. Each firefighter is currently overloaded to the extent of having to carry out the work of three to four personnel at the time of an emergency call, said the senior official. With a lack of firefighters, the department has been using daily wage sanitary workers from the NMC’s solid waste management department. Sources said the practice of using the unskilled workers for attending to emergency calls was unethical. Given the infrastructure development in the city, the NMC is also planning to open at least two new fire stations — at Wathoda and in Rathod Layout in west Nagpur. It is also all set to restart Pachpaoli fire station, which was shut due to its dilapidated building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/55-firefighters-for-7-lakh-city-properties/articleshow/83822316.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

His entire trousseau was destroyed in a fire towards the beginning of the month inside the temple and he and his siblings had to be given the modest gamchha to wear, till his clothes could be redesigned for this special day. Starting with ‘Snan Yatra’, a special period in the Jagannath lore starts. It ends with the 15-day Rathayatra festival. It is said that on his birthday, the Lord is bathed with milk, ghee and Ganga water, so much that he catches cold and fever and is quarantined for 15 days before making a public appearance once again for the Rathayatra. ‘Snan Yatra’ at Kolkata and Mayapur were celebrated on Thursday. While in Kolkata participation was not allowed on the Albert Road premises, in Mayapur, headquarters of Iskcon, and at Rajapur, a few kilometres from where the temple is situated, devotees were allowed in small numbers. In pre-Covid times, ‘Snan Yatra’ saw participation of at least 50,000 people at Mayapur. “We were shocked when the wardrobes with the dresses were destroyed. Luckily, the jewellery was saved. Six leading designers, all Iskcon devotees in the city, worked at a frenetic pace to get the dresses ready,” said vice president of Iskcon Kolkata, Radharaman Das. The portion of the temple destroyed by the fire has been restored. “We did not allow more than 40 at a time at the Mayapur complex but a thin crowd continued to troop in throughout the day. At Rajapur, it was a quiet affair,” said Iskcon Mayapur spokesperson Subrata Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iskcon-kol-observes-snan-yatra-without-devotees/articleshow/83822317.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The track laying work commenced from IIT-K on May 11 and now it has reached up to Kalyanpur Metro Station. Metro engineers are fabricating rails of several meters by welding 18-18 meters long segments. These rail segments are welded with the Rail Welding Machine and then laid down on the track. But metro tracks differ from rail. Metro Track is a complete system, whereas Rail is just a part of that system. The track system comprises elements like Track Plinth, Rail Sheet, Rubber Pad, Fasteners etc other than rails. On Wednesday late night, scissor crossing has been cast near IIT Metro station. This scissor crossing enables a metro train to criss-cross the track while proceeding further. Expressing satisfaction over the pace of track laying work, UPMRC managing director Kumar Keshav said, “Various system contractors have already been deployed in Kanpur and system works are under progress. Track laying is also being executed with a considerable pace. On the mainline of the Kanpur Metro Project, ballast-less track is being laid. Ballast-less track asks for the least maintenance and offers better stability & ride quality than the Ballast Track.” The Metro work is going on at a rapid pace and it is expected that the trial would be carried out in November this year. While the passenger services in Kanpur Metro are very likely to commence in the month of January next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/metro-track-laid-up-to-1km-on-priority-corridor/articleshow/83826523.cms||---

They have moved a complaint with the Huda water department but no action has been taken so far, they alleged. Gurmeet Singh, a resident of Buddanpur village, moved a complaint with the executive engineer (XEN) Huda division-1, asking for appropriate water supply to the area. Residents of gali numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Buddanpur village alleged that they barely had enough water to get through the day and had to visit other areas to get water in buckets, bottles and tubs. Residents also alleged that they sometimes got muddy water. According to them, they had lodged a complaint with the Sector 16 water works but to no avail. Gurmeet said, “Earlier, there was a heavy motor with high horsepower which got faulty and was replaced with a small motor which fails to supply water to the entire area.” Residents said low water pressure is a recurring problem every summer and asked Huda water department to provide a solution. Residents of sectors 12, 12/A and 3 are also facing acute shortage of water supply. President, Lok Sarvhitkari Society R K Aggarwal said he came to know that two motors of the water supply department had developed snags while one motor fell into their own water tank and stopped functioning. He said this led to low water pressure in the residential area. “We have written to officials concerned about the low water supply. Huda must fix the problem on priority basis, considering the need of residents in this summer season,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/glitches-leave-residents-parched/articleshow/83819786.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

The New Jersey-based rival to Elon Musk’s Tesla will be investing Rs 2,100 crore in setting up its EV manufacturing facility in Telangana’s Zaheerabad, which also houses Mahindra & Mahindra’s largest tractor facility. Triton Electric Vehicle Pvt Ltd, the Indian arm of Triton that was registered in March this year, will create over 25,000 jobs and manufacture around 50,000 EVs, including semitrucks, sedans, luxury SUVs, and rickshaws, at the facility over the first five years, Telangana IT & industries minister KT Rama Rao’s office announced on Thursday. Top Telangana government officials told TOI that the company has sought around 150 acres of land for the facility, which will be located in the Zaheerabad NIMZ (National Investment & Manufacturing Zone) that is being developed over 13,500 acres by the Telangana government. The land for the project will be provided to Triton by the Telangana State Industrial Investment Corporation (TSIIC). “The company will start with semi-trucks and then go on to manufacture SUVs and sedans at the proposed Zaheerabad facility,” Telangana industries principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan told TOI. The company inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Telangana government on Thursday after Triton’s India head of development Mohammed Mansoor met KTR and Ranjan. KTR said the project would put Telangana in the fast lane as far as EV manufacturing was concerned and the government will be expediting all the necessary approvals for setting up the facility. He also assured the company that the state would provide all the incentives applicable for a mega project under the TSIIC guidelines. Triton’s founder chairman Himanshu B Patel, who held a virtual meeting with KTR, said that the company looked into investment opportunities in various states across the country and finally zeroed in on Telangana due to its industryfriendly policies. Karnataka's chief minister BS Yediyurappa had also held a virtual meeting with Triton EV's founder in early April. Other states like Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat too were in the race. The company inked an MoU with Bharat Electronics in February to develop the batteries and EV technology for its vehicles and also has plans to make the proposed Indian facility an export hub for markets such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Middle East and Africa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/triton-ev-to-drive-into-t-with-rs-2-1k-cr-investment/articleshow/83826565.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Nagpur||In a first, Nagpur forest department to use live wire detectors to check poaching||NAGPUR: In a maiden move, state forest department patrolling teams will now be equipped with a new device that detects live electric wires laid in forest areas to poach wild animals. The WWF-India has handed over 20 such detectors to the wildlife wing. This is for the first time such innovative and cost-effective devices have been deployed. State PCCF (wildlife) Nitin Kakodkar said, “The 20 devices have been produced by a startup company and will be helpful in buffer zones of tiger reserves where there is a problem of electrocution.” “Electrocution is serious which the department has been grappling with. It is not only about poaching of animals or farmers electrifying farm fences to protect crops from wild animals. While doing so, there are cases where forest staff and people laying these wires have lost their lives,” said Kakodkar. He said the device looks like a walkie-talkie and is handy. If live wires are laid, a person can detect them as the device makes a beep sound. “It is a pilot project and if found useful, more such equipment can be procured by the forest department in future. Of the 20 devices, four each have been handed over to Tadoba-Andhari, Navegaon-Nagzira and Pench tiger reserves, three to Bor and five to Melghat tiger reserve. WWF-India’s Soumen Dey, team leader, Central India Landscape, said, “Last year, we had distributed eight initial models to Pench, Bandhavgarh, Kanha and Panna tiger reserve for field trials. During trials, certain modifications were suggested that have been incorporated in the new prototype.” On the journey of the device, Dey said Atal Innovation Centre-Sri Krishnadevaraya University (AIC-SKU), Andhra Pradesh, with WWF-India had hosted an innovation challenge in June 2019 to identify solutions to tackle man-animal conflict. Participants from academia and industry presented ideas in which Kuppam Engineering College was selected for prototype development. The prototype was ready and trials were conducted in select tiger reserves and accordingly, modifications were made. A startup company, Kuppam Electro Solutions Private Limited incubated at AIC-SKU is now manufacturing 100 such units of live wire detectors to be delivered to WWF-India. Further orders are expected from south-east Asian countries which face a similar problem. Ajinkya Bhatkar, WWF-India’s senior project officer, Nagpur, said, “The device can detect live wire from three metres. It can be adjusted from 0-8 metres, but while doing so, it may even detect overhead live wires of 11kv lines.” Dey said the device can also be helpful to power company staff. Currently, the cost per units has been kept at Rs10,000 but if there are bulk orders, it can come down to Rs8,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-a-first-forest-dept-to-use-live-wire-detectors-to-check-poaching/articleshow/83822397.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Goa||May lead third front if alliance with Cong fails: NCP||Margao: NCP on Wednesday said that it was prepared to go alone to the 2022 assembly elections and contest all 40 seats in case there is no alliance with Congress. The party said that talks were on with “other like-minded non-Congress, non-BJP parties” in a bid to form a third front as its Plan B. NCP president Jose Philip D’Souza told TOI that the party’s central leadership was also exploring the option of having a “mahagatbandhan” with “like-minded opposition parties” in Goa. “The idea is that secular votes shouldn’t split. If like-minded opposition parties come together, a strong message will be sent to the voters that they have a viable alternative. Talks are on with regional parties here,” D’Souza said. Speaking to reporters at a function held to constitute NCP’s Nuvem block committee, D’Souza said that the party was capable of fielding candidates in all 40 seats in case the alliance with Congress doesn’t work out. “We believe we want an alliance, and Congress is our natural ally. We were deceived by Congress in the last elections. That won’t happen this time. If we are forced to go alone, we are prepared,” he said. NCP’s lone MLA Churchill Alemao said that NCP was a formidable force and that the party was ready to go to the polls even without an alliance. “I have started a movement for strengthening the party in South Goa. In the event of an alliance, we will need to have at least 10 seats this time. I have a feeling that we will be able to win at least 5 out of 8 seats from Salcete,” Alemao said. General secretary and NCP spokesperson, Avinash Bhosle, buttressed the party’s position. “In the event of an alliance with Congress, we will demand nothing short of 10 seats. Else, we are prepared for an alliance with other like-minded parties, non-Congress and non-BJP. NCP will possibly lead the third front in Goa and contest all 40 seats,” he said. In reply to a query whether NCP will admit any of the 10 Congress MLAs who had defected to BJP, D’Souza only said, “We have held talks with many MLAs, things will be revealed at the right time.” Earlier, Francis D’Mello was appointed president of the party’s Nuvem block committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/may-lead-third-front-if-alliance-with-cong-fails-ncp/articleshow/83824579.cms||---
---||Kanpur||B’khand should be made a separate state: Raja Bundela||Jhansi: A day after his weeklong tour of Bundelkhand to educate people on following Covid safety protocol and importance of vaccination, vice chairman of Bundelkhand Development Board and famous actor Raja Bundela said on Thursday that misleading statements of the leaders of opposition parties as well as the superstitious beliefs of villagers are hampering the mass vaccination drive in the rural belt of Bundelkhand. He also said that in order to kickstart development in the region, “Bundelkhand should be made a separate state”. Talking exclusively to TOI in Jhansi, Bundela viewed that during his weeklong tour in which he travelled extensively across seven districts of Bundelkhand, he and his team members observed that the major reasons behind vaccine hesitancy are lack of exposure and awareness, spread of disinformation through social media and irresponsible statements by leaders of opposition parties. Hence, a majority of the population of Bundelkhand is reluctant to get the jab despite understanding the severity of the disease. In fact, in certain villages, not even a single person has come forward to get vaccinated. In addition, people are not ready to follow the Covid safety protocols, added Bundela. He further stated that despite lots of developmental schemes launched by several parties for decades, Bundelkhand still remains backward. “The only way to develop the region is to carve out Bundelkhand as a separate state, having districts both from UP and MP which have possess the essence of Bundeli culture,” said Bundela. “Once it becomes a separate state, the development will pace up, as the region boasts of a rich source of natural minerals and tourist places of historical importance. There are also opportunities of industrial development as the works of defence corridor and a network of highways have begun,” said the vice chairman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/bkhand-should-be-made-a-separate-state-raja-bundela/articleshow/83826581.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Water supply work to start in 9 villages||CHANDIGARH: Of 13 villages, the municipal corporation engineering department has received water supply tenders for nine and allotted about Rs 10-crore work to successful companies. For some villages, more than one tender was advertised. The process was initiated after physical surveys, discussions and meetings by the department. All these tenders are related to different divisions and executive engineer-level officers will monitor them. The works have been allotted for less than the detailed tender amount, enabling the civic body to make big savings. The successful companies have been asked to start work, which the MC engineering department’s public health division will monitor regularly. The MC has also advertised tenders for sewage and storm drainage works. These are yet to be received. As these villages have no municipal councillors, the nominated councillors look into their problems. The nominated councillors held regular meetings with villagers, who apprised them of their issues. Based on these, the engineering department had prepared the plan. The 13 villages whose developmental plan has been prepared are Behlana, Daria, Dhanas, Khuda Lahora, Khuda Jassu, Khudda Ali Sher, Kaimbwala, Mauli Jagran, Makhan Majra, Raipur Khurd, Raipur Kalan, Sarangpur and Kishangarh. These villages were earlier under the UT panchayat department and were transferred to the MC a couple of years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/water-supply-work-to-start-in-9-villages/articleshow/83819845.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court orders judicial probe into dalit woman’s custodial death||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Thursday ordered a judicial probe into the custodial death of a dalit woman, Mariamma, at Addaguduru police station in the Rachakonda police commissionerate limits on June 18. A bench of justices M S Ramachandra Rao and T Vinod Kumar gave this direction while hearing a petition filed by People’s Union for Civil Liberties, Telanagana state unit, general secretary Jaya Vindhyala seeking a judicial probe, stern action against the errant policemen and Rs 5 crore compensation to be recovered from the officers who allegedly tortured Mariamma to death. Alair judicial first class magistrate has been asked to inquire into the custodial death and furnish a report to the court in a sealed cover in a month. Addaguduru police had taken Mariamma and her son along with their friend into custody to question them about a crime registered at the police station. Petitioner’s counsel P Shashi Kiran said police took them into custody on June 15 and tortured them for three days. The bench directed the judicial registrar to inform the judicial magistrate of Alair to conduct the probe immediately. Recover the body from the burial ground, if necessary, to conduct a re-postmortem, it added. Advocate general BS Prasad contended that the Rachakonda police commissioner had already suspended some cops and they even ordered a probe by a revenue divisional officer (RDO), an executive magistrate. The bench said the CrPC Section 176 (1-A) makes it mandatory for the state to get the matter inquired into by a judicial magistrate and not an executive magistrate in matters such as this. Reading out the section that says “where death, disappearance, or rape is alleged to have been committed on any woman within the police or judicial custody, there must be an inquiry conducted by a judicial or metropolitan magistrate, in whose jurisdiction the incident has taken place.” The bench asked why no one in the police department or the state government read this crucial provision before ordering an executive magistrate to inquire into it. The court sought a report from the Alair judicial first class magistrate in a sealed cover and posted the case to June 28 for further hearing. The bench, during the course of the hearing, inquired about CCTV footage pertaining to the police station. The state counsel said the police station was not equipped with CCTVs. The bench asked him why they were not installed despite a clear direction from the Supreme Court. It helps genuine police officers to prove their innocence. “Suppose if the victim died of a heart attack, then they can easily establish their innocence. National Human Rights Commission too made it mandatory to get such incidents inquired by a judicial magistrate through its September 4, 2020 order,” the bench said. The bench directed the Alair magistrate to issue notices to the relatives of Mariamma and record their statements. He was given a month’s time to complete his probe and furnish the report to the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-orders-judicial-probe-into-dalit-womans-custodial-death/articleshow/83826642.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Meerut||ATS finds Hindu nationalist on Uttar Pradesh’s ‘forced converts’ list||MEERUT: The Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) had gone looking for “Abdul Samad” at Shitla Kheda village in UP’s Saharanpur on Wednesday. The name was on the “list” of a thousand-odd allegedly converted to Islam by two Delhi-based Muslim clerics who, the ATS said, had received foreign funding to do so. The ATS found, instead, a staunch Hindu nationalist who has written books on PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath and had “definitely not been converted”. “Had I not produced the books I’ve authored, ‘NaMo Gatha: Modi, Ek Vichaar’ and ‘Yogi Raj se Yogiraj Tak’, they wouldn’t have believed me,” Praveen Kumar, 32, told TOI. He's a PhD scholar, working on the plight of girl students in the rural sector, whose day job is as a cane development officer at a sugar mill. “The ATS officials were accompanied by local police that day. They spoke with me alone, behind closed doors, and asked me not to speak of the conversation ever again. They wanted to know when I had been converted,” Praveen said. “I told them no one ever tried to convert me. I am a Hindu and have always been one … Then, they said my name must have been included to seek funds from outside the country.” The case ATS is pursuing is against the chairperson of Islamic Da’wah Centre (IDC) Mufti Kazi Jahangir Qasmi and Mohammed Umar Gautam. Their names allegedly came up during interrogation of two men accused in another case — an alleged assassination plot against Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, head priest of the Dasna Devi temple in Ghaziabad where a Muslim boy was beaten up after he entered the premises to drink water. The ATS said IDC is being used for mass religious conversion, that over 1,000 “vulnerable” people have been converted by the two clerics with the “promise of jobs” or by “inciting hatred” against Hinduism over the past 18 months, and that it was all done with “foreign funding”. UP ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said just one case won’t change the course of their investigation. “It's a bit premature to develop our future strategy on the basis of one case. Since the investigation is ongoing, I can’t say if there are more such cases (like that of Praveen) but there are over a thousand conversion cases by the two clerics. Probe is on regarding the exact number,” he told TOI. “The list was compiled on the basis of documents found during investigation.” TOI traced others on the “list”, all of whom said they had converted on their own, years ago, and not under duress. They had all approached IDC, a registered government organisation, for paperwork over the past year. Ibrahim Khan, 46, from Khargone in Madhya Pradesh, for instance, converted to Islam in 1998. “No one forced me. I make Rs 90,000 a month as an insurance official. What allurement?” he told TOI. “I’d approached IDC in 2020 for a certificate to go on Haj.” In Patna, Ghazala, 42, got her name registered with IDC in January this year. “But I had converted in 1999. It was my choice and I exercised it,” she said. “Why am I being dragged into this now?” In Munger, Abdullah Ahmed, 35, was astonished. He had approached the IDC to get his name changed in February last year. “I am a teacher with a BTech degree. I converted to Islam in 2016, adopting the legal procedure, going before a magistrate. There was no pressure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/on-forced-converts-list-hindu-nationalist-few-whod-changed-faith-in-late-90s/articleshow/83817514.cms||Sandeep Rai

Chandigarh-Dibrugarh Express and Chandigarh-Ramnagar will be back on track from July 7 onwards. Railways have issued a notification for resumption the two trains, said Ambala divisional railway manager (DRM) Gurinder Mohan Singh. He said that demand for resumption of five more trains has been sent to the ministry of railways for approval. These trains are Himalayan Queen, Chd-ASR, Chandigarh-Madgaon, Chandigarh-Indore and Kerala Sampark Kranti Express. “The trains may get green signal in the first week of July after which date for the departure will be announced,” he said. Members of Malayalam Sabha had raised a demand with the DRM to resume Kerala Sampark Kranti Express, which connects Chandigarh with Kochuveli. Chandigarh to Dibrugarh train number 05904 is a bi-weekly train and Chandigarh-Ramnagar (12528) is a weekly train, said Chandigarh station superintendent J P Singh. He said Chandigarh to Dibrugarh train would operate every Wednesday and Sunday, departing Chandigarh at 11:15pm and taking over 3 days to complete the journey. The train will arrive in Chandigarh from Dibrugarh at 6:15am. Chandigarh-Ramnagar Superfast Express departs Chandigarh at 4:05pm every Monday and takes 7:30 hours to cover this trip, reaching Ramnagar at 11:35pm. Now, only 14 trains are running in Chandigarh against 35 earlier. Railway officials said the footfall, which was somewhere between 9,000 to 10,000 per day has now come down to 2,500 to 3,000 per day. While long distance trains like Unchahaar Express, Pashchim Express, Rishikesh-Katra Express, Bandra terminus Express and Sachkhand Express are running at full capacity, AC coaches in such trains are also not attracting passenger rush.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/two-trains-to-to-resume-services-from-july-7/articleshow/83819902.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

---||Delhi||No salary & petition pending, ex-Taekwondo coach kills self in Delhi's Mangolpuri||NEW DELHI: A 46-year-old man allegedly killed himself at his house in outer Delhi's Mangolpuri area over non-receipt of salary as a Taekwondo coach at GD Goenka School in Sector 9, Rohini. The man left behind a suicide note in which he named a few people for his poor financial condition that led to his taking the extreme step. According to police, the body of Tanoop Johar, who had been unemployed for more than a year, was found hanging inside his room by his family on Tuesday. After informing the cops, Johar's body was taken to a hospital where the doctors declared him dead on arrival. His body was sent for a post-mortem examination. Johar and two of his colleagues in school had filed a case in the Delhi School Tribunal against the non-payment of salaries last October. According to Vikas Bhardwaj, head of the sports department at GD Goenka and party to the case, “We were taking sports class even after the closure of the school. When we weren’t paid for three months, we enquired about this from the school authorities. They told us that if we submitted our resignation, they would clear our dues. We weren’t sure if we could trust them, so we first filed a complaint with the grievance cell of Delhi government’s Directorate of Education. When there was no respite for us, we moved the Delhi School Tribunal.” Rajeev Kumar, principal of the school, did not respond to calls and messages from TOI. Police found a purported suicide note in which Johar mentioned the names of two members of the school administration and accused the school authorities of not paying him his salary. The note claimed Johar was “disturbed” because he had no work or earnings at the moment despite his plea in the school tribunal for almost a year now. The note also said Johar was being helped financially by family members. Sunny, brother of the deceased, said, “It was Tanoop’s birthday on June 29. We hadn’t realised how stressed he was about his finances.” Parvinder Singh, DCP (Outer), said, “Tanoop Johar’s wife had gone to meet her parents-in-laws and discovered his body hanging at home on her return. We have recovered a suicide note and the contents of the suicide note are being examined.” Police said after questioning the deceased’s family members and his colleagues, they found that Johar had been taking online classes for the school’s students since March last year after the Covid lockdown in the city. He, however, had to discontinue the martial arts’ training over the salary dispute with the school management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-salary-petition-pending-ex-taekwondo-coach-kills-self/articleshow/83822538.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||1.8 crore population yet to get a single dose of vaccine in Telangana||HYDERABAD: An estimated 1.80 crore people in Telangana out of 2.73 crore eligible beneficiaries are yet to receive even a single dose of vaccine worrying officials at a time when experts have called for mass vaccination before a possible third wave later this year. With the vaccine stocks depleting fast in the state, first dose vaccination drive is likely to come to a halt in July at government vaccination centres as the state would now have to give priority to second doses. At the moment, the state has 5.39 lakh doses and another 10.76 lakh are expected to arrive by the end of June. The state has so far vaccinated close to 96 lakh people, out of which 64 lakh are awaiting the second dose. With the current level of vaccination, we are consuming 1.5-2 lakh doses every day. At this rate, the existing stock will last only for a week. The situation is very dynamic. Halting the first dose for a while might be necessary unless we get more stocks,” said an official from the state health department. He said completing the first dose itself is likely to take over four months at this rate. While an internal meeting has been held on the subject recently, the low availability of stocks was even mentioned in an affidavit submitted by the state health department in the high court on Wednesday. “In July, another 21 lakh doses are expected, but considering the available vials, the government will still fall short by 2.8 lakh doses to cover beneficiaries awaiting the second jab,” added the official. People who cannot afford to get vaccinated at private centres, and more importantly beneficiaries in rural areas, will face huge problem, say officials. Telangana has so far received 88.33 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines. Of these, 82.94 lakh were consumed by June 22 itself. Telangana has planned an aggressive vaccination programme and health officials maintain that given the vaccination capacity, if adequate stocks are available, entire population can be inoculated in next one-and-a-half months. While the stocks of both vaccines are running low in the government centres, even stocks of Covaxin in private hospitals is low. “We are trying to save the Covaxin stock for second doses,” said a private hospital source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/1-8cr-popn-yet-to-get-a-single-dose-of-vaccine-in-telangana/articleshow/83826685.cms||Amrita Didyala

The accused has been booked under Haryana Development Regulation of Urban Area Act. A complaint was lodged with the police by the district town planning officer. The complainant stated that a person identified as Gurmeet Singh, a resident of Kiratpur village, Kalka raised unauthorised construction over land falling in the revenue estate of Garidah village in violation of sections 5 and 11 of Punjab New Capital Periphery Control Act, 1952. The site of the offender falls within notified controlled area declared on April 4, 1972 and is also notified in the gazette. The DTP stated that rules prohibit construction within notified controlled area without prior permission of the competent authority (director, Town and Country Planning, Haryana). It was pointed out that rules also provide for change of land use permission before changing existing use of land from the competent authority on payment of prescribed fees and charges to the government. “The accused in this case violated both sections of the Act by changing existing use of land from agriculture to residential/commercial without obtaining change of land use permission from competent authority and also caused financial loss to the state exchequer by not paying prescribed fees and charges for change of land use,” said the DTP in his complaint. Necessary show cause notices and restoration orders under section 12(2) of Act of 1952 have already been issued against the offender on June 2, 2020, but the offender is deliberately continuing with the offence/violation/ contravention of provisions of Act and rules framed under the Act, it was alleged. Police was requested to get the unauthorised construction stopped immediately, investigate the matter and register an FIR. A case was registered under Section 10 of the Haryana Development Regulation of Urban Area Act at Pinjore police station.

Maharashtra had 19 lakh cases by the time the first wave ended and 40 lakh in the second wave, which is now ebbing. Medical education director T P Lahane said numbers were “difficult to predict … we need to prepare”. The cut in spending by Rs 52,000 crore was announced on Thursday by the finance department. In the event of a Covid resurgence, the state expects at least 25 lakh patients to rely on public medical facilities. Given the challenge, it is firming up a plan to stock up on medicines and kits on a large scale. The slash in the Rs 1.3 lakh crore budget will impact all wings save public health, medical education, and food and drug administration. It will hit new projects, curtail discretionary outlays on workshops, printing of diaries, etc and curb recruitments. Spending cut 40%, govt hiring & functions to be scaled backThe cash-strapped Maharashtra government on Thursday imposed a 40% cut in the Rs 1.3 lakh crore budgetary provisions made for fiscal 2021-22 to mobilize up to Rs 52,000 crore to tackle expenditure linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. The drastic cut is expected to force the government to scale back on new projects, curtail discretionary spending on workshops, seminars, printing of calendars and diaries, apart from putting restrictions on expenditure incurred on government functions and recruitment to vacant posts. The state hopes to conserve scarce resources for welfare schemes, including centrally-sponsored ones, pension, subsidies and wages. The finance department under deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday issued a resolution for the cut. A senior official said the state is saddled with a debt burden of over Rs 6.15 lakh crore and since the lockdown in March 2020, its revenue collections have dipped. Manufacturing activity has slowed, excise and stamp duty collections have reduced. “Last year, we spent a huge amount to tackle Covid and now we will have to again make provisions. Since we can’t enhance taxes, the only way is to cut budgetary provisions,” a senior official said. On May 4, 2020, the state had initiated stringent measures to cut down expenditure. Later, the norms were relaxed as the financial situation improved. But in view of the possibility of a third wave, the government is anticipating the need for more funds. “We have issued an order to provide for utilization of only 60% of budgetary provision. Priority will be given to state’s share in centrally sponsored schemes, wages, pension and honorarium, and a nutritious food plan for the poor. We have asked all departments to only spend on essential items,” a senior official said. Departments of public health, medical education, and food and drug administration have been declared as the “priority departments” for tackling Covid-19 through the resolution. It also says that in the event of a high court order directing the government to release funds, the financial situation must be brought to the notice of the court and the scheme closed in consultation with the court. The order says barring priority departments, all others have been warned not to spend funds on routine work. They should not hold seminars or workshops without the prior permission of the finance department. And unused deposits lying in banks should be transferred to the government before June 30, 2021 and till then their bills are not to be passed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-spending-cut-40-govt-hiring-functions-to-be-scaled-back/articleshow/83822749.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

A senior official said the state is saddled with a debt burden of over Rs 6.15 lakh crore and since the lockdown in March 2020, its revenue collections have dipped. Manufacturing activity has slowed, excise and stamp duty collections have reduced. “Last year, we spent a huge amount to tackle Covid and now we will have to again make provisions. Since we can’t enhance taxes, the only way is to cut budgetary provisions,” a senior official said. On May 4, 2020, the state had initiated stringent measures to cut down expenditure. Later, the norms were relaxed as the financial situation improved. But in view of the possibility of a third wave, the government is anticipating the need for more funds. “We have issued an order to provide for utilization of only 60% of budgetary provision. Priority will be given to state’s share in centrally sponsored schemes, wages, pension and honorarium, and a nutritious food plan for the poor. We have asked all departments to only spend on essential items,” a senior official said. Departments of public health, medical education, and food and drug administration have been declared as the “priority departments” for tackling Covid-19 through the resolution. It also says that in the event of a high court order directing the government to release funds, the financial situation must be brought to the notice of the court and the scheme closed in consultation with the court. The order says barring priority departments, all others have been warned not to spend funds on routine work. They should not hold seminars or workshops without the prior permission of the finance department. And unused deposits lying in banks should be transferred to the government before June 30, 2021 and till then their bills are not to be passed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbai-spending-cut-40-govt-hiring-functions-to-be-scaled-back/articleshow/83834902.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Goa||State appoints 2 consultants to get central funds||Panaji: The state government has appointed two consultants to coordinate with the Centre to secure funds under the central sector and centrally sponsored schemes in different sectors. The consultants will be paid up to 2% as success fee. Director of planning, statistics and evaluation, S Shanbhogue said that the state government has appointed Darashaw and Company Pvt Ltd and All India Institute of Local Self Government (AIILSG). “The consultants will have to assist the department in preparing proposals as per the guidelines, procedures and requirements of relevant schemes of the government of India. This may include pre-feasibility report, techno-economic feasibility report, detailed project report, or any other study as may be required to avail financial assistance,” Shanbhogue said Darashaw and Company Pvt Ltd will look after sectors like agriculture and allied sectors, industry, infrastructure and utilities, power and energy, including renewable energy, information technology and e-governance. AIILSG will look after sectors, like welfare, education, skill development and employment, and healthcare. The consultants will identify relevant central government schemes with preference to those that have 100% central financial assistance. However, the consultants will have to consult and get approval of the respective departments before preparing proposals, Shanbhogue said. He added that it would be the responsibility of the consultancy firms to coordinate with the central government (fund sanctioning authority) on behalf of the state government for approval and sanction of the detailed project report, and release and disbursement of funds thereafter. The state government said that the agreement with the consultant will be valid for three years with effect from the issue of letter of empanelment or date of signing of the agreement, whichever is later, with a provision for a two year extension. It will be the responsibility of the consultancy firms to coordinate with the central government (fund sanctioning authority) on behalf of the state government for approval and sanction of the detailed project report, and release and disbursement of funds thereafter||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-appoints-2-consultants-to-get-central-funds/articleshow/83824788.cms||---

The school said it is facing a tough time paying salaries of teachers and other support staff because of the huge financial backlog. Parents have been requested to clear the pending dues, with some defaults dating to pre-Covid time, by June 30 after which the school can review its decision. Independent English Schools Association (IESA), a pan-Maharashtra association of private schools, said such decisions have been taken across the state. President of the association Rajendra Dayma said, “There are quite a few of our members who have postponed the academic session till July 1. It’s likely that this date will be pushed further. I can’t blame them because many of them are on the brink of financial ruin and in such cases, it’s better to keep operations shut. Once we open the school, parents use political pressure or approach education officers to get their child admitted without clearing previous dues.” Another state-level organization, Maharashtra English Schools Trustee Association (MESTA), said schools have been cornered. Khemraj Kondhe, divisional president of MESTA, said, “80% of the English schools in Maharashtra fall under the budget school category where fees are very low. These schools barely get by each year and fee default by 2-5% students are common. But now, we have so many member schools that have not received even a single rupee for the last academic session. There’s no cash pile available with budget schools to keep operations running and that’s why teachers are facing either salary or job cut.” A senior teacher at Kendriya Vidyalaya said even government employees have not paid fees. “We have a few central and state government employees, including policemen, who are not clearing their dues even though their salaries have not been impacted by Covid-19 pandemic,” said a teacher on the condition of anonymity. While many schools have started issuing transfer certificates (TC) to students, many are withholding this crucial document so that parents cannot take admission in a new school. To ease their admission, the state education department recently issued guidelines that admissions can be done without TCs. However, school trustee Sachin Kalbande, who is also the founder president of RTE Foundation, said such guidelines are ‘misleading’. “First of all, that admission without TC rule is only for those students who have been outside the education ecosystem. Students who have never gone to school due to poverty etc and, hence, are unable to produce a TC while seeking admission. The government is using that guideline for a different set of students, which is completely wrong,” said Kalbande.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-school-puts-classes-on-hold-as-over-700-parents-fail-to-pay-fee/articleshow/83822513.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

While the ASI sustained critical injuries, the constable has minor injuries. The driver, who was being stopped for having tinted window glass, fled the spot. A manhunt has been launched to apprehend him. The incident took place around 4.30pm when the ASI Vishram, head constable Vinod and constable Anoop were on regulation duty at Mangal Pandey Road near Mayapuri red light. Police said that the cops were stationed 50 metres ahead of the Hari Nagar Ghanta Ghar when a Polo car arrived with tinted glasses. “The three signalled the driver to stop, who slowed down, but then suddenly accelerated and hit ASI Vishram with full impact, injuring him severely,” said a police officer. Vishram was taken to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital with help from public where he is being treated of critical injuries on his hips, head and hands. As the car moved towards head constable Vinod, he jumped over the bonnet of the car in order to save himself, but got stuck on the vehicle. “The car driver sped the vehicle for nearly two kilometres before coming to a halt near Hari Nagar Bus Depot at Jail Road, where Vinod fell off the bonnet. He too sustained injuries on his hands and left leg,” the officer said. The driver managed to escape in his vehicle. A case has been registered and footage from the area is being checked to identify the man.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cop-critical-after-speeding-car-hits-him-another-hurt/articleshow/83822682.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh accomplishes ‘Mission June’ with 8.51 lakh jabs in 24 hours||LUCKNOW: Accomplishing its Mission June, Uttar vaccinated one crore persons six days before the deadline. On Thursday, the state had administered 1,04,19,608 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. It had set a target of inoculating 1 crore beneficiaries in June with an average of more than 3 lakh doses per day. Now, the next goal is to vaccinate 10 crore people in the next three months. On Thursday, UP surpassed the 7 lakh vaccination mark for the fourth consecutive day and by the end of the day, 8,51,137 jabs had been given. This is the maximum in a single day in UP. One crore jabs in 24 days is the fastest vaccination exercise conducted anywhere in the country, say UP health officials.”So far, Maharashtra is the only state which is ahead of UP in terms of total doses given. But the western state has been able to dispense about 70 lakh doses in the past 24 days. In this way, UP’s achievement came at about 30% faster rate,” they say. Likewise, UP is way ahead of the other states like Gujarat which has undertaken about 63 lakh vaccinations in June so far. Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have achieved 67 lakh and 52 lakh vaccinations respectively in the same period. Although the target was achieved in 24 days, technically it took just 21 days as only a few private centres hold immunisation sessions on Sundays, a senior officer said. Speaking about the achievement, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said: “It is a matter of pride that the state has been able to achieve the target before time. The credit goes to the hard work put in by every single person in the field who translated the plan to action.” He added that concerted efforts made under Mission June like dedicated booths for guardians, women special centers, drive-ins, employee camps etc were taken to the next level through the cluster approach. “The journey towards the goal was accelerated through the Cluster approach which we will launch in full swing from July,” he said. Under the cluster approach, started from Barabanki district, focused and intensified vaccination drives are being taken in small geographical units. Also, the camps are being organised inside the villages along with the health centers to make it easier for the people. In addition, the issue of digital divide was addressed by elimination of the necessary prerequisite of registration through app. Instead, the electoral rolls are being used to identify the eligible persons and vaccinate them. The dry run for the cluster was rolled out on June 17 with communication and mobilisation activities while the vaccination began on June 21. The total number of jabs given in the past four days is nearly 32.2 lakh. Prior to the cluster formula, the average number of vaccinations per day in the state was about 3.25 lakh. The data also revealed that over 55% of those vaccinated under Mission June are from the 18 to 44 years age group. Meanwhile, the total number of vaccinations undertaken in UP reached 2.90 crore by Thursday evening. Of them, 2.49 crore have taken at least one dose while 41.94 lakh are fully vaccinated in the state. In terms of categories, the total number of persons with at least one dose in the 18-44 years reached 91.45 lakh while the number of those vaccinated in the 45 to 60 years age group reached 92.99 lakh. In the elderly category, 62.47 lakh persons have taken at least one dose. Experts are of the view that the cluster approach will help UP achieve the target of vaccinating 10-12 lakh persons per day from July as announced by CM Yogi Adityanath. “The cluster approach has institutionalised the process of vaccination in the state. And processes make goals achievable,” said Dr Praful Bharadwaj, health officer, Unicef, UP. Insiders said that if UP got a sustained supply of vaccines, it will be able to inoculate 13.6 crore people by the end of August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/with-8-51-lakh-jabs-in-24-hrs-up-accomplishes-mission-june/articleshow/83826736.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The municipality has now decided to tender work for two more biogas plants which are likely to be set up in the next six months. MMC chairperson Damodar Kaskar said, “The wet and dry garbage are first segregated, and the wet waste is treated by the biogas plant at our garbage treatment plant at Sada. The dry waste is sent to a cement factory in Karnataka.” He also said that about 20 tonnes of wet garbage is generated daily in the port town and the current plant can treat 5 tonnes daily. The electricity generated from this is used to run the plant, but as it is insufficient, power from electricity department is also used to run the plant. MMC’s biogas plant is being maintained by BITS-Pilani currently. The civic body has now decided to install two such plants with a capacity of 5 tonnes each per day. The contract will be given to any private party as per tendering rules, Kaskar said. The three plants are expected to produce electricity from the wet waste to run the plants. The municipality expects to reduce the load of the wet garbage which is being stored as dumps currently. “People should segregate their waste at home and hand it over to our workers,” Kaskar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mormugao-to-get-two-more-biogas-plants/articleshow/83822652.cms||Ruvina Khan

In nine months — from June-quarter to March-quarter of 2020-21 — transactions made through universal payments interface (UPI) surged 120% in Gujarat. According to the latest report by State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) Gujarat, UPI transactions grew from Rs 12.75 crore in June 2020 to Rs 28.12 crore in March 2021.  The 169th SLBC meeting was held in Ahmedabad on Thursday afternoon. “Volume of digital transactions saw a significant surge especially UPI transactions. This is because of the pandemic due to which there was a great deal of reluctance among the general public in using cash. Moreover, most of the public sector as well as private sector banks onboarded the UPI platform and the transactions went up not just due to the pandemic but more awareness and convenience as well,” said M M Bansal, convener, SLBC, Gujarat. Besides UPI transactions, the value of immediate payment service (IMPS) grew 131% in Gujarat from Rs 1.93 crore to Rs 4.46 crore, ATM transactions grew 40% from Rs 4.28 crore to Rs 6.25 crore and 110% in point of sale (POS) transactions from Rs 0.42 crore to Rs 0.99 crore as well in Gujarat. “The first big surge in digital transactions was witnessed around the end of 2016 and early 2017 and onwards after demonetisation. Then, during Covid-19 lockdown, the hesitant digital banking users felt comfort and ease in finally adopting it so that they can avoid venturing out to bank branches. Also, payment solutions such as UPI and QR Code are pathbreaking and have only helped accelerate the adoption of digital solutions, during the pandemic,” said Thomson Jose, branch banking head, Gujarat, HDFC Bank. Interestingly, across all these platforms, Gujarat has shown a higher growth in value of transactions as compared to pan-India trend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/120-growth-in-upi-transactions-in-gujarat-in-9-months/articleshow/83824831.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Delhi||Vax stocks merged, 25% of youths have got the jab||New Delhi: Every fourth Delhiite between 18 and 44 years has received at least one dose of a vaccine against Covid-19, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi said on Thursday. Of the more than one lakh doses administered on Wednesday, nearly 90% were administered to the youths. “With the increase in the vaccination drive for the youth due to the availability of stocks, we have been able to vaccinate 25% of them in Delhi, which means that this population has at least received the first jab,” Atishi said. “It is important as the youths are the ones who need to step out of the house most often for earning livelihoods. Also, unlike the first wave of Covid 19, which affected the older and comorbid population more, the second wave impacted the youth population severely as well,” she said, adding that Delhi government hopes to vaccinate the entire youth population soon. “Due to the clubbing of the stocks for both age groups, there has been an increase in the vaccines available for the youth,” the MLA said. “As of Wednesday, Delhi received more than 68,000 Covaxin doses and 80,000 Covishield doses, which totals to 10,24,000 vaccine doses available in the state. Currently, Delhi has 20 days of Covaxin and nine days of Covishield stocks,” she said, adding that Covaxin doses are being administered only to the second-dose recipients. On Wednesday, nearly 90,000 doses were administered to the youth out of the 1,09,358 jabs. “Of this, 98,287 were first dose and 11,071 second dose. This takes the total doses administered in Delhi to 67,98,236, with more than 16 lakh people receiving both shots,” she said. “All those who haven’t been vaccinated should come forward as soon as possible,” Atishi said. “All the vaccine centres are now eligible to administer vaccines to people of all age groups.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vax-stocks-merged-25-of-youths-have-got-the-jab/articleshow/83822738.cms||Sidharatha Roy

For June, he said, stocks in lakhs will continue. Civic officials said they will receive 2.4 lakh doses of Covishield by Friday morning. “It takes time to distribute it to all the centres, so we have scheduled vaccination from 2pm today,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. There are 295 public vaccination centres and representatives from each physically collect the vaccine vials from BMC’s vaccine depot in Kanjurmarg. Gomare said vaccination will be held as per schedule on Saturday. Across wards, many people were disappointed to find the centres shut.

Reviewing the progress of infrastructure development at Karwar under Project Seabird, along with Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh, the minister said the base will not only further bolster the country’s operational military readiness, but also help in augmenting trade, economy and humanitarian aid operations in the region. Already the home base for several frontline warships, including aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, the completion of the ongoing Phase-IIA of Project Seabird will enable Karwar to berth 32 major warships and submarines. Project Seabird involves construction of a naval base over an area of 11,169 acres. Phase I comprises construction of deep-sea harbour, breakwaters, dredging, a township, a naval hospital, a dockyard uplift centre and a ship lift. An airstrip, with an air station and a naval research centre are coming up in the second phase. The base provides the Navy with both strategic depth and operational flexibility on the western seaboard, especially against Pakistan, while also helping in the endeavour to decongest Mumbai, as was earlier reported by TOI. The Navy has played a key role in enhancing India’s ties with its maritime neighbours as well as ensuring stability and security in the Indian Ocean Region in accordance with PM Modi’s vision of `Sagar’ (security and growth for all in the region), said Rajnath Singh. The minister interacted with the contractors and engineers working on the project at the Karwar naval base. In his address, he said that the Kawar naval base would further bolster the operational readiness of the armed forces and help in augmenting trade, economy and humanitarian aid operations. Accompanied by chief of the naval staff Admiral Karambir Singh, the defence minister undertook an aerial survey of the project area and sites before arriving at the INS Kadamba helipad. A statement from the Indian Navy said that Singh inspected the ongoing works at Karwar and received on-site briefings, including capability demonstration, at the shiplift tower. The defence minister’s visit to Karwar is part of a two-day itinerary which culminates in Kochi, where Singh will be briefed about the construction of India’s first indigenously built aircraft carrier Vikrant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/more-funds-can-be-given-to-make-karwar-asias-largest-naval-base/articleshow/83822714.cms||---

A woman died and four others sustained injuries in the accident. Police said that the accused is absconding and suspect that the accident occurred when a group of youngsters took out the vehicle when their elders were not at home. Police have launched a manhunt to nab the accused. South zone task force team that analysed the CCTV footages from various places traced the car to a house in Jahangeer Nagar in Talabkatta area of Bhavani Nagar police station limits. “During the preliminary inquiry, we found that the car belongs to one Jaleel Khan, a businessman. We suspect that his son Adil, 20, was driving the car at the time of the accident. After the family members had locked the house and left, the youngsters might have taken out the car for a joyride,” said a south zone police officer. There were several access entry stickers of various clubs in Mumbai on the windshield of the car and a traffic challan issued by Shadnagar traffic police station in July 2020 for speeding (112 KMPH) is pending against the vehicle. At 7 pm on Wednesday, the driver of the car lost control of the vehicle and hit three vehicles and a pedestrian in Shalibanda. Salamma (40), a beggar who was present at the spot at the time of the accident, sustained grievous injuries and died while undergoing treatment at Osmania General Hospital later in the night. Police said that four others who sustained injuries are stable. An autorickshaw and two bikes were also damaged. “A few eye witnesses said that after the accident, the youngster driving the car got out of the vehicle for a short while and then drove away towards Moghalpura,” Charminar ACP G Bhiksham Reddy said. Hussainialam police registered a case under Sections 304-a and 337 of the IPC.

According to GSL, the Indian Army delegation also discussed future requirements of hovercrafts and interceptor boats to patrol sensitive and strategic areas. GSL, which bagged the a Rs 65 crore order to construct 12 specialised boats for the Indian Army, plans to deliver the first boat by early July, with three of the boats in advanced build stages. The Army’s engineer in chief Lt Gen Harpal Singh arrived at Vasco to oversee the initial trials and to inspect the pace of construction. “Lt Gen Harpal Singh visited Goa Shipyard to review progress of fast patrol boats being made for the Indian Army. He also discussed future requirements of hovercrafts and interceptor boats,” said chairman and managing director of GSL B B Nagpal. The Indian Army has ordered 12 specialised, high altitude patrol boats to match China’s heavier type-928B patrol boats and 17 flat bottomed boats to counter incursions by China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The 12 boats being built by GSL will be fitted with machine-guns and surveillance gear including optical sensors.

Conservationists, however, are unhappy about the undersized catch that may hasten extinction of bivalves. A resurgence in a few shellfish species, especially tisreo, due to rejuvenation of ecology offers opportunities to the fishermen and unemployed during the traumatic pandemic period. The sale of bivalves has been extended from the market place to odd places by the roadside. But it is a sad story everywhere, as the bivalves have been hauled out before maturity. That has left the experts worried, as they apprehend major impacts on the reproduction cycle and a reversal in the revival process boosted by a cleaner ecology in recent months. “At present, adolescent ones which are not of marketable size are being harvested. This means there will be insufficient population to sustain the future breeding of the species,” Baban Ingole, former chief scientist of National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) said. In 2020, a few estuarine areas such as Chicalim and Sancoale witnessed a bumper crop of clams and oysters. Despite the local biodiversity management committees’ (BMC) persistent efforts, hordes of extractors plundered huge quantities of the resource, causing a famine this year. “By harvesting them before maturity, the next generation is wiped out. This is how their population collapses and we drive a species to extinction,” an ecologist said. The fisheries department and village BMCs can play a critical role in determining the shellfish size to be harvested. “This needs to be tackled urgently or it may be too late to protect the clam’s gene pool. With no brood stock for reproduction, they may face the same fate like green mussels (xinanneo), ” Ingole, a reputed fisheries scientist, said. Traditional beliefs ensured in decades past a conservation regimen. “We need to sensitise the people again, as commercial interests are dominant. In the past, people themselves understood breeding cycles,” a fisheries department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-tisreos-in-markets-grow-smaller-in-size-experts-raise-extinction-fears/articleshow/83822739.cms||Paul Fernandes

The experts have laid emphasis on first diverting water of the west-flowing rivers (that draininto the Arabian Sea) towards the Godavari basin — a project mooted by previous BJP-led government along with the water-grid project. “Every year, around 300 TMC water from west-flowing rivers goes untapped into the Arabian Sea. Around half of this water can be easily diverted to the Godavari basin. The water grid project in isolation does not sound feasible given the drought-prone nature of Marathwada. It has to be clubbed with fetching water from west-flowing rivers,” water right activist Abhijit Dhanorkar said. Dhanorkar, who had waged a legal battle in the Supreme Court for ensuring equitable distribution of water for Marathwada, said the water from west-flowing rivers should be first brought to Darna group of dams from Nashik before channelizing the same towards Marathwada. “Both the projects must be executed at the earliest,” he added. The state cabinet, in its meeting held on Wednesday, approved Rs 285 for the water-grid project amid speculations that the ambitious project envisaged by previous BJP-led government would be shelved by the present MVA government. While limiting its scope for begin with, the state cabinet has sought works under water-grid project only at Paithan from Aurangabad district as against the original plan of interlinking 11 dams catering to Marathwada. Shankar Nagare, expert member (Irrigation) of Marathwada Development Board, said dams from Nashik district should also be included into water-grid project to make it more viable. Meanwhile, State water supply minister Gulabrao Patil could not be reached for comments.

The court adjourned the matter to July 29 and also permitted the government to further amend its petition. The government had sought leave to appeal against Tejpal’s acquittal by the trial court last month. He had been accused of raping a woman in a starred hotel in 2013. Sibal said the amended petition before the court mentioned that the state had not received a copy of the trial court’s judgment. “How is that possible when this is an amended petition? ” Sibal said, adding, “We do not understand what appeal this is.” He also said that he had a preliminary objection as a copy of the amended appeal wasn’t served to his client. “Neither a hard copy nor a soft copy has been served, annexures too have not been served, and neither a transcript,” he said. Advocate general Devidas Pangam said the state had received a notice from the lawyer that certain documents and annexures weren’t included and assured that the state would provide them within a week. When asked by the court whether the state sought to further amend the petition, Pangam replied in the affirmative. “Leave is granted to further amend the memo of appeal. The advocate general states that further amendment will be carried out within a period of one week from today,” a division bench of Justice Mahesh Sonak and Justice M S Jawalkar observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tejpal-case-sibal-pokes-holes-in-state-govts-plea/articleshow/83822769.cms||---

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has reportedly asked health department officials to check height restrictions in the area as it was about three to four km from Begumpet airport and close to the flight funnel, where only ground and two floors are permitted. KCR has laid foundation for a super-speciality hospital in Warangal with 33 floors, which could be the tallest building in the second biggest city of Telangana, and a helipad on the terrace of the building. The cabinet has recently okayed construction of a super-speciality hospital on the premises of Chest hospital at Erragadda. Of the 62 acre land, the government has decided to utilise about 44 acres for construction of a new 1,500-bed hospital. As of now, Gandhi hospital has eight floors, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) 13 storeys and Osmania General Hospital (OGH) just five floors. A team headed by roads and buildings (R&B) minister would be visiting Canada to see the health infrastructure there and replicate them in the state, including Hyderabad. “Of the proposed 1,500 beds in the hospital, 50% beds will be for chest-related issues, the rest will be allocated for allergic disorders and other combination problems like chest-cardiac and chest-gastric issues etc. The plans are being prepared now,” TS Medical Services Infrastructure Development Corporation managing director K Chandrasekhar Reddy said. On the directions of the CM, minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav along with health department officials visited Chest Hospital on Thursday to prepare a comprehensive plan for construction of the proposed hospital. Health department officials said it was only a preliminary visit and plans would be readied with different options and heights and place before the CM for the final call. Airport officials confirmed that there were restrictions in and around Erragadda area as it is located close to the Begumpet airport. “While it is ground and two floors in the funnel area, the permissible height in adjacent areas will depend on the distance from the airport,” a top official said. However, he said the state government has not approached them yet. The government had earlier run into AAI restrictions when the CM proposed skyscrapers around Hussainsagar five years ago. The flagpost erected at Sanjeevaiah Park too faced similar issues in 2016. While the government had proposed 303 feet or 295 feet, AAI allowed only 167 feet, later with the permission of AAI authorities in Delhi, it was raised to 275 feet. Even the new secretariat was proposed to have multi-storeyed structure with one architect suggesting a 278-foot building. Later, it was restricted to six floors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/aai-norms-may-derail-govts-grand-chest-hospital-plans/articleshow/83820202.cms||Koride Mahesh

They were brought to Hyderabad and formally arrested on Thursday. Rachakonda police said Mayur Sharad Hadkar, the director of a private company in Mumbai, and G Vinod Sharma, an employee of the company, were arrested. After their arrest, police froze Rs 12 lakhs belonging to the accused in different bank accounts. A victim from the city approached police claiming that he was contacted by some persons over the phone and they explained about the virtual gold trading, promising high returns. By believing their scheme, he invested Rs 8.50 lakhs. During the investigation, police came to know that Philip Chan, a Singapore national, and C Vijay of Mumbai started three different companies in Mumbai and Gujarat offering gold buying and selling schemes. Mayur was appointed director of one of the three companies, whereas Vinod was an employee of the other company. Prime accused Philip started different websites and his associates in India used to manage it by contacting the prospective victims over the phone and WhatsApp offering to invest in gold and silver trading. “When the victims show interest to invest in the funds, the accused provided a user ID, password and web links of their websites. Once the victim login and purchase the virtual gold coins/bars by deposing money into accounts provided on the website, initially they were shown some virtual profits on the investment. When the victim tried to withdraw money, the withdraw option was removed and the victims were cheated,’’ Rachakonda police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-including-firm-director-held-in-mumbai-for-fraud-gold-schemes/articleshow/83820239.cms||---

The offences which were committed between 2018 and 2019 and came to light a few months back after the original landowners applied for information under the RTI Act pertaining to the mutation cases, as they maintained that they had not sold their properties in question to anybody. The complaint pertains to 13 files submitted for mutation involving 4-5 properties, sources said. Interestingly, while the files went missing from the office, inquiries by the mamlatdar’s office with the office of the sub-registrar revealed that no such sale deeds were ever registered in the office. The documents were thus found to be forged. The original land owners then filed an appeal in the case before the court of the deputy collector which ruled that that the properties in question be reverted to the appelants. Following a hearing conducted in the matter in the court of the deputy collector, the land ownership was, however, reverted to the original land owners, it was informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/complaint-filed-for-submitting-fake-sale-deeds/articleshow/83822775.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

With this, the crucial examination will be now held at six centres in Maharashtra — Pune, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Aurangabad, Mumbai and Nagpur.

The examination will now be held across 75 centres across the country and candidates are given an option to change their centres as per their convenience in the wake newly added centres. Colonel Amit Dalvi (Retired), director of Services Preparatory Institute (SPI), said the decision by UPSC to increase the exam centres would avoid the travelling for many students and their parents during the pandemic situation. “With only two centres in Maharashtra earlier, many students were experiencing waste of time and energy in travelling from their home town to the designated examination centre. We hope that the arrangement of increased examination centre stays in future too,” he said.

Recent research in different countries have revealed this, the advisor said. The advisor Dr Sheetal Mistry pointed out that the research was conducted in 31 countries by 150 scientists. He added that they had concluded that Covid-19 spread more during spring and autumn when pollination took place. Mistry said that in India, spring prevailed from February to May while September and October were autumn months. He added that over the years pollination had also increased due to climate change. “When inhaled, pollens affected immunity and a person became prone to infections including viral infections. The pollen can also work a bioaerosols and carry the infection from one person to another,” Mistry said. Mistry pointed out that the wave in spring was large as compared to that in September and October. He added that if one went by this, the next big wave would hit in February 2022. “We must focus on vaccination to ensure this does not happen. But a lot will also depend on how the vaccine works against mutant strains,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/pollination-effecting-covid-spread-expert/articleshow/83817639.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC pulls down 165 political flags, banners from vax centres in 15 days||Mumbai: It’s been more than 20 days since BMC commissioner I S Chahal banned political party hoardings, banners and flags at vaccination centres, but a few centres still sport them, claim activists. According to BMC data, 165 illegal political flags and banners have been removed from across the city between June 1 and 15. In comparison, civic officials said, all through last month 170 such illegal paraphernalia were pulled down. “We also issued letters to several politicians to voluntarily take down party hoardings, banners and posters on vaccination centre premises,” an official said. RTI activist Anil Galgali said though the number of such illegalities has reduced, it has not been curbed entirely. “Civic officials remove the posters and hoardings, but they are put up again after they leave. Often, the local politicians also try to pressure the authorities to not take down the banners and posters,” he claimed. But a corporator, refusing to be named, argued that if elected representatives facilitate private vaccination drives, they should be allowed to put up their hoardings and banners. “From managing crowds at civic centres to ensuring eligible beneficiaries are made aware of the walk-in facility, we have been at the forefront since the vaccination drive began. So, why should we not be allowed to put up our party banners or posters,” the corporator questioned.Activists countered the argument by stating that politicians have created “selfie galleries” in the guise of facilitating vaccination drives to promote themselves. “With BMC elections next year, they want to be visible to their voters and party heads. But civic vaccination centres have been set up using taxpayers’ money, so why do politicians promote themselves there?” asked Chembur resident Kala Suresh. King Circle resident Nikhil Desai said party hoardings and banners have been taken down in his ward. “But a few days ago, many citizens only saw banners and hoardings when they went to the vaccination centres, but no slots,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-pulls-down-165-political-flags-banners-from-vax-centres-in-15-days/articleshow/83823004.cms||Richa Pinto

Bank deposits showed a promising 16% growth in 2020-21 to settle at Rs 8.8 lakh crore, according to the latest State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) report. The last time bank deposits were at this level was during the demonetisation year i.e. in 2016-17.“Most companies in all the sectors except pharmaceuticals and chemicals, did not make any capital expenditures due to the pandemic situation, lockdown and a drastic fall in demand. Due to this, all the surplus funds were parked in banks. As a result, bank deposits grew tremendously well in the pandemic year,” said a well-placed source in SLBC.Even financial consultants said that corporate funds continued to remain parked in banks.Mumukshu Desai, director of an Ahmedabad-based financial consultancy firm, said, “Till June-July, the banks saw tremendous inflow of deposits both from individuals as well as corporates. However, as curbs eased, while retail participation declined, corporates continued to keep their money parked into banks. Most big companies invest only a small chunk of their funds into equity-markets whereas the remaining is kept in fixed deposits and invested in debt-mutual funds. With expansion plans and new projects coming to a halt due to the pandemic, the money held on by companies continued to remain in the banks, causing a surge in deposits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lesser-capital-expenditure-by-industries-pushes-bank-deposits-up/articleshow/83824890.cms||Niyati Parikh

The order on Thursday came a day after Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee had announced it, explaining why these women need vaccine protection before the third wave. For the city, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has been asked to implement this drive while district magistrates and CMOHs (chief medical officer health) have been given the responsibility in the rest of the state. “Since there is a hypothesis of more children getting infected during the third wave, strategies like this will be helpful in protecting kids. As there is no vaccine yet for children, the best alternative is to immunize adults who will be in close contact with them,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhyay. Times ViewThe decisions appear to be the result of research and following the virus’s trend elsewhere. The implementation, too, will have to be as planned and methodical. Hopefully, the measures will help in curbing the disease’s spread.“On Wednesday, we already had a preliminary discussion on including mothers who have children up to the age of 12 into the drive. We have scheduled a KMC Covid Health Committee meeting on Friday where we will discuss on steps to be taken up so that we can start implementing it at the earliest,” said Rajya Sabha MP Santanu Sen, the health advisor to KMC’s board of governors. KMC officials are expected to discuss on the modalities. Issues like mechanisms to identify this group of mothers, organizing special camps to inoculate them or if they could walk into any government vaccination centres will be clearer after the Friday meeting. While a section of women between 18-44 are taking the jab at private centres, those who cannot afford the shot have been left out of the drive. This step by the state government has given a relief to the likes of Rina Mistry of Patipukur, who has two children aged 4 and 7. His husband, a bus conductor, has already got the jab from RG Kar Medical College. In addition, the state health department has also included construction workers in the vaccination drive on a priority basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mom-kid-vax-order-a-day-after-cm-prod/articleshow/83820308.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Given the sheer numbers at play, the state is firming up a plan to stock up on essential medicines and kits on a massive scale, which may require tweaking purchase policies as well. Authorities expect the maximum active caseload to touch eight lakh, of which four lakh are presumed likely to seek public health support. The 50 lakh cases are assumed to include five lakh children, of which 2.5 lakh will be expected to visit public centres. Within this subset, 3.5% children (that is 8,750) may require admission and treatment under supervision of paediatricians. The data was part of a presentation made before chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “No final figures yet, two/three projections needs to be studied and converged. Our presentation was based on assumptions. As suggested by the task force, we will fine-tune it,” state health commissioner N Ramaswamy said. Read AlsoCovid vaccination: Maharashtra gives record 5 lakh jabs in a day amid hours-long queuesThe number of daily Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in Maharashtra hit a record high of 5 lakh on Monday, a day after the state touched a low of one lakh vaccinations due to shortage. The state is hoping to cross the milestone of overall 1.5 crore vaccinations by Tuesday, principal healthMedical education director T P Lahane said the caseload from the third wave may not cross 40 lakh but the administration will have to keep infrastructure ready for 50 lakh patients. “In the first wave, we had 19 lakh cases. In the second, it crossed 40 lakh. Since new variants are emerging, it will be difficult to predict the number of cases in the third wave. We are prepared… but we do not know if there will be third wave at all,” Lahane told TOI. The public health department has submitted a Rs 1,676-crore proposal for its contingency plan: Rs 782 crore to procure essential medicines and consumables for Covid and Covid-associated diseases and Rs 893 crore for newer medicines required for treatment of mild to moderate Covid patients. Going by the presentation, plans have been firmed up to ensure stocks of essential medicines and testing kits do not run out. During the first and second wave, 6.9 lakh vials of remdesivir were given till June 24. It’s been estimated that eight lakh will be required for the third wave. Similarly, in the first two waves, one crore RT-PCR and 70 lakh rapid antigen tests were used up. Now, an inventory for 1.25 crore RT-PCR and 87.5 lakh antigen tests is being readied. Read AlsoMaharashtra: Vaccination for age group 18 to 44 not to start on May 1; lockdown to be extended by 15 daysTope also informed that the state will need 12 crore doses to vaccinate these people and it will cost Rs 6,500 crore.A senior official said a new policy will have to be worked out for use and procurement of new medicines, particularly those which are not in protocols published by the state or central government. “We have to take a policy decision depending on evidence-based technical advice before purchase,” he said. Issues involved in purchasing are being resolved on top priority. The key issues which Maharashtra hopes to iron out are: insufficient supply of essentials as demand peaks leading to shortage, limited response from drug manufacturers, fluctuating prices, differential pricing for the same medicines, and the fact that government of India (GOI) has not specified rates and schedules of supply for essential drugs, which allows manufacturers to vary their prices and supply schedules. An official said the purchase policy will need to be altered as the present one was drafted in 2016 when it was decided that purchases above Rs 3 lakh would need an e-tender and administrative approval. “We need to bring key changes in procurement of medicines. We need simultaneous processing of purchase and administrative approval, purchase from GOI-allotted manufacturers at the rate quoted by manufacturers. Above all, we need complete exemption from Dec 1, 2016 purchase policy directives,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-expects-50-lakh-cases-in-third-wave-works-to-stock-up-on-essentials/articleshow/83828281.cms||---

---||Pune||Maharashtra expects 50 lakh cases in third Covid wave, works to stock up on essentials||MUMBAI: Maharashtra’s public health department has estimated that in the event of a third Covid wave, the state will record approximately 50 lakh cases, of which 25 lakh will rely on government-run medical facilities or Covid care centres. Given the sheer numbers at play, the state is firming up a plan to stock up on essential medicines and kits on a massive scale, which may require tweaking purchase policies as well. Authorities expect the maximum active caseload to touch eight lakh, of which four lakh are presumed likely to seek public health support. The 50 lakh cases are assumed to include five lakh children, of which 2.5 lakh will be expected to visit public centres. Within this subset, 3.5% children (that is 8,750) may require admission and treatment under supervision of paediatricians.

The action was stopped after the PMC court intervened. A citizen approached the municipal court raising objections to the action after the demolition drive started. “The defendant shall not demolish the suit property till the next date,” the order said. Several houses in the slums along the nullah, which civic officials said are illegal, were razed in the action. These areas had suffered huge losses after the flooding in September 2019. The residents opposed the action saying that it was carried out without any notice to them. Heavy police deployment was made as tension prevailed in the area. Three local residents poured petrol over themselves and tried to set themselves ablaze, but timely police intervention prevented any untoward incident. As the anti-encroachment drive started, citizens raised objections saying that it was illegal. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone III) Pournima Gaikwad said, “Barring a few verbal altercations, the action by PMC remained peaceful. People protested, but no untoward incident was reported. By afternoon, the people calmed down and the action was carried out.” A strong police bandobast was maintained in and around Ambil Odha since 6am on Thursday, Gaikwad said.  “The action started in the morning and citizens were informed about it. They were told to leave their houses but many still occupied the properties so a demolition drive was conducted,” the civic official said. “People living here for the last 40 to 50 years want an assurance that the slum rehabilitation project will be carried out at the same location and that they will be resettled at the same site,” local corporator Dheeraj Ghate said. He said talks for shifting all the people were on for the last three months but Thursday’s action was taken before they could arrive at a solution.  NCP leaders blamed the BJP and mayor Murlidhar Mohol for not taking precautions. “The mayor and the ruling BJP cannot pass the buck to the civic administration. The BJP is equally at fault for the suffering which the residents of Ambil Odha areas faced on Thursday,” the party leaders added .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/protests-mark-ambil-odha-anti-encroachment-drive/articleshow/83820322.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Forest department has wetland development plans for backwaters of Ujani dam||KOLHAPUR: The Solapur division of the forest department is likely to undertake the task of wetland development in the Ujani dam backwaters. The Bhigwan section of the backwaters, spread over 357 square kilometres, has been selected for the wetland development. The dam lying on the borders of Pune, Solapur and Ahmednagar districts is used for irrigation and pisciculture. The backwaters created by it is one of the largest such waterbody in Asia and is a home to a large number of migratory birds. Dhairyashil Patil, deputy conservator of forests of Solapur division, said, “The road improvement works in our region are mandated to use some funds of the project towards environmental conservation and development efforts. The Environmental Appraisal Committee therefore recommended utilising funds up to Rs 80 lakh towards the development of Bhigwan wetland of the Ujani backwaters.” He added that this wetland is known for arrival of migratory birds such as flamingoes, bar-headed geese, painted stork and other species of ducks and waders. “We have proposed the plan with two objectives — one to protect and develop the wetland and second to provide jobs to as many as 1,000 local youths through eco-tourism.” The wetland project involves plantation of sledges, shores and aquatic vegetation. The plantation of sledges can create habitat for marsh species such as crakes, rails, moor hens, coots and some species of ducks. The floating vegetation will help growth of Jacana species. The project also involves creating artificial nesting sites which includes floating nesting platforms to nesting baskets and elevated nesting platforms. The bird population from Bhigwan site will be monitored for three years and radio telemetry of some species such as flamingoes and bar-headed geese will be carried out by fitting these birds with transmitters to study their pattern of migration for two years. The forest department has also considered testing the water here as a Solapur University study showed the presence of high level of pollutants in the backwaters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/forest-dept-has-wetland-development-plans-for-backwaters-of-ujani-dam/articleshow/83820305.cms||---

---||Pune||2 cops, informer hurt in mob attack during police search at Warje colony||Pune: Two constables from the city police crime branch and an informer were injured after a mob of around 150 residents of the Mhada colony in Warje attacked them on Tuesday evening when they went to a flat in search of firearms. The residents, mostly youngsters, nursed a grudge against the police informer for giving tip-offs, resulting in “frequent visits, searches and their harassment” by the police. The mob attacked with bamboo sticks, cement paver blocks and stumps. The two constables — Shrikant Arun Dagade (33) and Hrishikesh Kolap — were also assaulted despite Dagade telling the residents that they were policemen in plain clothes. The informer suffered serious injuries in head, chest and legs. Dagade and Kolap received injuries to their back and neck. All of them were treated in a private hospital in Warje. On Dagade’s complaint, the Warje police registered an FIR under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of duty), 141 (to overawe by criminal force), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapon) and 149 (unlawful assembly). “We have also sought a legal opinion on the application of IPC Section 353 (obstructing public servant from performing duty) in the matter,” senior inspector Shankar Katke said. He said, “We have identified 28 people, including some women. The process of arresting them will begin this (Thursday) evening. The injured informer has named these 28 people.” Dagade and Kolap, on patrol in Warje on Tuesday evening, met the informer at the Ramnagar Chowk at 6pm. He told them about a country-made firearm and some ammunition with a resident. Dagade then sought help of his friend, Mayur Kadam, to take them to the colony in his four-wheeler. They reached the colony around 7.15pm. Kadam stayed back in his vehicle, while Dagade, Kolap and the informer proceeded towards the fourth floor flat of a building. Dagade stated in the FIR that while they were climbing up the stairs, some youngsters gathered in the staircase and gave them a suspicious look. Others gathered outside the building. When the constables reached the flat, a woman told them that the person they were looking for was not at home. The constables sensed trouble and were leaving the place, when the mob charged them. The informer was first attacked. Dagade and Kolap tried to rescue him, and were attacked too, the constable’s statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-cops-informer-hurt-in-mob-attack-during-police-search-at-warje-colony/articleshow/83820348.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Covid brings down office rentals by 5-20% in Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Covid-19 and increased adoption of work-from-home (WFH) have hit office rentals in Ahmedabad. The average office space rentals in the city have declined in the range of 5% to 20% since the outbreak of the pandemic. The drop in rentals, according to industry stakeholders, varied depending upon the size and location as well as owner of the office spaces. While offices having area of 500 to 2,000 sq ft have seen their rentals dip by 15-20%, the reduction in properties bigger than 2,000 square foot (sq ft) is comparatively less at 5-10%, said industry players.“Work-from-home, tenants opting for smaller offices, low demand for co-working spaces and corporates holding their expansions have led to a reduction in office rentals,” said Pravin Bavadiya, founder president, Ahmedabad Realtors’ Association.“Persistently high supply in the face of already high vacancy, weak occupier demand, bleak business environment caused by income disruptions and operational roadblocks due to Covid-19 impacted office rentals. Threat of a resurgent virus and effectiveness of remote working strategies has also contributed to the drop,” said Balbirsingh Khalsa, national director- industrial& logistics, Knight Frank India, which pegged office space vacancy in Ahmedabad at 46.4%. “Average office rentals plummeted in Ahmedabad due to sluggish demand in the wake of Covid-19. The office space inventory was already high, and several tenants vacated offices — where rents were high — following work from home,” said Dipen Thakkar, a city-based real estate consultant.“Some correction was anyways due in rentals even before Covid-19 because of the increased supply, high inventory levels and availability of spaces in affordable zones. However, Covid-19 and work from home added more pressure on office rentals,” said Thakkar.According to the real estate consultant Knight Frank India, rentals for offices above 2,000 sq ft in the city’s central business district (CBD) eased by 5.5% to Rs 37-43 per sq ft a month in January-March quarter. The CBD includes areas such as Bodakdev, Keshav Baug, Prahladnagar, Satellite, SG Highway and Thaltej. Real estate brokers further said that the average monthly rentals have dipped from Rs 40-35 per sq ft to Rs 35-30 per sq ft in areas stretching from Ashram Road to SG Highway with smaller office spaces taking a harder hit.“The small office segment is largely dominated by investors with limited holding capacity, who panicked and started offering low rates. The reduction is comparatively less for offices above 2,000 sq. ft. This type of inventory is usually held by developers, who understand the market dynamics and hence they do not panic, said real estate brokers. “Although there is a decline in office space rentals, the reduction in temporary. The office space market will bounce back within a year,” added Ajay Patel, president, CREDAI Ahmedabad-GIHED, a body of city-based real estate developers.Real estate players opine that present rental are attractive and the time is ideal for long-term leasing contracts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-brings-down-office-rentals-by-5-20-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/83824943.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Experts suggest vaccination card entry plan for malls, halls||KOLKATA: The 10-member expert committee set up by the state government, after its first meeting on Thursday, has suggested several measures to counter the third wave. The committee has suggested, among other things, making vaccine certificates a must to enter shopping malls and setting up of an epidemiologist team to identify the viral strains that could dominate the third wave. “Strain identification of the virus is very important as this would be helpful in determining whether that particular strain is more or less virulent than previous strains. There is the need to form an epidemiologist team without any delay for this task,” said the proposal. The proposal that vaccination cards be made mandatory for adults to enter places like malls and movie halls has found resonance with physicians who felt that the move would enhance safety in large air-conditioned spaces that are potential crowd-pullers. Two malls in the city had in fact toyed with the idea of introducing a no-vaccine-no-entry policy but dropped it after retailers opposed the move. At least five malls in the city currently have vaccination centres housed in them. The state has already started ramping up paediatric Covid facilities in terms of infrastructure and manpower because of the hypothesis that more children could be affected in the third wave. While the government has already set up an expert paediatrics team, another expert committee was set up on Tuesday for monitoring the overall evolving situation. The committee also proposed that at least 80% of patients admitted in general wards should have access to centralised oxygen supply. While most government-run hospitals in the city and some in medical colleges in districts have LMO tanks, the problem is with district and sub-divisional hospitals. Health department sources said efforts are on to install LMO tanks in those hospitals as well. “Number of SNCU and PICU beds should be scaled up in next two weeks,” said the proposal. Most hospitals in Kolkata, including RG Kar, BC Roy Hospital for Children, Medical College Hospital and Chittaranjan Seva Sadan are confident of getting between 10 and 25 beds prepared during this time frame. Giving special preference to children with co-morbidity as and when a vaccine for children is rolled out, adequate supply of protective gears like N95 mask and a protocol for prophylactic ivermectin to Covid-negative mothers who would be admitted along with their infected children was also proposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/experts-suggest-vax-card-entry-plan-for-malls-halls/articleshow/83820342.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Delhi||Delhi: Soon, learner’s driving licence test to be conducted online||NEW DELHI: In about a week, those applying for a learner’s driving licence in Delhi will not need to visit the regional transport office. Instead, they will acquire an e-licence after an online test. The e-licence, a first of its type in the country, is part of the transport department’s ‘faceless services’ that were kicked off in February. While the main software was prepared by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), a new face-recognition software has now been developed to ensure only genuine candidates appear for the test. “We could have launched the NIC software earlier, but we wanted the face-recognition component to also be installed. This will ensure that only a bona-fide applicant will sit for the test,” Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI. “We want to ensure this because the entire exercise is connected with road safety. We also wanted the applicant to be aware that somebody was watching.” The transport minister added, “The rest of the entire system is ready and it may be launched in another week’s time. For the learner’s licence, the applicants learn about the traffic rules, while the permanent driving test is a skills test. The online test ensures that the aspirants become conversant with road signage and other rules.” From February 18, the transport department has rendered 12 of its most transaction-heavy services completely online. The e-licence, which will be valid for six months, is part of the next phase of faceless services. Applicants will first have to register on the department’s website and get an appointment to take the test. An online tutorial is available. The 10-minute learner’s licence test has objective type questions and the applicant needs to score at least six out of 10 marks to qualify for the licence. Following this, a colour blindness test will also be conducted online. Once the applicant clears that, an e-licence will be issued to him or her. The transport department’s website will have a dedicated web link for the e-licence service. All information about the service related to fees, minimum age, other eligibility norms, documents required, etc., will be available on the website, apart from frequently asked questions. To help those attempting the test, a question bank and quizzes are also available. The transport department is moving towards a completely faceless services, with physical presence of personnel limited in the future to the automated driving test tracks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/face-it-get-learners-dl-online-but-you-cannot-fake-this-test/articleshow/83822947.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Offline CET for junior college admission likely between end-July & early August||MUMBAI: An offline common entrance test (CET) for Class X students of all boards for admission to Class XI in junior college in the state is set to be held between end-July and early August. The state government on Thursday issued a notification announcing the optional CET and giving details about the proposed exam. Though optional, the CET score will be given preference during admission. The CET will be conducted two weeks after the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) results are announced by July 15, the notification said. The exam date and centres will be announced later. The 100-mark CET will be for two hours. The exam will be based on the SSC syllabus and will include English, Mathematics, Science and Social Science (25 questions from each subject). After cancellation of SSC exams in April due to Covid, the state had decided to conduct a CET for admission to class XI. The CET scores will be given preference during the first round of online admission. Students who do not take the CET will be considered based on their SSC marks after that round. The work of uploading marks of SSC students is underway. The state is evaluating SSC students on a 50:50 ratio of class IX and X scores. The state has clarified that all students will get admission in class XI as data for 2020-21 shows 32% of first year junior college seats were vacant last year after the admission was completed. Class XI admissions for the academic year 2020-21 had stretched to March this year. All SSC students have been promoted to class XI. The CET will be conducted by the state education board that conducts the SSC and HSC exams. A six- member committee headed by the education commissioner has been constituted. State board students will not have to pay CET fees as they have already paid SSC exam fees. Students of other boards will have to pay the exam fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-offline-cet-for-jr-college-admission-likely-between-end-july-early-aug/articleshow/83822955.cms||Sandhya Nair

The cheating occurred on April 27, but an FIR was registered on Wednesday by the Alankar police after an initial verification of the victim’s complaint application by the cyber police. Senior inspector Santosh Barge of the Alankar police said, “On April 27 morning, the victim received a phone call from a man who identified himself as a representative of the UPI application. The caller told the victim that the latter had not been utilising his UPI aptly and, hence, was not getting appropriate rewards for money transfers done by using the application.” “The caller asked the victim to follow certain steps to get maximum rewards. The victim thought he would get rewards for using the UPI application and decided to follow the steps the caller told him to do,” Barge said. “The caller kept asking him about four-digit numbers received as text messages on his cellphone and the victim went on sharing the PINs with the suspect,” he added. “The caller kept on ordering electronics and other articles from an online shopping site. The victim received text messages containing PINs and he shared these with the suspect,” he said. “The suspect purchased articles worth Rs92,000,” he said. Police have registered an offence of cheating and also invoked provisions of the Information Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kothrud-man-loses-rs-92000-to-upi-app-reward-bait/articleshow/83820388.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Maidan’s Fountain of Joy ranks among world’s best, makes Kolkata proud||KOLKATA: The Fountain of Joy in the Maidan opposite Victoria Memorial Hall has featured among the world’s 26 leading fountains listed by a popular global travel portal. The three-tier cascading fountain in Kolkata, only the second in India after the one at Mysore’s Brindavan Gardens, is the only Indian fountain to feature on the list — prepared by travel portal loveexploring.com — that includes the iconic Trevi fountain in Rome that was completed in 1762. Also on the list are Latona Fountain at the Palace of Versailles in France; Jet d’Eau in Geneva, Switzerland; Fountains of Bellagio in Las Vegas, US, and King Fahd’s Fountain in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. “The Fountain of Joy, India’s largest dancing fountain, has emerged as the city’s landmark after being featured in the prestigious World’s incredible water displays,” said a spokesperson of CESC that maintains the fountain. The Fountain of Joy was first commissioned 30 years ago in 1991. At the time, the city had just emerged from an era of power cuts and Rama Prasad Goenka, the chairman of the RP Goenka group, wanted to give the city something that would drive away the nightmares that the city had suffered through the 1970s and 1980s. His desire though was to make the Fountain of Joy a landmark. Inaugurated by then chief minister Jyoti Basu, Goenka had envisaged it to become a tourist attraction and a meeting place for artists, musicians, poets and other intellectuals. The fountain, however, lost its charm over time and the shows stopped by the turn of the century. With the rush of visitors gone, the area would turn into a criminal den after sundown. Families avoided the stretch and preferred to hang out near the Victoria south gate. It was CM Mamata Banerjee’s penchant for lights and her keenness to beautify the city so that it could rub shoulders with other megapolises that inspired CESC to revive the fountain with improved technology and visual effects in 2012. It was integrated with a computer-embedded software that allows musical choreography with water features, light and sound with 26 pumps of different capacities. The average water display is approximately 15,800 litres per minute, the central nozzle sprays water to a height of 25m. The song and music sequences with dancing fountain effects are show-cased every evening from 6pm to 9pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/maidans-fountain-of-joy-ranks-among-worlds-best-makes-kolkata-proud/articleshow/83820424.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Aurangabad||Demand for separate raillway division for Aurangabad||AURANGABAD: Highlighting several pending demands related to rail connectivity and infrastructure of Aurangabad, different advocacy groups have now demanded that a separate railway division should be created for Aurangabad. Railway activist Anant Borkar said the new division can include Aurangabad and Jalna districts from Marathwada along with a few other districts from the Central Maharashtra. “Carving of a new division is essential to ensure Aurangabad gets improved rail connectivity and have state-of-the-art infrastructure. Despite being hailed as the tourism capital of Maharashtra, Aurangabad is neglected by the South Central Railway (SCR),” he said. Aurangabad is currently part of Nanded division of the SCR. Listing out pending demands, railway activist Omprakash Varma said a new rail route on Aurangabad-Chalisgaon continues to remain a distant dream. “The desired rail route is expected to give push to the development of the region. Besides, there is no official progress on demand for laying down new route between Aurangabad-Pune and Rotegaon-Kopargaon,” he said. The railway activists also drew attention towards the pending demand for raising a pit-line in Aurangabad. “Even the division-level authorities had said on record that a pit-line would be raised at Chikalthana in Aurangabad. Such announcement turned out to be a hollow promise as no official progress has been made in the past five years,” Borkar said. He also highlighted the need of speeding up the work of track-doubling and electrification in Marathwada. As regards to improving the rail connectivity, activists have demanded new trains to Mumbai, Bengaluru or Mysore, Gujarat and Goa from Aurangabad. SCR general manager Gajanan Mallya could not be reached for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/demand-for-separate-rly-divn-for-aurangabad/articleshow/83820353.cms||---
---||Pune||Rupee bank considers equity plan for revival||Pune: The administrators of the stressed Rupee Cooperative Bank are planning to reach out to high-value depositors, as part of a plan to revive the bank as a small finance institution. The plan is a contingency if the proposed merger with the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank, under scrutiny by the Reserve Bank of India, is nixed. Bank administrator Sudhir Pandit said the plan involved encouraging high-value depositors to convert their deposits to equity in the bank, which would provide part of the liquidity to revive the institution. “As a bank, we have no issues except a negative net worth. Around 4,000 depositors hold 45% of the total deposits — around Rs 580 crore; 99% hold the other 55%. If the bank is liquidated, the high-value depositors —mostly senior citizens — will not be able to get most of their funds. So, the idea is to convince them to convert their deposits into equity so that the bank is revived as a small finance institution and they can get their funds back in time,” Pandit told TOI.

The Supreme Court on Thursday, while hearing a petition relating to Central Board of Secondary Education(CBSE), Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) and state board exams, directed all states to notify alternative assessment patterns in 10 days. Though states need not have a uniform assessment methodology, the apex court wants all education boards to declare results by July 31. The CBSE and CISCE have told the court about declaring results by the end of July. State education officers are interacting with principals and teachers before arriving at a marking system. Academicians are in favour of a CBSE-like evaluation criterion in which scores of classes X, XI and XII in a 30:30:40 ratio are being considered. Sources in the education department said they are examining if more weightage should be given to class X scores as the exam (2018-19) was conducted before the Covid outbreak. Most principals and teachers said least weightageshould be given to class XI scores (2019-20) as students’ performance was below par.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hsc-board-struggling-to-solve-assessment-fix/articleshow/83825075.cms||Sandhya Nair

The civic administration had issued notices to the tenants and the owners of these structures, telling them to vacate the properties. But they did not follow the directives,” said Sudhir Kadam, a senior PMC official. Kadam said that the structures have been categorised into three types — C1, C2, C3. The most dangerous buildings have been put in C1, while structures which need major repairs have been placed in C2. The C3 category structures need minor repairs.“We will continue with the demolition drive. The structures in the C2 category can go into the C1 category after heavy rains, so we need to keep a constant watch on these properties,” said Kadam. The PMC action was taken mostly in peth areas, such as Somwar Peth, Kasba Peth, Ghorpade Peth, Mangalwar Peth, and other nearby areas. The civic administration had sought police help to vacate dangerous wadas in some cases. Some properties have been partially demolished, while some were razed totally. Many accidents occur due to falling of wadas during the rainy season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-razes-33-extremelydangerous-wadas-in-2-months/articleshow/83820508.cms||---

Around 3,000 trees were planted during the drive that began from the bridge on Nandini river on Satpur-Ambad link road. Bhalerao said this is a part of measures to make Nandini river pollution free. The Godavari river has three tributaries — Nandini, Waghadi and Waldevi — that flow in the city. “In fact, Godavari and other three tributaries are the soul of the city. Godavari is the lifeline of Nashik city. The pollution of these rivers is the major concern for us. We need to make the rivers pollution free,” she said. “Hence, we undertook the tree plantation drive on the banks of the Nandini river as part of river conservation measures,” she added. Meanwhile, Bhalerao recently met municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav and urged him to form a special task force to stop pollution in Nandini river and also earmark funds for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/corporator-plants-trees-on-banks-of-nandini-river/articleshow/83820470.cms||---

France is the country closest to Maharashtra in terms of tally, with 57.6 lakh cases so far. The daily cases and deaths due to the ongoing second wave continued to drop in the state and city. The state added 9,844 fresh cases and 197 deaths on Thursday, taking the total deaths to 1,19,859; and 359 unreported deaths were added to the cumulative tally. On Thursday, 773 cases were detected in Mumbai from 35,746 tests and the test positivity rate was 2.1%. The city’s total case tally has now climbed to 7.2 lakh. After a sudden spike in deaths on Wednesday (23), the city registered 10 deaths. The total toll in Mumbai stands at 15,348. “The slight daily fluctuations are most possibly due to crowding on streets after relaxation of restrictions. The cases are generally between 500 and 900 in the city at present,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. The daily number of tests has gone up in Mumbai due to testing at crowded places such as railway stations and markets. BMC higher-ups had in April said they would target 45,000 tests daily in Mumbai. As per a presentation made in the cabinet on Wednesday, the weekly growth rate of Covid-19 cases dropped to 0.15% and doubling rate has increased to 460 days from 190 days in May.

---||Nagpur||Chandrapur: Hours after national tiger conservation authority OK, Tadoba opens safaris from today, but only till June 30||NAGPUR: With six days remaining for wildlife parks to close for the monsoon, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) on Thursday gave the go-ahead to open sanctuaries, national parks, and tiger reserves for tourism. On Wednesday, NTCA IG Dr Amit Mallick had said, “As the Covid situation has improved across the country, the chief wildlife wardens may take a call to open tiger reserves for tourism in consultation with local authorities.” After the death of two lions at Arignar Anna Zoological Park, besides reports of tigers and lions testing positive for Covid in Etawah, Mumbai, Jaipur, and Hyderabad zoos, on June 7, NTCA had ordered the closure of parks immediately. Now, taking cue from the order, Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) in Chandrapur has decided to open a jungle safari in the core area from Friday. “The safari will remain open till June 30, following all Covid-19 protocols. Other parks like Nagzira, Melghat, Pench can also open as per the directions of the respective district collectors,” said PCCF (wildlife) Nitin Kakodkar. The opening of Tadoba comes after more than two months of lockdown due to spread of Covid-19 cases. The park was closed from April 15, after it opened for safari from October 1. TATR field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar said, “Entry till June 30 will be offline and will be given on first-come-first-serve basis as per gate quota. A separate order will be issued for tourism in buffer zone during monsoon.” The NTCA decision followed by TATR management action has been welcomed. Tourists, who had only the option to visit tiger reserves in Madhya Pradesh since June 1, have welcomed the move. “The park was closed for the entire peak tourism season. The opening of parks, even for a short period, would refresh our minds from the sickening memories of the pandemic. Hopefully, it will also help park, resort owners, guides, and gypsy drivers get some income,” said Sakshi Yeramwar, wildlife lover. Even as Tadoba will be open, Pench CCF and field director Ravikiran Govekar said, “We will take a decision on Friday after we receive a go-ahead from the district collector, who heads the Disaster Management Authority (DMA). Bor will not open due to damage to roads by rains. However, monsoon tourism will remain open in buffer and separate order will be issued soon.” Meanwhile, even as Tadoba will close for the monsoon, buoyed by NTCA directive, deputy director (buffer) G Guruprasad said, “I’ve called a meeting of guides and drivers on Friday to discuss tourism in the buffer during monsoon. Mostly, it will start from all 13 gates from July 28. We will allow 12 vehicles in two shifts operating from 6am to 10am and from 2pm to 6pm.” Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) field director M Ramanujan said, “It is a good decision. We will open the park from Saturday, maybe with offline bookings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hours-after-ntca-ok-tadoba-opens-safaris-from-today-but-only-till-june-30/articleshow/83822876.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Pune||Students design edu applications for Toycathon||Pune: A game similar to Monopoly, but which also gives information about Indian cities and important monuments in it; an application which uses famous tunes to teach concepts like the Pythagoras theorem are some of the projects designed by Pune students participating in the Toycathon being organised by the Union ministry of education in collaboration with various other departments and ministries. A total of 1.29 lakh students registered for the competition and submitted 17,000 ideas. Nationally, 1,567 ideas were shortlisted for a three-day online finale which was held from June 22 to 24. The results for the digital Toycathon will be announced on June 26. Shravan Ambudkar, a final year mechatronics student at Symbiosis Skills and Professional University has partnered with two electronics and telecommunication engineering students of Dr D Y Patil Institute of Technology, Pimpri — Pranav Yambal and Purva Mahajan — for a project called Surification, which was selected for the grand finale. “After games, music is the most interesting thing for students. We also tend to remember tunes well. So we have used ready-made tunes and changed the lyrics to the explanation of a theorem or remembering a formula. Initially, we are launching this for school-going students,” said Ambudkar. The five-member team from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology called CreateAR is headed by Akhil Jaywant, a third-year electronics student. “We have used the concept of monopoly, but when we roll the dice, we get an Indian city and the humanoid chatbox tells us about the importance of the most famous and historically important monument in that place. Moreover, we have used the 360-degree video recording of the monument which can be seen by the player in Augmented Reality by tilting his or her phone,” said Jaywant. Shantanu Jadhav, a third-year electronics and telecommunication student along with his five team members developed a quiz competition application that covered topics related to India. “What made our app different was that it was not just a quiz, but there were-match the following, identify the picture, puzzles among others. Our target was 12 to 16 years olds,” said Jadhav. Pranav Patharkar and his team from Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering developed an app which made learning about periodic tables fun. “When the app is opened, there is be a link to an online article about various elements and the periodic table. After reading it, when the student closes the link, a quiz starts on the periodic table. This should help him or her remember the table better,” said Patharkar. Meanwhile, second-year Information technology student Varun Prasannan and his team had developed an app for children with limited motor skills. “Generally we play a game like car racing using arrows. Maybe the ‘up’ arrow will accelerate, the ‘left’ arrow will turn the car. But children with impaired movement cannot do it fast. So we developed an app, which uses the front camera in the computer. The camera catches the movement of the child’s hand and accordingly accelerates or turns,” said Prasannan. Vijay Mane, coordinator of Toycathon from the nodal centre of VIT, said the grand finale of the digital Toycathon was being held now, whereas the physical Toycathon will be done at a later stage due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/students-design-edu-applications-for-toycathon/articleshow/83820511.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Pune||Experts call for increased testing as 27 districts lag state average||Pune: Twenty seven districts in the state have been directed to ramp up daily Covid-19 testing for their failure to meet the state average, especially in the wake of the emergence of the Delta plus variant. According to a report submitted to the state cabinet on Wednesday, these districts have been found testing less than the state’s average of 3.08 lakh tests per 10 lakh population since the last month. Resultantly, the state health department has issued detailed guidelines to these districts to ramp up testing and contact tracing. Among the 27 districts, Hingoli, Nandurbar, Palghar, Dhule, Buldhana, Nanded, Parbhani, Kolhapur and Raigad feature at the bottom with an average of 1.5 lakh tests per 10 lakh population, state health officials said. “With the emergence of the Delta plus variant, districts have to increase testing and contact tracing,” director of health services Dr Archana Patil said. Patil has outlined the need for ILI/SARI surveillance in the areas of the index cases. So far, the Delta plus variant has been found in seven districts, including nine cases in Ratnagiri, seven in Jalgaon, two in Mumbai and one each in Palghar, Thane and Sindhudurg. The CM in his review meeting held on Thursday directed Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Hingoli districts to stay cautious and increase testing and contact tracing ahead of the impending threat of the third wave. Currently metros such as Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur and Thane have been conducting an average of 4 lakh tests per 10 lakh population, state health officials said, while adding that the testing numbers have come down in these metros over the last two-three weeks in the wake of the decline in cases. Public health experts have demanded that more genomic sequence should carried out. Former state health director Dr PP Doke said it was always better to be fully prepared and take all precautions to avert any kind of adverse event. With the Centre asking state to increase testing and ensuring containment measures, especially in the districts that have detected the Delta plus variants, he said besides increased testing, more samples from district should be sequenced, for which additional testing laboratories for genomic sequencing should be made available. “We have to increase the facilities for genomic sequencing to ensure that we are not caught unawares and data should be put out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-call-for-increased-testing-as-27-districts-lag-state-average/articleshow/83823155.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Ahmedabad||Panchayat polls: HC issues notice to govt, SEC||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Thursday issued notices to the State Election Commission and the state government in response to a petition filed by a runner-up in a taluka panchayat election taking objection to poll results declaring a deceased candidate winner. She has demanded that instead of the dead candidate, she as a runner-up in the election should be declared a winner. The case pertains to the taluka panchayat election results of Pimpan electoral division of Sanand taluka in Ahmedabad district. The polling took place on February 28 and votes were counted on March 2. Lilaben Thakor, as an independent candidate, secured 2,163 votes and Sonalba Vaghela came on second place with 1,409 votes. On March 8, Thakor was declared as a winner with highest number of votes. Unfortunately, Thakor passed away on March 1, a day ahead of counting of votes.On March 31, Vaghela moved the high court through advocates Nishit Gandhi and Vipul Sundesha questioning the election commission’s decision to declare Thakor a winner. Vaghela submitted that her agent had informed SEC about the demise of Thakor, and demanded that with her death, Thakor was disqualified from being a candidate in the election and therefore she could not have been declared a winner according to provisions of section 28 of the Gujarat Panchayats Act. But still she was declared a winner, her lawyers submitted. It was contended that the SEC’s decision to declare the deceased candidate a winner is completely illegal, unjustified and contrary to the Panchayats Act and Article 243F of the Constitution. The votes cast in favour of Thakor should have not been counted, and any order passed in favour or against a dead person is a nullity in the eye of law. After hearing, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justive V D Nanavati sought reply of the authorities and posted further hearing on this case on July 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/panchayat-polls-hc-issues-notice-to-govt-sec/articleshow/83825098.cms||---

---||Delhi||79 minutes for Dwarka to Noida Sector 62, 80 minutes to just get into a Delhi Metro station||NEW DELHI: On Wednesday 7pm, the average waiting time to enter Delhi Metro’s Rajiv Chowk station through gate number 7 was 1 hour 20 minutes, or 80 minutes. In comparison, it takes a passenger 79 minutes to travel from Dwarka Mor station to Noida Sector 62 station. While the average waiting time on Wednesday was unusually long, it has become usual for commuters to wait for 25 to 40 minutes before they can even enter the gates of a Metro station. The gates are also intermittently closed during peak hours to ensure stringent Covid norms are maintained inside the station. “These days, long queues are frequently observed outside Metro stations as the entry is regulated due to restrictions on the number of passengers allowed inside a train,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). At present, commuters can only sit on alternating seats with no standing passenger, limiting the carrying capacity of Metros to 10-15%, even as DMRC runs maximum number of trains. “The long queues are caused as only single entry points are permitted at most stations. This is because in a mass transit system like the Metro, it is difficult to regulate the number of people inside the system once entry is permitted,” Dayal said. Dayal said that DMRC is running 5,100 train trips every day, with a peak frequency of 2.5 minutes to 5 minutes on all major corridors. “This was the same frequency at which Metro was operating in the pre-Covid era. The Metro is thus operating and running at its full frequency and capacity, but with a reduced number of passengers owing to the restrictions,” he said. The stringent Covid norms have meant commuters are also trying to stagger their travel times as much as possible and the ridership, as a result, increased in the fortnight since Metro reopened. When Delhi Metro reopened for the public on June 7, a Monday, it witnessed 6.4 lakh ‘passenger journeys’, which increased to 10.3 lakh by Friday, June 11. With more relaxations allowed as part of the Unlock process, Metro’s ridership increased to 13.1 lakh passenger journeys on Monday, June 14 and stood at 14.9 lakh on Wednesday, June 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/79-mins-for-dwarka-to-noida-sec-62-80-mins-to-just-get-into-a-metro-stn/articleshow/83823188.cms||Sidharatha Roy

It once held the bust of then Portugal dictator and prime minister, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar. “This pedestal is a piece of history which was thrown in the garden. We have straightened it up and are going to give it to Fundacao de Oriente to preserve it,” CCP commissioner Agnelo Fernandes, said. The garden was inaugurated during Salazar’s 1952 visit to Goa and was named ‘Jardim António de Oliveira Salazar’. The bust was placed there in 1958. In 1963, after the integration of Goa into the Indian Union, the park was renamed after Goan freedom fighter Luis de Menezes Bragança. “After Goa’s liberation, people were in a frenzy and broke the Salazar bust. In 1963, when the garden was renamed Jardin de Luis de Menezes Braganza, the pedestal was replaced with the statue of Menezes Braganza,” Sardesai said. Though the pedestal has been lying in the garden since then, exposed to the ravages of nature, Sardesai pointed out how the quality of the stone and the Portuguese inscription upon it continues to be in good condition, even 61 years later. “Any board put up today starts rusting within a year. We must salute the artists that created the pedestal. Any aspect of historical value cannot be looked at as ‘something named after someone’ instead it requires to be restored as a piece of history. Every citizen must have consciousness and responsibility to preserve it,” Sardesai said. He further said that similar artifacts were found during the building of the new Patto bridge that were salvaged and have been placed in the traffic island behind the customs office. There are many more carved stones there that are yet to be recovered, he said. Sardesai, who is trying to rehabilitate such artifacts for posterity, said that measures must be taken by CCP to ensure that they’re protected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/salazar-pedestal-in-panaji-to-be-shifted/articleshow/83825160.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Pune||Poor biomedical waste disposal puts Maharashtra at greater risk of Covid: Study||MUMBAI: A gap analysis study conducted by the International Institute of Population Sciences (IIPS) indicates several states in the country are at increased risk of Covid-19 infections due to non-compliance to biomedical waste management rules. While the pandemic has led to a significant increase in biomedical waste generation, disposal facilities have not gone up proportionately, said the study. Global studies have associated increased Covid risks with a rise in biomedical waste (BMW). The ‘Assessment of Bio-Medical Waste Before and During the Emergency of Novel Coronavirus Disease Pandemic in India: A Gap Analysis’ study, published recently in the journal Waste Management & Research, highlights how most states fare poorly in terms of Covid-19 waste management. TimesViewMaharashtra’s poor record in recycling and safe disposal of waste reflects a lack of understanding about its impact on quality of life. Pollutants that contaminate our air, water and soil are bound to have a deleterious effect on public health and even get into the food chain.The study said 23 of the 35 states and union territories (UTs), including Maharashtra, still follow deep burial methods for waste disposal, restricted by the Centre. It said 70% of the states do not have well-established systems to regularly monitor their common BMW waste treatment facilities (CBMWTFs) and only 12 have upgraded their facilities as per new emission rules. Two hundred CBMWTFs are available across India but are insufficient to treat the large quantity of waste. Most states and UTs have almost reached their threshold capacity, it said. Professor Aparajita Chattopadhyay from IIPS, who supervised the study, said the government needs to prioritise states based on their BMW generation for policy decisions. “All states which generate over 100 metric ton a month should be considered high priority,” he said. There should be a special emphasis on hilly states, said Rahul Rajak, lead researcher, who studied the mismatch of facilities along with Ravi Kumar Mahto and Jitender Prasad.  Data from Central Pollution Control Board, used in the study, shows states such as Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Delhi, constituted over 70% of the Covid waste generated in the country. Statistics showed the country generated 32,996 metric ton of Covid waste from June to December 2020. Maharashtra was the worst offender before and after Covid (789.9 metric ton a month). Amar Supate, principal scientific officer, MPCB, said the state has adequate disposal facilities, though they are being augmented where necessary. “Excess BMW is generated in fewer districts such as Mumbai and Pune, and capacity enhancement is already planned. Currently, the excess waste is sent to nearby facilities. Setting up a disposal facility requires a feasibility study, environment clearance, among other things,” he said. The state has 30 such facilities and few new ones are proposed. On deep burial, he said the state permits it only in hilly and remote areas where captive treatment is not feasible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/poor-biomedical-waste-disposal-puts-maharashtra-at-greater-risk-of-covid-study/articleshow/83834881.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Engineer & hotel manager clone ATM cards after losing their jobs||MUMBAI: A mechanical engineer and a hotel manager are among three people arrested in an ATM card cloning racket. This is the second such case in Mumbai where point-of-sale machines (card swiping machines) were used by fraudsters. The case came to light when the accused tried to purchase a mobile phone with a cloned card. Dahisar police have seized 250 blank cards that the gang had used for cloning, besides 40 cloned cards. TimesViewWhile the Dahisar police have made swift arrests in the card cloning racket, convictions in cybercrime cases continue to be abysmally low in Mumbai. Between 2017 and 2019, 1,682 persons were arrested in Mumbai for various cyber offences, of which only 14 were convicted. Fast-track courts are needed to boost conviction rates in cybercrime. Improved police training and frequent software and hardware upgrades are also necessary.On June 21, police received a complaint that three men were trying to buy a phone with a cloned card at a store on SV Road. Investigation revealed that of the three, Akhil Shaikh, 48, and Raghavendra Shetty, 35, had been stealing ATM card data of bank customers for the past three months. The men had installed skimmers and micro cameras in various ATMs in Mumbai and Thane that would capture numbers and pins of customers’ cards. The data captured on these skimmers was then transferred onto blank cards. The cloned cards thus created were swiped through a POS machine which sent the victim’s money into a bank account operated by the gang. “Deepak Karande, 41, the third accused, had floated a bogus company called “The Star”. He opened a bank account in a large private sector bank in Kolkata in his company’s name. The bank then issued him a POS machine for business activities. But the gang systematically misused the POS machine,” said a police officer. From the Kolkata branch, the money is transferred to a second bank account opened in Nashik by the accused using fake documents. The money is finally withdrawn at Nashik. So far, the gang has duped 50 individuals of Rs 8 lakh between March and June this year. Shaikh, an engineer, and Shetty, a hotel manager, told the police they got involved in crime after losing their jobs to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-engineer-hotel-manager-clone-atm-cards-after-losing-their-jobs/articleshow/83825193.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Agra||Tax officer, cop die as truck rams into GST squad on Uttar Pradesh e-way in Mathura||AGRA: A commercial tax officer and a police constable were killed and five others -- among them a joint commissioner (special investigation branch) -- were seriously injured when a truck rammed into the squad checking goods vehicles on the Yamuna expressway after a tip-off about transportation of silver consignment from Delhi to Agra without paying GST. The accident took place in Mathura district on Wednesday night. Senior officials of the department suspected that it could have been a deliberate act. The truck driver was untraceable. The accident took place when joint commissioner Manoj Tripathi and his subordinates were checking vehicles after receiving “specific inputs” about the illegal transportation. The officer had set up a check-post near Milestone 60 on Yamuna expressway in Mathura’s Naujheel area when the truck drove into the personal car of joint commissioner Tripathi, leaving him seriously injured. Assistant commissioner Vinay Gupta, peon Vinod Kumar and driver Vijay Kumar sustained serious injuries. Commercial tax officer Virendra Singh and constable Kishore Kumar Shukla were killed. Additional commissioner of commercial tax department, Vinay Asthana, told TOI that Tripathi had “some specific information about transportation of a silver consignment from Agra to Delhi with GST evasion”. According to Asthana, they had parked their vehicles on the side of the expressway and the truck rammed directly into the joint commissioner's car. Asthana added, "It looks like a deliberate act." Mathura district magistrate Navneet Singh Chahal told TOI that Tripathi was rushed to Noida’s Fortis hospital and his condition was critical. The other three injured were in Noida’s Kailash hospital. SSP Guarav Grover said, “We will probe all the angles.” FIR will be registered on the basis of the complaint provided by the department, he said. Inspector general of Agra range, Naveen Arora, also reached Naujheel police station to inquire about the incident. He told TOI that the matter will be investigated in detail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/tax-officer-cop-die-as-truck-rams-into-gst-squad-on-up-e-way-jc-among-5-hurt/articleshow/83818056.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

A total of 188 Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)-run Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) are operating at present. Barring the 70 CVCs at the PMC-run hospitals/dispensaries, the rest have been made operational by the local corporators. These centres are mainly run at schools, community and marriage halls. The PMC provides free vaccine doses to these CVCs according to the availability and the centres, in turn, pass on the benefit of free vaccination to citizens. Besides, PMC also provides two nurses and a data entry operator for smooth vaccination. “About 70% vaccination at these CVCs is made through prior booking of online slots and the remaining 30% vaccination is done through walk-ins. The response has been very encouraging,” said Siddharth Dhede, a corporator from the Nagpur Chawl-Phulenagar area. Every CVC started through the local corporators get an equal number of doses. “We get at least 100 doses when the vaccines are available in adequate numbers. Over 11,000 people have been vaccinated at three local corporator initiated CVCs in our area so far,” Dhende said. Overcrowding and scramble scenarios at the vaccination centres have reduced significantly now because most of the prabhags (municipal areas) have about two to three CVCs made operational by the local corporators, besides the centres at the PMC-run hospitals/dispensaries. “We have four CVCs in our area. Of them, one is at a PMC-run hospital and the other three started through our initiative are at civic schools. Multiple CVCs have reduced crowding,” Dhede said. Rajabhau Laigude, a corporator from the Wadgaon-Dhayari area, said, “Three CVCs are operational at schools in our area. These centres were started through our initiative. We shall start one more at Pokale school from Monday.” A lot of noise was made when local corporators had approached the PMC to allow CVCs at schools/community/marriage halls in their prabhags over a month ago. A senior health official, requesting anonymity, said, “Initially, there were a lot of misgivings that local corporators from the ruling party would hijack the vaccination drive and earn mileage for the upcoming polls. But the PMC administration ensured that corporators across all political parties got an equal number of CVCs.” There are 164 elected representatives (municipal corporators) in the PMC. “Of them, 99 belong to the ruling party. But even in areas like Kharadi, Hadapsar and Yerawada, where the local corporators are from opposition parties, people have got CVCs through their corporators,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/corporators-initiative-adds-118-vaccination-hubs-in-pmc-limits/articleshow/83823253.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Whether camping at Haryana’s toll plaza or Delhi borders, they had sustained the efforts of the farmers with their enthusiasm. Whenever, police and farmers got into confrontation in Haryana, women had been seen on the forefront, sometimes even facing injuries and police actions. TOI team met up with some of them camping at Khatkar and Baddowal toll plazas in Haryana’s Jind district. These women, mostly from Bangar region, have been taking part actively since the beginning and were more in number when compared with their male counterparts. However, the women said the ongoing agitation has led to several changes in their life — the biggest is the time management as they have to manage work at home such as cooking, bring fodder from the field to feed the cattle and handling children who are at home for over a year due to Covid-19 outbreak. It is only only when they finish these tasks that they reach the toll plazas at about 11am. They leave the venue at 3pm. Sixty-year-old Rajo Devi, who hails from Dariawala village of Jind district, said she comes to Khatkar toll plaza daily with other women. “The agitation changed the life of women and made them stronger. The women now sleep early and wake up at 3am. We used to wake up at 5am before the agitation. We don’t fear now even death after nearly 500 farmers have lost their life while protesting. We never thought that Modi will turn like this after taking our votes. Now, the agitation has become a part of our life. And we will be here until our demands are met,” she added. “The adamant attitude and the use of force by the government on farmers, leaving them with injuries many times, led us women to take charge at the forefront. Women made protest sites more disciplined and energetic. Now, women learnt to address from public places, to speak for their rights and fight to save the future of coming generations. One day, Modi government will have to repeal the three laws, as we women have decided to fight till the last,” Savitri Devi, a native of Raichandwala village of Jind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tirelessly-women-stand-behind-farmers-lending-solid-support/articleshow/83825168.cms||---

The health staff helped four such patients successfully deliver healthy babies at the hospital in the last two months. District collector Ashish Modi praised gynaecologist Dr Ravindra Sankhla, paediatrician Dr Dinesh Jangid and their nursing staff for the efforts. Two of the women delivered babies through caesarean.Meanwhile, the hospital has also been selected for Kayakalp Award for better quality. Rs 3 lakh will be given along with this award.Dr Sankhla said that safe delivery of corona-infected pregnant women was not less than a challenge. During the delivery, doctors had double responsibilities. To keep themselves safe from the infection and to bring the newborn into the world safely. It is satisfying that the hospital took all safety precautions during the procedures, he added.Dr Jangid said doctors have been discharging their duty in getting the corona positive pregnant women deliver babies safely. The biggest relief is that despite the women being infected, the newborns were not infected. The babies were taken care of so that they do not contract the virus. They were kept away from the infected mother and got them breastfed safely due to which no newborn was infected.Meanwhile, there many efforts are being made for the development and expansion of public health services and many innovations due to which this hospital is continuously leading. As a result of coordinated efforts made by the district administration, health department and UNFPA, better results and quality are visible due to which the hospital got the Kayakalp award. The hospital met all the parameters of quality set by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jawahar-hosp-helps-4-covid-infected-pregnant-women-deliver-healthy-babies/articleshow/83823241.cms||---

The students claimed they have been awarded low marks despite performing well in the examinations. Several students from private colleges in Lucknow, Prayagraj, Ghaziabad, Noida, Kanpur and others sent an application to the university administration on Thursday requesting re-checking of their answer copies. Also, a section of BTech third-semester students is running #reevaluation of AKTU answer copies on Twitter. “I had scored 94% marks in the first year. I had calculated my marks and was expecting above 95% in the third semester, but got only 87% marks. This has happened with many topper students of other private colleges too. Most of them have been awarded marks 80% marks,” said BTech (mechanical engineering) III semester student Sameer Mishra. He said every single mark counts in job placements, be it the public or private sector. “Be it mechanical, electrical, computer science the branch toppers of all the subject who scored in the 90s have been got percentage in 80s. I feel that the university wants to make money through ‘challenge evaluation’,” said BTech (computer science ) students Sahil Siddiqui. He said the university gives the option of ‘challenge evaluation’ in which students can get copies re-checked by paying fee of Rs 2,500 per subject. Ayushi Bhardwaj of electrical engineering said, “ The copies have not been evaluated properly. The difference in marks expected and awarded is huge.” AKTU spokesperson Asheesh Mishra said, “We have asked colleges to send us marks of the students. We will make sure to redress complaints of the students if found true.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/stunned-by-low-marks-aktu-students-cry-foul/articleshow/83825203.cms||---

During his stay at the hospital, doctors said, there were multiple occasions when it seemed difficult to predict if the decorated officer would survive. “Cheetah was so sick that he had to be put on a ventilator twice, once on May 30 and again on June 10. Normally, such patients do not survive, but his willpower and constant efforts from doctors, nurses and other staff members looking after him helped him tide over the crisis,” Dr Sushma Bhatnagar, chairperson of Covid services, AIIMS Jhajjar, told TOI. She added that he would require minimal oxygen support at home, and his family has been advised to continue physiotherapy for faster recovery. In 2017, Cheetah cheated death when he survived multiple bullet injuries sustained in a gun battle with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. He was the commanding officer of CRPF’s 45th battalion in Kashmir Valley in February 2017 when he suffered multiple bullet injuries in the brain, right eye, abdomen, both arms, left hand and in the buttock region. The doctors at AIIMS Trauma centre had then performed multiple surgeries to save his life. He was discharged from the hospital in April 2017, and in 2018 he resumed work. The Government of India awarded him with the Kirti Chakra — the second highest peacetime gallantry medal. “All the nurses and multitask workers at the hospital took extra care of him. They always said, as a CRPF commandant, Cheetah saved the lives of many citizens like them, and now it was their turn to do everything possible to save him,” said a senior doctor, adding that Cheetah, too, exhibited a fighting spirit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cheetah-fights-back-wins-battle-against-covid-too/articleshow/83823315.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Meanwhile, the civic body has also reached out to the interior slum pockets to vaccinate the dwellers there. As part of the special initiative, NMMC has started vaccinating homeless people from Belapur node which will cover all 8 wards in the next 10 days. Ward level officials have been instructed to identify 8 to 10 major locations where the camps could be carried out. The civic health officials along with voluntary groups will conduct the drivethrough mobile vans. The officials have been told to locate the homeless people outside railway stations, bus depots, religious places and beneath flyovers and persuade them to get themselves vaccinated through the special drive.  NMMC has administered jab to transgenders as well. The civic administration has already reached out to slum dwellers to vaccinate them at its nearby flu clinic and mobile camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/spl-drive-to-give-jabs-to-beggars-street-dwellers-in-navi-mumbai/articleshow/83823308.cms||B B Nayak
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Awaiting trial for 3 yrs, man pleads guilty in Pocso case||Mumbai: After spending almost three years in jail awaiting trial on charges of sexually assaulting a nine-year-old in a park, a 42-year-old labourer pleaded guilty and told the court that he had committed a mistake and now wanted to live a respectable life. When an accused pleads guilty, s/he forfeits the right to a trial. Premranjan Gupta pleaded guilty when he was produced for framing of charges in the delayed trial. The court sentenced Gupta to three years’ imprisonment. This is the fifth accused in recent months who has pleaded guilty in a Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (Pocso) Act case. Gupta had sent two pleas from Arthur Road jail, telling the court he wanted to be produced in person to plead guilty. Last week, he was finally produced before the court. After Gupta iterated his stand, he was requested to think over his decision and was told about the consequences of his actions. After about 15 minutes when he was brought back to the courtroom, he again requested the court to accept his guilty plea. In the case, the child had told the cops that on November 25, 2018, at about 8.30am she went to park. After playing for some time, when she went to a tap to drink water, a “short man” came near her and touched her inappropriately. She told her mother, who immediately got an FIR lodged against the accused. Gupta was arrested and has been in jail since. The child’s statement was also recorded by a magistrate. The maximum sentence in the charges framed against Gupta attracted five years. The prosecution submitted that considering the nature of the offence, acceptance of guilt and provisions of law, Gupta should be given considerable punishment to send a message to society. Gupta pleaded for leniency and cited his poor financial status. He said he had come to the city from UP to make a living and wanted to be released so that he could fend for his family who depended on him. He added that he did not have anybody who could even help him secure bail. The court gave him three years, most of which he has served and fined him Rs 6,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-awaiting-trial-for-3-yrs-man-pleads-guilty-in-pocso-case/articleshow/83823436.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: In first week of reopening, footfalls at monuments grow at steady pace||JAIPUR: The new positive cases may have come down but people have started venturing out for leisure activities including visits to museums and monuments in the state. The heat and humid conditions may have caused some reluctance for outdoor activities, but monument authorities said that the arrival of monsoon will draw crowds. When historic tourist landmarks in the Pink City were reopened on June 16, they attracted 518 visitors but the footfalls increased to 1274 on Wednesday after a week. Pankaj Dhirendra, superintendent of Amber Fort, said, “Footfalls have been increasing steadily despite June not being a tourist season. As the monsoon bring in more rains, we expect the number to get a faster pace in coming weeks and months. Because of the lockdown prohibitions, the monuments and museums are closed by 4 pm which further limits the scope for footfalls rising at a faster pace. Moreover, lockdown is still in force on Sundays when the monuments receive highest number of visitors on a week day. Authorities at Hawamahal said most of the visitors are people who are either from the city or nearby areas of Jaipur. “The number of visitors from other states are miniscule which can be attributed to the restrictions on travel,” he said. Requirements for travelling into the state like negative RTPCR report and fully vaccinated certificate have reduced the number of visitors to the state. Also, the tourism industry is not open fully with markets closing at 4pm. But an official in the state archaeology department said that in the current circumstances, a slow start is better start. “Nobody wants to see a resurgence in cases again. There is a talk of the third wave. But it can be avoided if people remain on guard and do not make public places overcrowded. Any way this is not a tourist season. So, if the footfalls don’t increase at a faster clip, it is actually better,” said the official requesting anonymity. Monuments offer insights into the health of tourism in the state as the tourism department uses these numbers, among others, to calculate tourist arrivals in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/in-1st-week-of-reopening-footfalls-at-monuments-grow-at-steady-pace/articleshow/83823263.cms||---

State public prosecutor Deepak Thakare informed the HC that over 2,053 people received fake Covid shots, and 8 persons were arrested so far. Thakare showed a rough chart. It said in Malad (W), 30 people got fake jabs on May 25, 122 in the next two days in Thane, and 514 in Borivli (W). At Lower Parel on May 29-30, 207 persons, and then 390 at Hiranandani Heritage in Kandivli on May 30 fell prey. On June 1, at Andheri (W), 150 were 'vaccinated', around 200 in Khar on June 3, around 225 in Borivli (W) and then again in Andheri (W) on June 6, 220 more were given shots. Senior civic counsel Anil Sakhare said when people realised that certificates were from three different hospitals in one camp, BMC started questioning the hospitals. The bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni instructed BMC to find what was the effect of this "fake vaccine" on people. "Do they have antibodies? Were they given saline or water?" the bench asked and said, "They should be taken care of now." The HC asked, "Did none of the society members suspect anything? Here vaccine was administered to 390 and they paid money in the evening?." It added, "Despite all your efforts, this has happened. So, what are you doing about it?" The government has sought a week's time. "Last week, we had passed an order and said that this needed urgent attention. Every minute is important," the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/over-2000-in-mumbai-duped-in-fake-vaccine-drives-says-govt/articleshow/83827768.cms||---

The chief wildlife warden of Rajasthan on Thursday had sought the state government’s permission for opening up Ranthambore National Park and Sariska Tiger Reserve for visitors, following which the directions were issued. The National Tiger Conservation Authority had previously restricted visitors’ entry at all tiger reserves in the country considering the Covid situation. However, as an improvement has been noticed in the pandemic situation, NTCA has now asked the chief wildlife wardens to decide on opening up of the reserves under their jurisdiction after consulting with local authorities. The visitors though would still need to abide with Covid-appropriate behaviour to avoid transfer of infection in animals. An official said, “Along with tiger reserves, biological parks will also be opened for visitors.” The NTCA decision has arrived just days before the reserves are scheduled to close for monsoon season. The Sariska Tiger Reserve will close again on July 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tiger-reserves-in-state-will-open-from-today/articleshow/83823311.cms||---

Since early morning, people were seen carrying ashes of their beloved who died during the second wave of the pandemic. “On Thursday, it was Vat purnima, an auspicious day for performing last rites and therefore people rushed to Pushkar for prayers,” said Deepu Maharishi, a priest of Pushkar. Usually, people go to Haridwar, but mostly locals come to Pushkar. Because of the lockdown and Covid, there were people from many cities performing last rites in Pushkar. Hundreds of people gathered on the ghats and priests performed pujas and last rites and later the markets too were crowded. Caution was thrown to wind as people violated social distancing norms despite warning by cops. Markets were allowed to open from early morning to 5 in the evening and therefore families came for the last rites. Only in Gaddi Malyan cremination centre of Ajmer, over 250 urns were left behind for the last two months as relatives did not turn up for last rites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/people-throng-pushkar-for-last-rites-on-purnima/articleshow/83823305.cms||---

While one private airline has already started operations on May 1, connecting Nashik with Ahmedabad, Alliance Air has announced that it will start operations on July 12. The airline said that its Nashik-Pune flight will be extended to Belagavi, while the Nashik-Ahmedabad flight will be extended to Delhi. An official from Alliance Air said they have made changes in the previous routes and planned two hopping flights from Nashik to Delhi via Ahmedabad, and another hopping flight from Nashik to Belagavi via Pune. “We have already started bookings on two routes from Wednesday midnight. At present, we have no plans to start the Nashik- Hyderabad flight, but we will take a call on it later,” said the airline official. Another private airline has also announced to start a return flight from Nashik to Belagavi from July 2. A low-cost private airline, which had started air services from Nashik to Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Delhi in November 2020, had stopped operations in April. It has decided to resume the routes from September. Manish Rawal, chairperson of the aviation committee of the Ambad Industries & Manufacturers’ Association, said this is a positive development. “Four airlines had connectivity from Nashik to Delhi, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Belagavi and Pune. But they had stopped in April. Now, one airline has already started Nashik-Ahmedabad flight, while two others are restarting from next month,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/flights-from-ozar-airport-to-restart/articleshow/83820733.cms||Tushar Pawar

Though vehicular movement on the barrage has restarted, the conditions are still risky. Parts of the concrete slab over the barrage have been washed away due to the heavy flow of water. The barrage acts as a connection between Kasba Bawda in the city and adjoining villages like Vadange, Kushire, Nigwe, Pohale, Bhuye, Bhuyewadi, Giroli etc. The bridge is extensively used by tractor trolleys and bullock carts during the sugar crushing season. Shubham Salokhe, a resident of Kushire village, said, “Movement over the barrage has become dangerous. The surface is not smooth and a balancing act is required to cross it. The side railings also have been uprooted. Last year, a girl had fallen in the river along with her bike. She survived as she knew how to swim. In another incident, a car had fallen into the river last year. The driver had to jump out of the car. Currently, the river water is gushing. If anyone falls in it, he or she may not survive.” Meanwhile, the construction of the new bridge parallel to the Rajaram barrage is moving at a snail’s pace. Amit Patil, a resident of Kasba Bawda, said, “The construction of the new bridge was started in 2016 and is going on very slowly. Even after five years, only five columns of the bridge have been completed. If the new bridge gets completed, then there will be connectivity even if the Rajaram barrage gets submerged. People will not be forced to take the long route to reach Kolhapur.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/rajaram-barrage-reopens-but-crossing-it-still-risky/articleshow/83820756.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

As part of Oxygen Mission launched by the state to take production to 3,600MT, the cabinet in May cleared a proposal to offer incentives to manufacturers who want to set up units or units which want to expand. Incentives include 110% refund in gross state GST, waiver on stamp duty, electricity subsidy of Rs2 per unit for five years, special capital subsidy for five years, and 100-150% returns on investment. A budget of Rs 300 crore has been set aside for the incentives. “We are expecting more proposals as June 30 is the last day to apply under the scheme. Subsidy will also be given to units that promise to start production before December 31 this year,” said an official. Most units may not be ready by December but the state is taking steps to ensure augmented supply in few months before the projected third wave hits the state. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray met key manufacturers in the state on Thursday and appealed to them to use this time when cases are on the decline to increase supply and storage capacity so that the additional oxygen can be stored. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said units should also be set up in backward areas to ensure the entire state has adequate supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-gets-57-new-proposals-to-manufacture-900mt-oxygen/articleshow/83823340.cms||---

But the cyber police of North Region moved swiftly and helped her retrieve Rs 1 lakh. Earlier this month, the woman, a resident of the western suburbs, placed an order on a shopping portal for an outfit. When the order was delivered, she found that the outfit was not her size. She then searched online for the shopping portal’s customer care number for a refund. “The woman told the man who answered the call that she wanted her money back. He instructed her to download an app called Any Desk so he could help her,” a police officer said. The woman was not aware that the fraudster got remote access to her phone through Any Desk. “She shared the ID with him and later he went to the mobile banking app on her phone and transferred Rs 2 lakh into his account,” the officer said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-woman-seeking-refund-online-loses-rs-2l-cyber-cops-help-recover-half/articleshow/83825256.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand high court provides police protection to interfaith couple, says adults have right to choose life partners||NAINITAL: Granting police protection to an interfaith couple, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Tuesday held that people above the age of 18 have the fundamental right to choose their life-partners even if their family members are opposed to the union. A petition was filed in the HC by Noori Begum (alias Akansha) and her husband Arbaj informing that they had fallen in love and got married in Bareilly on February 26 according to Muslim customs. The petitioners, who are residents of Rudrapur in US Nagar, however alleged that the father and mother of the bride were against the marriage and were threatening to kill them. The petition further alleged that the woman’s parents might even hire some goons to break the marriage. The couple added that even though they had approached the senior superintendent police, US Nagar on June 14 demanding police protection, no action had been taken by them yet. The bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma perused the Aadhaar cards and high school certificates of the couple and found that they are above 18 years of age. The court therefore said, “Undoubtedly, persons, who are major, have a fundamental right to choose their own life-partners, even in spite of the opposition voiced by the family members,” read the court order. The court has directed SHO Rudrapur to provide protection to the couple adding that “the protection shall not only be for their lives, but shall also extend to protecting their property, if any”. The court meanwhile has also issued notices to the woman’s parents and has given the state government three weeks’ time to file their responses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-provides-police-protection-to-interfaith-couple-says-adults-have-right-to-choose-life-partners/articleshow/83818220.cms||Prashant Jha

Speaking at the inauguration of a helpline for elderlies, the CM said, “With the third Covid-19 wave expected soon, we are doing everything to ensure that people do not face situations like they have faced in the second wave. We have already built hospitals with the help of DRDO and upgraded the existing ones. I am even converting the CM’s residence into a Covid care centre.” The residence on New Cantt Road has for long carried the tag of being "jinxed" as belief is that no CM who moved in here could complete his full five-year term. Previous CM Trivendra Rawat had chosen to ignore these beliefs and had shifted to the official residence. His predecessor Harish Rawat had preferred to stay away from the house and used to operate from the state government’s official guest house. Tirath Rawat, too, has been staying at a government accommodation known as ‘safe house’ near the official bungalow, after taking over in March this year. The CM’s official bungalow, designed in the traditional pahari style, was built in 2010 at an estimated cost of Rs 16 crore and is spread over an area of 10 acres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/jinxed-official-residence-of-ukhand-cm-to-be-used-as-covid-care-centre/articleshow/83818243.cms||Ishita Mishra

It has now grown into to 100-bed multi-specialty hospital having many departments, ICCU, 24-hour pharmacy and ambulance services. The hospital is completing 125 years on June 26. The only thing that remains unchanged is the mission ‘To strive together to care for health, to love and to empower people in need’. Another special feature of this hospital is that it treated patients during the plague pandemic, which was deadlier than Covid-19, right after its establishment. MMH founder Dr Agnes Elizabeth Henderson had come to India as a medical missionary all the way from Scotland. She started with a one-bed clinic in Mahal and later established a 24-bed maternity hospital in Sitabuldi on June 26, 1896. Sir Andrew Henderson Leith Fraser, who was the chief commissioner of Central Provinces at Nagpur, leased 12.75 acres land at Sitabuldi where the current campus stands. Two sisters – Helen and Mary Mure — from Scotland donated 2,000 pounds in memory of their brother, a British warrior who lost his life in a war while defending his country. As the hospital was constructed by the generous donation of Mure family, Dr Agnes named it as ‘Mure Memorial Hospital’ (MMH). “Since then Mure Memorial Hospital has been serving the needy people in and around Nagpur. Between April 2020 and March 2021, we were able to serve 47,000 people despite the pandemic situation,” said Dr Vilas Shende, director of this charity hospital. According to him, MMH is the only hospital having experience to treat patients in a pandemic. “Nagpur and central province witnessed the plague outbreak in 1903-04. Dr Agnes and her team at Mure Memorial Hospital served patients braving all odds,” said Dr Shende. Dr Agnes has written a first person account of Nagpur’s plague in the Women’s Missionary Magazine in October 1904. Dr Shende pointed out several similarities in Covid-19 and the plague pandemic. “The first, second and third wave, rise and dip in cases, non-cooperation of people, closure of schools, dedicated hospitals, isolation centres etc are things about which we have also read in Dr Agnes’ article,” said Dr Shende. MMH was instrumental in providing community health services to migrant workers, frontline workers, slum dwellers and villagers during lockdown and post lockdown periods beginning from March 2020 to January 2021. “As non-Covid hospital till February 2021, we were continuously treating patients suffering from other diseases, and particularly conducted deliveries. We sometimes had Covid patients to whom we provided necessary initial treatment. From March 2021, we started 47-bed Covid hospital where we were able to treat more than 250 patients with limited resources,” said Dr Shende. The next target for MMH is to establish a 500-bed multispecialty hospital in th city .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/from-plague-to-covid-mure-memorial-hospital-knows-how-to-cure-its-patients/articleshow/83823587.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan first state to get genome lab||JAIPUR: Rajasthan has become the first state in the country to start a genome sequencing facility. Meanwhile, following the detection of Delta+ variant of Covid in three states, the health department had enhanced surveillance across the state. Health minister Raghu Sharma said for the prevention and control of Covid in the state, the genome sequencing lab has been set at Sawai Man Singh Hospital. “Through genome sequencing, we will come to know about the new variant of Covid circulating in the state,” said Sharma. State government has spent Rs 1 crore on developing the genome sequencing facility at SMS Hospital. Till now, the state government had to send the samples to IGIB lab in Delhi, which was allocated to the state by Indian Council of Medical Research for genome sequencing. Sharma said earlier they were sending 300 samples from the state to IGIB, but the state was not receiving the test reports on time. The state’s genome sequencing lab has started functioning from June 15. The machine has a capacity of conducting genome sequencing of 20 samples daily, but soon its capacity will be increased to 80. It takes 3 to 4 days in getting report of a sample sent for genome sequencing. Sharma said 100 samples had been tested at the lab and out of those, 90 have tested positive for Delta variant. The rest have tested positive for B1.1 variant. Officials said no case of Delta + has been found in the state. “So far, not a single case of Delta+ variant has been found in the state. But, we are alert on it,” said a senior health department official. Union health ministry had alerted and advised Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh regarding Delta+ variant after it was found in some districts of these states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-first-state-to-have-genome-lab/articleshow/83823341.cms||---

A letter in this regard was issued by state immunization officer Dr Ajit Prasad, directing civil surgeons as well as reproductive and child health officials to ensure that vaccination for JE-1 and JE -2 be taken up on priority. The vaccination programme for JE-1 and JE-2 is part of the routine immunization programme and as many as 17 districts failed to meet their vaccination target this year owing to the pandemic. “We conduct the vaccination programme for JE-1 and JE-2 during January and February every year. However, due to the pandemic, a few districts haven’t been able to conduct the vaccination programme among the kids and as a result, they have not met their respective targets. We have decided to complete the vaccination programme before ongoing monsoon takes over,” Dr Ajit said. Although there hasn’t been an outbreak of JE in Jharkhand yet, some cases were reported from Godda district last year, following which the health department started conducting surveillance across 17 districts, which are considered as endemic zones for JE. Talking to TOI, state entomologist Sagya Singh said, “JE is more likely to spread in rural areas and at places where there is stagnant water. Paddy fields and piggery are considered as high-risk areas for JE and the infection can spread from animals, including birds.” He added, “We conduct awareness programmes among the rural populace regarding keeping kids away from pig farms as well as paddy fields where stagnant water is kept for long hours. This disease infects kids below three years with a weak immunity.” As per health department records, Ranchi is lagging behind in the immunization of children for JE-1 and JE-2 with a total coverage of 35% and 32%, respectively. While Garhwa and Pakur have failed to achieve even 50% of the target. Asked how the government plans to increase the coverage in those districts, Dr Prasad said, “We have asked the reproductive and child health officials to vaccinate more and more kids in those districts, along with the routine immunization, which has been expedited by the department. We administer two doses among the children - first when the child is aged between nine to 12 months and the second when he/she is between 12 -24 months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-to-ramp-up-je-vax-drive-to-prevent-monsoon-outbreak/articleshow/83790362.cms||---

Since morning, dark clouds had started gathering in the sky, resulting in moderate rainfall coupled with thunderstorms and gusty winds. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted light rainfall for the next couple of days in the city and ghat sections of Kolhapur and Satara districts. However, weather experts claim there is less probability of rain in the next few days. But heavy rainfall is expected to resume in the last few days of June and the July to witness more than average rainfall. Meanwhile, Koyna dam is around 40% filled. The dam with a capacity of 105 TMC currently has a storage of 41.55 TMC. The discharge of 2,100 cusec is being carried out from the power house section. The current inflow is 4,469 cusec and therefore to maintain the optimum storage level for flood management, the discharge continues. The Koyna catchment area received 20 mm rainfall by 5 pm on Thursday. A discharge of 37,000 cusec from Almatti dam located along Krishna river has been initiated that has also resulted into further decline in water level of Krishna river. On Thursday evening, water level of Krishna river was 10 feet at Sangli’s Irwin Bridge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-city-receives-10mm-rain-after-4-day-gap/articleshow/83820775.cms||---

---||Dehradun||All 111 Covid patients in dist died due to cardiac arrest, Uttarakhand high court asks||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court has raised doubts that death audits of Covid patients were not being conducted properly in the state after a report prepared by Almora authorities which was submitted to the court showed that all 111 Covid patients who died in the district in May had suffered ‘cardiopulmonary arrest’.  The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma on expressed surprise over the fact that cause of death was the same in all cases and refused to accept the “veracity” and “validity” of the report. The HC also directed health secretary Amit Negi to submit a reply by July 6.  The report in question was prepared by the Almora chief medical officer and was submitted to the court by Negi to show that death audits were being conducted in the state. In its last hearing on June 6, the court had asked Negi to inform whether death audits were being performed in Uttarakhand.  Negi had told the court that each district has been provided with a standard format for the audit and all CMOs, principal medical superintendents and medical superintendents are mandated to carry out an audit of each death caused by Covid-19.  The bench, however, said that a perusal of the report showed that each of the Covid-19 deaths were "because their heart stopped beating". The court added: "It is common knowledge that a dead body does not contain a beating heart. Therefore, the reason given for the cause of death is rather suspicious...the veracity and validity of such documents cannot be accepted by this court (sic).”  The bench also remarked that it had asked the government to submit audit reports along with death certificates for all Covid-19 patients to show that they were being conducted legally and in a valid manner, but it had not been complied with. “The government has even failed to inform the court as to how many people have died during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the judges said.  There have been previous instances of Covid-related data being misreported in Uttarakhand. Earlier, TOI had found that hospitals in the state were underreporting Covid deaths. The health secretary had said that hospitals which don’t report deaths on time would be booked under Uttarakhand Epidemic Disease Covid-19 Regulation, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/all-111-covid-patients-in-dist-died-due-to-cardiac-arrest-hc-asks/articleshow/83818228.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Lucknow||Lucknow shoots to record peak with 27,000 jabs||LUCKNOW: The record breaking turnout of people for Covid-19 vaccination continued on Thursday with over 27,000 people taking the jab – highest in a single day. Total 27,395 beneficiaries took the shot, breaking the record of 24,950 inoculations set on Wednesday, but fell short of the target of 30,000 vaccinations set for the day. Carried out at 250 booths – 242 government and eight private - the drive witnessed 24,748 people taking the first dose and 2,647 completing the two-dose course after taking the booster shot. Over 13.23 lakh doses have been administered in the city so far since the start of the mass immunisation programme on January 16. About 2.65 lakh persons have been fully immunized. District immunisation officer Dr M K Singh said that the pace of the vaccination programme is satisfactory. "Frontline workers and health workers, who have not taken the second dose yet, are being called to take it at the earliest. This will increase the count further." Besides, he said, the health department is increasing the number of booths and covering rural areas through the cluster model in which the entire adult population in a locality or area is vaccinated within a given timeframe. However, women continue to lag in getting the jab. Against 15,966 men, 11,429 (42%) women turned up at the centres. Nearly 66% (18,007) of the beneficiaries on Thursday were people in the 18-44 age group followed by 29% (7,901) aged between 45 and 59 and 4% (1,262) elderlies - 60 years and above. The rest were healthcare and frontline workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-shoots-to-record-peak-with-27000-jabs/articleshow/83825265.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

---||Goa||Veterinarians condemn threats by Maneka Gandhi||PANAJI: A nationwide protest call was made by the Indian Veterinary Association (IVA) to condemn the language allegedly used by former Union minister Maneka Gandhi against a veterinarian. Veterinarians across the country observed a black day on Wednesday and sported black badges to protest the BJP MP’s behaviour. Sources from the directorate of animal husbandry and veterinary services said that veterinarians in Goa also participated in this protest in solidarity with the doctor who was verbally abused. “Most of the doctors in Goa have participated on Wednesday. It is a movement that has spread all over the country in which all the veterinary associations have participated. Despite holding such a high position, it is very unbecoming of her to use such language. She has taken it too far. Her behaviour should be condemned or other politicians will also misbehave with veterinarians. She must apologise to the entire fraternity,” Dr Gustavo Pinto said. Gandhi allegedly verbally abused a veterinary doctor on Tuesday over the phone “using unparliamentary language during the conversation” IVA president Umesh Sharma, said in a statement issued to the press. A purported audio clip of their telephonic conversation has gone viral on social media. A letter written by the Federation of Small Animal Practitioners' Association of India mentions “threats and abusive language...several times in the past”. The letter goes on to state that the “behaviour hurts sentiments of passionate, hardworking veterinarians”. Achina Joglekar, president of the small animal veterinary association in Goa said that though the doctors did not go on a strike on Wednesday, they sported the black bands in solidarity. “She is an elected member, but it has become a habit with her to use such derogatory remarks. She has also questioned the veterinary doctor whether he is the son of a gardener or watchman, which is not very nice for a person of her stature to say. If a chaiwala can become a PM, why is the job of a gardener or watchman shamed? She is also not qualified to say that the surgery has gone wrong, when it could be other factors causing the problem. We are furious at the language she used against the qualified vet. We want her to come ahead respectfully and offer an apology,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vets-condemn-threats-by-maneka-gandhi/articleshow/83825492.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Orphaned by Covid, now spurned for no proof||Lucknow: Saumya Singh, 17, eldest among three siblings, dreamt of becoming a scientist, but her world turned upside down when the second pandemic wave snatched away her father, the sole bread earner of the family. Hope flickered for a while after UP government announced welfare schemes for Covid orphans, but despair struck again when she couldn’t produce documents to prove her father died of Covid-19. The women and child development department was categorical about proof to make her a beneficiary. Her father, Sunit Singh, a small-time contractor, passed away on April 17 after displaying full-blown Covid symptoms. “He had high fever, breathlessness and body ache. His pulse and oxygen saturation dipped dramatically even as I ran from pillar to post to admit him in a hospital bed with oxygen support. Also, it was difficult to even get a corona test. Everyone in the family was infected and my father gasped and died at home. Now, the state department is demanding evidence on his illness,” said Saumya, who stays in a rented accommodation at Hans Kheda in Para police limits along with her mother, Sunita Singh, and two siblings Subhi, 15, and Krishna,11. “My mother is unread and can’t get a job at this age, our relatives too have dumped us. Government aid was the only hope for my siblings to continue their studies, but now we have hit a wall,” she said. Like Saumya, Class 10 student Arjun Pandey,15, and Vanshika Pandey,17, who passed her Class 12 exam too face an uncertain future. Their mother, Shashi Pandey said, “My husband died on a stretcher while I stood in the queue for a RT-PCR test at Lohia hospital. For a week, he had high fever and suddenly his blood pressure dipped dramatically and he passed away. I was helpless then and worse now. I don’t have a Covid report to prove my husband died of corona,” said Shashi, who lives in a rented accommodation at Shivajipuram in Para police limits. “My son’s monthly fee is Rs 2,460, but I don’t have enough savings to pay his fees. I was hoping the state government’s monthly stipend for Covid orphans would help my son complete his schooling,” said the 46-year-old mother of two. Another mother, Deepa Shrivastav, whose son, Dhairya, studies in Class 2, said, “I came to know about the government scheme from newspapers. It was a ray of hope after my husband, Atul Shrivastav, succumbed to Covid on April 9. But when authorities asked me to furnish a report to prove he died of Covid, I had none to share.” Child welfare committee member, Lucknow unit, Sangeeta Sharma, said, “Between April and June, ChildLine received information about 248 Covid orphans. Of this, 212 children lost their father, 23 lost their mother and 13 lost both parents. Till date, only 69 children were able to present proof of their parents’ death from Covid to avail the government scheme of Rs 4,000/month till the age of 18, free schooling in Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas and Atal residential schools and free laptop or tablet for students in Class 10 or above. “We are writing to the director of women and child development department to constitute a team to investigate cases of children who don’t have documents to prove their claim. It’s logical that most deaths occurred due to corona in the months of April, May and June, when the pandemic peaked,” she said. WCD director Manoj Rai did not respond to TOI queries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/orphaned-by-covid-now-spurned-for-no-proof/articleshow/83825305.cms||Arvind Chauhan

This is a rare case where the villagers have readily agreed to relocate following a request from the forest department. Clement Ben, the chief conservator of forests for Kolhapur (territorial), said: “The Vele and Deur villages are located in the extreme core zone and the villagers have been facing many hardships there. They have had no schools, primary healthcare centres, roads, or electricity supply. Moreover, the fear of wild animals is always there. During the monsoon, the villages often get cut off. Therefore, the residents of the villages have readily agreed to move from the Sahyadri tiger reserve area and relocate to the forest land near Manewadi and Bopegaon. They have given written consent as well. The forest land near Manewadi and Bopegaon is close to the highway and the MIDC area. The villagers would be able to get employment there easily and they can also carry out farming activities.” “We have sent the rehabilitation proposal under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, to the government and will follow up on the matter. Once it gets sanctioned, then the relocation can be done in three to four months. Farmland and civic amenities, as per the rehabilitation plan, will be provided to these villagers in the 46.06 hectare of forest land at Bopegaon. Evaluation of their land in Deur and Vele will be done by the committee chaired by district collector of Satara and the forest department. Accordingly, compensation will be provided,” added Ben.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vele-deur-village-residents-agree-to-move-out-of-sahyadri-tiger-reserve/articleshow/83820845.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Kolhapur||Hunt on for site in Kolhapur city for SARTHI sub-centre||KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur district administration has started looking for a site to develop a sub-centre of the Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research Training and Human Development Institute, Pune, popularly known as SARTHI. The institute has been set up by Maharashtra government for the welfare of Maratha students. In the recent meeting of Rajyasabha MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar approved developing sub-centre of SARTHI at Kolhapur. The sub-centre will function similar to the main branch but on small scale and will cover south Maharashtra and Konkan districts. As suggested by the Maratha activists, district collector Daulat Desai visited the sites from Shivaji University and Rajaram College campuses. The activists also have suggested the abandoned site of Shahu Mill, where already Shahu Memorial is proposed. Desai said, “As per directions of guardian minister Satej Patil, we have checked the two sites. We are gathering technical information about the sites. The site to develop the sub-centre of SARTHI will be finalised only after the consultation with the stakeholders.” Sambhajiraje is expected to visit the sites on Saturday along with the delegation of Maratha activists. Prominent Maratha activists claimed that before SARTHI was set up, their demand was of setting up Maratha Bhavan in Kolhapur district which would have served the same purpose. SUK sub-centre Higher education minister Uday Samant has given in-principal approval of developing sub-centre of Shivaji University Kolhapur at Tasgaon in Sangli. A team of two officials of university will visit the site suggested by local representatives and finalise the proposal. The sub-centre will help students and colleges located at far flung areas of Sangli district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/hunt-on-for-site-in-kolhapur-city-for-sarthi-sub-centre/articleshow/83820800.cms||---

Navi Mumbai police, who denied them permission, used drones to capture images of protestors, probably as evidence to register FIRs. The protesters, who included BJP activists and PAPs, were stopped at NMMC HQ on Palm Beach road. The protest continued for four hours and later a delegation of Core Action Committee of PAPs said they demanded that Cidco board cancel a proposal naming the airport after Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray and instead table a new proposal naming it after Patil. The committee gave a deadline of August 15 or PAPs will not allow Cidco to continue airport work. DCP (special branch) Rupali Ambure said around 2,800 Navi Mumbai policemen and additional forces of around 500, including officers from other commissionerates and seven SRPF companies, were deployed. Around 25,000 participated in the march. Though no untoward incident was reported, an FIR will be registered. Dashrath Patil, president of the committee leading the protest, said, “Our delegation submitted a memorandum to Cidco chairman’s office stating that its board should revoke the proposal of naming the airport after Thackeray. MNS chief Raj Thackeray’s party’s lone MLA, Pramod (Raju) Patil joined the protest. Raj had said that the airport was an extension of Mumbai airport, so it will have the same name.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/over-25k-defy-ban-protest-over-navi-mumbai-airport-name-row/articleshow/83823418.cms||George Mendonca
---||Pune||142 small hospitals, nursing homes to begin Covid vaccination from July 1: PMC||Pune: A whopping 142 small hospitals and nursing homes are set to begin Covid-19 vaccination on their premises from July 1. Health officials of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) have started conducting zone-wise training of the hospitals’ staffers from Wednesday for a smoother vaccination process. “The training is mainly about how to conduct the inoculation drive which is primarily a technology-driven process. With this, the number of Covid vaccination centres in the PMC limits has gone up to 415. Of these, 200 are currently actively involved in vaccination,” said PMC’s Covid vaccination chief, Vaishali Jadhav. “Of the 415 Covid vaccination centres, 188 are run by the PMC and 10 by the state. With the existing 75 Covid vaccination centres at private hospitals and an additional 142 small nursing homes and hospitals that have been allowed to function as such hubs from July 1, the number of inoculation facilities at private hospitals across the PMC limits has gone up to 217,” Jadhav said. "The objective is to ensure that citizens have quite a few Covd vaccination centres available both at private and public settings in their neighbourhood,” she said. On the vaccine procurement policy for the small hospitals, Jadhav said, “Small private hospitals will have to procure Covid vaccines through a state government-devised mechanism to ensure equitable distribution. The mechanism will have more clarity in a day or two. They (private hospitals) will have to purchase the vaccine either from the state or from the PMC and carry out vaccination as per the centralized vaccination policy adhering to the set prices.” Unlike big hospitals, small nursing homes have been facing difficulties regarding procuring the doses from the manufacturers. Some of them have even joined hands to collectively place the purchase order after manufacturers dismissed their independent small purchase orders. “Our concern is to get an immediate and smooth supply of vaccines. Frequent changes in policy and guidelines have led to unnecessary anxiety and unrest among citizens as vaccination schedule is of two doses and needs to be completed in certain duration,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India, an association of small hospitals. Medical expert Girish Kirad, who runs a small private nursing home in the Chandannagar area and had participated in the training session at the PMC building in Shivajinagar on Wednesday, said, "The training was mainly about how to create vaccination sessions and other mandatory processes as per the CoWIN app. I would be able to vaccinate 100 people every day at the facility in my nursing home. It will help decongest other vaccination centres in our area. But I am clueless about how to procure the vaccine doses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/142-small-hospitals-nursing-homes-to-begin-covid-vaccination-from-july-1-pmc/articleshow/83823407.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Aurangabad||Ink thrown on new Shiv Sena Beed district chief||AURANGABAD: Internal differences over the appointment of Shiv Sena district president reached a new low on Thursday in Beed with a rival faction throwing ink on Appasaheb Jadhav, the newly appointed district chief. The incident took place in the afternoon when Jadhav, along with his supporters, was out for a vehicle rally in Majalgaon. Following the incident, videos depicting Sena workers clashing on the road have made it to the social media. When contacted, Jadhav said, “I entered Majalgaon in the afternoon and my supporters were following me in their vehicles. Suddenly, a person riding a two-wheeler came from the wrong side and threw ink on my car’s windshield.” He said when his car’s driver rolled down the window glass, the suspect dragged him out and started attacking him. “This angered the accompanying party workers and supporters, who then thrashed the man,” said Jadhav. He said the incident has left the driver injured and a decision on whether to lodge a police complaint or not will be taken soon. He blamed Sena’s city president Dhananjay Solunke and added that a day earlier, Solunke had allegedly — with his faction of supporters — torn Jadhav’s banner and hit his picture with footwear. Party insiders said a faction led by Solumke has been openly opposing Jadhav’s appointment. The allegations have been refuted by Solunke and his supporters. A senior party official said the party has taken serious cognizance of the incident and an internal probe will be carried out before initiating disciplinary action. “The action could range from suspension from party’s primary membership to permanent removal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ink-thrown-on-new-sena-beed-dist-chief/articleshow/83820886.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The techie was called to Lucknow en route to Mumbai by the kingpin to finalise employment details. When Kumar and his aides, Amal Antu and S K Manoj, checked in at Hotel Shanta on Latouche Road, gang members masquerading as Intelligence Bureau sleuths raided their room on Wednesday morning citing a police tip-off, locked them in the washroom and decamped with foreign currency worth more than Rs 10lakh. Their facilitator, Hakim, who masterminded the crime is on the run after the gang was busted by police on Thursday. Those arrested included Ashish Scindia of Chandigarh, Shakil Ahmad and Lalit Kumar, both from Delhi and Balram Sain of Rajasthan. Police seized $7,650 and Euro 3,150 and Rs 5,000 in Indian currency, PAN card, ATM, visa, passport, Aadhaar card and a countrymade pistol from their possession. Their getaway vehicle, a SUV, was also confiscated. ADCP, West, Rajesh Srivastava, who led the operation said, Hakim promised jobs to Kerala trio in Malta and told them fly to Delhi before being sent to Lucknow to chalk out job details. “The three gullible youths were specifically told to arrange cash in foreign currency before flying to Mumbai from Lucknow en route to Europe. Hakim was in touch with the trio in Dubai before the lockdown. When the youths checked into a hotel in Naka, Hakim dispatched four of his men to rob them,” he said. As per plan, Hakim directed one of the Kerala youths to go to the airport to buy flight tickets, while the techie and another stayed back at the hotel. “Suddenly, they heard a knock and four men calling themselves IB sleuths barged in and held them at gunpoint. After locking them in the loo, they collected cash and documents and fled,” said Srivastava. Later, the youths freed themselves and called police. “We nabbed one of the accused after identifying him from CCTV footage. After questioning, police were led to the other accused, but one of them, Kulwant Singh, escaped,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kerala-techie-conned-by-job-sharks/articleshow/83825350.cms||---

The accused downloaded videos of women getting undressed and then used the same during the video calls as they lured the victims to strip, police officials said. During the investigation of a Bardoli municipal councillor’s complaint, the local crime branch of Surat rural police nabbed one person who confessed about this modus operandi. The accused told the cops that he doesn’t know the woman and that he had downloaded the video to trap the victims. “Our investigations revealed that only men are involved in such rackets. The accused used downloaded videos of women to encourage the victims to undress,” said Rajkumar Pandian, additional director general of police, Surat range. However, the entire trap is designed and executed in such a way that the victim gets the impression that he is chatting with a woman, the cops said.Police arrested Salim Saiyed, 24, a resident of Chiprada in Alwar district of Rajasthan. He is part of a gang, which has five other members who are yet to get arrested. The gang created fake facebook pages in the name of women and sent friendship requests to the targets. If the requests were accepted, they started to chat over messenger and later asked the victim for his Whatsapp number.Over Whatsapp chat the crooks lured the victims to have video sex and used downloaded video of woman stripping to lure the victim to do the same. As the victim undressed over a video call, the accused recorded the video through a screen recorder. Once recorded the victim was sent a clip of it and money was demanded for not circulating it.“The accused never used to talk with the victims, they used to only chat over Whatsapp or facebook messenger,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/no-women-directly-involved-in-online-honeytrap-scams-cops/articleshow/83817864.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Steel City temples observe shahi snan, Rath Yatra likely to be low-key affair||JAMSHEDPUR: The festive enthusiasts on Thursday observed shahi snan (panchamrit bath) of lord Jagannath, lord Balabhadra and devi Subhadra in all the Jagannath temples across the two adjoining towns of Jamshedpur and Seraikela. Keeping the current Covid-induced restrictions in mind, the temple management made sure that only a limited number of servitors and volunteers took part in the rituals. The snan purnima rituals, which is part of shahni snan, were organised at Beldih Naga temple in Bistupur, Gandhi Ashram Jagannath temple in Sakchi, Rath Gali Jagannath temple in Jugsalai, Utkal Association in Golmuri, Namda Basti Kali temple, Jagannath temple in Khasmahal, among others. Following the shahi snan, the deities were adorned with new clothes and a variety of delicious food items were offered to them. Special kirtans were held at the temples as part of the prayers offered to the deities. “After mahasnan, lord Jagannath will take rest for 15 days and will reappear during Rath Yatra,” Seraikela Jagannath temple’s priest Brahmanand Mahapatra said. With shahi snan, the Jagannath Rath Yatra festival has commenced but organizers are not sure whether the government will allow them to the sacred and grand ritual of pulling the chariot, scheduled to take place two weeks later. “We are waiting for the government’s directive and will organise the Rath Yatra, accordingly,” Kharsawan’s circle officer Mukesh Machua said. Machua is the head of sarkari puja committee (puja organising committee) of Kharsawan Jagannath temple. The government bears the expense of the rituals performed at the temple here, a tradition in practise since several decades. Devotees are hoping that the government gives the green signal for taking out the chariot and allowing celebrations to take place in a restricted manner. “The usual enthusiasm associated with rath yatra will be missing if the government doesn’t allow us to take out the chariot on the streets and devotees are not allowed to participate in the ceremony for the second consecutive year,” gold merchant Abhinav Devchand said. Meanwhile, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskon)-run Jagannath temple at Cable Town in Golmuri has announced that the netra utsav and rath yatra would be organised without the fanfare. “Unlike panchamrit snan, the other two components of the festival -- netra utsav and rath yatra -- will be observed according to the safety norms issued by the government,” Iskon’s Jagannath temple functionary Prabhu Das said. In Ranchi too, ceremonial proceedings marked the day at the famous Jagannath temple in Dhurwa. A priest said, “All the rituals were held as per the laid out customs of the puja in strict accordance with safety norms and visitors were debarred from entering. As far as the rath yatra is concerned, it is unlikely to happen this year too due to Covid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/steel-city-temples-observe-shahi-snan-rath-yatra-likely-to-be-low-key-affair/articleshow/83820266.cms||B Sridhar

The children have been handed over to the anti-human trafficking unit (AHTU) Ranchi for further action. Police registered a case under sections 363 and 370 of the IPC against the trafficker, Raju Ganjhu. Ganjhu along with his wife, three children and the rescued minors, was scheduled to board a flight to New Delhi when they were stopped by the CISF personnel. Sources said the CISF personnel at the airport grew suspicious when they noticed a large number of children entering the airport premises. After checking their Aadhaar cards, the personnel found that all of them were minors. The CISF crime wing intervened and questioned Ganjhu and the others accompanying him but did not get a satisfactory reply. Later, they were handed over to the police. AHTU officer Babita Kumari said, “Ganjhu, who is working in Srinagar, was taking along 15 children for work. The minors belonged to Chandwa in Latehar and Simaria in Chatra district. A case has been registered against Ganjhu and the rescued children would be produced before the child welfare committee soon.” Sanjay Mishra, secretary of the Bal Kalyan Sangh (BKS), said, “We are gathering information about the rescued children. The deputy commissioners concerned would be asked to register cases against the middlemen responsible for the trafficking. Steps for providing benefits of welfare schemes to the children would be taken.” It may be stated here that the BKS runs the state resource centre, which is looking after the immediate needs of victims of trafficking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/15-children-rescued-trafficker-arrested-at-ranchi-airport/articleshow/83820024.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand Congress to demand 27% OBC quota||RANCHI: The Jharkhand Congress has decided to press for 27% reservation of government jobs for OBCs and a delegation of party MLAs will submit a detailed memorandum, along with a charter of their demands, to chief minister Hemant Soren in a week. A resolution to this effect was taken during a meeting of the legislative party members, which was attended by 17 MLAs, at the Rock Garden on Thursday. The meeting was chaired by Pakur MLA and leader of legislative party Alamgir Alam, who is also a minister in the Hemant’s cabinet. Talking to TOI after the meeting, Alamgir said that besides discussing the state government’s management of the pandemic, they reviewed the status of their manifesto prepared during the 2019 assembly election. He added, “We discussed four key points mainly - 27% reservation for OBCs in government jobs, formation of employment rules and policy (niyojan neeti), jobs and fulfilling long-pending demands of pay hike by para-teachers. All these factors were, in fact, part of our manifesto during the 2019 assembly election and the party will pursue them afresh with the government.” Besides Alam, three other Congress MLAs are part of the 12-member cabinet, though one berth is vacant at the moment and education minister Jagarnath Mahto is yet to be reallocated his portfolio post his recovery from Covid. Even though the mahagathbandhan government of JMM-Congress-RJD had promised to provide 1 lakh jobs per year soon after it came to power in 2019, it has failed to do so. Since last week, a campaign against the state government for failing to provide jobs is trending on social media platform.

While the pandemic has halted everything, the state government is exploring various ways to create livelihoods,” he said, adding that being an alliance partner in the government, Congress will pursue all promises made in the manifesto in the interest of the people.

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Wary of killing elephant, forest officials try to chase jumbo back to its herd||RANCHI: The forest officials of Jharkhand have directed the field officers to chase back the lone elephant, which has killed 14 people across five districts of the state since March this year, to its parent herd in the Tundi forests of Dhanbad district. The 10-year-old male elephant, banished from his herd in Tundi earlier this year, had meandered into Santhal Pargana through Giridih. There, over the course of the next 90 days, it trampled 14 people to death. Between June 20 and June 24, the elephant had trampled five people in Jamtara and Deoghar districts. With the fatalities rising, there has been a growing chorus among the residents of Santhal Pargana to declare the elephant a rogue and bring in professional hunters to kill it. “We have deployed several teams of foresters to track the elephant and ensure that it stays on course towards Tundi forests, from where it moved out earlier this year. As per the reports, the elephant crossed Barakar river on Wednesday night and is heading towards the forests,” state chief wildlife warden Rajiv Ranjan said. “Our objective is to ensure that the elephant rejoins its herd. This will stop the mayhem and loss of lives,” he added. The last time Jharkhand declared an elephant rogue was in August 2017. The rogue, a 25-year-old tusker wandering in Sahibganj district, had killed 15 people in between March and August of 2017. The elephant was declared rogue and was shot dead as it had fatally attacked several people without provocation. Prior to 2017, another male tusker was declared rogue in Bokaro in 2008 and was killed. In 2005, a rogue elephant was gunned down in Latehar. “One of the prime requisites for declaring an animal rogue is that it has to attack humans without provocation. But in the case of Tundi’s lone male, it is the opposite. Despite early warnings, the locals are provoking the elephant, pelting stones or are trying to take photographs. But if the herd does not accept him back, it will become a problem for us,” a senior official, who is closely tracking the developments, told TOI. There are around 590 elephants in Jharkhand’s forests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/wary-of-killing-elephant-forest-officials-try-to-chase-jumbo-back-to-its-herd/articleshow/83819614.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Keeping the current Covid-induced restrictions in mind, the temple management made sure that only a limited number of servitors and volunteers took part in the rituals. The snan purnima rituals, which is part of shahni snan, were organised at Beldih Naga temple in Bistupur, Gandhi Ashram Jagannath temple in Sakchi, Rath Gali Jagannath temple in Jugsalai, Utkal Association in Golmuri, Namda Basti Kali temple, Jagannath temple in Khasmahal, among others. Following the shahi snan, the deities were adorned with new clothes and a variety of delicious food items were offered to them. Special kirtans were held at the temples as part of the prayers offered to the deities. “After mahasnan, lord Jagannath will take rest for 15 days and will reappear during Rath Yatra,” Seraikela Jagannath temple’s priest Brahmanand Mahapatra said. With shahi snan, the Jagannath Rath Yatra festival has commenced but organizers are not sure whether the government will allow them to the sacred and grand ritual of pulling the chariot, scheduled to take place two weeks later. “We are waiting for the government’s directive and will organise the Rath Yatra, accordingly,” Kharsawan’s circle officer Mukesh Machua said. Machua is the head of sarkari puja committee (puja organising committee) of Kharsawan Jagannath temple. The government bears the expense of the rituals performed at the temple here, a tradition in practise since several decades. Devotees are hoping that the government gives the green signal for taking out the chariot and allowing celebrations to take place in a restricted manner. “The usual enthusiasm associated with rath yatra will be missing if the government doesn’t allow us to take out the chariot on the streets and devotees are not allowed to participate in the ceremony for the second consecutive year,” gold merchant Abhinav Devchand said. Meanwhile, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskon)-run Jagannath temple at Cable Town in Golmuri has announced that the netra utsav and rath yatra would be organised without the fanfare. “Unlike panchamrit snan, the other two components of the festival -- netra utsav and rath yatra -- will be observed according to the safety norms issued by the government,” Iskon’s Jagannath temple functionary Prabhu Das said. In Ranchi too, ceremonial proceedings marked the day at the famous Jagannath temple in Dhurwa. A priest said, “All the rituals were held as per the laid out customs of the puja in strict accordance with safety norms and visitors were debarred from entering. As far as the rath yatra is concerned, it is unlikely to happen this year too due to Covid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/steel-city-temples-observe-shahi-snan-rath-yatra-likely-to-be-low-key-affair/articleshow/83832793.cms||B Sridhar

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand high court pulls up RMC for not evicting squatters near waterbodies||RANCHI: The Jharkhand high court on Thursday pulled up Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) for failing to remove encroachments around waterbodies in the state capital. The court in an oral observation said those who encroach on public places play hide and seek with authorities. “Those who encroach seem to be powerful people but in the eyes of justice all are same and no offender will be spared,” the court observed. The bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad also said encroaching waterbodies is a risky venture and will adversely affect the ecological balance. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by advocate Khushbu Kataruka on the plight of the Ranchi Lake in the heart of the state capital. The court was also apprised of the condition of Harmu river, Kanke and Dhurwa dams. The petitioner informed the court that several acres of land in the catchment area of reservoirs have been encroached and is a threat to the existence of the waterbodies. “The Harmu river flowing through the city is reduced to a drain and garbage has been dumped on its sides,” the court was informed. The petitioner also said that multi-storeyed buildings have been made flouting the rules of the corporation and yet no action is being taken against the perpetrators. The bench also queried the civic body on action taken for establishing a sewerage treatment plant to cleanse Ranchi Lake. The municipal corporation has been directed to file a detailed status report in the matter within a week’s time. Meanwhile, Kataruka in her petition has stated Ranchi Lake is infested with water hyacinth and has become the sewage pond of the municipal corporation. All the sewage of the city is drained into the lake, the counsel mentioned in her petition. She has also said that the depleting condition of the lake can be seen from its earlier pictures taken in the past few years. “While comparing the pictures, the degradation of the waterbody is crystal clear,” the advocate said. She also mentioned in her petition that heavy vehicles are parked alongside the road on the boundary of the lake. These vehicles are washed and the dirty water trickles back into the lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-pulls-up-rmc-for-not-evicting-squatters-near-waterbodies/articleshow/83819666.cms||---

The trend of new symptoms and spread of infection continued on the steep downward slope too. Doctors in the city observed that when the wave was at its peak gastric irritation and diarrhoea were mostly seen with other symptoms commonly associated with Covid-19. But off late, many who had merely an upset stomach tested positive. “The only complain they had was that they were having pain or discomfort in the stomach or diarrhoea. When we tested them for Covid-19, they were found positive,” said infectious diseases expert Dr Hiten Kareliya. Kareliya and Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) health department officials said that another major change in trend was that entire families were not infected when the wave started receding. “This was a major respite,” said Kareliya. A VMC official said that the second wave saw multiple members of the same family getting infected at its peak. “But this stopped when the numbers started going down,” the official said. Kareliya said that it was becoming necessary to study the virus as and when such things happened. He added that another possibility was that vaccination may have led to the change in the pattern. Covid-19 advisor to the district administration Dr Sheetal Mistry said that the possibility of the patient suffering from digestive system discomfort could not be ruled out. “There are reports that the virus was found in water and also regarding faecal-oral transmission,” he said. Mistry added that the progress of vaccination in the city was also good. He said this may have ensured that the infection did not spread to entire families when one person tested positive. He, however, pointed out that the virus still remained unpredictable and throws up surprises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/virus-threw-more-surprises-while-loosening-its-grip/articleshow/83817678.cms||Sachin Sharma

Between June 1 and June 24, Jharkhand has received a cumulative rainfall of 243.9 mm, which is 76% more than the state’s normal rainfall average of 138.3 mm for June. Jamtara has received 460.5 mm rain, which is a 204% excess from its normal average of 151.7 mm rain. Dhanbad has received 424.6 mm rain followed by Giridih (331.5 mm) Koderma (320.1 mm), Hazaribag (319.7 mm) and Simdega (314.8 mm). Ranchi has received 220.4 mm rain so far in June while East Singhbhum has received 270.2 mm rain. Palamu, which receives 80 mm rain during June, has recorded a cumulative rain of 207.9 mm, which is an excess of 160%. As per the rainfall data collected by IMD Ranchi, 23 out of 24 districts of the state received excess rains while one district (West Singhbhum) received normal rain. Even though the cyclonic storm Yaas propelled the timely onset of southwest monsoon currents over Jharkhand in between June 11 and June 13, the rain gathered momentum over the next fortnight as a cyclonic circulation over East Uttar Pradesh merged with a low-pressure area which was formed over South Bihar and its adjoining areas. In addition to this, the trough of low pressure of the monsoon currents passed through Jharkhand, thus, adding to the rains. While the IMD issued a light to moderate rain alert over most parts of the state till June 27, the weather office also said that the showers will continue in the first week of July. “Between July 2 to July 8, the rains will be heavier with heavy showers in isolated places and light to moderate showers in most parts,” the IMD said on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-receives-76-excess-rain-in-june-jamtara-wettest/articleshow/83820187.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The district civil surgeon, Dr S K Mishra, had ordered the probe hours after the woman, identified as Bubul Dutta, claimed on a viral video that she was administered another dose of the vaccine within 10 minutes of getting the first one by the auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) despite her pleadings that she had already taken the first dose. The incident happened at a vaccination centre in Poriyahat block and it cast a doubt on the protocols and the action of health workers during the vaccination drive in the district. Soon after receiving reports of the investigation conducted jointly by the district RCH officer and the chief medical officer (in-charge) of Poriyahat block, the district health department recommended to the deputy commissioner that strict action must be taken against the woman. Talking to TOI on Thursday, civil surgeon Dr Mishra said, “The woman's claim is fabricated and nothing of that sort had happened.” He further said, “The probe team inquired with all others present at the vaccination camp and none claimed to have seen or heard about the double-dose gaffe. Moreover, the video was filmed somewhere else and not at the vaccination site. If there was indeed any wrongdoing, someone must have seen or heard if the woman had raised the issue with the particular ANM.” Dr Mishra added, “We have forwarded the reports to the DC and requested him to take appropriate action against the woman for attempting to mislead people against the health workers during the crucial vaccination drive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/probe-junks-womans-claim-of-getting-2-vax-doses-in-10-mins/articleshow/83820090.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

Its office bearers informed that a new schedule would be declared after the situation normalized. As per original schedule, the polling date was March 25 and the final list of contestants was also prepared. According to HCBA, with passage of over five months since declaration of poll programme, the eligibility for being a voter has undergone a change as per its constitution. “Many members have become eligible for becoming voters as well as for becoming candidates. Uncertainty still prevails and even though HC’s physical working might resume, it would still be with strict restrictions. Taking into account all these circumstances, the election committee is of the considered opinion that the poll programme declared in January is rendered non-executable by passage of time,” the HCBA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hcba-cancels-poll-prog-defers-voting-indefinitely/articleshow/83849735.cms||---

On Nov 19, following a heated argument, Chandra Sekhar hit his father’s head with a stick. When Ankireddy tried to scream for help, Ramadevi stuffed a cloth inside his mouth. After killing him, they buried his body behind a temple near their house. Locals suspected foul play and informed cops, who exhumed the body. By the time the body was identified, the couple had fled.

He said it is his dream to spend Rs 34,000 crore to develop infrastructure facilities in Jagananna colonies which is highest in the country. The chief minister reviewed the housing programme and the Jagananna colonies planned across the state at his Tadepalli camp office on Thursday. The chief minister cautioned the officials against corruption in the housing programme and the colonies. He told them to ensure the basic infrastructure is provided in each of the 17,000 colonies planned in the state. Stating that construction of new housing colonies in large scale with all the infrastructure is his dream, Jagan Mohan Reddy wanted the officials to provide the best living standards for the poor. He also told them that the colonies should not become slums and wanted the officials and staff at all the levels to work to achieve the goal. The chief minister told the officials to have a dedicated number for complaints over the quality of works and suggestions on the housing programme and the colonies. He wanted them to erect a board in every layout with those details and added that the feedback should be regularly reviewed. Reviewing TIDCO houses, the officials informed the chief minister that 2,08,160 units will be completed in eighteen months and around Rs 10,000 crore will be spent on it. The officials informed the chief minister that the works related to mapping, geo-tagging, issuing of job cards, registration were almost completed and construction of 3.03 lakh houses has already started. The construction of seven lakh houses will start by July 10, this year and completed by June 2022. The officials further informed the chief minister that training camps were being organised for engineers and engineering assistants of village and ward secretariats on quality assurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagananna-colonies-to-get-infra-worth-rs-34k-cr/articleshow/83818609.cms||Gopi Dara

The whole world knows that we should wear a mask,” the official said. Since the pandemic last year, he said, celebrities and others have been generating awareness that social distancing, hand sanitising, and wearing a mask, is a must when one steps into a public space. “Yet, we see people roaming without wearing masks. What is important is the enforcement, and only a penalty will work,” he said. Immediately after the first phase of the pandemic, Goa saw an influx of domestic tourists. The crowds reduced by April this year as the whole country was hit by the second wave. Locals pointed fingers at visitors who were not fazed by the measures in place and were seen without masks in public spaces. “We have repeatedly asked the tourism department to install signage at beaches and other places that tourists visit, but they are yet to be installed,” said Nilesh Shah, TTAG president. The tourism department does not have the manpower to monitor tourist places for violations. While beaches are manned by a few IRB personnel, a proposal was moved before the onset of the pandemic last year to have a dedicated tourist police force. “We are yet to hear from the police department over the progress made in training police personnel who will be dedicated as tourist police. We don’t know if they have recruited personnel or would select from the existing force,” he said. It was decided that the police personnel who will be selected to work as tourist cops would be trained in soft skills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-rules-not-enough-need-enforcement-tourism-dept/articleshow/83821556.cms||---

Currently, the company is talking with various investors to raise funds from markets to translate their expansion plans into reality. The funds raised will be primarily used to “realise multiple priorities such as new product development and consumer awareness”. In December last year, the company rolled out their first fleet of e-cycles at Metro wholesale store in Kolkata. Manohar Bethapudi, head, growth and corporate strategy of the company, told TOI: “Four models were launched last year while the next fleet would comprise other variants of electric two-wheelers. We are now focused on the phase I implementation, for which the investment was pegged at Rs 100 crore. We have already shelled out 30% of it. There will also be a significant investment plan for phase II.” Recently, app-based cycle-sharing scheme has been reintroduced along with a cycle bay and cycle repair clinic in New Town. Asked whether Motovolt is mulling over joining hands with government agencies for the promotion of cycling among commuters, Bethapudi said, “It is part of our plan in the coming few months. We will be launching e-bikes around Diwali this year. Our target is to sell 10,000 e-cycles and e-bikes by this fiscal.” However, the company is not planning to come up with new e-cycle models in Kolkata market soon. “We will be continuing with the current fleet for this financial year and the focus is on expanding the market pan-India by adding more retail points. We are in the product development phase for the next fleet of e-vehicles,” said Bethapudi. The company is planning to open 100-plus exclusive showrooms across the country during the current fiscal and 25% of these showrooms will come up in Bengal. They are also planning to roll out e-bikes in the third quarter of this year. Tushar Choudhary, founder director of the company, said, “The market response has been encouraging for us. The dearth of public transport amid lockdown has shot up the demand for cycles.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/motovolt-set-for-expand-with-electric-mobility/articleshow/83821542.cms||Sarthak.G
---||Goa||‘Vaccine effective, kept 97% Goa Medical College staff safe from Covid’||PANAJI: Even as the vaccination drive has gained momentum, some people are sceptical and question the efficacy of the jab. Doctors in the state continue to debunk myths and point to statistics that show the number of people who got Covid-19 after either taking the first or both doses is negligible. Experts said that some ask what is the point of taking the shot if one can get infected even after that, but for instance, out of the 4,500 healthcare workers at Goa Medical College (GMC), less than 150 — either fully or partially vaccinated — got infected, which is about 3%. “More than 90% of doctors and other healthcare workers in GMC have been vaccinated and, despite working in the Covid hospital, fewer than 150 of them contracted the virus. None of them were hospitalised and fatalities were nil,” head of the department of preventive and social medicine at GMC, Dr Jagadish Kakodkar, told TOI. Kakodkar said that it must be borne in mind by those who are doubtful about the vaccine that the majority of GMC’s doctors and other staff, despite working throughout the second wave when infectivity was high, did not get the infection. Covid-related fatalities among healthcare workers across the country, he said, was less as compared to the first wave. It was because they were vaccinated when the second wave hit, Kakodkar said. “Despite the Delta strain being more severe and infectious fewer healthcare workers contracted the virus, also mortalities were less. This proves that the majority will not get the infection if vaccinated. The disease will be mild among those few who may get it,” he said. It is certain that people who are vaccinated fully with a gap of 84 days between the two doses, receive almost 92% to 94% protection, Kakodkar said. The protective efficacy of the Covishield vaccine when two doses given 84 days apart, is maximum. “Unvaccinated people are not only vulnerable to infection but 10% to 15% of them will develop moderate disease and 1% to 3 % will die due to the severity of the infection. Severe to moderate infection is definitely prevented by the vaccine,” he said. Out of the 3,000 Covid deaths reported in the state, the majority were not inoculated. While few died after the first dose and six died despite two doses, all of them had severe co-morbidities, like advanced cancer, kidney disease, heart failure and uncontrolled diabetes, he said. “We can’t say people have died despite taking the vaccine. They may have died due to their comorbidities. The vaccine has been proven safe and most feared complications at the beginning of the drive, like deaths and anaphylaxis reaction, have not been reported in Goa so far. Whatever reactions were seen among the younger population post-vaccination have been mild, like in the case of any other vaccine, and lasted for two to three days,” Kakodkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vaccine-effective-kept-97-gmc-staff-safe-from-covid/articleshow/83821592.cms||Bindiya Chari

However, as in the previous days, 359 old deaths were added to the overall toll (not counted in the daily fatalities). More than 62,000 fatalities from the coronavirus have been reported so far in June, the second highest monthly toll after May, when nearly 1.2 lakh deaths were recorded. India registered 51,256 fresh cases on Thursday, with data from Jharkhand yet to come in till past midnight, as per TOI's Covid database. With 9,844 new infections, Maharashtra's total case tally went past 60 lakh. The state's case count is by far the highest among all states, accounting for 20% of all Covid cases recorded in the country so far. At 28,54,325, Kerala's tally is the second highest, followed closely by Karnataka (28,23,444). However, these two states collectively have recorded fewer cases than Maharashtra. Maharashtra also reported the highest number of Covid deaths on Thursday at 197, while also reporting 359 "backlog" fatalities - deaths from earlier days being brought into the official toll. Meanwhile, after more than two months, Rajasthan reported zero deaths from the virus on Thursday. The state had reported a single fatality on Wednesday. Among states that continue to record a high number of deaths, Tamil Nadu reported 155 new fatalities on Thursday, Karnataka 138 and Kerala 136. Kerala also posted the highest count of fresh cases, with 12,078 new infections detected in the last 24 hours. Tamil Nadu reported 6,162 cases, Andhra Pradesh 4,981, Karnataka 3,979 and Odisha 3,650.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-third-time-in-4-days-india-records-less-than-1000-deaths/articleshow/83827892.cms||---

Students of Balram Residential School, Mushifond, at Amonem near Poinguinim are being forced to attend to their online lessons in the forest away from their homes for want of mobile network. “Considering the woes of students living in the interior parts of the state, authorities have not paid any heed to the problems of students who have been suffering since the past one year due to non-availability of mobile network,” a teacher said. In a recent report, TOI had highlighted how with the state government putting no measures in place to improve network connectivity, students will once again be forced to trek through remote forests to higher ground for internet access. Manisha Gaonkar, a SSC student from Verlem in Netravali panchayat, has to go in search out for better places to get net connectivity. “I want to achieve a good percentage for my exams. Though I am studying in Balram residential school, we are now at home due to the pandemic. So since we cannot get net connectivity at home, we have to trek up hilly areas to get signal, or else I will miss my online lessons. Despite this there are constant connectivity interruptions,” she said. Like her, Prajyot Gaonkar and Vidhya Gaonkar, who are also students of the same school, also echoed the same sentiments, and hoped that the pandemic ends so that normal classroom studies resume. A teacher at Balram school said that there are more than 10 students from different wards of Netravali like Verlem, Tudav and Saljini, who are facing tremendous hardships in attend online classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kids-in-canacona-sanguem-go-the-extra-mile-for-network/articleshow/83822005.cms||Albert Fernandes

The state has about 20 lakh students and under-45 college staffers. “We want to complete the first round of vaccination for this group by the first week of July, subject to vaccine availability,” said Arundhati Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission. After the high-level expert committee for prevention and management of third wave of Covid submitted its interim report, the government said colleges for students aged 18 years and above will be opened first. This was followed by a meeting where the chief minister directed health department authorities to initiate a vaccination campaign for this target group. In a circular issued on June 23, the government directed all districts to collect data on degree colleges, students and staffers and hand it to the health department. Also, the health department directed districts to appoint a nodal officer in each college for the campaign and the nodal officer to communicate with the respective reproduction and children health officer in charge of Covid vaccination in each district. The nodal officers must communicate to the beneficiaries. The colleges will be considered ‘workplace vaccination sites’ as per the Centre’s guidelines. “If 45-plus college staffers have not taken vaccination, then they will also be included in the drive. The number of students will be no less than 15 lakh,” said Arundhati. After reopening of colleges, the committee had suggested periodic review by local authorities. A district-level review committee comprising members from departments of health and education, teachers, school/college management and parent groups will look into the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-to-jab-20-lakh-college-students-staff-by-july-first-week/articleshow/83827920.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Lauding the efforts made by Congress in providing help to the people during the pandemic, Sonia said it was due to Congress’s pressure that the Modi government finally took up the responsibility of stepping up vaccination, adding that the party should push the government to treble the vaccination rate. She said experts were already warning of a third wave. Goa in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao is learnt to have said it was time for the former party president to start moving in poll-bound states as it energises party workers. A couple of other leaders reportedly mentioned the same, saying the visits should start early. According to sources, a general secretary stressed that while the in-charges were visiting states under their mandate, the real effect is made by the leadership. The request is in relation with the elections in February in which Congress faces the tough challenge of dislodging BJP governments in Goa and Uttarakhand, while saving its own in dissidence-ridden Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-congress-covid-meeting-netas-urge-rahul-to-start-poll-tour/articleshow/83827918.cms||---

The OPDs were stopped from April 20 after the hospital was converted into a Covid facility during the second wave. It had largely affected patients in need of emergency aid, including victims of motor vehicle accidents. Medical superintendent of the Ponda sub-district hospital Dr Vikas Kuwelkar said that they would shift all the patients to the South Goa District Hospital at Margao on Friday. The hospital has only nine patients, he said. “After shifting the patients, we need two days to fumigate the premises and will be ready for general patients from Monday,” Kuwelkar said. The hospital was converted as the full-fledged covid facility during the first wave too. Between August 11, 2020 and January 3 the OPDs were shifted to the Dilasa palliative care centre at Farmagudi.

The state government has also ordered withdrawal of cases filed by the previous government against media houses and people who protested in a democratic manner against three farm laws promulgated by the Centre, Citizenship Amendment Act, methane extraction, neutrino project, Kudankulam nuclear power plant and the Chennai-Salem Expressway project, the CM said. “All cases would be withdrawn against people who held nonviolent protests,” Stalin said, while replying to the debate on motion of thanks to the governor’s address to the assembly. “We have already asked authorities to review and order discharge of people, whatever the case may be, filed during the previous regime, if they were unjust, and if the protests were held in a non-violent manner,” Stalin said. The CM was responding to requests made by TVK leader T Velmurugan, CPM floor leader Nagai Mali and Congress whip S Vijayadharani seeking withdrawal of cases filed against people involved in agitation seeking constitution of Cauvery water management authority, anti-Sterlite stir, and women who were facing cases for protests against Tasmac outlets. Last month, Stalin had ordered withdrawal of cases against MDMK leader Vaiko, CPI leader R Nallakannu and CPM secretary K Balakrishnan. 2 industrial clusters to generate 22,000 jobs in northern TNLarge industries would come up in northern Tamil Nadu providing employment opportunities to 22,000 people, the CM said on Thursday.

The state’s case positivity rate reduced to 6% while the recovery rate stood at 96.50%. The mortality count reached 3,023. Of the nine deaths, six died at the Goa Medical College (GMC) and three at the South Goa District Hospital (SGDH).

Hence I request all fish vendors to come to the fish market and do business,” president of the Fish Vendors Association Shashikala Govekar said. Most vegetable vendors also did not turn up as they were asked by the municipality not to stock their goods in the market in wake of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/poor-response-to-opening-of-mapusa-mkt/articleshow/83822504.cms||---

Pant said, “I am ready to co-operate in the entire investigation. I have all the proof. I am innocent.” Pant said his firm was in negotiations only with the mela administration. “I’ve no idea how the Haridwar CMO or district administration is saying my expression of interest was initially rejected by them. I never approached them. The mela administration approved my expression of interest on March 12. We got the contract towards March-end and on April 5, the two labs associated with us got the user ID and password to access the ICMR portal to upload test reports,” Pant said. “Our firm was only facilitating the two labs — Dr Lal Chandani and Nalwa Path Labs. We neither had any workforce on the ground nor access to the ICMR portal.” Pant claimed he had no political connections. On allegations of Dr JP Nalwa, one of the owners of Nalwa Path Labs, that he had cancelled the MoU with Max over complaints of fake tests, Pant said he never received any letter from Nalwa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/totally-innocent-says-owner-of-co-accused-of-fake-tests-at-kumbh/articleshow/83827964.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Now, students of final year diploma want exams cancelled||PANAJI: After the state government called off the Class X and XII public exams for 2021 and on Wednesday also cancelled Goa University’s offline exams for final year postgraduate students, the clamour has now grown for cancellation of diploma programme exams. The final year diploma exams are scheduled to begin from July 5 in the offline mode and the directorate of technical education (DTE) has received several representations to call it off. Around 800 final year students of engineering and pharmacy programmes are expected to answer the exams next month. Officials of the DTE said that the board for technical education is scheduled to meet next week where the students’ representations will be discussed. As of now, the possibility of postponement of the exams is under consideration, sources said. “The Class X and XII exams and GU exams have been cancelled with the CM announcing that the pandemic is the reason. Then the same should also apply to diploma students,” said a diploma student. Students have demanded that, in their case too, instead of postponing exams, internal assessment marks should be taken into consideration to evaluate students and declare the results. The final year diploma programme examinations were conducted by the DTE in 2020 during the pandemic. Officials said that it was felt that a full-fledged exam offers more weightage to the diploma awarded and will help students in their higher education and employment opportunities. “As compared to the thousands of students that answer the Class X and XII exams and the GU exams, the number answering the diploma exams is lower. So the number is manageable to conduct exams by adhering to all pandemic norms. The exams were held without any issues last year too. They were conducted by calling students in batches to the college and seating only 12 students in a classroom,” said an official. However, he said that the students’ representations will be given due consideration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-students-of-final-year-diploma-want-exams-cancelled/articleshow/83822573.cms||---

It was administered to elderly patients having co-morbidities and those who reported within the first four to five days of developing symptoms, a doctor with the hospital said. Some patients were discharged the same day, but the hospital follows their progress over the phone, he said. The drug — consisting of Casirivimab and Imdevimab — which is given intravenously to treat mild to moderate Covid-19 cases, is very expensive, but is free in government hospitals. The drug helps reduce chances of the patient developing complications as also the need for hospitalisation, the doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/12-get-antibody-cocktail-at-chicalim-hosp/articleshow/83822535.cms||---

The bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice T V Thamilselvi also directed the Union government to explain as to why only Dr Reddy’s Laboratories had been approved for production of the drug. The court the ordered counsel for the Centre to get instructions from the authorities concerned and file a detailed report by June 25. According to the petitioner, D Saravanan, DRDO had discovered 2DG oral powder as an adjunctive therapy to standard of care in the acute treatment of moderate to severe Covid-19 patients. Though the drug had received emergency use approval from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) during the pandemic, licence to manufacture was granted only to Dr Reddy's Laboratory. The privately-owned pharma company has planned to sell the drug at ₹990 per sachet containing 2.34 g of the oral powder, he said. While Covid-19 is causing huge economic loss to the nation, the policy of granting license to one particular company will create monopolistic trade and give way to price rise, he added. Claiming that giving the licence to several medical companies might bring down the price of the drug when several lives are being lost, the petitioner wanted the court to direct the authorities to provide the licence to multiple pharmaceutical companies. He said the inordinate delay caused by the private pharmaceutical manufacturing company in bringing the drug to market has been adversely affecting severely-affected patients in ICUs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/what-is-delaying-anti-covid-19-drug-by-drdo-madras-hc-asks-centre/articleshow/83827987.cms||Sureshkumar

At least four popular safari destinations — Sariska and Ranthambore in Rajasthan and Tadoba-Andhari and Nagzira-Navegaon in Maharashtra — announced that they would receive tourists Friday onwards as a drop in Covid cases provides a small window of opportunity. Several others are likely to make an announcement in a day or two. In a circular issued on Thursday, NTCA inspector general Amit Mallick said, “As the Covid situation has improved across the country, the chief wildlife wardens may take a call to open tiger reserves for tourism.” After the death of two lions in Tamil Nadu’s Arinagar Anna Zoological Park and reports of tigers and lions testing positive for Covid in Etawah, Mumbai, Jaipur and Hyderabad zoos, the NTCA had ordered the closure of parks with immediate effect on June 7. Opposing and wanting the order revoked, Madhya Pradesh had kept Kanha, Bandhavgarh, Pench, Satpura and Panna reserves open for tourism from June 1 and will shut on June 30. After opening for safaris on October 1 last year, the reserves shut around April 15 following a rise in Covid cases. Many parks close down for monsoon between July 1 and September 30. Safaris continue in the buffer zones of Corbett, Ranthambore (some parts of core), Tadoba, Sunderbans and a few others even during rains. Maharashtra forest chief Nitin Kakodkar said that even “Pench and Melghat can be thrown open to tourists”. Pench authorities are awaiting a nod from the Nagpur district collector. A senior forest department official in Bengal said that since restrictions imposed by the state government were in place till June 30, “there is no clarity”. Uttarakhand will take a decision on June 29 when the ongoing phase of Covid curfew ends. “The decision to open buffer zones would depend on the revised Covid guidelines. The forests would be opened for tourists if their accessibility is found to be easy and smooth,” added JS Suhag, the chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department. TN is not keen to open the sanctuaries immediately. “A decision will be taken after sometime,” said a source. Karnataka forest department sources said they are keen to open the zoo and safari for the public. Officials with the Bannerghatta National Park outside Bengaluru have sought permission from the commissioner of the state health department to start from Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/small-window-of-opportunity-as-tiger-tourism-set-to-restart/articleshow/83827997.cms||---

Justice G Narendar, however, added that if the UP police desires to investigate or examine the petitioner, they may do so in virtual mode. The matter has now been listed on June 29 for further consideration and objections if any can be filed by the respondent UP police. Manish had moved the court challenging the notice issued by UP police under section 41A of the CrPC to appear in person at the Loni Border police station in Ghaziabad at 10.30 am on Thursday. On June 15, Ghaziabad police booked the microblogging platform, a news website and journalists over the circulation of a video related to the assault. The case was registered under IPC sections related to incitement and criminal conspiracy. Senior advocate CV Nagesh, who appeared for Manish, said the petitioner is only an employee, a revenue head, in charge of advertising sales. He is neither a member of the board of directors nor responsible for uploading of the alleged video for which police have registered the FIR, he said. He argued that in response to police notice, Manish had replied he would join the investigation in virtual mode as he is a resident of Bengaluru. “In all probability, the respondent police, taking offence to the said request, issued a notice under section 41A of CrPC, virtually putting him in the shoes of an accused from that of a witness,” he said. P Prasanna Kumar, special public prosecutor for UP police, opposed the petition, submitting that it is not maintainable as the petitioner is from Mumbai, as shown in the documents. He further claimed that the petitioner was called as part of further investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-high-court-to-up-cops-no-coercive-action-against-twitter-md-manish-maheshwari/articleshow/83828006.cms||Vasantha Kumar

So far, over 30 crore vaccine doses have been provided by the Centre to states/ UTs, through centralised and direct state procurement categories. Of this, total consumption, including wastages is just over 28.4 crore doses, according to data available till Thursday morning. Nearly 1.9 crore balance and unutilised Covid vaccine doses are still available with states and UTs to be administered. Besides, around 21 lakh vaccine doses are in the pipeline and will be received by states/UTs within the next 3 days, the ministry said. Under the new vaccination strategy which came into effect from June 21, the Centre will procure 75% of the locally manufactured jabs and distribute among states for free administration to all above 18 years of age. The rest 25% has been earmarked for private hospitals, where people will have to pay for vaccination. Over 59 lakh doses were administered on Thursday till 9:30pm, after a total of over 2 crore doses were delivered through first three days since the implementation of the new policy. So far, 7.6 crore vaccine doses have been administered in the age group18-44years.\||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaccine-supply-to-states-fair-based-on-several-criteria-centre/articleshow/83828019.cms||---

Replying to the debate on motion of thanks to the governor’s address, the chief minister said in the assembly that several people, who recovered from Covid infection, had been reporting some complications. Stalin said Palaniswami was chief minister until May 6 and he failed to check the rise in cases. The cases that stood at 6,618 on April 12, shot up to19,588 on May 2, when the votes were counted. Though the election code of conduct came into force on February 26, the EPS government wrote to the election commission only on April 9 seeking permission for the chief minister to hold Covid review. “The AIADMK has to take responsibility for the rise. The infection rose drastically since March 6. The state commission for protection of child rights even warned the education department. The cases surpassed 19,000 per day in April. It is wrong to say the AIADMK contained the spread. Did anyone tell him (EPS) not to do Covid work?” Stalin asked. He wondered whether the AIADMK government had forgotten that it had to run the administration - especially carrying out Covid-related work - till the new government took over. Palaniswami intervened to say the election commission authorised only the chief secretary to do Covid review.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/will-set-up-post-covid-clinics-promises-tamil-nadu-cm-m-k-stalin/articleshow/83828022.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Mineral seigniorage drops by 40% in May||AMARAVATI: Revenue from mineral seigniorage was badly hit during May due to Covid-19. Revenue fell short by nearly 40 per cent of the target set by the department. Revenue from the districts were pegged at Rs 126 crore against the target of Rs 204 crore. The state government had collected Rs 211 crore in April. According to officials, Covid-19 second wave crippled operations in many quarries. Workers migrating to native places and falling sick due to Covid-19 were the reasons cited by factories in slowing down operations. The diversion of industrial oxygen to medical oxygen also contributed to major losses to mineral units, particularly granite and slab factories. The district administrations directed industrial oxygen producers to convert it into medical oxygen and supply to hospitals. All the industrial oxygen units were made to stop supplies to the factories due to health emergency in the state. “Many industrial units linked with the mineral production suffered huge losses or production cut down due to shortage of industrial oxygen,” said a senior official of mines and geology department. Revenue from minerals in April, 2021 reported nearly 25 per cent growth over the corresponding period in 2020. “In fact, it is nearly 121 per cent achievement against the target for April, 2021,” said an official. While the state government set a target of Rs 175.32 crore, the department pocketed Rs 211.99 crore in one month. Keeping in view of April revenue, the government upped the target and put it at Rs 204.54 crore. However, the slowdown of operations in mineral units resulted in poor revenues. The department could fetch just Rs 126.77 crore which is just 62 per cent of the target.

The court also expressed its displeasure over ‘inadequate supply’ of black fungus medicine to the state. Hearing a batch of petitions filed against the state and central governments for failing to take adequate measures to tackle Covid-19 situation, the HC asked both governments to file memos with specific details regarding oxygen plants, black fungus medication, vaccination details and preparedness to tackle the perceived third wave. The HC bench, headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya, asked additional solicitor general N Harinath about the number of black fungus cases in the state and the status on supply of Amphotericin-B injections. Harinath told the bench that 1,528 cases have been detected so far, and 4,941 vials of Amphotericin-B has been made available to AP. YV Ravi Prasad, amicus curiae to the high court, informed the bench that the number of vials are inadequate as the state needs 58,000 vials to treat 697 severe cases. He said 232 lives have already been lost due to black fungus and more people will die if the Union government does not increase the supply of Amphotericin-B vials. The bench also wanted to know why it’s taking so long to set up the sanctioned PSI oxygen plants. Expressing displeasure over making only five plants operational out of the 55 sanctioned, the Chief Justice said there seems to be some kind of laxity in the government administration after the number of cases started coming down. The court asked the Union government to file a memo with all details pertaining to supply of Amphotericin-B, setting up of oxygen plants and also vaccination figures. The HC further asked both governments to detail the steps taken to tackle the potential third wave and posted the matter for further hearing to July 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-expresses-displeasure-over-inadequate-supply-of-black-fungus-medicine-to-andhra/articleshow/83818042.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Rekha Kadiresh (BJP), twice corporator and resident of Chalavadipalya (Cottonpet), died en route to hospital. She was the second wife of rowdy-sheeter Kadiresh, who was hacked to death in February 2018. She is survived by a son and daughter. #Bengaluru : #RekhaKadiresh (BJP), two-term corporator, was stabbed at least 17 times by two aides in public, minut… https://t.co/SAJrNODSO1— TOI Bengaluru (@TOIBengaluru) 1624589441000Police identified the attackers as Peter and Surya based on eyewitness accounts and digital evidence, including CCTV footage. Police learnt that another suspect Stephen helped Peter and Surya. The murder took place around 10.30am outside Rekha’s office at Flower Garden. Rekha, who lived nearby, reached there by 9.30 am. She distributed breakfast among the poor and stepped out of her office to return home when Peter and Surya accosted her. One stabbed her in the neck with a knife and the other hit her on the head with a dagger. People in the area scurried for cover. Rekha ran into a small lane, where the duo stabbed her multiple times and fled. Passersby rushed her to the nearby Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences hospital, where doctors declared her dead on arrival around 11am. Police concluded it was a well-planned murder as the miscreants had turned several CCTV cameras in the areas away from the crime scene. S Murugan, ACP, said police have collected information from eyewitnesses about the killers. “We’ll nab them soon,” he added. Police deployed additional men at Rekha’s office and at KIMS hospital. Rekha’s relative and primary suspect Peter had been her ardent supporter and it’s not clear why he turned against her. Rekha’s son Rahul told police his mother had arranged for him and his sister to live in BTM Layout after his father’s murder. “I requested her to stay with us but she preferred Chalavadipalya. Peter was close to my father and mother,” Rahul said. A senior police officer said they’re checking for the Kadiresh couple’s old rivals, financial disputes and political jealousy. According to sources, a few of Kadiresh’s relatives were planning to contest the next BBMP elections but saw Rekha’s hold over the ward a hurdle. “Peter, Surya and Stephen were her relatives. We’re verifying the suspects’ financial transactions and collecting more details about them,” a police officer said. Peter had been arrested for allegedly killing one of Kadiresh’s killers and was currently out on bail. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa said he had spoken with police commissioner Kamal Pant about the case. “I’ve instructed police to arrest the killers within 24 hours,” he added. Home minister Basavaraj Bommai has instructed Pant to ensure a thorough probe.

---||Vijayawada||‘No coercive action against NRIAS members’||Vijayawada: The high court on Thursday directed the police not to take any coercive steps against three executive council members of NRI Academy of Sciences (NRIAS) society. A house motion petition was moved late on Wednesday night after Mangalagiri police swooped into the premises of the society after receiving a complaint. NRIAS has been mired in controversy after internal disputes between its executive members came to the fore following the removal of Mukkamala Apparao as secretary of the society. A police complaint was also lodged, allegedly at the behest of Apparao, against Dr Nimmagadda Upendranath, Dr Mani Akkineni and Dr Raghava Rao. Challenging the case registered against them, the trio moved the high court with a house motion petition. Justice C Manavendra Roy, who heard the petition on Thursday, was informed by N Ashwani Kumar, counsel for the petitioners, that the complaint was lodged with ulterior motive to obstruct the petitioners from attending the executive council meeting. He sought relief from the court and sought directions to the police not to arrest the petitioners. The HC considered his arguments and directed the police not to arrest or take any coercive steps against the petitioners until further orders.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/no-coercive-action-against-nrias-members/articleshow/83818078.cms||---
