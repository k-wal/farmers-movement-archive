Authorities believe a man they arrested Thursday acted alone.  There were at least eight separate shootings in three cities that stoked fear throughout the region and shut down parts of major freeways as police gathered evidence. Four people were shot, including the person who died.  Others were injured as bullets shattered glass or as their vehicles crashed. Authorities said the injured victims were all adults and expected to fully recover. Their identities haven't been released.  One victim was able to give authorities a description of the suspect's vehicle - a white Volkswagen SUV - and the license plate number. A local fire department spotted the vehicle and called police, who swarmed a retail area.  As officers drew their weapons, the shooter, who has not been identified, raised his hands and did not resist arrest, video shot by a bystander showed. Police don't believe anyone else was involved in the attacks.  "We don't know the nexus, we don't know what the motive was," said Brandon Sheffert, a spokesman for police in the suburban city of Peoria. "We don't have an idea of what this person was thinking when he went out and did this."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/motive-sought-for-fatal-string-of-arizona-freeway-shootings/articleshow/83649512.cms||---
---||World||US Catholic bishops OK steps toward possible rebuke of Biden||US Catholic bishops overwhelmingly approved the drafting of a "teaching document" that many of them hope will rebuke Catholic politicians, including President Joe Biden, for receiving Communion despite their support for abortion rights.  The result of the vote - 168 in favor and 55 against - was announced Friday near the end of a three-day meeting of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops that was held virtually.  The bishops had cast their votes privately on Thursday after nearly three hours of impassioned debate.  Supporters of the measure said a strong rebuke of Biden was needed because of his recent actions protecting and expanding abortion access, while opponents warned that such action would portray the bishops as a partisan force during a time of bitter political divisions across the country.  As a result of the vote, the USCCB's doctrine committee will draft a statement on the meaning of Communion in the life of the church that will be submitted for consideration at a future meeting, probably an in-person gathering in November.  One section of the document is intended to include a specific admonition to Catholic politicians and other public figures who disobey church teaching on abortion and other core doctrinal issues.  Bishop Donald Hying of Madison, Wisconsin, said during Thursday's debate that he speaks with many people who are confused by a Catholic president who advances "the most radical pro-abortion agenda in history," and action from the bishops' conference is needed.  "They're looking for direction," Hying said.  Bishop Robert McElroy of San Diego countered that the USCCB would suffer "destructive consequences" from a document targeting Catholic politicians.  "It would be impossible to prevent the weaponization of the Eucharist," McElroy said.  Biden, who attends Mass regularly, says he personally opposes abortion but doesn't think he should impose that position on Americans who feel otherwise. He's taken several executive actions during his presidency that were hailed by abortion-rights advocates.  The chairman of the USCCB doctrine committee, Bishop Kevin Rhoades of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Indiana, said no decisions have been made on the final contents of the proposed document. He said bishops who are not on the committee will have chances to offer input, and the final draft will be subject to amendments before it is put up to a vote.  Rhoades also said the document would not mention Biden or other individuals by name and would offer guidelines rather than imposing a mandatory national policy.  That would leave decisions about Communion for specific churchgoers up to individual bishops and archbishops. Cardinal Wilton Gregory, the archbishop of Washington, has made clear that Biden is welcome to receive Communion at churches in the archdiocese.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-catholic-bishops-ok-steps-toward-possible-rebuke-of-biden/articleshow/83649622.cms||---

---||India||It's my effort to conduct the House with consensus: Om Birla||In the past two years, Lok Sabha saw record levels of productivity, spirited debates and its fair share of controversies. Speaker Om Birla speaks on issues such as House disruptions, the new Parliament building and the debate on virtual House panel meetings in a conversation with Akhilesh Singh. Excerpts:On June 19, you will complete two years as Lok Sabha Speaker, how has your experience been?It has been good. The Prime Minister, politicians from all parties and all members of the house have served well. It is because of this that we have been able to maintain the people's belief in democracy and in democratic institutions. For the past two years, I have tried to ensure that maximum members get time to speak in the House. As many as 107 bills were passed in two years with record participation in debates. We have also digitised questions, now 90% questions come digitally, earlier it used to be 40%. Besides, productivity was also high. During corona also, it was 167%. It is my effort to conduct the House with consensus. You have given chances to newcomers and women to raise issues. What has your experience been with these experiments?The first session functioned for 27 days in which 35 bills were passed with 122% productivity. It has been my effort that more and more people get opportunities. In one day, 161 people spoke during zero hour. I think it is a record. In the last session, there was demand for a special debate on Covid-19. Do you think there will be a dedicated debate on Covid-19 in the coming session?In the last session, Covid-19 was discussed. The Business Advisory Committee decides which issues will be taken up. All party members are there. They decide which issues are to be discussed. When you took over in 2019, initial sessions took place smoothly but in the last two sessions, we saw that the opposition got a little aggressive. Since assembly polls are around the corner, are you expecting another stormy session?It is my sincere effort that the House runs smoothly. But some political parties resolve to not let the House run on a certain day. This kind of tendency and a pre-meditated mindset is not good for a democratic institution. Any issue can be discussed as there is a process but to not let the House run is undesirable. Certain people say earlier, entire sessions used to be washed out. I say let's set a good example. In the last session, some senior leaders complained that they were not being given enough time to speak.If any issue is raised according to the rules, then everyone gets enough time. What they say outside is not my business but if they complain to me, then I shall give them time. Can we expect the monsoon session on time and what will be the agenda of the session?Let's hope that the session takes place as per schedule. The government agenda is fixed by the Centre, which bills are to be tabled. Whatever the government tells us, we hold a debate on that. If there is no consensus, then we hold a vote. You have been active on digital platforms for a long time. What is your opinion on the ongoing Twitter controversy?Twitter and other social media have been summoned to our parliamentary committees too. The law of a sovereign nation is universally applicable to all who live and work there. However, as far as the issue between Twitter and the government goes, I think government representatives have spoken enough about it. Lok Janshakti Party leader Chirag Paswan has requested you not to identify the five MPs as a new group and not give them recognition. What will be your next step?Out of six party MPs, five came to me and said Pashupati Kumar Paras is their leader. We matched their signatures. We keep the records updated and we simply change the information, that a certain leader will be seen as their representative in the House. Parliamentary boards are different, the party is different. They can hold another meeting, have another majority, and we will change the information again. BSP has changed its leaders several times. For a long time, requests were being made for virtual meetings of standing committees as members didn't want to attend physically. But indecision persists.There are two issues. There is Rule 362 according to which the minutes of the committee's meetings will be confidential and won't be discussed in public, unless completely necessary. Until 362 is changed, virtual meetings cannot happen. The new Parliament's construction is projected to be completed by 2022. Is the construction on track?They have given October 2022 as the deadline and I believe the work will get over by then. All agencies are at work and they are working brilliantly. They fell behind by 16 days but then recovered that lag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/its-my-effort-to-conduct-the-house-with-consensus-birla/articleshow/83650126.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||World||California launches digital Covid-19 vaccine pass but won't require it||OAKLAND: California officials on Friday unveiled a website to access or download a digital copy of COVID-19 immunization records, though they stressed the state would not make it mandatory to carry the vaccine credentials.  Businesses will be able to verify the authenticity of digital "vaccine cards" by scanning a QR code on them using an app that a nonprofit group is expected to launch this month. The nearly 20 million immunized Californians can access their data at myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov.  "It's an optional tool to use," said State Epidemiologist Dr. Erica Pan.  California opened up from COVID-19 restrictions on Tuesday, with masks, social distancing and capacity limits no longer required at most venues for those who are vaccinated. But businesses are largely operating on the honor system and not "carding" people.  Still, state officials said the e-pass could help in some circumstances, such as for travel.  Other states have barred shops and offices from requiring proof of vaccination, deriding "vaccine passports" as an intrusion on civil liberties.  California's technology department developed its new website using technology known as Smart Health Cards, which originated at Boston Children's Hospital. Walmart Inc this week also adopted Smart to support people who were vaccinated at its stores.  The approach contrasts with New York state, which paid IBM to develop a records app called Excelsior Pass, as well as a companion app for verification. Over a million people downloaded their records onto New York's app, but few businesses have required them.  California's Los Angeles County has offered digital Covid-19 vaccine records for months through startup Healthvana. Millions of users have taken advantage, said Healthvana Chief Executive Ramin Bastani.  Users may experience glitches with California's new system, because their entered names, birthdates and contact information must match immunization records. Rick Klau, the state's chief tech innovation officer, said only about 90% of records include contact information and some of it may be outdated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-launches-digital-covid-19-vaccine-pass-but-wont-require-it/articleshow/83651524.cms||---
---||World||Joe Biden, Kamala Harris urge vaccinations as US looks to miss July 4 target||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris urged Americans to get Covid-19 shots on Friday, as the country looks likely to miss the White House's goals for vaccination next month.  "Act now, act now," Biden said in remarks at the White House, urging the unvaccinated to talk to their family and friends who have had shots.  Deaths and hospitalizations are going "drastically down in places where people are getting vaccinated," but not other areas, Biden said. "They're actually going up in some places."  At the current pace, the United States seems unlikely to hit Biden's goal of 70 percent of adults receiving at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by July 4, the Independence Day holiday. As of Friday, around 65.1 percent of people in the United States had gotten at least one shot, and that mark has increased by less than one percentage point over the past two weeks.  That pace would have to more than double over the next two weeks for the United States to hit the target.  "When you get the vaccine for yourself, that means that you will not possibly pass it on to somebody else in general because you're unlikely to get Covid," Harris said during a vaccination drive at Atlanta's famed Ebenezer Baptist Church. "Isn't that an extension of love thy neighbor?" she said, to which several in the audience responded, "Amen!"  The United States has administered 300 million Covid-19 vaccinations in 150 days, a White House official said on Friday ahead of Biden's speech. Biden's government-wide push to accelerate vaccinations was paying off, with Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths down to their lowest levels since the start of the pandemic, officials said.  The news comes days after the United States marked a grim milestone, surpassing 600,000 Covid-19 deaths.  The US death toll remains the highest in the world, although other countries, including Brazil, Britain and Russia, have higher death rates as a measure of their populations.  A White House fact sheet said the number of Covid-19 deaths has decreased by 90% since Biden took office in January, when more than 3,300 Americans were dying each day, and highlighted big gains in the economy as people return to work.  It said more than 175 million Americans had now received at least one Covid-19 vaccine shot, and 55% of adults were fully vaccinated.  Addressing racial imbalances in vaccination rates remained a huge and continuing concern, the White House said, but pointed to gains there as well. In the past month, it said, people of color had accounted for 54% of nationwide vaccinations, while making up 40% of the US population.  The vice president's visit to a vaccination site at the Ebenezer Baptist Church on Friday underscored the importance of faith groups and community-based organizations in accelerating vaccinations and overcoming vaccine hesitancy.  "Church is always a healing place. It's so appropriate that we're doing this here," Harris said in remarks at the historic church where civil rights leader the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and his father once preached.  "We just need to get the word out. One of the most important ways is friend to friend, neighbor to neighbor ... please help us get the word out," Harris said, according to a pool press report on the visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-kamala-harris-urge-vaccinations-as-us-looks-to-miss-july-4-target/articleshow/83651868.cms||---

Beauty parlours and salons had to remain shut during the recent lockdown. With the unlock, however, Mumbaikars are now making up for lost time and rushing to their favourite beauty corner to get a touch-up, a new haircut or pedicure done. There is a difference though — salons, like restaurants, are only open till 4 pm and with 50 per cent capacity. The beauty industry, which has been facing losses due to closure, is just glad to be back at work. Says Vijayendra Sinha, general manager, operations, at a chain of salons in the city, “The salon industry witnessed tumultuous changes in 2020, but in 2021, the impacts of a lockdown is challenging every rule in our corporate books. With business gradually kickstarting again, we are back with a zeal and clients have also welcomed us back.” Pushkaraj Shenai, CEO of a salon chain, adds, “The first week of unlock has been promising, though the 4pm deadline has affected us as our highest footfalls are generally on the weekend. We hope the restrictions ease further.” Monsoon makeovers and hair spa treatments in huge demand after lockdown: Salon ownersGrooming tops many city-goers’ list and they’ve already checked in for a variety of treatments — right from the regular waxing-threading to hair touch-ups and some nail TLC. Informs Vijayendra, “The first week had clients rushing to avail their go-to services like a haircut or pedicure after a long lockdown. We’ve also seen a steady rise in haircuts with hair colour being the next most popular service. The rains are also inspiring people to go for a makeover, more like inviting change to break the monotony.” Archana Jain, founder of spa and salon in Sion, says, “Hair treatments – colour, cut and trimming — are what 90 per cent of our customers are asking for. Hair spa with keratin and cysteine treatment are also popular as the monsoon can be harsh on the hair. There is not much demand for facials yet. While business such as food deliveries flourished over the last few months, we did not, as you can’t cut hair via a video call. People also didn’t have confidence in home services, so we looked forward to the reopening of salons. Though the 4pm cut-off timings will affect business, something is better than nothing.” Safety measures also include contactless services and disposablesSalons and beauty parlours have a number of safety measures in place, so expect to be greeted by staff in PPE suits, temperature checks, and social distancing at the salon. Says Pushkaraj Shenai, “All our employees have been vaccinated as the safety and well-being of our team and customers are top priority. Bookings are on appointment basis only. Our experts wear hair nets, double masks, gloves, shoe covers and disposable aprons. We undertake complete sanitisation of equipments and use single-use sachets and mono-dose kits. In addition, we have also introduced new contactless services such as contactless threading.” Encouraging sanitisation of equipment and contactless payment (Pics: iStock; pictures for representational purpose only) Mamtaa Joshi, salon chain owner, adds, “Our staff has undergone safety and hygiene training for the new normal. Indoor areas and high-contact surfaces are sterilised and we also do deep disinfections. Disposable bedsheets and towels are used and outside footwear is not allowed. For nail services, we have a shield between the client and nail artists to place an emphasis on hand hygiene.” ‘The 4pm deadline has impacted revenue’The salons say the current timing is not making it easy for footfalls and they hope things will ease up. Says Vijayendra, “The 4pm deadline and no-work weekends have definitely impacted the revenue generation as a chunk of our business takes place during these days, but clients are adjusting their schedule to incorporate weekday appointments.” Here’s what to expect at salons during the unlock Temperature checks are mandatory before entering a salon (iStock)- Staggered appointment times - No walk-ins - Temperature checks - Staff in PPE suits - Mandatory masks for experts and clients - Use of disposable aprons, towels and sanitised equipment - Sanitising of all indoor areas and touch points - Social distancing measures in the salon - Contactless services||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/as-salons-reopen-mumbaikars-rush-to-get-their-much-postponed-haircuts/articleshow/83646157.cms||Ismat Tahseen
---||India||J&K: PM to hold all-party meet on June 24, polls on agenda||NEW DELHI: With the security forces continuing to have an upper hand in Jammu & Kashmir and the state appearing to reap a “safety” dividend, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to hold a meeting of all political parties from the UT on June 24. While the date could still be under discussion, official sources said the plan for the meeting is under consideration and has been tentatively scheduled. The meeting will be seen as a bid to move the political process in the UT after a gradual easing of restrictions on the internet and detention of political leaders. The agenda ahead includes completion of the delimitation exercise and holding of assembly elections for the installation of a government. Union home minister Amit Shah Friday reviewed the situation in the sensitive Union territory, sparking speculation about a possible political initiative. J&K LG Manoj Sinha attended the review held amid a steady decline in terrorist incidents, local recruitment, and infiltration this year: gains which would not have looked possible until recently. This has enabled the administration to push the coverage of central schemes to 90% and vaccination coverage to 76% of the population aged 45 years and above. At the meeting, Shah noted the improved security scenario and expanded the reach of central schemes, and stressed the need to speed up the implementation of the Prime Minister's development package and other industrial projects. The meeting was held against the backdrop of speculation that the Centre was exploring the possibility of building upon the relative peace to take political measures, When contacted sources refrained from confirming whether likely political steps also figured in the meeting. "The focus was on development and vaccination and let us keep it at that", said a senior source stopping well short of denying that a political initiative was discussed.  At the separate security review on J&K chaired by Shah on Friday - where NSA Ajit Doval, heads of Central intelligence agencies and para-military forces and J&K DGP were present - the statistics appeared to confirm the upper hand for security forces. Terrorist incidents were down to around 40 till May 31 this year, as compared to 238 in the whole of 2020. As many as 52 terrorists were killed by forces in the first five months of 2021. At his meeting with Sinha, Shah complimented the LG and his team for the success of the Covid-19 vaccination drive in J&K, with 76% of the 45-plus population having been vaccinated and four districts – Ganderbal, Shopian, Jammu and Samba - achieving 100% vaccination in this category. The success of the ‘J&K vaccination model’ can be attributed to special initiatives including door-to-door vaccination and a conscious bid to help people overcome vaccine hesitancy by involving community and religious leaders to bust the vaccine ‘myths Shah, during Friday’s review meeting attended by Central and J&K government brass, asked for speedy implementation of PM’s package and other development projects, particularly the start of 3000 MW Pakal Dul and Keeru hydroelectric projects and fast-tracking of other 3300 MW projects. He directed officials to organize training for the members of the panchayats and urban local bodies for better grassroots governance. He also suggested that the panchayat representatives visit various parts of the country to observe the working of developed panchayats there. Officials said the development push in J&K would not have been possible but for the steady improvement in security scenario since 2018. Sources said local recruitment in J&K declined with 42 youths joining terror ranks till May 31 this year as compared to around 180 through 2020. Even infiltration has fallen drastically and many feel this would have brought the total number of active terrorists in J&K lower to the ‘usual’ figure of 200-300. An official told TOI that successes on the security front have created a conducive environment to push development initiatives in J&K. While reviewing the development initiatives on Friday, Shah called for widening the scope of MGNREGA to provide employment to more people. He spoke about the use of modern techniques in agriculture to increase the income of the farmers, seeking the setting up of at least one agro-based industry in each district. He said work should be done to increase the quality and density of apple production in UT. Shah directed the J&K administration to ensure that all farmers were provided benefits of agriculture-based schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Kisan Yojana. The minister suggested that it be ensured that the benefits of the industrial policy reach the small-scale industries. He lauded the efforts for providing employment to youth and institutional reforms like geo-tagging of all development works that are put in public domain, etc Shah directed that it be ensured that benefits of the refugee package reach the migrants from PoJK, West Pakistan and those who had to migrate from Kashmir to Jammu, at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-may-hold-all-party-meet-on-jk-june-24/articleshow/83652505.cms||Bharti Jain
---||Goa||Players have improved in last two years, Sandesh is among best in Asia: Igor Stimac||Panaji: Igor Stimac said he has a list of 35 players good enough to represent the country with at least three of them competing for each position in the national football team. “India is not dependent on 13-14 players anymore,” the chief coach told reporters during an online interaction on Friday. For the last leg of the World Cup 2022 qualifiers in Doha, though, the coach said he was forced to handpick players from just two teams – FC Goa and Bengaluru FC – who had some training sessions and competitive minutes under their belt closer to the camp. “That’s why we used most of these players, along with ATK Mohun Bagan,” said Stimac. “When you look at the game plan we are trying to implement, ATK Mohun Bagan and Bengaluru are counter-attacking sides. They are not ball-possession sides. To find a proper balance and find a team that produces results is really difficult.” With the All India Football Federation’s technical committee set to decide on the chief coach’s future with the national team, Stimac said he was not unduly worried. Instead, he reflected on the progress that the players have made. “Sunil (Chhetri) is better now than two years ago; Sandesh (Jhingan) is twice as better today than two years ago. He is one of the best, defensively speaking, centre-backs in Asia at the moment, but now working hard on his passing. He can become the best one in Asia. “Gurpreet (Singh Sandhu) is much better today than few years ago. Now I am talking about the spinal part of the team. These are the real examples of our achievements,” said Stimac. The progress, Stimac said, is not just on the field. Off the field, players know what to eat, how much to eat and when to go to sleep, besides having access to analysis of not just opposing teams but individual players too. Stimac said players’ fitness improved as well with fat percentage reducing from an unacceptable 12 per cent in 2019 to 7.9 percent now. Tests conducted on players showed Indian footballers – compared to their counterparts in Europe – had seven to nine kgs lower muscle mass. “When I took over, the fat percentage was 12, which was unacceptable. Now all of them are around 7.5%. That is exceptional. But they do not have enough games in a calendar. Playing four months, we cannot go forward as a country. “A season of eight months gives us more competition. To do anything better you need to work more. You need to have more high-quality games,” said Stimac.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/players-have-improved-in-last-two-years-sandesh-is-among-best-in-asia-igor-stimac/articleshow/83652886.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

After failing to break into the senior FC Goa squad, Aaren will continue his development at Hyderabad FC, a club that has provided a fine platform for Goan youngsters to excel. One fine example is Liston Colaco, while other Goans at the club are Adil Khan, Sahil Tavora, Laxmikant Kattimani and Sweden Fernandes. The 23-year-old striker signed a three-year deal that will keep him at the club till the end of 2023-24 season, the club announced on Friday. Hailing from a sporting family, Aaren has been involved in professional football since a young age. He spent over four years learning his trade at the Sesa Football Academy. The youngster also featured for Dempo SC in the U-19 I-League and Santa Cruz Club of Cavelossim in 2016-17 season of the Goa Pro League. Aaren joined FC Goa in 2017 and spent three seasons at the club. “I am excited to be a part of Hyderabad FC. I have already spoken to the coaches and that makes me even more excited. I want to be a part of the squad, and work hard to make a name for myself,” said Aaren. Aaren scored 25 times in the Goa Pro League over four seasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aaren-newest-goan-at-hyderabad-fc/articleshow/83652956.cms||---
---||Goa||Proud of our work, no coach could have done more: Igor Stimac||Panaji: Igor Stimac will soon know if he will manage the national football team again. His two-year contract as chief coach ended last month, and while the All India Football Federation’s technical committee handed him a three-month extension, his future is now up in the air. Two years should be a good time to judge a coach, but these are not normal times. Since taking over in May 2019, Stimac has been “out of work for nearly 500 days, due to the pandemic.” So how do you judge Stimac’s work, under whom India won two of the 13 games? The Fifa World Cup qualifiers should be a good yardstick. India booked their place in the third round of the Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers with one victory, four draws and three losses, two of them against higher-ranked Oman and once against Asian champions Qatar. Given India conceded late in two games after taking the lead, it could have been different while still finishing third in the group. “I can be proud of the work that we have done, to be honest,” Stimac told reporters during an online interaction on Friday. “Some of you can be critical and complain about it, but believe me, neither (Pep) Guardiola or (Jose) Mourinho and all of them together could do more in such circumstances.” Stimac took over from Stephen Constantine after India came within two minutes of making it to the knockout stage of the Asian Cup 2019. When he took over, the brief was simple. “I took this job for one simple reason; it’s probably the greatest challenge I could get in the football world. Getting into the long-term plan and executing something which is difficult to do. “I was brought to change the game India were playing from counter-attacking to a more progressive football. This meant more in control of the games, improvement in passing and accuracy. From that aspect, we can say we have succeeded in a certain way,” said Stimac, providing numbers to prove his case. The biggest improvement, though, can be seen at the back, not surprising given that Stimac himself has been a defender who won bronze with Croatia at the 1998 World Cup in France. India conceded seven goals in eight games, playing Asian champions Qatar twice, both away. “From the minus 13 goal difference and 18 goals conceded (under Constantine), we conceded seven and just once against Qatar after 180 minutes. Teams have found it difficult to score against us. The defensive work was done perfectly,” said Stimac. In the middle-third, Stimac said he introduced technically-gifted players like Brandon Fernandes, Sahal Abdul Samad, Liston Colaco, Yasir Mohammed and Lallianzuala Chhangte. “When you look carefully, they have their limits, never mind how much we like them,” said Stimac. The Croatian coach pointed at other limitations. Besides Sunil Chhetri, India do not have anyone who can score, a problem unlikely to be solved soon with foreigners hogging that space in the Indian Super League (ISL). The players also find it difficult to make the transition from ISL to international football, rubbing shoulders with the best on the continent. Stimac said there are also not enough games in a calendar, while if players have good passing range, then they do not have muscle strength or lack speed. The coach will now present a report to the AIFF technical committee and wait for their decision. “We have good platform for the future,” said Stimac. “It’s for the technical committee members, AIFF and president (Praful Patel) to decide. If they say they are not happy with what we have done and achieved in the last two years, I need to accept that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/proud-of-our-work-no-coach-could-have-done-more-igor-stimac/articleshow/83653405.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||India||Gear up to combat mutating virus: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: PM Modi Friday amplified concerns over the need to be prepared to combat new challenges posed by the rapidly mutating coronavirus amid reports that a third wave could not be ruled out. “Covid-19 is still there and there’s a strong possibility of the virus mutating. Therefore, India’s preparations have to be ramped up in order to combat new challenges. We are working towards preparing 1 lakh frontline workers,” the PM said while underlining the lessons learnt from the two waves. He was speaking at the launch of a crash course for frontline workers where he reiterated the Centre’s commitment to vaccinate all citizens. Speaking on the key role of skilled healthcare workers like Asha, Anganwadi and ANM in fighting the pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said they were crucial to preventing the spread of infection in villages in remote areas and a strong pillar of the health sector. He said the crash course for Covid-19 frontline workers would be completed in two to three months and it would be immediately available and act as a “trained sahayak” to assist in the present arrangements and reduce the burden on medical staff. “The crash course has been designed by the country’s top experts upon the requirement of states,” the Prime Minister said. Modi said while the pandemic tested the strength of the country, it also created awareness on expanding capabilities. He cited the increased capacity for PPE kits, testing and other medical infrastructure related to Covid care and treatment. He said far-flung hospitals were being provided with ventilators and oxygen concentrators. More than 1,500 oxygen plants were being established on a war footing, the Prime Minister further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gear-up-to-combat-mutating-virus-pm/articleshow/83653124.cms||---
---||World||Western heat wave threatens health in vulnerable communities||PHOENIX: Extreme temperatures like the ones blistering the American West this week aren't just annoying, they're deadly.  The record-breaking temperatures this week are a weather emergency, scientists and health care experts say, with heat responsible for more deaths in the U.S. than all other natural disasters combined. With more frequent and intense heat waves likely because of climate change and the worst drought in modern history, they say communities must better protect the vulnerable, like homeless people and those who live in ethnically and racially diverse low-income neighborhoods.  "This heat has an important effect on people and their health," said Dr. Suganya Karuppana, chief medical director at the Valle del Sol community health clinics in Arizona.  People - along with plants and animals - need cooler temperatures at night to recover from the stress of high heat, scientists and doctors said. But with overnight temperatures in the 90s, that's not happening.  Karuppana noted that many people she sees may have no car and have to take public transportation in the Phoenix heat, walking through neighborhoods with few trees and waiting at bus and light rail stops with no or little shade. Some people live in poorly ventilated mobile homes or without air conditioning. Or they may work outside in the sun as construction workers or landscapers.  Phoenix has been baking in temperatures above 115 degrees (46 Celsius) all week. The high Friday was expected to reach 117 degrees (47 Celsius) after hitting a record 118 (48 Celsius) a day earlier. Daily records were set this week in Arizona, Nevada and California, including 128 degrees (53 Celsius) in Death Valley on Thursday.  Those who are vulnerable to high temperatures include the very young, the very old and people with heart or kidney disease, ailments that disproportionately affect communities of color.  "We are activated for Phoenix and monitoring it closely," said Nicolette Louissaint, executive director of the Washington nonprofit Healthcare Ready, which was founded after Hurricane Katrina to help communities deal with natural disasters.  Louissaint said her organization has helped in heat emergencies by funding cooling centers that offer bottled water and shade or arrange transportation for older people without cars who need dialysis or heart checkups.  "Extreme heat really exacerbates those kind of serious medical conditions," she said. "It's tough on people who don't have a lot of money."  Phoenix and other local governments around the Southwest remind people on social media to drink lots of water, stay out of the sun if possible and take frequent breaks on hot days. They warn people to not leave children or pets in vehicles, and they work with nonprofits like the Salvation Army to open facilities that allow people to cool off.  The rising risks of the heat became painfully clear three years ago when 72-year-old Stephanie Pullman died at her Phoenix-area home after Arizona's largest electric utility turned off her service for failure to pay $51. A coroner listed "environmental heat exposure" as one of the causes of her 2018 death.  It led to a series of moratoriums on overdue electrical bills in Arizona that continued through the end of last year amid the coronavirus pandemic. The utility, Arizona Public Service, says it has suspended service disconnections and waived late fees through Oct. 15.  The county that includes Phoenix has reported three heat-related deaths as of Saturday, with an additional 20 fatalities being investigated as possibly caused by high temperatures.  Heat-related deaths in Maricopa County have been rising dramatically in recent years, with 323 reported last year, the highest ever recorded. The highest rates were reported among Black people and Native Americans. About 80% of those who died were men.  People living on the street are especially at risk. The Maricopa County medical examiner has said heat was a primary or secondary cause in the death of 146 homeless people last year, when the summer was the hottest ever recorded in Phoenix.  Scientists say the number of heat deaths in the U.S. West and the world over were only expected to rise.  As average temperatures rise worldwide, heat is becoming more extreme, said Gerald Meehl, senior scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.  "As the average climate warms up from increasing human-produced greenhouse gases, we are seeing more intense, more frequent and longer lasting heat waves," Meehl said.  A study last month estimated the number of heat deaths each year that can be attributed to human-caused global warming. It included about 200 U.S. cities and found more than 1,100 deaths a year from climate change-caused heat, many of them in the East and Midwest, where many people don't have air conditioning or are not acclimated to hot weather.  Joellen Russell, climate science professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said the Southwest is an early example of what will hit the rest of the nation later when it comes to the dangers of heat extremes caused by global warming.  "I think we'd better hurry up," she said. "Our kids are counting on us."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/western-heat-wave-threatens-health-in-vulnerable-communities/articleshow/83653672.cms||---
---||Kolkata||National and international artistes come together to celebrate 100 years of Visva-Bharati||It was a Herculean task to make a documentation on an institution that has crossed a 100-year mark during the ongoing pandemic. But that didn't deter interdisciplinary artiste Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee and the members of his arts collective to come forward and host a digital show, Shikkhateertho, to celebrate 100 years of Visva-Bharati. Assisted by Subhasree Patel, designed by Uttaran De and scripted by Ketaki Mukherjee, Shikkhateertho, began with an address by the legendary Sharmila Raypommot about the ethos and foundation of the university. While Priyam Mukhopadhyay read out from Rabindranath Tagore's speech delivered on the historic day of 8th of Poush (according to Bangla calendar), scholar Goutam Bhattacharya and veteran Tagore exponent Dr Pabitra Sarkar shared earlier accounts of the setting up of Visva-Bharati. Singer Pramita Mallick spoke aptly about the significance of the seasonal festivals begun by Tagore, thus manifesting the concern and love for nature and environment. Distinguished alumni such as Chandrodoy Ghosh, Setsu Towaga (Hiroshima), Diyali Lahiri and many others recounted how the liberated global education left a lasting impression on their minds. International scholars like Martin Kaempchen, Basabi Fraser spoke about how Visva-Bharati collaborated with the best of the minds around the world while Hispanic scholar Malabika Bhattacharya reminisced about her husband Dr Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, a highly revered vice-chancellor of Visva-Bharati in the ’90s. The documentation also featured songs by Sasha Ghoshal, Srikanto Acharya, Ritapa Bhattacharya, Liasa Ahmad Lisa (from Bangladesh), Manoj Murali Nair and an evocative recitation by the Bratati Bandyopadhyay. One of the highlights of the digital show was Supriyo Tagore’s speech in which he expressed his deep concern about the evolution of the education system in Visva-Bharati. "This project is my homage to a simple, value-based education system that transformed lives, built personas and inculcated a global outlook – the true essence of universalism", said Sujoy, the creative director of the digital event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/national-and-international-artistes-come-together-to-celebrate-100-years-of-visva-bharati/articleshow/83654074.cms||Srishti Dasgupta
---||World||Declaration of Juneteenth holiday sparks scramble in states||COLUMBUS: Congress and President Joe Biden acted with unusual swiftness this week in approving Juneteenth as a national holiday, a move that sent many states scrambling to clarify their policies on the observance with less than a business day's notice.  Nearly all states recognize Juneteenth in some fashion, at least on paper. But most have been slow to move beyond proclamations issued by governors or resolutions passed by lawmakers. At least seven states have designated it in law as an official paid state holiday - Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Texas, Virginia and Washington.  This year alone, legislation to formally recognize Juneteenth died in Florida and South Dakota and is stalled in Ohio, all states controlled by Republicans. But even in Maryland, where Democrats control the Legislature, a Juneteenth bill passed one chamber only to die in the other.  The effort recalls the drawn-out battles over recognizing Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the last time the federal government designated a new holiday. That legislation, finally passed in 1983, scheduled the holiday to begin three years later. It set off bitter debates in the states over whether to enact their own holidays.  Only a handful of states headed into Thursday's signing of the federal Juneteenth law with the paid holiday on the books to be celebrated in 2021. The governors of Washington, Illinois and Louisiana, by contrast, all signed more recent laws that were set to kick in for 2022, adding to the muddled rollout.  Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, announced that state offices would be closed for a half-day on Friday, only a few days after he signed Juneteenth legislation. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker closed government offices in his state as well, though the new holiday would not have been observed until 2023, since June 19 falls on a Sunday in 2022.  In another twist, many states have laws with provisions that automatically recognize all federal holidays - even those not named in state statute.  Such was the case in Ohio, where Republican Gov. Mike DeWine issued his Juneteenth statement on Thursday evening. In the manner of a hastily called school snow day, he noted the state's automatic observance of all federal holidays and declared that most government offices would be closed Friday.  State Sen. Hearcel Craig, a Columbus Democrat who is Black, is sponsoring the bill making Juneteenth a paid state holiday in Ohio.  He said Friday that it remains essential that lawmakers pass the legislation even after the federal holiday was declared. His bill cleared the Ohio Senate unanimously last session, but time ran out for its consideration in the House.  "This is the party of Lincoln," he said of Republicans who control both Ohio's legislative chamber. "My hope and expectation is that Ohio will choose to be a leader in the quest to honor Black history and the movement toward a more equitable world. And that's not hyperbole. Ohio can and should be a leader with regard to this issue. It concerns not only African-Americans but all Americans. Put simply, Black history is American history."  West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice held a last-minute virtual press conference after Biden's bill-signing Thursday to declare Juneteenth an official state holiday. New Jersey passed a Juneteenth holiday in September.  Minnesota has recognized the third Saturday in June as Juneteenth since 1996, but the statute only obligates the governor to issue a proclamation each year honoring the observance. That's a common situation in the US.  Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has called for making it an official state holiday. The idea has not gotten traction so far in the Minnesota Legislature, the only one in the nation where Democrats control one chamber and Republicans control the other.  Members of its People of Color and Indigenous Caucus are now drafting legislation patterned on the new federal law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/declaration-of-juneteenth-holiday-sparks-scramble-in-states/articleshow/83654532.cms||---

Members of the committee, led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, pinned down Twitter India officials on what they felt were diversionary answers to questions about whether the US company respected Indian laws and the decision-making powers of the India office. The discussion in the committee came in the wake of Twitter delaying appointing officials to address grievances under new rules issued by the government and a row over its decision to flag certain BJP handles as "manipulated media" for tweeting about Congress's alleged "toolkit" to defame the government. BJP's Nishikant Dubey asked why Twitter failed to tag as "manipulated media" the recent video of a Ghaziabad man alleging assault, despite a clarification from UP police that the victim had made false claims. It was pointed out that the alacrity with which Twitter tagged BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya’s tweets as “manipulated media” suggested that the platform was playing the role of an “editor, not an intermediary”. Other MPs who participated in the discussions included Trinamool’s Mohua Moitra and BJP's Rajyavardhan Rathore. Twitter’s “vague” responses led members to allege disrespect to the House panel. Asked specifically whether it respected Indian laws, Twitter India’s public policy manager Shagufta Kamran and legal counsel Ayushi Kapoor said they respected Indian laws and Twitter policies equally. In a statement after the discussion, a Twitter spokesperson said, “We appreciate the opportunity to share our views before the standing committee on information technology. Twitter stands prepared to work with the committee on the important work of safeguarding citizens’ rights online in line with our principles of transparency, freedom of expression and privacy. We will also continue working alongside the Indian government as part of our shared commitment to serve and protect the public conversation.” The explanation offered by Twitter India officials, sources said, attributing delays in appointing officials to the coronavirus pandemic, failed to impress MPs as there was no timeline indicated as to when the company would comply with the recently notified Digital Media Rules, 2021. With no clear responses forthcoming, the House panel asked Twitter representatives to submit written responses in 15 days on compliance and on what sort of authority the India chapter wielded. The query reflects concerns that Twitter India often claims that important decisions are taken in the US and that technical matters also reside in servers located in America. “When tweets were labelled as manipulated media before investigating agencies completed their investigation, Twitter passed a judgment and acted as an editor. If the platform claims to be an intermediary, it cannot do this,” a member told the panel. The panel also asked Twitter why it should not be fined since it was found to be “violating” rules of the country, and especially because it was unable to declare a timeline by which it would ensure compliance to the Digital Media Rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mps-question-twitter-on-its-organisational-structure-accountability/articleshow/83654780.cms||Swati Mathur
---||World||Georgia officials seek to remove 102,000 voters from rolls||ATLANTA: Georgia's secretary of state is making public a list of nearly 102,000 voters who will be removed from the rolls unless they act to preserve their registration.  Republican Brad Raffensperger announced the list Friday, part of an every-other-year bid to remove voters who may have died or moved away. The state has about 7.8 million voters and his office said the removals include about 67,000 voters who submitted a change of address form to the US Postal Service, and about 34,000 voters who had election mail returned.  Voter purges in Georgia became a hot-button issue during the 2018 governor's race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp. Secretary of state before being elected governor, Kemp oversaw aggressive voter purges during his tenure. More than 1.4 million voter registrations were cancelled in Georgia between 2012 and 2018.  In the current purge, election officials said, cancellation notices will be mailed and those who respond within 40 days will have their registration switched back to active. Anyone who is removed could register again.  On a monthly basis, the secretary of state been removing voters who were convicted of felonies or who died.  Raffensperger said more than 18,000 voters were removed last month after Georgia concluded they had died based on information from Georgia's own death registry or from the Electronic Registration Information Center, a partnership among 30 states and the District of Columbia. Officials said they have no record that any of those 18,000-plus cast ballots in the November 2020 general election or the January runoff.  The removals are much smaller than the more than 300,000 voters that Raffensperger sought to remove from Georgia's registration lists in 2019. That year, Fair Fight Action, a voting rights group founded by Abrams, sued to stop a portion of the removals.  During the lawsuit, Raffensperger agreed to keep 22,000 voters on the rolls after finding it was moving too soon to cancel their registrations. A federal judge, though ruled against Fair Fight Action's argument that Georgia should have to keep another 98,000 voters registered.  In 2019, Georgia purged 287,000 voters, while nearly 5,000 either voted or got in touch to keep their registration from being cancelled.  Georgia law says voters should be moved to inactive status if they have no contact with the state for a period of time. The General Assembly voted in 2019 to lengthen the no-contact period to five years. Inactive registrations are later removed if voters miss the next two general elections, giving them a total of nine years.  Only 276 voters will be removed under those "use it or lose it" provisions this year.  "Making sure Georgia's voter rolls are up to date is key to ensuring the integrity of our elections," Raffensperger said in a statement Friday. "That is why I fought and beat Stacey Abrams in court in 2019 to remove nearly 300,000 obsolete voter files before the November election, and will do so again this year. Bottom line, there is no legitimate reason to keep ineligible voters on the rolls."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/georgia-officials-seek-to-remove-102000-voters-from-rolls/articleshow/83654819.cms||---

In the last seven days ending Thursday, Brazil registered 4,88,882, narrowly inching ahead of India's count of 4,88,626, as per data from worldometers.info. This was the first time since late March that the seven-day average of daily Covid cases in India has been overtaken by another country. Brazil has been in the midst of a long Covid outbreak with daily cases staying mainly between 60,000 and 90,000 since the beginning of March. India, on the other hand, saw cases spiral sharply from the beginning of March, touch a peak on May 8 and then fall just as steeply since then. The US, the only country apart from India where daily Covid cases have crossed 1 lakh, witnessed a peak in infections around the second week of January. Cases in that country have been steadily dropping since then except for a brief rise around mid-April. In India, the seven-day average of daily cases dropped to 66,660 on Friday, nearly one-sixth of the peak of 3,91,263 recorded on May 8. The seven-day average of daily deaths (not counting old deaths being reported now mainly by Maharashtra) had dipped to 1,399, down to a nearly third of the peak of 4,040 on May 16. On Friday, the country recorded 60,959 fresh cases and 1,200 deaths. In addition, 450 "backlog" deaths were reported by Maharashtra. The state recorded 198 fatalities in the last 24 hours, second highest in the country after 287 reported from Tamil Nadu. Karnataka was the only other state to report a daily toll of more than 100, with 168 deaths on Friday. For the second day running, Kerala was the only state to post over 10,000 fresh cases. Kerala recorded 11,361 new infections of the virus, while the count in Maharashtra was 9,798 and in Tamil Nadu 8,633.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-india-now-2nd-in-daily-cases-after-leading-for-2-5-months/articleshow/83654890.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

A five-judge bench, led by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal, put it on record that the state, from the very beginning, had been denying everything, adding, "But the facts placed on record by the member secretary of the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority on June 3, are different." "In a case where the allegation is life and property in danger on account of post-poll violence, the state can't be allowed to proceed in the manner it likes," the court observed, taking nature of the complaints. "It is the duty of the state to inspire confidence among residents." The bench also directed the state government to provide logistics support to the NHRC committee and issued a stern warning: any obstructions might entail action under contempt of court, among other provisions. "The state shall ensure that there is no obstruction of any kind in this process," the court held. The court also took exception to the procedure members of the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority (WBSLSA) followed to address the complaints. The bench, referring to the video conference the members held with the alleged victims, observed: "In our view that was not the idea. It was not a normal meeting. Rather, the officers were to see the ground realities and report to the court." The bench said it wanted one representative each from the West Bengal State Human Rights Commission and the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority in the NHRC committee. The next date of hearing has been fixed on June 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/post-poll-violence-hc-critical-of-bengal-seeks-nhrc-panel/articleshow/83655028.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||India||NE Delhi riots: HC’s bail order ‘surprising,' cannot be cited as precedent, SC says||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday pointed out serious issues with the Delhi high court judgment granting bail to activists Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha in the northeast Delhi riots cases, and ordered that it could not be cited as precedent by other accused to seek bail even as Delhi Police said they were not seeking to put the three back in jail. A bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramaniam said it was surprised by the unprecedented, over 100-page judgment rendered by the HC in a case where the only issue at stake was bail sought by the accused. "What is troubling us is that in a bail petition, the HC authors a 100-page judgment, and that too discussing all laws. This is something very, very surprising. What we can say is since bail has been granted, those who got the relief will not be affected. But, otherwise, we will stay the effect of this order." The court's task was made easier by solicitor general Tushar Mehta who said Delhi Police was not seeking to put the three accused back in jail. However, he pressed on for a stay by raising several questions which hit at the basis of the HC judgment and the logic employed for granting bail. The SC emphasised the HC, while hearing a bail plea, went on to dwell on the constitutionality of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the key anti-terror law. The SC bench said, "We agree with you. There are many questions which arise. Because the legality or constitutionality of UAPA was not challenged before the HC. Therefore, all these important questions raised by Delhi Police will have to be considered. We understand that and the way the UAPA has been interpreted will probably require examination by the Supreme Court. That is why we are issuing notices." It asked Narwal, Kalita and Tanha to respond to Delhi Police's appeals within four weeks and ordered that the lengthy Delhi HC judgment would be of no value to other accused in Delhi riots cases as it could not be cited for seeking bail in any court. Mehta said the HC judgment should be stayed as it was laced with unwarranted observations and incorrect interpretation to lay the foundations of a dangerous situation in which terror and disruptive activities would have to be dealt with by the Indian Penal Code rather than the specialised anti-terror law UAPA. Significantly, even counsel for the accused, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, agreed that the HC's remarks about UAPA could have pan-India repercussions. "I entirely agree with Supreme Court that it should consider the ramifications and interpretations of UAPA. There is no doubt about that. We should have a judgment from this court. It will otherwise impact everybody. The HC judgment should not be stayed. What we are dealing with is the bail application," he said. Mehta said if the HC judgment was to be implemented, then no terrorist could be booked under UAPA as he could be booked for offences prescribed under IPC. He said even the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case accused could have been booked under IPC charges and not under TADA. "As many as 53 people, including police personnel, were killed. More than 700 people were injured in the north-east Delhi riots. But the HC says since the riots were eventually controlled, the accused cannot be charged under UAPA. This means, if someone plants a bomb somewhere, but it gets defused by the bomb disposal squad, then UAPA cannot be slapped against the person who planted the bomb. This also means, if a terrorist kills a person, then since he could be booked under Section 302 IPC, UAPA could not be slapped on the terrorist," the SG argued. The SG pressed on for stay of the judgment and said, "Right to protest does not include the right to indulge in terrorist activities and killing people. So many people died in Delhi riots. And the HC in its wide-ranging unwarranted observations says the state blurred the line between right to protest and terrorist activity? And that the state tried to suppress the right to freedom of expression? HC says the anti-CAA protests were restricted to north-east Delhi so it would not be right for police to say protests affected the community at large." Mehta added: "The HC says the protesters were under a perceived belief that CAA was against a particular community. If we go by this logic, even the woman who assassinated the former PM was protesting only because her view was that something was going against a particular community. So she could not have been charged under the anti-terror law."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ne-delhi-riots-case-hcs-bail-order-surprising-cannot-be-cited-as-precedent-sc-says/articleshow/83655132.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The potential of managing pollutants in STP can be obtained if the STP is located on the convex bank — the sand-bed side of the Ganga. This is the only way to use the STP to manage the river pollution,” wrote Prof Choudhary while referring to the appearance of algal bloom in the Ganga stream in Varanasi due to malfunctioning of STP at Vindhyachal in Mirzapur district. “The Vindhyachal STP cannot only be claimed to have discoloured the huge quantum of the Ganga water for such a long period in several kilometres of length. The satellite imagery depicts the dark colour of the river water along the Assi Ghat region of Varanasi,” he wrote adding, “This is caused due to discharge of pollutants from various STPs located along the bank of the river in Varanasi.” “It is thus proved that the STP is capable of managing the organic load of the pollutant only. The river can manage this in a small stretch with the help of enlargement of the microbiological load of several thousand times. Thus, the insufficient potential of STP and its wrong location are causing Ganga pollution. The STP capabilities can only be used if it is rightly located,” he added. He said that presently the STPs are located on the city side bank (concave side) of the Ganga, where the flow dynamics is not capable of dissolving, digesting and absorbing the pollutants. “These potentials of managing the pollutants in STP can be obtained if the STP is located on the convex bank (sand-bed side) of the Ganga, which is existing on all the three sides of the city,” he explained. Prof Choudhary also attached a booklet — ‘The Five Theories of River Management’ — authored by him with the letter, claiming that methodology of pollution management is discussed in the booklet. After retiring from BHU, Prof Choudhary is presently the founder director of the Mahamana Malviya Institute of Technology for Ganga Management, Varanasi. The algal bloom first appeared in the Ganga in Varanasi around a month back. It was initially examined by the officials of the regional office of the UP-Pollution Control Board. Later, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma constituted a five-member team to look into the matter and submit a detailed report. The team submitted its report after an extensive survey conducted for three days from Varanasi to Mirzapur. According to the investigation report, the 4-MLD capacity STP at Vindhyachal is based on a conventional system. It seemed that the algal bloom originated from the STP at Vindhyachal. After receiving this report, the district administration sent a request to the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) seeking a solution of the algal bloom. Taking note of it, the NMCG sent a consignment of a German chemical for treating the Ganga water in Varanasi. The DM said that a drive of water cleaning with the German chemical was launched in this regard at many ghats on June 13. Earlier, Prof Choudhary had also written a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath fearing an impending threat to the Ganga in Varanasi due to the construction of a spur (wall) and a canal in the river. He had posed a series of questions regarding the design of the project seeking answers from the authorities concerned. However, irrigation department executive engineer Pankaj Verma clarified that this multi-purpose project will reduce the velocity of the river water to avoid pressure on the ghats due to which the threat of erosion under their steps and historical buildings was increasing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/noted-river-engineer-raises-issue-of-ganga-pollution-with-pm-in-a-letter/articleshow/83647689.cms||---

Their contracts were terminated following detection of irregularities in recruitment. They were demanding withdrawal of the termination order. Authoritative sources said the contract of the daily wagers was terminated from the date of appointment on the recommendation of a three-member inquiry team headed by Muzaffarpur DDC. They were appointed for a period of three months on the directive of the health directorate. Muzaffarpur DM Pranav Kumar had ordered a probe after receipt of complaints related to irregularities in the appointment of paramedical staff on daily wages for vaccination purposes. An audio of an aspirant claiming that money changed hands in the appointment also went viral on social media. Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Dr S K Choudhary said the doctors and paramedical staff appointed on daily wages for vaccination in the district have now been allowed to render their services till July 26. “They assumed duty after the earlier order regarding termination of their services from the date of appointment was withdrawn,” he said, adding that vaccination as well as testing of Covid in the district have been restored. They had staged a dharna outside the Sadar hospital, throwing the traffic on the busy hospital road, close to Muzaffarpur railway junction, out of gear and causing heavy traffic congestion in the town. The situation deteriorated when the police intervened and tried to remove the protesters by using force. They were pelted with stones causing injuries to some woman police personnel. The police later resorted to baton charge to bring the situation under control. The probe team detected lack of transparency in the recruitment process. The other criteria such as experience and skill were also ignored. On Wednesday the probe team submitted its report to DM Pranav Kumar who, in turn, directed the civil surgeon to terminate the contract of services of those from the date of appointment. The civil surgeon complied with the DM's order. As soon as the news about termination of contract spread, a number of paramedical staff assembled at Sadar hospital and launched agitation. They were deputed at the Sadar hospital and different primary health centres in the district. The civil surgeon said that the health department is likely to advertise appointment of doctors and paramedical staff soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/780-daily-wage-muz-docs-med-staff-call-of-stir/articleshow/83644689.cms||Ramashankar

Speaking as the chief guest on the occasion of Singh’s birth anniversary and the foundation day celebrations of local A N College through digital mode, the governor said all efforts are being made to provide quality education to the students. The state government has already initiated steps to improve the infrastructure in educational institutions and expedite appointment of teachers against the vacant posts, he said. Chauhan recalled Singh’s valuable contributions in the freedom struggle and post-independence development of the state and called upon the students to imbibe his ideals and good practices in their lives. Patliputra University vice-chancellor Surendra Pratap Singh appealed to the younger generation to follow the path shown by Anugrah babu. He said A N College, which has been awarded ‘A’ grade by NAAC three times consecutively and has also been awarded CPE (college with potential for excellence) status by the UGC, should now try to get autonomous status. The university would provide all support to the institution in its endeavour, he added. College principal S P Shahi welcomed the guests. Bihar State Higher Education Council’s vice-chairman Kameshwar Jha, state’s higher education director Rekha Kumari and principals of several local colleges participated in the celebrations. The annual magazine of the college, ‘Anugrah Jyoti’ was also released on the occasion. A programme was also organized at Congress’s state headquarters on the occasion. State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha said Singh was the jewel of the state and “we have a lot to learn from his contributions to our country as well as Bihar.” State Congress working presidents Kaukab Qadri and Sameer Singh, MLA Chatrpati Yadav and spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre were remembered Anugrah babu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/governor-cm-others-remember-anugrah/articleshow/83646948.cms||---

---||Kolkata||‘Anticoagulant use needs guidelines’||Kolkata: A review article on the use of anticoagulants in Covid treatment, its concepts and controversies emerging from the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital has topped the chart in the British Medical Journal (BMJ). The article by a team of four doctors has pointed to the need for a definite guideline on the timings, dosage, duration and choice of drug to be used on those infected. Anticoagulants are being used during Covid treatment to counter blood clotting as patients who suffer moderate-to-severe infections tend to develop thrombosis. The group of four doctors — Atanau Chandra, Uddalak Chakraborty, Shrestha Ghosh and Sugata Dasgupta — went through various published information on deploying anticoagulants on Covid patients before coming out with their conclusion. The team found most clinicians resorted to individual bias in treatment with anticoagulants, with decisions varying according to patients’ profiles due to conflicting guidelines. The article said venous thromboembolism (VTE) secondary to Covid has resulted in high mortality. Thromboembolism, it said, has often gone undetected following Covid. It advised anticoagulants in moderate to severe and critical cases. Enoxaparin is the preferred low-molecular weight heparin in acute phase of thromboembolism and post-discharge prophylaxis may be considered in patients at high risk of thromboembolic events after assessing the bleeding risks, it said. “There are still some grey areas in administering anticoagulants to Covid patients in terms of dosage, timing, duration and the type of patient. So we have done a systematic review after going through various trials on the use of anticoagulants across the globe. This review article is keeping in mind the need for a uniformed guideline,” said Dasgupta, professor of critical care medicine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/anticoagulant-use-needs-guidelines/articleshow/83650527.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Sasidhar said the finance department had released Rs 500 crore in the last two days and has promised to release Rs 200 crore each day starting Saturday following chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s instructions. Speaking to the media here on Friday, Sasidhar said the Centre has also promised to release the first tranche of Rs 1,200 crore by Monday which would provide the state big relief. “The delay in release of the paddy procurement advance by the Centre during the current fiscal has strained the payments to farmers to some extent. The Centre, which used to release procurement advance in April, was not able to release it till date due to Covid-19 induced troubles across the country,” said Sasidhar. He added that the Centre had positively responded after the chief minister explained the issue to Union minister Piyush Goyal during his recent visit to New Delhi, and promised to release Rs 1,200 crore by Monday. Sasidhar said the state government has already paid Rs 1,632 crore to farmers towards paddy procurement from its own pocket, without waiting for the release from the Centre. As much as 28.35 lakh metric tonnes of paddy for the current rabi season have been procured, he said, adding that the government had to pay Rs 1,619 crore to farmers as dues that had accumulated beyond 21 days. “We have received Rs 500 crore in the last two days and the chief minister directed the finance department to release Rs 200 crore each day to clear the dues. We are hopeful of clearing all dues beyond 21 days within a week,” said Sasidhar. The commissioner also appealed to farmers not to worry about the dues as arrangements for payments are underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/paddy-procurement-dues-to-be-cleared-in-a-week/articleshow/83656070.cms||Samdani MN

The accused had thrown his ailing mother from the terrace of his house located on 150-feet Ring Road in 2017. The police arrested Nathvani three months later following an anonymous note that hinted at his role in the death. Assistant public prosecutor, Prashant Patel told TOI, “Additional sessions judge PN Dave considered the FSL report, CCTV footage and statements of witnesses produced by the prosecution and convicted the accused for cold blooded murder. The court sentenced accused Sandeep Nathvani life term in jail.” Advocate Mahesh Joshi also appeared in the court on behalf of prosecution which produced 28 witnesses including doctor, police, neighbours, sister and brother-in-law of the accused. According to the case details, Jayshree died after falling from the terrace of a four-storey building in September 2017 and prima facie it was considered a case of suicide. However, cops received an anonymous note raising fingers towards her son Sandeep. Cops reopened the case and started investigation in which they found CCTV footage showing the accused dragging his mother and arrested him. It was clear from CCTV footage that the victim was unwell and not in a position to climb the 2.5 feet terrace wall herself to jump down. Jayshree, a retired government teacher residing at Jamnagar, had suffered a brain haemorrhage which had severely affected her lower body part and because of it she was practically immobile. She was operated in a private hospital of Rajkot, and was under treatment when she started living with son Sandeep in his house in Rajkot. “The accused lived with his wife and a daughter and domestic disputes were a regular phenomenon in the Nathvani household between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. To get rid of this daily dispute, the accused decided to kill his mother,” Patel added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/ex-lecturer-convicted-for-killing-ailing-mother/articleshow/83648737.cms||---

---||Business||‘It’s a bank PMC will be part of, it’s not takeover’||MUMBAI: For Jaspal Bindra, who headed Standard Chartered Bank’s Asia operations in his 40s, the road back to banking is a challenging one. Bindra, who exited StanChart to turn entrepreneur by acquiring a stake in Centrum in 2016, will have to build a bank by merging operations of a failed local cooperative, a non-banking finance company and a new age digital lender. For Bindra, who has been pursuing a bank licence for some time, the RBI’s quest for a white knight for Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC) provided that opportunity. The RBI has granted Centrum 120 days to convert itself into a bank with fintech player BharatPe as an investor who will merge its payment business with the bank. “We are seeing it as a bank which PMC will be a part of and not a takeover. We are capitalising it abundantly so that we will have room to do other things and PMC’s operations will not dominate the new bank,” said Bindra. “As against the Rs 200-crore minimum capital required for a small finance bank, we are committing to bringing in Rs 900 crore in the first year and we have further committed Rs 900 crore from both of us. In all, we are committing Rs 1,800 crore,” said Bindra. He added that currently the partners are self-sufficient for capital and funds would be raised only at a later day. Bindra agrees that PMC Bank has a large hole in its books which Centrum examined in January before making the bid. It is not yet clear to what extent the hole will get filled as the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation would pay out depositors only after the RBI invokes Section 45 of its Act which has the same effect as a bankruptcy resolution and does not leave scope for any additional payments outside the plan notified by the government. Both Centrum and Bharat Pe will have to follow RBI’s diktat and undertake all financial businesses within the new bank and not in group companies. This means that the bank will begin with Centrum’s sizeable loan book and BharatPe’s large payment business. “The PMC loan book is wholesale which is not part of our business, and this will be a runoff. This will not exist in our future as we want to be a pure digital play with over 85% of business being done on the digital platform. The offline presence will be for only those segments of society without digital access,” said Bindra. The government notification will also determine the terms for the staff of PMC Bank. “For PMC staff we will have to see what comes in the government notification. For our existing staff, we are going to choose the best person between Centrum, BharatPe and the market. We are going to plan talent for the longer term. It does not mean that there will be layoffs as there will be jobs outside the bank for Centrum and BharatPe,” said Bindra. While there is no guarantee that customers will retain their deposits once the new bank opens its doors, Bindra sees value in the retail deposit franchise. “The branch network is relevant from deposit collection point. They were quite exceptional in their service quality, and we will be happy to have the staff as a valuable addition to the group. They have Finacle which is a leading software platform,” said Bindra. Besides the amalgamation of unlikely partners, the PMC resolution is an experiment at several levels. This is the first time that the RBI is using the lure of a bank licence to refloat a failed bank. This would also be the first time that an old-world business is being moved onto a digital system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/its-a-bank-pmc-will-be-part-of-its-not-takeover/articleshow/83650211.cms||Mayur Shetty

The issue will also have a secondary component where existing shareholders will decide on the number of shares to be tendered. Announcing an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on July 12 for approving the IPO, the company has sought shareholders’ approval on a resolution that seeks to declassify founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma as a promoter as it is a professionally managed company. The EGM notice has been sent to employees of the organisation who are also shareholders. This is the first time that Paytm has confirmed the size of its primary fundraise. The company had earlier written to employees seeking their interest to participate by offering their shares as part of the ‘offer for sale’ (OFS) component in the IPO. The EGM notice contains several other resolutions pertaining to the listing, additions to articles of association and an amendment to the Employee Stock Option Scheme. It said that the board had in its meeting held on June 14, 2021 approved the IPO, subject to the approval of the members of the company. It also said that no change in control of the company or its management is intended or expected pursuant to the offer. The equity shares are proposed to be listed on the BSE, the NSE and any other stock exchange as determined by the board. The company has decided to hold an offline EGM, which will take place at Mayur Vihar in New Delhi where most of its shareholders are based. Last week, One97 Communications finalised the bankers for its proposed IPO. The company is understood to have taken on board JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, ICICI Securities and Goldman Sachs to lead the issue, which is likely to be the largest IPO in the financial sector. With the investment bankers in place, the draft red herring prospectus is set to be filed in July 2021. According to a Bloomberg report, Paytm is aiming at a valuation of $25-30 billion (Rs 1.8-2.2 lakh crore). There have been other reports estimating the value at around $20 billion (Rs 1.5 lakh crore) as against the earlier one of $15 billion (Rs 1.1 lakh crore) during a fundraise in 2019. Among non-banks, Bajaj Finserv has a valuation of over Rs 1.9 lakh crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-to-raise-rs-12000cr-via-new-shares-under-ipo-plan/articleshow/83650354.cms||Mayur Shetty

The average number of Covid death claims in FY22 so far have gone up by 1.5x-2x, as compared to entire FY21, according to analysts. Kotak Life has informed its parent bank that it has made a higher provisioning due to increased claims and more mortality-related provisioning for deaths during the second wave. It expects to incur a loss in the range of Rs 225-Rs 275 crore on the shareholder’s account. These are losses net of reinsurance. Coronavirus: Live updatesCanara HSBC OBC Life Insurance says it may have to allocate a significantly higher provisioning — which could be more than double — than last year. It is a joint venture of Canara Bank, HSBC Insurance Holdings and Punjab National Bank. Its MD & CEO Anuj Mathur said, “We have seen a 5-6x surge in claims in the last two months of April and May, and the trend continues in June as well. Death due to Covid claims may not be significant this year. However, claims of post-Covid deaths due to long-term effects like heart attack are on the rise.” Its average claims size remains unchanged at Rs 10 lakh. Motilal Oswal Financial Services VP (research-banking sector, institutional equities) Nitin Aggarwal said, “Many insurers have already made provisions in FY21, while others like Kotak Life are frontloading the provisions in the first quarter of FY22.” He added Max Life has made the highest provisions of about Rs 500 crore, it reported Q4 business figures later than others and had the time to make these provisions. Max Life Insurance has paid 19,922 death claims worth Rs 886 crore during FY21, making it the company’s all-time high individual death claims paid ratio at 99.4% in FY21, as compared to 99.2% in FY20 and 98.7% in FY19. ICICI Pru Life has made an additional provision of Rs 333 crore towards Covid, which is not utilised so far. It has settled total Covid claims of Rs 459 crore for FY21. HDFC Life has provided about Rs 165 crore towards its Covid reserve for FY22. In its investors’ presentation, it said the provision was made based on its actual experience in FY21 and after factoring in aspects such as latest mortality trends across business and customer segments and geographic spread of Covid 2.0. And it will continue to review the adequacy of this reserve through the course of FY22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/life-insurers-fear-q1-loss-due-to-covid-up-provisions/articleshow/83648965.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Patna||Patna HC pulls up state govt over foot-dragging, asks it to update Covid deaths daily||PATNA: The Patna high court on Friday pulled up Bihar government for its reluctance to reveal the number of Covid deaths in the state during the last one year. In a detailed judgment, the division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar ordered the state government to upload the number of deaths and births daily to its portals under the central government’s flagship programme ‘Digital India’ and National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP), 2012. The high court observed that the need arose for such step as it found that deaths reported by Bihar government in the second wave of Covid-19 didn’t appear to be correct, which was confirmed in the chief secretary’s affidavit mentioning 9,375 deaths taking place in the state on June 8 and not 5424 as reported till a day before. The court directed the state government for making digital portals accessible to general public with regular and timely updates with private information of the deceased protected under the Right to Privacy. It also observed that the government is under obligation to provide information about the number of deaths, due to whatever reasons, on its digital platform with direction to update the figures regularly as per law. The bench quoted the Supreme Court’s observation in 1975 that covering the common routine business under the veil of secrecy is not in public interest and such secrecy can be seldom legitimately desired. The bench questioned as to why is the government reluctant when there is mandate of publishing statistical report as per Bihar Registration of Births and Deaths Rules, 1999 and why it cannot do so in a digital form. It observed that the state government objection of public representatives not being responsible or accountable for providing information to be uploaded to the digital portal and that there is no mandate of law to disclose information of the number of deaths on the digital portal is legally unsustainable as per the 1999 rules. It also observed that no annual report has been uploaded since 2018. The court also ordered that the elected representatives are under obligation to disclose the number of deaths in their constituencies within 24 hours. It also directed the government to sensitize public, especially in rural areas, of constitutional and statutory right of uploading and obtaining information and convening forthwith meeting for compliance of all orders. Observing that no state government portal is updated regularly for figures, the high court reminded the government that India is a signatory to international treaties and under obligation to respect international law and treaties. The court said WHO has repeatedly emphasised on maintaining accurate data from credible sources to design effective countermeasures for the pandemic. “The provision of the RTI Act casts duty upon all public authorities to suo motu provide and disseminate information unless it is protected by law,” it observed. “Data collection process for births and deaths is an important exercise, more so during the pandemic for the relief to be given to the bereaved families. Also, in maintaining the correct statistics we as a nation can be prepared for the third wave of the pandemic. For lack of knowledge, resources and information, some families have not reported Covid deaths,” the bench mentioned in its judgment. “We find that the systematic neglect of civil registration and vital statistics has been identified as ‘the single most critical failure of development over the past 30 years’. It has become increasingly clear that we cannot monitor progress towards our sustainable development goals or national development policies without reliable vital statistics,” it observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-pulls-up-govt-over-foot-dragging-asks-it-to-update-covid-deaths-daily/articleshow/83646669.cms||Debashish Karmakar

While allowing the petitioner, Pranvesh, to withdraw the PIL and file a fresh one, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Yadav and Justice Prakash Padia observed, “Having gone through the entire petition, we are of the view that the petitioner has not done much research work in respect of rites and customs which are prevalent among various communities living along the bank of river Ganga.” “Therefore, we are not inclined at this stage to cause any indulgence instead to allow the petitioner to withdraw the petition with a liberty to file fresh petition after inquiry and research in respect of the practice of last rites in various communities which are residing along the bank of Ganga," the bench said, adding "with a liberty above, the petition stands disposed of as withdrawn.” The petitioner’s plea was that during the second wave of Covid-19, there were many who succumbed to the disease but were not cremated properly. He also pleaded before the court to pass order to prevent/stop burial of dead bodies near the river. The court refused to pass ‘any order at this stage’. There was much uproar at the peak of Covid infection in April and May this year when bodies were found buried along the rivers and it was alleged that kin of deceased persons couldn't afford the cost of cremation and hence went for the burial. The state government, however, clarified that it was the tradition among many communities living along the Ganga to bury their dead on the banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-refuses-to-entertain-pilon-bodies-buried-near-ganga/articleshow/83647525.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

---||Mumbai||CoWin allows merging of 2 first dose certificates for final one||The Centre on Friday introduced a new feature to merge two first dose certificates on CoWin to get a final vaccination certificate, offering relief to scores of beneficiaries who obtained the two doses using different cellphone numbers. TOI in its issue dated June 16 had highlighted over a lakh duplicate CoWin entries in Maharashtra alone of beneficiaries, especially among healthcare and frontline workers, who had got the two doses of the vaccines but were still showing due for the second dose. R S Sharma, chairman of the Empowered Group on Covid Vaccine Administration, told TOI that CoWin now enables merging of two first dose certificates based on ID credentials in case a person has got the two doses after registering with different phone numbers. “CoWin has an easy system of entry where users have to register using their cellphone numbers. Many people, due to whatever reasons, got their first dose by registering from one cellphone number and second dose by registration from another phone number. Technically, they should have got both the doses with one account so that the system has their vaccination records,” Sharma told TOI. He said CoWin does not work on de-duplication of entries and hence would not automatically prevent new sign-ins if the same person registers using another cellphone number. “Though such users have now completed their vaccination schedule, they have two first dose certificates. We have, therefore, introduced the new option to merge certificates on CoWin to get a final vaccination certificate for such users,” he said. Users can log in to CoWin with their registered cellphone number, click on the ‘Raise an issue’ option, select ‘Merge multiple first dose provisional certificates’, and follow the listed steps to get the final vaccination certificate. However, it remains to be seen if this will help those who got vaccine certificates with errors. Mumbai resident Viraj Mehta said, “My mother (a senior citizen) got two first dose certificates and I have been running from pillar to post to resolve the issue. Second dose was scheduled through Arogya Setu app for April 15 at a paid centre and both the appointments were done using the same phone number. But the certificate issued after the second dose said “dose 1”. I have been having a lot of trouble getting a helpful response from the hospital concerned too.” Working professional Prabhakar Jagdale said: “My parents are facing an issue with getting the final certificate after the second dose. It seems like the second dose was logged as first dose in the system by mistake. Not sure if it happened due to an error at the centre in uploading information or error in CoWin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cowin-allows-merging-of-2-first-dose-certs-for-final-one/articleshow/83651486.cms||Neha Madaan

Members of IMA-Bihar paralyzed the OPDs, except cases of Covid and emergency, in all medical colleges and private nursing homes of Patna and staged demonstrations with banners and placards demanding strict action against the yoga guru. Leading the stir, national president elect of IMA Dr Sahjanand Prasad Singh said, “Hundreds of patients had to wait for hours at PMCH, NMCH, IGIMS and AIIMS due to no-OPD services. However, agitating doctors offered treatment to some emergency patients in these hospitals.” Later, addressing a dharna at the IMA building Dr Sahjanand pleaded for stern action against Ramdev for creating suspicion about the vaccination drive against Covid-19 in the minds of many people. He said Ramdev used insulting language against the doctors and even questioned the line of treatment being followed to help people in recovering from Covid infections. “It was following Ramdev's remarks that many people in Bihar villages refused to take vaccine though the state government has launched various measures to extend the immunisation cover to eligible persons in urban and rural areas,” he said. Sahjanand also urged the Prime Minister to frame a strict law with provision of 10 years of imprisonment for checking the incidents of crime and violence against doctors and damage of hospital properties in the country. “Healthcare professionals need protection for rendering their services with dedication,” he added. Acting president and secretary of state IMA Dr Ajay Kumar and Dr Sunil Kumar, respectively beside senior doctors like Manju Geeta Mishra, DK Choudhary, Captain VS Singh, Basant Singh, Bimal Karak and others participated in the dharna.

The DM wrote that Anand had not been discharging his duty properly since his posting here in April, 2020. Anand refused to comment on the issue. The DM reportedly took the action after a report on waterlogging in major localities of the town. According to sources, the DM has stated in his letter that despite his direction for resolving the impasses with the elected members of the board of the civic body, the executive officer evinced little interest in the matter, which resulted in stalling all development and civic amenities works. “After the growing resentment among the common people over waterlogging in most localities in the town due to cyclone Yas last month, I had to entrust deputy development commissioner (DDC) of Rohtas to bring the situation under control. Now, monsoon has reached and apprehensions of waterlogging are being raised because of the failure of civic body to clean the drainage,” the DM has written in the letter on Wednesday. He added: “Waterlogging can create law and order problem as well.” The DM also mentioned that he had shared the information with the state government about the poor functioning of the executive officer. Suresh Kumar, a grocery shopkeeper lamented that when the civic body failed to pump out knee-deep water from his ancestral house at Mubarakganj, his family had to shift to a rented accommodation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rohtas-dm-writes-to-govt-against-civic-body-officer/articleshow/83644892.cms||---

WRD minister Sanjay Kumar Jha told a section of media that the rainfall during the first fortnight of this month across the state has provided additional information about the likely vulnerable points on the embankments. While the state has 3,790km of embankments, the rain has shown which points need further strengthening, Jha said. The work on only those schemes stretch to June which get clearances in April, he said. “The positive aspect of the recent rainfall across the state is that the department has got sufficient information on all the vulnerable points on the embankment,” Jha said. The WRD officials said the forecast is that Nepal will receive light to moderate rainfall in the next few days, while people of north Bihar districts prone to floods have been asked to remain alert, as the rainfall will be in the range of 12.5mm to 62.5mm in the coming week. Meanwhile, the locals in West Champaran district, including CPI(ML) MLA from Sikta Birnedra Gupta, asked the administration and WRD to get the seepage and breach points on the embankments and bandh in Piprasi circle plugged to avert further floods. A breached gap on abandoned Paniyahawa-Tamakuhi road rail line has remained unplugged. Two community kitchens have opened at government primary school, Chakadahawa, under Bagaha-2 block, and at Shripatinagar village under Piparasi block for 300 flood victims.

---||Allahabad||Pratapgarh cops take U-turn, term killing of bride’s kin a celebratory firing case||PRAYAGRAJ: After a gap of three days, Pratapgarh police on Friday took a U turn and claimed that it was, in fact, celebratory firing by the bride’s real brother that killed the bride’s cousin at Saraykher Kha, Lohartara village under Raniganj police station on the night of June 15. Earlier, a day after the firing incident, the police had claimed that a jilted lover of the bride had attempted to kill the groom during the wedding, but the bullet missed the target and hit the bride’s cousin instead, who dies on the way to the hospital. The police, on Wednesday, had also claimed to have detained the prime accused, identified as Vivek Singh, in connection with the killing of the bride’s cousin Prem Singh (38). On Friday, Deputy SP (Raniganj) Dr Atul Anjan Tripathi told TOI that following the death of Prem Singh due to a gunshot injury, the father of the bride, Nigam Singh, had accused Vivek Singh and two others of killing him, and lodged an FIR under Sections 302, 34, 504 and 506 of IPC against them. However, the DSP said, after a series of investigations, it came to light that the bride’s father had concealed facts related to the incident and intentionally named three other persons in the FIR to dodge police. As per the latest investigations, said police, it was Vinay Singh, the bride’s real brother, who indulged in celebratory firing. He was firing the shots in celebration when a bullet hit Prem Singh and he died. A team of police on Friday arrested the prime accused Vinay and his accomplices, Firoz and Sanjay Singh, all residents of Saraysher Kha, Lohartara village in connection with the firing incident. Police have also seized a licensed revolver of .32 bore that was used in the firing, along with a cartridge, from their possession. DSP Tripathi, meanwhile, said that Vinay had sent his friend Firoz to the house of another friend Sanjay Singh to bring his licensed weapon for celebratory firing during the wedding on Tuesday. The incident, as per police, took place when Vinay was busy in firing the shots when one of the bullets hit his cousin Prem’s back, leaving him grievously injured. Prem died on the way to the hospital. Police said that the family members of bride had, in fact, concealed all the facts of the incident. Two hours after the incident, the family had concocted the story of the jilted lover and narrated it to the police. Earlier, the police had detained a man named Vivek Singh based on the theory of the jilted lover. The police had even claimed that Vivek confessed that he was in love with the bride, and fired a shot targeting the groom in order to stop the wedding. However, he missed the the target and the bullet hit the bride’s cousin, the police had added. After the latest investigations, Vivek was released.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/pratapgarh-cops-take-u-turn-term-killing-of-brides-kin-a-celebratory-firing-case/articleshow/83647654.cms||---
---||Business||Cipla to tap foreign companies for large-scale vax play||MUMBAI: Cipla, one of India’s top 3 drug firms, is readying a larger play in the Covid therapies space, buoyed by the growth it has witnessed in this segment. Moving beyond a wide portfolio of Covid drugs and diagnostic kits, the Mumbai-based company — with revenues of nearly Rs 20,000 crore — now plans to partner foreign companies for large-scale fill-and-finish services for coronavirus vaccines. Cipla, which witnessed robust year-on-year (YoY) growth of nearly 74% in May on the back of Covid drugs (Tocilizumab, Remdesivir & Azithromycin) has sought clarity from the government on the vaccine ecosystem, even as it weighs options. “We are open to partnerships for fill-finish, and would have the capability in terms of logistics to administer the vaccine, to sell the vaccine. It will be done through our network hospitals. We have adequate cold storage. We do fill-finish for several other products,” Cipla MD and global CEO Umang Vohra told TOI in an exclusive interview. Vohra added that the company has no immediate plans to develop a Covid jab. There has been speculation that Cipla has sought fast-track regulatory approvals to launch US firm Moderna’s vaccine to bolster the country’s vaccine supply. There are marketing, distribution and certain manufacturing tie-ups with MNCs including Roche, Gilead Sciences and Lilly for key Covid drugs (Tocilizumab, Remdesivir and Baricitinib). Additionally, the company entered the diagnostics space with Covid kits in October last year. Now it plans to deepen its Covid portfolio, which roughly contributed about 5% (full-year basis) beyond drugs and diagnostics. The fill-finish process requires a set of specialised capabilities and equipment, and typically drug companies with an injectables’ facility can handle it. It involves aseptically filling the active ingredient in any form — such as sterile liquid, powder, and suspension — into vials, ampoules and then packaging it. Vohra did not disclose details of the foreign company, or the nature of the tie-up under discussion. “Even to fill-finish, you have to understand the vaccine you are importing. We can only go forward to that step if we understand what is permissible and what is not. To put a general overview, for most companies who have imported vaccines, the fill-finish is not a problem. It is usually the first-step to localise it, and then it depends on what is the nature of the partnership,” he added. Vohra said the company was seeking guidance and direction “on applicable laws”, and how the vaccine environment could operate. Further, Cipla has a basket of drugs to treat post-Covid lung sequelae. Its post-Covid offering includes an anti-fibrotic drug that helps in the treatment of lung fibrosis. It has also repurposed two antibiotics, Tobramycin and Colistin, used by inhalation (nebulisation), for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disease affecting lungs in children. Besides, the partnerships include licensing agreements for manufacturing and supply like the one with Gilead for Remdesivir and Lilly for Baricitinib, whereas others pertain to distribution of drugs for Roche — Tocilizumab and antibody cocktail (Casirivimab and Imdevimab). Cipla has also partnered to distribute MSD’s antiviral drug Molnupiravir, and with CSIR-IICT, a national-level research centre, to develop and launch Favipiravir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cipla-to-tap-foreign-cos-for-large-scale-vax-play/articleshow/83649780.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

A five-member delegation led by Jamui MP Chirag reached the ECI office in Delhi and staked their claim saying he was elected the LJP national president for a period of five years in 2019. Chirag said he has urged the commission to take a final call on the matter not without taking their claim into consideration. “I will provide the relevant documents to buttress my claim,” he said and added that some people were staking claim over the party and using its symbol, which was not valid as per the LJP constitution. “Before the death of the party founder Ram Vilas Paswan, I was made its national president,” he asserted. He also informed the commission about the suspension of the five party MPs for their anti-party activities. He described the nomination of Hajipur MP Paras as the LJP national president as “unconstitutional”. Later, a delegation of LJP’s rebel faction comprising Sanjay Saraf and Vinod Kumar staked their claim over the party. “We have already apprised the commission about our claim. We also told the commission about the election of Paras as the party's national president by the national executive,” Saraf said. Paras said his election to the top party post was valid as per its constitution. “Chirag is neither the party's national president nor leader of the parliamentary party,” he told this newspaper over the phone from Delhi. Meanwhile, a video went viral on social media quoting Chirag as asking a man over phone to continue the agitation in Patna and also to keep a close tab on the activities around the party office. In the video, the authenticity of which TOI doesn’t confirm, Chirag has been quoted as assuring the caller to provide full cooperation and assistance for the agitation and other related activities. Reacting to the video, a former LJP functionary, Keshav Singh, said he had time and again pointed out about Chirag's association with some people having criminal antecedents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/both-factions-stake-claim-over-ljp-symbol-with-ec/articleshow/83648644.cms||Ramashankar

AIIMS-P director Dr PK Singh said it was an uncommon case and required complicated surgery so as to save other organs from any damage. But the team led by Dr Anil Kumar, head of trauma and emergency, performed the surgery succesfully. Singh also congratulated the team for this. Dr Anil said it was a 30cm-long, 15cm-wide and 11cm-thick retroperitoneal tumour which had eclipsed some other vital organs, including ureter, kidney and interior vena cava. If the lump continued to grow for a few weeks more, it could turn fatal, he said. Being painless in nature, such lumps mostly remain undiagnosed till their growth reaches internally damaging position. The patient first reached the AIIMS-P OPD about ten days back when radiological tests like ultrasound and CT scan confirmed the presence of huge tumour. Other doctors of surgery and anaesthesia departments in the team included Dr Sheo Shankar, Dr Ajit Kumar, Dr Rahul Ranjan, Dr Jijo Anto and Dr Hari Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aiims-p-doctors-remove-tumour-weighing-2-5kg/articleshow/83646981.cms||---

A man in his mid twenties from the Tarsali area was arrested on Friday after an offence was lodged against him by the woman. He allegedly assumed a fake identity on social media and married the woman whom he later pressurised for conversion to his religion.

He allegedly told Shanti (name changed) that he wanted to marry her. According to police, Shanti was forced to get physically intimate and the accused also allegedly clicked her nude pictures without her coming to know of it. He even threatened to make the photographs viral. Shanti’s parents were allegedly threatened, and in February this year, she was taken to a religious place in Kalyannagar area of the city where the couple was married. He name was changed and she was allegedly forced to convert. The marriage was also registered.  The offence alleges that Shanti was harassed after marriage too and she was not allowed to practice her religion but forced to follow the faith she was converted to. The woman has alleged that she was also forced to undergo abortion twice by giving her medicines and on the third occasion, when her pregnancy was in an advanced stage, this was done by a doctor. Deputy commissioner of police (zone 2) Jayrajsinh Vala said that provisions of the Atrocities Act were included in the offence as the girl was from the scheduled caste. “We have arrested the man and a remand will be sought after the reports of his Covid-19 tests arrive,” he said Hindu Jagran Manch activist and advocate Niraj Jain too got involved in the case. “Her father reached out to us as we have been taking up such cases,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/first-arrest-under-love-jihad-law-in-state/articleshow/83648428.cms||---

Their contracts were terminated following detection of irregularities in recruitment. They were demanding withdrawal of the termination order. Authoritative sources said the contract of the daily wagers was terminated from the date of appointment on the recommendation of a three-member inquiry team headed by Muzaffarpur DDC. They were appointed for a period of three months on the directive of the health directorate. Muzaffarpur DM Pranav Kumar had ordered a probe after receipt of complaints related to irregularities in the appointment of paramedical staff on daily wages for vaccination purposes. An audio of an aspirant claiming that money changed hands in the appointment also went viral on social media. Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Dr S K Choudhary said the doctors and paramedical staff appointed on daily wages for vaccination in the district have now been allowed to render their services till July 26. “They assumed duty after the earlier order regarding termination of their services from the date of appointment was withdrawn,” he said, adding that vaccination as well as testing of Covid in the district have been restored. They had staged a dharna outside the Sadar hospital, throwing the traffic on the busy hospital road, close to Muzaffarpur railway junction, out of gear and causing heavy traffic congestion in the town. The situation deteriorated when the police intervened and tried to remove the protesters by using force. They were pelted with stones causing injuries to some woman police personnel. The police later resorted to baton charge to bring the situation under control. The probe team detected lack of transparency in the recruitment process. The other criteria such as experience and skill were also ignored. On Wednesday the probe team submitted its report to DM Pranav Kumar who, in turn, directed the civil surgeon to terminate the contract of services of those from the date of appointment. The civil surgeon complied with the DM's order. As soon as the news about termination of contract spread, a number of paramedical staff assembled at Sadar hospital and launched agitation. They were deputed at the Sadar hospital and different primary health centres in the district. The civil surgeon said that the health department is likely to advertise appointment of doctors and paramedical staff soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/terminated-daily-wage-muz-docs-staff-call-off-stir/articleshow/83648727.cms||Ramashankar

However, steady buying through the session helped the index recover its early losses and it closed 21 points higher at 52,344. By evening, Dalal Street, however, was pushed to the edge again as the Dow Jones index lost about 450 points in early trades after a top US Fed official said that the threat of inflation continues to worry policymakers in the US. The official also indicated that it would be a tough job for the US Fed to roll back the economic stimulus package for the world’s largest economy. This was the fifth consecutive session of losses for the US index, mainly because of investors’ fears about the rising inflation in the US. For May, the government data showed retail inflation was at 5% — a 13-year high. Global cues will continue to dictate the domestic market trend, said Ajit Mishra, VP, research, Religare Broking. In addition to international factors, on the domestic front, the progress of the monsoon and updates on the vaccination drive will be closely watched. On Friday, the day’s recovery came on the back of a Rs 2,680-crore net inflow by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), while domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 446 crore, BSE data showed. On Wall Street in early trades, the Dow Jones index was down about 450 points and recovered some grounds in mid-trades and was down about 380 points. This was the fifth consecutive session of losses for the index. Although most US Fed officials said that the inflation was transitory in nature, meaning prices would come down very soon, several analysts and bankers disagree and feel the rising rate of inflation is going to make it difficult for the US central bank to continue its $120-billion-a-month bond buying programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/d-street-cautious-as-dow-trades-lower-for-5th-session/articleshow/83649877.cms||---

---||Business||‘Banks must focus on tech resilience’||TNN Mumbai: With growing dependence on IT, technological resilience for banks has become as important as financial resilience, said RBI deputy governor M K Jain. Speaking at a webinar on a resilient financial system and governance, Jain said that the banking sector has managed to demonstrate operational and technological resilience during the pandemic. The central bank too managed to successfully implement a business continuity plan by maintaining a separate team in isolation solely to take care of the payment system. To highlight the importance of cyber risks the central bank had made it mandatory for senior management and those in CXO position to complete a certification programme on cybersecurity. He said that while banks should switch to new ways of doing business to avoid getting marginalised, the banking system as a whole should maintain its heterogeneity. This was important as a homogenous structure would increase risks. As a proactive supervisory measure the central bank was asking lenders to ensure that their business models, business decisions and strategies were interlinked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-must-focus-on-tech-resilience/articleshow/83650025.cms||---

Sasidhar said the finance department had released Rs 500 crore in the last two days and has promised to release Rs 200 crore each day starting Saturday following chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s instructions. Speaking to the media here on Friday, Sasidhar said the Centre has also promised to release the first tranche of Rs 1,200 crore by Monday which would provide the state big relief. “The delay in release of the paddy procurement advance by the Centre during the current fiscal has strained the payments to farmers to some extent. The Centre, which used to release procurement advance in April, was not able to release it till date due to Covid-19 induced troubles across the country,” said Sasidhar. He added that the Centre had positively responded after the chief minister explained the issue to Union minister Piyush Goyal during his recent visit to New Delhi, and promised to release Rs 1,200 crore by Monday. Sasidhar said the state government has already paid Rs 1,632 crore to farmers towards paddy procurement from its own pocket, without waiting for the release from the Centre. As much as 28.35 lakh metric tonnes of paddy for the current rabi season have been procured, he said, adding that the government had to pay Rs 1,619 crore to farmers as dues that had accumulated beyond 21 days. “We have received Rs 500 crore in the last two days and the chief minister directed the finance department to release Rs 200 crore each day to clear the dues. We are hopeful of clearing all dues beyond 21 days within a week,” said Sasidhar. The commissioner also appealed to farmers not to worry about the dues as arrangements for payments are underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/paddy-procurement-dues-to-be-cleared-in-a-week/articleshow/83646736.cms||Samdani MN

This was revealed in the minutes of the monetary policy committee meeting held on June 2-4 which were released on Friday. “The emphasis should be to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of Covid on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. In this context, the phrase ‘to revive’ needs to be brought in to strengthen the forward guidance and demonstrate the unambiguous commitment of the MPC to revive and sustain the growth process,” Das said in the statement. He said that the central bank was committed to taking conventional and unconventional measures to channel funds to sectors that bore the brunt of the second wave of the pandemic. RBI deputy governor Michael Patra said that although monetary transmission was reasonably full (with interest rates being passed on to borrowers) credit growth continued to remain subdued. “By keeping the policy rate unchanged and by persevering with the accommodative stance in this meeting, the MPC creates the space for further easing of financial conditions by the Reserve Bank,” said Patra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/guv-fragile-demand-prompted-dovish-policy/articleshow/83650109.cms||---

On the first day, Bevco outlets sold Rs 51.25 crore worth Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) through its 225 retail outlets that were opened on Thursday. The highest sales were recorded at the Bevco retail shop at Thenkurissi in Palakkad, where Rs 68.65 lakh worth IMFL was sold. It was followed by outlets in Powerhouse road in the capital and Irinjalakuda, where Rs 65.81 lakh and Rs 64.23 lakh worth IMFL were sold, respectively. Adding the sales through the bar hotels and Consumer fed outlets in the state, the total sales of IMFL in the state would be much higher. As per estimates, the bar hotels and Consumer fed outlets together sell approximately 25% of the total sales through the Bevco outlets, which would mean that the state would have sold approximately Rs 75 crore worth IMFL in a single day, according to taxes department sources. Meanwhile, the prices of IMFL sold through the bar hotels and Consumer fed outlets have increased, as the government has revised the wholesale profit margin of Bevco. As per the order issued by the taxes department on Wednesday, the profit margin of Bevco in its supplies to Consumer fed has been increased by 20%, while the margin in the supplies to the bar hotels have been increased by 25%. The government had revised the profit margin on the basis of a request from Bevco, to improve the financial position of the corporation. There are 639 bar hotels and 300 Bevco and Consumer fed outlets in the state. Bevco has roughly estimated the loss of revenue at Rs 1,800 crore for lost sales when the outlets were shut. Liquor sales had begun on a positive note in the current financial year with the government earning approximately Rs 970 crore through sales from April 1 to April 27. However, it was decided to shut down Bevco outlets and bars once again from April 27. In the last financial year, the state earned a robust revenue from liquor sales, earning Rs 11,743.99 crore, which is only 5.28% less compared to the immediate year before it. In 2019-20, liquor sales fetched the state exchequer Rs 12,398 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/after-51-day-break-bevco-logs-rs-51cr-sales-on-first-day/articleshow/83649406.cms||---

The storage in the four dams in Khadakwasla circle — Temghar, Panshet, Varasgaon and Khadakwasla — collectively increased by 0.5 TMC, while storage in Bhama Askhed went up marginally. The stock in Pavana dam, which supplies water to Pimpri Chinchwad, also increased by 0.2 TMC after the dam recorded over 74mm rainfall in 24 hours, ending on Friday morning. On Friday, the collective storage in the four dams of the Khadakwasla circle increased to 7.06 TMC, while the stock in Bhama Askhed was at 2.9 TMC. The irrigation department stated that it had activated the control rooms at each dam to monitor the storage, which is likely to increase more if the rainfall continues. The Panshet and Varasgaon dams recorded 85mm rainfall each, while the catchments of Temghar received 95mm rainfall. The Khadakwasla dam recorded 47mm rainfall till Friday morning.An official from the irrigation department said that the inflow of rainwater into the reservoirs had started with continuous rain, which led to an increase in water-levels. “Besides the dams near Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, many other major dams in the Bhima basin have recorded fairly good spells of rain in the last two days. The Nira Devghar dam, which is located ahead of Bhor, recorded 163mm rainfall in 24 hours, ending on Friday morning, while Mulshi recorded over 100mm rainfall”, the official said.The official added that there was no immediate plan to release water from any dam as the water levels were up only marginally. “The collective storage capacity of four dams in the Khadakwasla circle is over 29 TMC. The existing live stock is at 25%,” the official added. As per the report released by the irrigation department, water storage in two dams — Andra and Khadakwasla — was above the half-way mark of their respective capacities. Live storage in all other dams were yet to reach 50% capacity. This week, the irrigation department stopped the water release from Khadakwasla dam into the Mutha canal for rural areas. Existing stock would be utilized to meet drinking water requirements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/storage-in-six-dams-rises-after-two-days-of-showers/articleshow/83651522.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Second wave hotspots may have better fighting chance||NEW DELHI: A serosurveillance study carried out by AIIMS, under the World Health Organization (WHO) umbrella, in a south Delhi locality has found that 75% people in the vicinity had antibodies against Covid-19 in March, when the second wave was yet to peak. Researchers said a detailed analysis was being carried out to see whether the said locality witnessed fewer infections during the second wave that peaked between April and May. “In principle, studies reported so far show, natural infection offers maximum protection against re-infection. Therefore, it is my understanding that these areas may have witnessed fewer cases during the second wave and by that logic they may have strong protection against the infection in future as well,” Dr Sanjay Rai, professor of community medicine at AIIMS, told TOI. He added that Covid hotspots in the first wave, for example Jehangirpuri in north west Delhi and Dharavi in Mumbai, witnessed fewer cases during the second wave. The WHO-AIIMS study, based on testing of 4,509 samples collected between March 15 and June 10, at five centres including Delhi (urban) and Delhi (rural), Bhubaneshwar (rural), Gorakhpur (rural) and Agartala (rural), also showed that the seroprevalence was almost similar in both children and adults. Seroprevalence in children ranged between 42% in the 2-4 year age group to 44% in the 5-9 year age group and 60% in the 10-17 year age group. Overall, the seroprevalence was 56% in the less than 18 years age group and 64% in 18 years and above, the study showed. “SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity rate among children was high and was comparable to the adult population. Hence, it is unlikely that any future third wave by prevailing Covid-19 variant would disproportionately affect children two years or older,” the authors have stated. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology division at Indian Council of Medical Research said mere exposure to infection and the presence of antibodies may not be sufficient to predict the risk of future infection or not. “One needs to have enough neutralising antibodies against the coronavirus,” he said. Serosurvey report released by Delhi government in February 2021 showed more than 50% of the population had developed protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave that led to three peaks in June, September and November respectively. Despite that, the city witnessed a fourth peak from April onward which turned out to be the deadliest yet. Scientists from National Centre for Disease Control and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research said in a recent report that this was caused by the predominance of Delta variant (B.1.617.2), a sub-lineage of the Kappa variant (B.1.617) that was first detected in Maharashtra in October last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/second-wave-hotspots-may-have-better-fighting-chance/articleshow/83651555.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

However, it has only been since Friday evening that the rain intensity began to pick up in the city, IMD’s three-hourly rain data showed. As per the data, Shivajinagar received 29.2mm rain from 5.30pm till 8.30pm on Friday. From 8.30am to 5.30pm on Friday, Shivajinagar had received 6.2mm of rain. However, IMD in a forecast issued for the weekend indicated that moderate rain in Pune will be replaced by light rains on Saturday and very light to light rain thereafter. Isolated heavy rain in ghat areas has, however, been forecast on Saturday. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD Pune, said, “Though monsoon has been active vigorously over Gujarat, areas of MP, UP and eastern part of India, no strong system is active over Maharashtra. There is, however, an off shore trough from South Maharashtra to Kerala coast, and moderately strong westerly winds, which are responsible for the ongoing rainfall activity in the state.” Konkan Goa may get a very heavy to heavy rainfall at isolated places in the next 24 hours, mostly confined to Raigad district. Madhya Maharashtra witnessed fairly widespread rainfall on Friday, with 50-70% area reporting showers. From Saturday, IMD said the region might receive scattered rain, followed by isolated light rain. Kashyapi said rainfall activity was likely to reduce drastically from June 20 in Pune city/district. Friday’s rain, meanwhile, caused tree falling instances in Pune. As many as 22 two-wheelers were damaged after a big tree was uprooted in Katraj on Friday. “No one sustained injuries in the incident though,” said an officer from the Pune fire brigade.  Due to constant rainfall, 14 cases of tree falling were reported from Kothrud, Paud Road, Prabhat Road, Ganesh Khind Road, Senapati Bapat Road, Sahakarnagar and Khadki areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-gets-highest-12-hour-rainfall-in-june-so-far/articleshow/83651548.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Investigations into factory accidents flawed, says scientists||HYDERABAD: Scientists for People, a group that comprises of prominent retired scientists, alleged that the investigations into the recent accidents in factories in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were flawed. In a letter written by principal secretary (labour, employment, training and factories), Scientists for People, led by Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) retired scientist Dr K Babu Rao, said that factory departments maintain secrecy over investigations. “A series of accidents are taking place regularly since the last two years resulting in loss of life of workers and livelihood of their families. Every time an accident happens, a routine exercise of inquiry by the same officials that failed to enforce safety norms takes place and the same officials are asked to report. These reports are submitted to district collectors who are not experts in judging the quality and correctness of the reports. These reports are not made public and are filed,” Babu Rao said. Recently, there were two major accidents in a span of nine months at Venkata Narayana Active Ingredients Private Ltd, Chandrapadia, SPSR Nellore district, and seven lives were lost. The latest accident, which killed four people, occurred on May 11, 2021. “The information we have is that the scene of the accident is not preserved and the officials are building up a story unrelated to the actual accident. This requires an independent inquiry. The enquiry report submitted to the district collector was not made public. The earlier accident involving fire and explosion took place in July, 2020. The report is a reflection of the inadequacy of understanding of the processes involved leading to false conclusion. It was not a methanol fire and explosion but a hybrid dust/solvent mixture explosion,” Rao said. The NGT formed a joint committee comprising of the same officials, including some from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC). “None of them have any training in accident investigation. They will have to depend on the report of the joint district committee. We suggest that the probe should be open and the affected people must be consulted. We are willing to interact with the committee provided they share the data,” said Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/investigations-into-factory-accidents-flawed-scientists/articleshow/83651568.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The food will be prepared in Hyderabad and taken to Vasalamarri, which was fourth village in the state adopted by KCR (in November 2020) to develop it in all spheres. The CM will sit with the villagers for the meal. After the lunch, he will hold a meeting with the villagers. He rang up Vasalamarri sarpanch Pogula Anjaneyulu and enquired about the population of the village – to get a rough idea as to for how many people food will have to be prepared. “Your responsibility is to identify two places in the village for us to have lunch together and have a meeting after that. You can coordinate with the district collector and officials who will visit your village,” KCR told Anjaneyulu. The sarpanch informed the CM that the gram panchayat office would not be sufficient and wondered if the lunch and meeting could be arranged at a private land belonging to a villager. The CM asked him to go ahead with the preparations. “I will come in a bus which has all the amenities, including a toilet. So, I do not need any special arrangements to be made,” he told the sarpanch. Anjaneyulu requested the CM if he could spare some time to visit his house for which the CM agreed. Officials said this visit could be squeezed in after the lunch and before the meeting with the villagers. Vasalamarri caught the attention of the CM last year when he was on a visit to Jangaon to inaugurate the Dharani web portal. The CM, who was proceeding from his farmhouse at Erravelli, stopped by at the village in October last year and spoke to the villagers and wondered how it lacked in development despite being close to Hyderabad (40-odd km away). He assured the villagers that he would take it upon himself to develop the village and adopted it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-kcr-to-have-lunch-with-vasalamarri-villagers-on-june-22/articleshow/83651603.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Pune||App for learning, testing Pune zilla parishad students by July||PUNE: A new cellphone application integrated with the curriculum from Balbharati to open source private courseware to NCERT is being developed for students studying in Pune zilla parishad (ZP) schools. The app is in the development phase and the developers are gathering technical support through CSR arms of private companies while inputs from NGOs on building it are being sought. Over the next two weeks, the Pune ZP plans to ready the back-end of the platform with integration, upload the videos and ensure that the data with them is on the app which is expected to be available to the students by July. The app will have videos prepared by the state education department, teachers and other experts.Students will also be able to take tests through and evaluation will take place through random method where teachers from anywhere in the state would be allotted answer sheets for assessments. The application has been developed in order to structure the online education system in ZP schools, chief executive officer of Pune ZP, Ayush Prasad, said. He conducted a meeting with all the stakeholders, including companies working in education and willing to lend CSR support, NGOs, film makers, officials of the education department at the Pune ZP and others. “Initialising the app will help get personalised tracing of every student. We want to know what the student is learning, which video the student is watching, what the student finds more interesting and if they like Balbharati concepts or NCERT or other private players’ videos and tutorials. Integration of the app with other available resources would ensure academic tracking of the student,” Prasad said. Madhukar Banuri, from the Leadership for Equity, a non-governmental organisation, said they have undertaken intensive surveys in Pune district related to learning and teaching outcomes during the year.  Banuri said, “The most effective method in teaching was handing out worksheets to children. The method had immense potential and also response from students and so far the best as per our ground survey.” The Pune ZP vice-president Ranjit Shivtare said the ZP was trying to use optimum funds to ensure that students get the best out of online education and the Covid restrictions did not hamper their learning process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/app-for-learning-testing-pune-zp-students-by-july/articleshow/83651595.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The college, affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), has classes from Std XI to PhD with 119 such students enrolled. Vedant Mundada, gold medallist and best student award recipient at the recently conducted 118th convocation ceremony of SPPU, is a postgraduate student of this college. The college through its vast alumni network has been able to help employ all disabled students. “Apart from ramps, wheelchairs and white canes available at the college, hearing aids are given and visually impaired students have a dedicated computer lab, screen reading software like JAWS and an application which can store a copious amount of data and read it out for the student,” principal V B Gaikwad, said. “The students are also helped to avail various scholarships from different sources, while extra tutoring sessions are conducted for them. The college has tied up with a South Korean organisation for software that helps disabled students academically. We encourage students to talk to schools exclusively for the physically challenged students so those children feel inspired and work hard,” added Gaikwad.  Vaibhav Puranik, currently a deputy manager at State Bank of India, said he owed it all to the college and its staff.  “My father passed away early, and my mother had lost her job in the private sector. I had completed Std XII and didn’t know what to do when we visited the principal. I could complete my education for free and my mother got a job as non-teaching staff. They installed a screen reading software for us, probably the first in Nashik and under the earn and learn scheme assigned a fellow student to read to me for two hours a day. I had no computer at home and did all my preparation for the bank exam in college. They gave me permission to appear for internal exams at a later stage because they clashed with the bank exams,” Puranik said. Aakash Chavan, a postgraduate student in economics, has been with the college since Std XI. He said the teachers helped him a lot. Sagar Bodake graduated in 2018 but received help from his alma mater till he got selected in Bank of India. “They keep sending me all the advertisements for jobs, helped me prepare and use the library and other facilities, and encouraged me to take part in sports,” Bodake added. He said that he has participated in athletics in college and have trekked to 70 peaks in the Sahyadri range, and scaled Kalsubai peak 26 times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/college-offers-disabled-free-edu-helps-get-jobs/articleshow/83651621.cms||Ardhra Nair

On Friday, 9,798 cases and 198 deaths were recorded, taking the total Covid caseload to 59.5 lakh and, with the addition of 450 past deaths, the cumulative toll rose to 1,16,674. Mumbai reported higher cases on Friday (758) while deaths (19) continued to be under 20 for a week now. The total caseload in the city stands at 7.2 lakh and toll at 14,860 so far. The Kalyan-Dombivli municipal area did not record any Covid deaths for the first time since March 12. BMC officials said cases could have gone up marginally in Mumbai as testing has increased keeping in view that restrictions are easing and crowds are back at public places. The civic update on Friday said 30,447 tests were conducted in a 24-hour period. “We have consciously increased the number of tests, and plan to increase it further in the coming weeks,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. Before the restrictions were announced on April 27, BMC commissioner I S Chahal had said the BMC aimed to carry out over 45,000 tests a day. The daily test positivity rate continued below 3% and the case doubling rate improved to 734 days and the weekly growth rate dropped to 0.09%. In Kalyan, daily cases (78) were below 100 for the second consecutive day even as deaths dropped to zero after 98 days. The twin city is the second worst-affected city in MMR after Mumbai, with a caseload of 1.4 lakh cases so far. In Navi Mumbai, the recovery rate has improved to 97.2%, better than the national average of 95.8%, and daily cases hover between 5- and 60. Active cases have dropped below 1,200. At the state level, the active cases continued to dip and the rate of recovery was slowly on the rise. The rate of recovery rose to 96% and the active cases dipped to 1.3 lakh, of which 18,764 were in Mumbai.

---||Pune||Plaints about demand for fees during RTE process||Pune: Complaints about schools demanding fees, not getting admission in the nearest school and parents being told to pay for online classes have come to light during the admissions to fill the 25% reservation quota under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, this year. The admission portal opened on June 11 and the process will continue till June 30 for the first round. A parent from a Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) area said, “My daughter got admission in a private school two years ago via RTE. Everything is free in her case, including textbooks, uniforms, online classes among others. But this year, my son had to be enrolled. The lottery process allotted him a nearby school, but when I went there, the school administration demanded Rs 6,000. I told them that under RTE, they are not supposed to take any fees but they said they are taking activity fee. When I told them I don’t want my son to be part of any activity, they told me to take my son elsewhere. The school said that I would also have to pay for uniforms, textbooks and also blamed me for choosing the school and wasting their time.” Nagpur-based Rajesh Singh, whose niece was seeking admission in a private school under RTE, said that the computer programme did not give preference to students who stay within a one or three km radius of the school and instead randomly selected from the pool of students who had applied. “We stay within 1km of the school. But when the admission list was out, we found that many students who stayed beyond 3km were selected, neglecting those staying within 3km. After much deliberation with the administration, another list was uploaded. However, such things must not happen and if it has happened in one school it can happen elsewhere too,” Singh said. Dinkar Temkar, in-charge of RTE admissions in the state, refuted views that the admission software has a glitch. “The software selects students as per the distance of the address given by the parent. If a parent has given the wrong address to show that they are within one km, the student’s name can be selected before others. However, this is verified at the time of actual admission when the parent has to show residence proof to the school administration. Secondly, it is illegal to ask for fees of any kind from students seeking admission under RTE. If there are any such cases, I would request the parent to immediately contact the education officer of the area and lodge a complaint,” Temkar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/plaints-about-demand-for-fees-during-rte-process/articleshow/83651651.cms||Ardhra Nair

On Thursday morning, the 21-year-old man’s uncle informed the police that some people intercepted his nephew’s scooter near Garware company and forced the elder brother to get into their sports utility vehicle (SUV) before driving away towards Akurdi. The complainant also told the police that the 17-year-old had witnessed the entire incident. Senior inspector Ganesh Jawadwad of Nigdi police station told TOI that the youth narrated the ‘kidnapping’ incident to the police after which an elaborate operation was launched to trace the SUV and the complainant’s nephew. “However, the CCTV footage that we recovered as well as other evidence collected by the police team established that no such incident had actually taken place and the ‘kidnapped’ nephew was traced to his friend’s house at Ajanthanagar in Chinchwad,” Jawadwad said. The officer added that the man later told the police officers that he wanted to go back to his hometown, but he feared that his uncle may not let him leave so he cooked up a false kidnapping story with the help of his cousin. Jawadwad said, “We have also filed a case against the complainant for giving information to the police without verifying with his son.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-cook-up-fake-kidnapping-story/articleshow/83651646.cms||---

Devendra Fadnavis, when chief minister, and Union home minister Amit Shah had taken up the issue with the Karnataka CM, but the issue was not resolved. Fadnavis had taken it up with NDA government, but there was no response. Since both states were ruled by BJP, it was expected that better sense would prevail and Karnataka would concede to the demand. Patil said he felt it will be appropriate if he interacts with the Karnataka CM. “Earlier, we had a secretary-level meeting. Only dialogue will resolve the dispute. In view of annual flood-like situation in Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur districts, the CM will concede to our demand,’’ Patil said. A senior official said Maharashtra demanded that water discharged should be more than 500,000 cusecs to save villages in the three districts from flooding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-minister-ready-to-meet-karnataka-cm-on-dam-issue/articleshow/83653810.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The CHC earlier had only a 15-bed ward. After adoption, it has been equipped with two more wards of 15-bed each. An oxygen plant is already being installed at this CHC with corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. A fund of around Rs 1 crore has been spent for its modernisation. The Niti Ayog has selected Sevapuri block to develop as the first model block of the country by saturating all the villages with government schemes and elevating the standard of the people by measuring them on prescribed key performance indicators in 2020. After the CHC inspection, the CM went to Ring Road (Phase-2) to inspect the Kalika Dham flyover that connects Mirzapur and Bhadohi with the Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport at Babatpur. The CM also held a meeting with the officials to discuss various issues. Earlier, talking to reporters in Ballia, Yogi said: “The Covid-19 situation is under control in Uttar Pradesh. About three lakh tests are being conducted on a daily basis in the state and the number of active cases has come down to 6,000.” “The government is also alert in anticipation of the third wave of coronavirus and is very sensitive towards the health of the children. In this regard, a paediatric hospital with ICU is being constructed in every district and the facilities are being upgraded,” he told reporters. In Ballia, he reviewed development work and took stock of the Covid-19 situation. He visited the district hospital and interacted with the doctors, nursing staff and also the patients who were admitted there. The CM also inspected the vaccination centre and motivated people to take the vaccine shots.

---||Kanpur||Team inspects Old Ganga Bridge to assess its condition||KANPUR: A team of officials on Friday visited the Old Ganga Bridge (Shukla Ganj) to review its strength so that it can be repaired and restored for safe travel and transportation. The Old Ganga Bridge connecting Shuklaganj with Kanpur had been closed for an indefinite period after cracks were developed below the track and the road a few days ago. Old Ganga Bridge (Shukla Ganj) is a historic structure of more than 146 years of History. It’s around 970 metres in length and has a road of 5.5 metre and below a pedestrian path. This bridge was one of the most important points of Transit between Lucknow, Kanpur, Jhansi and Agra and millions of people used to travel from this place. As of now the bridge is closed for movement and transportation as few cracks have developed below the track and the road. Looking into safety aspects, the administration closed down this bridge for travel and transportation. The administration asked PWD to get the strength check done and to see how this Bridge can be repaired and restored for travel and transportation. Following this the PWD approached the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) which is a premier institute of Government of India based in Delhi. The team of CRRI headed by Dr Rajiv Goyal recently visited the site in Kanpur to study the structure and to interact with the officers for vital inputs. On Friday, divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar visited the Old Ganga Bridge site and discussed the facts and figures with the CRRI team for further follow up action. Rakesh Singh, GM Setu Nigam and Mukesh Sharma, executive engineer (project director) PWD accompanied him. “As this bridge is one of the most important transit points for people of Kanpur, its repair and restoration at the earliest is the priority of the state government and local administration,” said the commissioner. The administration and PWD department have asked the CRRI team to check out and to report whether the “basic support structure” of this bridge is intact and can bear the load if its repaired and reopened. And also to study and give the possibility of widening this road from 5.5 mtrs (now) to 7 metres so that it can be used as 2 lane road for effective transportation, the commissioner said further. CRRI team assured the commissioner to give the preliminary report in next one week and then once the preliminary report is accepted and funds for study are released by PWD, then CRRI team will visit the site & will do the strength analysis with necessary equipment and machinery and will give the report in next one month. After getting the report, a decision will be taken for budget allocation by the government for its repair and widening of the road if found feasible. Commissioner directed chief engineer PWD, GM Setu Nigam to follow up the case personally and to keep him updated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/team-inspects-old-ganga-bridge-to-assess-its-condition/articleshow/83647756.cms||---

It is also an infringement on the power of civic bodies to take decision regarding amenity spaces under their jurisdictions,” activists claimed, adding that the decision will lead to creation of concrete jungles.According to the new order, keeping amenity space for any construction below 20,000sqmt is not mandatory. Even for properties above 20,000sqmt, only 5% amenity space is mandatory. The PMC in its development control rule has made provision for 15% amenity spaces. These changes have been made in the unified development control and promotion rules. The state issued the notification on Friday.Activists have been demanding more amenity spaces and their proper utilisation, saying city was already short of amenities. “The amenity spaces are hearts and lungs of cities. Not keeping enough spaces will cause harm and lead to development of concrete jungles in civic areas,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group.“The civic body should raise objection against the changes. It should approach the court requesting for direction to quash the order,” said Ujjwal Keskar, a BJP leader. He said the Constitution has given powers to the civic bodies to plan local development. The state can intervene only if it pertains to larger public interest. But reduction of amenity spaces cannot be a larger public interest, he said.Civic officials said the administration has amenity spaces in its possession at the 11 merged villages. More amenity spaces will be needed in the 23 villages, likely to be merged soon. “Many amenity spaces have been developed on the fringes of the city and newly-developing areas. More amenity spaces will help in better planning of these areas,” said a senior PMC official. As many as 737 amenity spaces are available under the PMC areas. They are spread across 150 hectors of land. “We welcome the move. Cities have earmarked reservations on the development plan of the city, which takes care of the civic amenities,” said Anil Pharande, president, Credai Pune-Metro. The additional demand for amenity spaces, especially for small plots of 4,000sqmt and above was always a challenge as these plots had to provide for 10% open spaces, 15% amenity spaces and also create inclusive housing as EWS/ LIG flats to the extent of 20% of the basic FSI.(With inputs from Shiladitya Pandit)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activists-resent-govt-move-to-reduce-amenity-spaces/articleshow/83651680.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Four children with mucormycosis infection and other ailments lose an eye||MUMBAI: At least four children have lost an eye due to mucormycosis at city hospitals in the past seven months. Doctors said the cases were rare and mainly among immune-compromised children. But none of them had a history of Covid-19 infection; two had Covid-19 antibodies, suggestive of a recent exposure to coronavirus. In June, a 14-year-old girl from Ratnagiri underwent an orbital exenteration (removal of eyeball, tissues) at Cooper Hospital to stop the fungal infection from spreading to the brain. In February, Fortis Hospital doctors performed the same debilitating surgery on a 14-year-old with a history of juvenile diabetes to save her from the fast-spreading infection. At Parel’s KB Haji Bachooali Charitable Hospital two children aged 4 and 6 years were operated between December and April this year. The 4-year-old was a cancer patient. Despite these detections, mucormycosis in children is rare and hardly ever seen in healthy children, said paediatrician Dr Jesal Sheth who consults at Fortis. The 14-year-old, who had uncontrolled sugar, had developed blackening of an eye. “Even in pre-Covid times, children with juvenile diabetes were susceptible to these infections,” she added. The girl had antibodies but no history of Covid. The Ratnagiri girl’s case has intrigued Cooper doctors as she neither has blood sugar nor a history of Covid infection in the family or of steroid use. A class VIII student, she had a swelling in the eye. As symptoms progressed, the family came to Mumbai. This girl too has Covid antibodies but no Covid. “Our understanding is mucormycosis is only seen in children with underlying health problems, but we haven’t found any in her till now. She also didn’t suffer from serious Covid that would make her susceptible,” said Dr Charuta Mandke, in-charge of ophthalmology at Cooper. The hospital plans to send her samples for immunological tests to probe for undetected underlying conditions. Both cases treated at Haji Bachooali Hospital were from outside Maharashtra, said oculoplastic surgeon Dr Prithesh Shetty. He said they had lost vision by the time they came. Both these children didn’t have diabetes, although the 4-year-old had leukaemia. For paediatric cases, correct diagnosis of mucormycosis is crucial since it's not commonly seen in them, said oculoplastic surgeon Dr Akshay Nair, who consults with Sion Hospital. “We did have children who presented with symptoms looking like mucormycosis, but they turned out to be bacterial cellulitis. Nationally, too few children have got it,” he added..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4-children-with-mucor-infection-and-other-ailments-lose-an-eye/articleshow/83651723.cms||Sumitra Debroy

There have been multiple occasions in the last one week when no Covid funeral was carried out in east Delhi. A senior municipal official overseeing the Covid funeral centres said that for the last two days, only five bodies of Covid patients were being received in the Covid-designated crematoria and burial grounds. “A compiled report from all three corporations states that five bodies were laid to rest with Covid-protocol funerals on June 17 and the same number of bodies was received on June 16 too,” the official said. The report states that 14 Covid-protocol funerals were carried out on June 13, 10 a day after, 11 on June 15 and five funerals each on June 16 and 17. A senior official explained that Covid-protocol cremations are carried out with a number of precautions such as use of body bags, PPE kits and disinfection as mandated by the health ministry to minimise the risk of spread of the infection. “In cases where test results are still awaited or tests could not be carried out but the patient shows all the symptoms and lung deterioration associated with Covid, the hospitals send the bodies with a 'Covid suspect' tag. Such bodies are also cremated with the same procedure,” the official added. Covid-protocol funerals had peaked in Delhi on April 29 when the civic bodies recorded 717 such funerals. Delhi’s official Covid funeral count remained above the 700-mark between April 28 and 30, while between May 1 and 2, the count was between 600 and 699 per day. The capital registered less than 300 funerals a day on May 13 and the number has been consistently going down in the past few weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/huge-dip-in-covid-19-funerals-average-daily-figures-now-below-10/articleshow/83651752.cms||Paras Singh

Ordnance factories include DRDO labs, MES, COD, Army base workshops and various departments of the army, navy and air force. Sameer Bajpai, senior vice-president of OEF, Phoolbagh Kanpur Qila Mazdoor Union, said “The the eyes of the Central government are on the lands of the ordnance factories. It wants to corporatise and hand over all the land to the capitalists.” He said that ordnance factories have a history of 219 years. “These are the same ordnance factories, which protected the borders and honour of the country by making available military equipment on time to the country’s army in the wars of 1962, 1965, 1971 and 1999. But the way the Central government is bent on ending their existence, it will certainly prove to be a very fatal step for the country’s army and security. Decision of incorporation will not be accepted at any cost,” he added. Meanwhile, Congress party workers led by senior leader Dr Shailendra Dikshit pledged their support to the ordnance factory workers and staged a massive demonstration at the Small Arms Factory gates at Kalpi Road on Friday. Dikshit said, “Congress party strongly condemns this draconian decision of the government. The Central government has been proceeding with the defence corridor while depriving the state-owned defence industries like ordnance factories of their work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/oef-workers-protest-against-govts-corporatisation-move/articleshow/83647764.cms||---
---||Kolkata||CBSE schools form panels for XII final scores with board formula||KOLKATA: Most CBSE schools have either formed or are in the process of setting up their results committees to start the evaluation of Class XII candidates and computation of their final scores, in the absence of their board exams this year. After getting the formula ratified by the Supreme Court, the central board has sent schools detailed instructions on how to go about it. Accordingly, 30% weightage will be given to each of Class X board exam scores (best three subjects) and Class XI final exams scores and 40% on Class XII online exams at schools, that might include everything from unit tests, term tests to pre-boards. “We have asked our Class-XII teachers to read the notification. We have formed our results committee that includes two teachers from other schools. When the results are prepared, subject teachers will be consulted as they know every child’s proficiency level,” said Lakshmipat Singhania Academy director Meena Kak. The school has submitted its CBSE X marks to the board. Schools felt the computation of CBSE X marks was a dress rehearsal for this more complex marking Class XII formula, where a lot of scores under several heads were being considered. A list of FAQs has been prepared by all schools to be discussed with the city coordinator, with whom the first meeting has been slated for Saturday. “The notification is clear but we will give our questions to the co-ordinator who will then take it to the board for further clarification,” said North Point Senior Secondary Boarding School director Rita Chatterjee. CBSE schools will be divided into clusters that will hold subsequent meetings with the coordinator. South Point principal Rupa Sanyal Bhattacharjee felt the inclusion of Class X boards marks, which the Class XII candidates had scored in pre-pandemic days, would help. The inclusion of Class XI finals marks, which were also held on campuses as pandemic was yet to strike with a vengeance in March 2019, would be an objective analysis, she said. “We were lucky we could conduct our pre-boards on the campus and our practicals, too,” she added. Schools felt the inclusion of the average performance of schools for the past three years while computing the Class XII final marks would bring a system of check and balance so that children were not affected from too much leniency or too much strictness in school assessments. “We have all the data with us and we are getting down to arranging them in order. Our exam committee is in place, too,” said Asian International School principal Vijaylakshmi Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbse-schools-form-panels-for-xii-final-scores-with-board-formula/articleshow/83649550.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Fined every month for lapses, garbage collecting agencies paid Rs1.42 crore||NAGPUR: BVG India and AG Enviro Infra, the two companies entrusted with door-to-door garbage collection 19 months ago, have been fined 19 times by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) for low collection coverage, irregular collection services, malpractices and staff strike. The two companies have paid a cumulative fine of Rs1.42 crore, while NMC paid them Rs99.35 crore for the door-to-door garbage collection and transportation to Bhandewadi dumping yard. The data obtained from NMC’s solid waste management department revealed that both firms had started lifting door to door collection from November 2019. Since the beginning of their services, NMC levied Rs1 lakh fine on each firm in November 2019 itself. The fine amount increased from the second month of their service. In December 2019, the then municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar had fined BVG India Limited (Rs4 lakh) and AG Enviro Infra (Rs3 lakh) for deficiency in service. NMC also imposed a fine of Rs27 lakh on AG Enviro Infra after Shiv Sena leader Nitin Tiwari and West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre exposed how the firm first filled their trucks with mud and then garbage to increase the weight. Though workers from both garbage firms had resorted to strikes on several occasions, NMC has penalized them only once. BVG paid Rs25.08 lakh fine after its workers stopped work in January 2021. In July 2020, AG Enviro Infra paid Rs13.80 lakh as fine after its employees went on strike. After leader of opposition and senior Congress corporator Tanaji Wanve and BSP corporator Jitendra Ghodeswar raised the issue of irregularities in lifting garbage by both firms in the general body meeting, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari had formed a five-member committee headed by ruling party leader Avinash Thakre. Thakre panel has already started gathering details about both firms, manpower, machinery and groundwork data. “On Friday, we collected data from all 10 zones regarding details pertaining to both firms. Now, we will cross-check the data collected from both firms and NMC’s zonal offices,” Thakre told TOI. Within a fortnight, a report comprising the committee’s observation about the issues raised by Wanve and Ghodeswar will be tabled in the general body meeting, he said. Report Card From Nov 2019 to May 2021 AG Enviro Infra Per tonne garbage payment---Rs1,950 Fine---Rs76,36,172 Total payment---Rs50,93,76,159 BVG India Per tonne garbage payment---Rs1,800 Fine --- Rs66,47,741 Total payment --- Rs48,41,95,678||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fined-every-month-for-lapses-garbage-collecting-agencies-paid-rs1-42-crore/articleshow/83651713.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Pune||Gavaskar, not Tendulkar, the greatest: Former umpire||Pune: While standing in his debut Test as umpire in Kanpur in 1973, Madhav Gothoskar was challenged by the then English skipper Tony Lewis over a substitution rule. Without pausing for a second, he recited the rules to Lewis. The Englishman was convinced he didn’t have any scope to argue. Gothoskar (92) recited the substitute rule again, without pausing for a second, while narrating the incident on Wednesday. His audience was convinced that Gothoskar was one of the best umpires the sport has seen. The former international umpire had his listeners in awe while being felicitated by Cricketers’ Foundation here on Wednesday. Gothoskar received a cheque of Rs75,000. He has temporarily moved to Pune with his wife Leela, as his house in Mumbai has gone under redevelopment. “There are 42 laws and over 300 bylaws of cricket. I had memorised them by heart. Knowing the rules of the game is the basic requirement for a cricket umpire,” he quipped. In a career spanning 11 years, Gothoskar has seen 23 Test centuries by various batsmen. At 92, he doesn’t just remember the names of the batsmen who made those tons, he also has details ready to share. “Five of them were by (Sunil) Gavaskar. But my favourite will always be his 29th ton in Delhi,” he said. “It is my favourite because of the way it was scored. I always found Sunil very strong in defence, but his innings was all about aggression that day. He was hitting Malcolm Marshall and (Michael) Holding all over the ground. With that knock, he also equalled Don Bradman’s 29 centuries,” Gothoskar told TOI. Gothoskar, who officiated in 14 Tests and an ODI from 1972 to 1983, didn’t mince words when he was asked to pick one between Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar. “Tendulkar, no doubt, was a great batsman, but Gavaskar was the greatest. The quality of fast bowlers that Gavaskar faced throughout his career, without a helmet, cannot be matched by any other player from any era,” he said. On if umpiring had become easier because of the technology, Gothoskar shook his head in negative. “With everybody watching the game on live screens in the stadium and when you have television replays, the pressure is more on the umpires. You have the fear of getting exposed in front of so many people if you make a mistake,” he said, adding that Pakistan’s Aleem Dar was the best umpire of this era. Having officiated in matches involving the West Indies and England greats like Clive Llyod, Viv Richardson, Marsh, Holding, Tony Grieg and Graham Gooch, Gothoskar said he never felt the pressure before taking any on-field call. “I never went to the field as a fan of any cricketer, be it Indian or anyone else. When you don’t have a favourite, it is easier to take tough calls,” he said. About his choice of most gentleman cricketer, he said, “Gundappa Viswanath was a gentleman. Tony Lewis and Asif Iqbal were gentlemen, too. But not Zaheer Abbas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gavaskar-not-tendulkar-the-greatest-former-umpire/articleshow/83651694.cms||Tushar Dutt

The freezing order was passed against the accused, Pinninti Subrahmanyam Srinivas, under the PMLA. The order was initiated based on a letter rogatory (LR) received from the embassy of Qatar in Delhi. ED sleuths conducted a search at Srinivas’s residence at Seethammadhara in Visakhapatnam on June 15. Srinivas was working as head of buyers department in Almeera Consumer Goods Company in Doha, Qatar. A money laundering investigation by the ED revealed that Srinivas had transferred funds from his Doha National Bank account to his accounts with Axis Bank and HDFC Bank here. “The money trail has revealed that Srinivas has invested Rs 45 lakh out of these funds in various mutual funds in the name of his wife and self,” said the ED. Srinivas also acquired three residential plots — 386 square yards in Cheepuruvalasa village in Vizianagaram district and two plots of 271 square yards and 300 square yards in Tatituru and Gidijala villages in Visakhapatnam — in his name, the value of which is approximately Rs43 lakh. By abusing his official position in the goods company, he accepted bribes from customers for doing undue favours to them. The bribe amounts were laundered by him from Qatar to his bank accounts in India. The public prosecutor’s office at Onaiza police station in Doha had asked the Indian authorities to trace, identify Srinivas’s assets in India, which were acquired out of the bribe amounts, and preserve them until the investigation is concluded and the accused is convicted in a court of law in Qatar.

---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Now mathematics kits to make Maths easier and interesting for kids||PRAYAGRAJ: With an aim to improve the quality of education, as many as 2,470 primary schools in Prayagraj district have been offered mathematics kits. These mathematics kits will help thousands of school children studying in primary and upper primary schools to learn the various concepts of mathematics in an interesting way when the schools will reopen. Educational institutes, including primary, upper primary and intermediate colleges, are currently closed owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Basic Shiksha Adhikari (Prayagraj) Sanjay Kushwaha told TOI, “The mathematics kit will help enhance the interest of students in mathematics, which can prove to be a difficult subject for quite a few students otherwise.” He added “The kit will help kids of primary schools to learn while playing, and attract them towards the subject.” “The kits contain 21 elements including abacus, cloth clips, fraction strips, play money and manuals for teachers—all of which combine to make learning and teaching the subject a fun-filled experience,” said Kushwaha. “Many kids feel anxious and nervous to even hear the word ‘maths’, let alone understanding the subject,” said the BSA, adding “If they use these mathematics kits while attending classes, they will participate in the lectures way more actively and will be more attentive. Using these kits can even make most of the students love the subject.” Introducing mathematics kit is an initiative that aims at turning maths, once perceived as an inveterate foe of the students, into their friend. The initiative has been rolled out in government primary and upper primary schools across the state. After the mathematics kits, education department is all set to introduce science kits as well in primary and upper primary schools across the state. Aditi Pandey, a school teacher, observed that kids were often taught to just memorize formulae and regurgitate them, leading to poor performances in the subject. “Mathematics isn’t a classy subject, and we use it everyday. The only way teachers can get primary school students closer to the subject is if we have something interesting for them to learn. Mathematics kits are the only way the different concepts of maths will always stay in the memory of kids ,“ she added. BSA, meanwhile, said these mathematics learning kits will certainly turn mathematics, a subject dreaded by many, into a fun subject for government school kids. Not only will the kits make it easy for students to grasp concepts, it will also increase their curiosity to learn more about the subject. Officials of education department were of the view that imparting knowledge to little students in such interesting ways will help them crack even the difficult questions in seconds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/now-mathematics-kits-to-make-maths-easier-and-interesting-for-kids/articleshow/83647612.cms||Kapil Dixit

On Friday, police took the accused, Vineesh Vinod (21), who hails from Muttungal, to the crime scene for evidence collection. Drishya was killed by her former schoolmate at Elamkulam near Perinthalmanna on Thursday morning after she had spurned his romantic advances. “The accused committed the crime out of sheer hatred he had for the victim and her father. He planned the crime well and we will seek his custody for a thorough probe,” said Perinthalmanna DSP Devassia KM. The accused was presented in court and remanded in judicial custody on Friday. The victim’s sister Devashree (13), was injured in the attack and is undergoing treatment. Vineesh allegedly set fire to the toy and stationery shop owned by Balachandran, Drishya’s father, at 9:45pm on Wednesday. On Friday, police recovered the footwear Vineesh had stashed in the portico on the first floor of the house as he reportedly wanted to move quietly. The mask he left behind and a lighter used to set fire to the shop were also recovered. “We recorded on video the way the accused chose to enter the house. He said that he had a knife but took another one from the kitchen thinking that his knife wasn’t sharp enough. As per his statement, he spent nearly an hour at the house. He waited in the woman’s room for a while. When she didn’t come, he came to another room where he found her. And he killed her,” said Devassia. Police said the accused walked all the way from the shop to the house of the victim and took another pair of footwear while going back. “He identified the house from where he took the footwear. The knife used for committing the crime and his mobile were seized on Thursday. He had dumped his own knife while escaping. This knife would be recovered later when we seek him in custody,” said the officer. Police believe that no one else was involved in the crime. “We will investigate whether he was instigated by someone. Probe is underway to find if he had discussed his plans with his friends,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/police-drishyas-murder-a-well-planned-crime/articleshow/83649610.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Tribal marries two girls, Adivasi elders see nothing unusual||HYDERABAD: Raising eyebrows, a tribal man married two girls — daughters of his aunts — in Ghanpur village in Utnoor mandal of Adilabad district. However, elders and relatives of the brides and bridegroom said it was not an unusual practice in the Adivasi community to get married to two women at the same time. Arjun of Ghanpur married the girls on June 14 at a ceremony which was attended by the community. Wearing traditional tribal clothes, the brides and the groom went through the marriage rituals as traditional tribal music blared. “The Adivasi tradition allows for such marriages. This, however, is the first time that marriage of a man getting married to two girls has taken place in our village. Both the girls wanted to get married to him and had no issues being wives to the same man,” a community leader said. Arjun first fell in love with Usha Rani, daughter of his father’s sister. While the love affair continued, Arjun’s interest also grew in the daughter of another aunt. The affairs reportedly went on for the last four years without both the girls having any knowledge about it. When Arjun’s parents decided to get him married, the secret tumbled out. Both the girls were ready to get married to him and there was no dilemma on the part of Arjun. “Since it was acceptable to both the girls and there was no objection from his parents and families of the girls, we went ahead with the marriage,” a community member said. Arjun has completed his BEd degree and is yet to get into a job. He is said to be preparing for competitive examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tribal-marries-2-girls-adivasi-elders-see-nothing-unusual/articleshow/83651788.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The Delhi government should adopt a sympathetic view towards the consumers and waive off electricity bills for three months. Curfew was imposed in Delhi on April 6 and then a lockdown was announced on April 19,” Bidhuri said in a statement. “People have got some relief after the unlock process was put into action but businesses remain badly affected. Overall business has been hit in the last 15 months. Traders are being asked to deposit fixed charges on electricity bills despite their shops and premises remaining closed. This is completely unjustifie,” Bidhuri said. The BJP functionary said the AAP government should send a proposal to DERC to waive off three months bills.

Intermittent rainfall with a couple of heavy thundershowers with lightning is expected for the next two days in several parts of the state including Lucknow. Weather remained pleasant due to overcast skies and drizzle all day on Friday. Some areas witnessed heavy showers, leading to waterlogging. The maximum temperature was 28.2 degrees Celsius, 10 units below normal and minimum temperature was 25.3, two notches below normal. Total 7mm rainfall was recorded from 8.30am till 5.30pm on Friday. The quantity increased at night. Monsoon is expected to provide good rainfall this year. In fact, the city has already received impressive pre-monsoon rain this year. In June, total rainfall has amounted to 117.3mm so far, which is 269% more than the normal 31.8mm for the period. Monsoon arrived in UP on June 13 but lost steam after covering east UP till Lucknow’s doorstep at Barabanki. The currents remained stalled for four days before formation of a low pressure area over southeast UP fuelled further advancement in the central, northern and southern parts of the state. State Met director JP Gupta said that conditions are favourable for further advancement of monsoon into some parts of west UP on Saturday. Dense cumulonimbus high-speed low-level cloud movement is expected during the next two days over east UP, which may cause lightning. People, particularly in rural areas, are advised to take precautions while venturing out, he added. It is for the third time in the past 15 years that monsoon has arrived on time or earlier than scheduled in the city. In 2008, it arrived on June 15 and in 2013, on June 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/monsoon-arrives-officially-expect-good-rainfall-this-yr/articleshow/83651830.cms||---

Jagpreet Singh, the headmaster of The Doon School, told TOI, “We are an ICSE-affiliated school and our board is yet to come up with its criterion for evaluating Class XII students. As for the CBSE’s objective criterion, I feel that the performance of a student in Class XII should be given more weightage than the performance in Class X and XI.” He elaborated, “The CBSE is taking three-year data to evaluate a child. According to the CBSE announcement, the performance of a student in Class X and Class XI is being given a combined weightage of 60% and the Class XII performance will have a 40% weightage. This means that the majority of the weightage is not based on a student’s performance in Class XII... A student is more career-oriented in Class XII and hence, I feel that CBSE should have given 60% weightage to Class XII performance and 40% weightage to Class XI performance. They could have avoided factoring in Class X results.” Meanwhile, Sohan Singh Majila, general secretary of the Uttarakhand Teachers' Association said, “The criteria adopted by the CBSE is a good one and it will suit students as well. Majority of the CBSE students had given their unit tests and half-yearly exams and attendance in the online classes was good since the CBSE schools are largely located in the urban areas. But the same criteria might not suit the students of the Uttarakhand Board (UBSE) since a large number of students didn't give their unit tests or half-yearly exams as many of them reside in remote areas where network connectivity is quite poor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cbses-criterion-for-evaluating-class-xii-students-draws-a-mixed-reaction-from-educationists-in-dehradun/articleshow/83647652.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Hyderabad||Telangana govt set to further relax lockdown norms||HYDERABAD: The state cabinet, which is meeting on Saturday at 2 pm, is likely to lift the lockdown during the daytime and opt for a night curfew between 9 pm and 6 am. The lockdown, which was imposed last month to control the spread of Covid-19 cases, is ending on Saturday. Apart from lockdown, the cabinet will also discuss the kharif agriculture season, lifting of water from Kaleshwaram project, hydel power generation and other issues. With the health department indicating a sharp decline in Covid-19 positive cases, the government believes that there is no need to continue the present lockdown from 6 pm to 6 am, sources said. However, the government is not in a hurry to open cinema theatres, gyms, clubs and recreational centres till this month-end. Sources said they will be allowed to resume only in July if there is no further rise in positive cases. “To speed up developmental works in districts and also boost economic activity in Hyderabad, the government will further relax the lockdown norms,” a senior official said. In the seven assembly constituencies of Sathupally, Madhira, Nalgonda, Nagarjuna Sagar, Devarakonda, Munugode and Miryalaguda where the lockdown is enforced from 2 pm to 6 am due to high incidence of positive cases, the government may relax lockdown guidelines as the positivity rate has come down. But, the government will continue Covid-19 containment measures in these segments, sources said. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who held a meeting with some ministers at Pragati Bhavan on Friday, is believed to have discussed the pandemic situation and sought their views on relaxing the lockdown measures. He also spoke about disbursement of Rythu Bandhu assistance in the districts. The CM, who announced that he would undertake surprise visits in gram panchayats and municipalities to check the works taken up under Palle Pragati and Pattana Pragati, is visiting Siddipet on June 20 and Vasalamarri village in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district on June 22. He will also review refurbishing works of Yadadri temple. “Since the agriculture season has begun and some irrigation projects have started receiving water from upstream areas and Maharashtra, lifts will be operated to release water in a week’s time,” an irrigation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-govt-set-to-further-relax-lockdown-norms/articleshow/83651845.cms||Koride Mahesh

The heavy rainfall — that lashed Dehradun on Thursday night and Friday morning — caused waterlogging in several parts of the city and its outskirts. The pace of the traffic was particularly slow on the Haridwar road due to flooding. Dhirendra Rajput, a city resident, said, “The link roads, already in need of repair, gave a hard time to commuters after the rain spell. One cannot figure out the depth of a pothole when the road is waterlogged. An error of judgement can prove fatal for commuters.” On Friday, 80 mm rainfall was recorded in Dehradun, 70 mm in Chamoli and Mukteshwar, 60 mm in Gairsain and 20 mm in Mussoorie, according to the data released by the regional meteorological centre. The Met centre has issued an orange alert of heavy-to-very heavy rainfall in Dehradun, Pauri, Tehri, Almora and Udham Singh Nagar district on June 19. Besides, thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and intense rainfall could occur at isolated places in the hills of Uttarakhand. Due to continuous rain activity, the temperature levels in both hills and plains of the state are settling at least three-to-six-degrees Celius below the normal level. For instance, the maximum temperature in Dehradun was recorded at 28.4 degrees Celsius, almost six notches below the normal level. In Mukteshwar, the maximum temperature remained at 15.9 degrees Celsius, seven notches below the normal level. According to Rohit Thapliyal, senior scientist at the regional meteorological centre, the temperature levels will continue to settle below the normal level in Uttarakhand for the next couple of days. He further added that the weather will start improving from June 20. Meanwhile, with water levels in the Ganga at Haridwar rising due to the rains, the ghats were cleared by the police as a precautionary measure late on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/heavy-rainfall-lashes-uttarakhand-met-warns-of-more-rain-spells-in-next-24-hours/articleshow/83647683.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Dr Ajay Khanna, secretary, IMA, said the protest was successful and doctors took part by wearing black badges and ribbons. “It is sad that when we are on the frontline against the pandemic, instances of violence against doctors - like the one in Bihar, West Bengal, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh - are taking place. We wanted professional protection for a long time and it is high time that the government ensures it,” said Khanna. The IMA secretary also demanded the implementation of “Central Hospital and Health Care Professionals Protection Act with IPC and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), standardisation and augmentation of security in each hospital and declaring hospitals as protected zones". On Ramdev's remarks, the IMA said they are exploring legal recourse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ima-stages-statewide-stir-against-ramdevs-remark/articleshow/83647671.cms||Ishita Mishra

One bidder, Genesys Biological Pvt Ltd, claimed it had procured 30 million single shot Sputnik V vaccine and can supply on receipt of pay order. All 11 bids received were scrapped after they failed to submit documents connecting them with the manufacturer. Somaiya said even a charitable organisation like the Avada Foundation filed bids offering to supply Johnson & Johnson vaccines. “Many of these companies are on paper with no experience of export-import or manufacturing of vaccines,” he said. “The municipal commissioner did not seem inclined to file an FIR and, therefore, I shall be submitting a complaint to the Mumbai police commissioner on Monday to file an FIR in the matter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-not-all-vax-bidders-were-genuine-file-fir-says-somaiya/articleshow/83653997.cms||Clara Lewis

Hearing a public interest litigation filed by Nadeem Ahmad and others, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Yadav and Justice Prakash Padia directed listing of the case for the next hearing on July 26 as documents related to formation of the Trust were not placed by petitioners. “Documents based on which petitioners seek quashing of formation of the Trust have not been filed and it is not possible to appreciate and adjudicate the matter without these. Unless petitioners supply relevant papers and documents, relief sought cannot be accepted. But in the interest of justice, petitioners are being granted four weeks to file necessary papers. In case, documents are not filed within the period, the petition shall stand dismissed without further reference to court.” Talking to TOI, IICF secretary Athar Husain, said, “The question of validity of the mosque Trust has already been examined by the Supreme Court and the matter settled in the December 4, 2020, judgment when the court dismissed a petition challenging the validity of the Trust. Moreover, we have not received any notice from the high court about the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pil-seeks-quashing-of-iicf-court-gives-4-wks-to-file-docus/articleshow/83651872.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

While Karan Mahra and Qazi Nizamuddin are being seen as the frontrunners for the post of leader of opposition, insiders say that state chief Pritam Singh may also be given the position based on his substantial experience. The position of the leader of opposition fell vacant after the recent demise of veteran Congress leader Indira Hridayesh. To balance caste equations, the party is likely to select a senior Brahmin leader from Kumaon as its new state chief. Sources say that party leaders like Manoj Tiwari, Prakash Joshi and Mathura Dutt Joshi are being considered for the post. From Garhwal, senior Brahmin leaders like Ganesh Godiyal, ex-MLA from Thalisain, and Kishore Upadhyay, former state chief, are also being considered frontrunners for Congress state chief post. Congress state in-charge Devender Yadav told TOI, “The demise of Indira Hridayeshji has left us in a state of shock. We are working on several issues, which are being discussed with the national leadership and senior members of the state unit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/major-changes-likely-in-uttarakhand-unit-of-congress/articleshow/83647693.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Dehradun||Rainfall hits road connectivity in Kumaon, electric supply disrupted, rivers in spate||ALMORA/PITHORAGARH: Continuous rain spells and subsequent landslides for the last two days have caused damage to motorable roads and disrupted electricity supply in several villages and towns of Kumaon region. In Bageshwar, vehicular movement was suspended on 18 rural roads after rainfall led to issues like waterlogging, road damage and felling of trees. The Kausani road also remained shut for traffic for three hours on Friday. In some areas, the electric poles also suffered damage, leading to a disruption in power supply across the district. A shop owner in Malta village of the district had a narrow escape after a pine tree fell on his shop. The water level of Gomti and Saryu rivers in the district rose to the danger mark due to the downpour. The district administration has issued an alert for the people living along the banks of these rivers. The locals of Almora also faced inconvenience as seven roads, including the Almora-Pithoragarh national highway, were closed for traffic after the district received 66 mm rainfall on Friday morning. District's Someshwar village has been receiving incessant rainfall since Thursday. Meanwhile, Pithoragarh remained disconnected with Nainital and Almora for the fourth day in continuation due to landslides, triggered by heavy rainfall, at many places on the all-weather Road. To reach Pithoragarh, Almora residents are taking the Berinag road, which extends the journey by 90-km. Consequently, the supply of daily essentials like milk and vegetables to Pithoragarh has been hit. Mohammad Salim, a vegetable wholesaler, said, “It’s taking us a long time to get the vegetables using the longer route. The price of vegetables has also gone up due to the rise in transportation cost.” Besides, the Tawaghat-Lipulekh road, also known as the Kailash Mansarovar route has remained closed at Shantivan for the last 10 days as a result of which, the villages of Byas Valley have been isolated. Similarly, the Pithoragarh-Tanakpur road — that was closed at Chupkot, Delli Band and Ghat on Tuesday — remained closed for traffic on Friday as well. The National Highways Authority of India personnel are clearing the stretch, said Bhupendra Singh Mahar, district disaster management officer of Pithoragarh. Due to continuous rain spells, the Kali river in the district had also swollen up and the water level in the river crossed the danger mark at Jauljibi. “We have asked the authorities concerned to vacate the area along the river,” added Mahar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rainfall-hits-road-connectivity-in-kumaon-electric-supply-disrupted-rivers-in-spate/articleshow/83647706.cms||Prem Punetha

Around 100 such subject experts are guiding over 15,000 students of different departments in which teachers have retired or passed away, or in departments that do not have any sanctioned permanent posts. The payment of subject experts has been increased by 40-60% from the next academic session. The move will not only help the university to meet the teachers’ shortage but will also ensure that in departments where teachers have retired, experts take classes so that the quality of teaching is not compromised. “We have subject experts mostly in arts and commerce faculty. In science, we take a professor of eminence under the University Grants Commission scheme. These are retired teachers of our own science departments who continue to teach even after retirement,” said LU vice-chancellor Prof Alok Kumar Rai. He added that amid the Covid-19 pandemic, when those not in full-time professions were hit financially, specialists in subjects should be supported with respectable honorarium. Rai said that the payment had been increased for three reasons. First, to ensure that a decent amount is paid to teachers so they remain motivated and to attract new talents. “Second, we have excellent subject experts at present who have been teaching sincerely over the years but their payment has not been increased. Lastly, it was to bring about uniformity as earlier, payment in every subject was different,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-gives-40-60-payment-hike-to-guest-faculty-in-ug-pg-courses/articleshow/83651959.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority to hire repair agencies as EM Bypass potholes return||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) plans to engage an agency for repair, restoration and annual maintenance of the road surface of EM Bypass, following damage caused by utility service providers. It took only a couple of heavy spells of rain for craters to spring up on several stretches. A stretch of Park Circus connector off EM Bypass near Science City was waterlogged following the overnight rain on Thursday. Officials said that it was a routine policy to engage an agency on an yearly basis. “Different utility service providers dug up portions of the road for urgent work. The agency will be responsible for repairing and restoring the potholed stretches as well as maintaining them,” said a KMDA official. EM Bypass stretches in between under-construction Metro stations turn unmotorable following heavy showers every year. Potholes, the size of craters, make it virtually impossible for commute and have even led to deaths of multiple bikers.  Explaining the recurring problem, a KMDA engineer said, “The sub base of the road surface at these places have become weak due to pressure created by concrete slabs put there, with barricades placed to divert lanes and additional vehicular load. This creates an undulation on the surface, leading to the bituminous surface to crack and create the potholes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmda-to-hire-repair-agencies-as-em-bypass-potholes-return/articleshow/83649612.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘CBI wants to make backdoor entry for Rashmi Shukla case papers’||MUMBAI: Maharashtra government on Friday contended before Bombay high court that the CBI “blatantly” sought a “backdoor entry” to investigate and seek documents on former commissioner (SID) Rashmi Shukla’s phone-tap report on police transfers and suspended API Sachin Waze’s reinstatement when neither formed part of its preliminary enquiry. The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar adjourned the matter to Monday for hearing. Continuing a relief to the state, CBI’s counsel, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, extended assurance that it would not seek the Shukla report or other documents from the police establishment till Tuesday. Senior counsel Rafique Dada on behalf of the state sought orders to quash two paragraphs from the CBI’s FIR against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh in a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act. He said the CBI had “overreached’’ the HC order of April 5, directing the preliminary enquiry, not in a PIL filed by ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh, but in a petition for probe filed by a city advocate, Jaishri Patil. The state, through its counsel, submitted it was not against a probe by the CBI, but only against its “mala fide intentions…and colourful exercise of power” in trying to investigate something the HC had clearly kept out of its reach. Dada invoked several judgments on the point of the federal structure of the government and said the CBI cannot seek to investigate the state’s administration. Advocate Subhash Jha, appearing for an intervenor in submissions after Dada, said the state’s petition is unprecedented and frivolous and should be dismissed with exemplary costs. He too cited judgements to argue that CBI cannot be told how to investigate its FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-wants-to-make-backdoor-entry-for-shukla-case-papers/articleshow/83654071.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||As wired education becomes the norm, IIT-IISc platform is a mega hit||MUMBAI: If any evidence was needed to show how wired education has gathered pace since the pandemic set in, here it is. NPTEL (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning), India’s largest and free open online programme provider, has seen enrolment almost double to over 41 lakh students in 2020 when compared to 2018. Online learning platform Coursera added 6.8 lakh new learners in the first quarter of 2021, taking the cumulative numbers from the country to 1.1 crore. edX saw 17 lakh more Indians joining from January 2020, expanding its desi learner base to 40 lakh. Globally, too, people were clocking over 1 million hours per week on LinkedIn Learning in the first quarter of 2021—80% higher than during the same time last year (no India specific data available). Online learning has only grown stronger in India, with millions of learners logging into classrooms streamed from around the world. Powered by the academic might of all seven IITs and IISc, NPTEL now is the leader with a cumulative base of over 1.4 crore learners. But under the structure that this provider follows, where online learning ends with in-person exams, NPTEL is the world leader. Tamil Nadu has the most learners, followed by Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. For edX, the top five Indian states with the largest enrolment are Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Interestingly, the second largest cohort of learners on NPTEL after students are faculty members, followed by working professionals. “Most students on NPTEL are there under the credit transfer scheme. Students greatly enjoy the variety of courses they can access and get credits for. Second, BTech honours has been implemented by many universities and they are using NPTEL courses to enable this,” said Prathap Haridoss, national coordinator, NPTEL. This year, NPTEL started “domain certification”, which is like a minor programme where students get extra recognition for picking a selection of core and elective courses in a specific stream. Last year, by the end of the first semester in July 2020, a total of 1.03 lakh students, largely from engineering colleges. (HANGING HERE) Amit Goyal, country head, edX, said: “edX saw a major uptake from corporates who added ‘learn from home’ to just ‘work from home’ for their workforce L&D (learning and development); academia also realised the true power of blended learning and 800-plus colleges in India joined our edX Campus program to blend edX certifications in their degree curriculum.” Irrespective of the platforms, Python programming courses are the most popular in India in contrast with courses on soft skills and English picking pace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/as-wired-edu-becomes-the-norm-iit-iisc-platform-is-a-mega-hit/articleshow/83677994.cms||Hemali Chhapia

In its order dated June 16, UPHRC said RMLIMS conducted a superficial inquiry into the issues raised by the commission and added that a high-level probe should be carried out and a report be submitted within two weeks. TOI has a copy of the order. “We took suo motu cognisance of a news report which said five patients died of oxygen shortage at RMLIMS. The institute was asked to set up a high-level inquiry into it and identify what caused the deaths – whether the negligence was on the part of supplier or the staff or the deaths were due to the critical condition of patients. However, in contempt of the commission’s directives, RMLIMS did not set up a committee or furnish adequate reply,” OP Dixit, a member of the commission, told TOI. Dixit said RMLIMS submitted a letter on April 17 which said the matter was probed and a report was received the same day. “This is highly unbelievable. Moreover, there is no clarity in the letter dated April 17 and no responsibility has been fixed on anyone,” he said. “We will send a pointwise reply to the commission answering all questions. Even in April, we sent a prompt report in just one day,” said RMLIMS spokesperson Dr Shrikesh Singh. The commission’s order passed on June 16 was also signed by its member, Justice KP Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rights-panel-raps-rmlims-seeks-2nd-inquiry-into-deaths/articleshow/83652019.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cops look for doctor who sourced vaccines for fraudsters||MUMBAI: A school dropout has turned out to be the mastermind of the fraudulent vaccination camp at Kandivali's Hiranandani Heritage society. Mahendra Singh, 39, used to be a clerk with the Malad Medical Association for over a decade. Between Thursday night and Friday, the police arrested Singh along with three others for conducting fraudulent camps at nine locations in Mumbai. While the big question as to whether the vaccine was spurious or not has not been resolved, police believe the vials could have been adulterated as their seals were broken. “The vaccines were not procured from any authorised source which prompted us to register an FIR,” said additional commissioner Dilip Sawant. "The organisers did not inform the BMC which is mandatory. Not a single doctor was present at the site nor were any arrangements made for attending to adverse effects, if any, arising out of the inoculation,” he added. Besides Singh, police have arrested Sanjay Gupta, 29, whose role was to remain present on site and make arrangements for the camp. Gupta would collect money from vaccine beneficiaries and hand them over to Singh. Police have seized a sum of Rs 9 lakh from Singh's account. Two employees of private hospitals, Chandan Singh alias Lalit and Nitin Mode, both 32, have also been held. The duo used hospital ID-passwords without authorization to log in to the Co-Win platform. "The vaccines were ferried to the site by Qareem Akbar Ali, 21, who has been detained from a railway station in Madhya Pradesh while he was trying to flee to his hometown," said senior inspector Babasaheb Salunke. The police are still in the dark about where the vaccines were sourced from. They are looking for a doctor that the gang had tied up with for sourcing vaccines. Besides the doctor, the police are yet to arrest Rajesh Pandey, an ex employee of Kokilaben Ambani Hospital who would refer citizens to Singh for vaccination. At the Hiranandani Heritage society camp on May 30, nursing students were hired from a nursing college in Charkop for administering the jabs. The students are being quizzed. “Vaccination certificates generated via CoWin mentioned incorrect dates, timings and locations of inoculation. We are considering them as forged documents for our investigation,” said an officer. Mahendra Singh had been removed from the Malad Medical Association, a 57-year-old organization with 1,600 members. “His attendance was very erratic of late,’’ said Dr Anil Suchak, former president of the association. Singh would earn between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000 a month. He pulled off most of the fraudulent vaccine camps in the May-June period. As the association held regular conferences and weekly meetings at his hall in Malad, Singh had ample opportunity to bond with doctors and sales and marketing personnel of various companies and hospitals. “We were aware he would take on assignments with individual doctors or associations, including the Indian Medical Association. He knew what was needed to organize medical conferences,’’ said a senior doctor. The outdoor assignments became so many that he had little time for association, prompting them to ask him to leave. BMC's R/Central Ward Office has initiated an inquiry into a vaccination camp at Borivali's Aditya College which was organised on June 3 by the same group that carried out the Hiranandani camp. Around 213 people, including college staff, were vaccinated. "The BMC was not informed about the camp at Aditya College. The beneficiaries were charged over Rs 1000 each when the guidelines say they cannot be charged over Rs 750," said Ward Officer Bhagyashree Kapse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-looking-for-doc-fraudsters-tied-up-with-to-source-vaccines/articleshow/83651999.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Mumbai||Open space in Juhu encroached by developer despite SC order||MUMBAI: A plot in Mumbai whose open space status has been endorsed by none less than the Supreme Court is not safe from encroachment. Ten days ago, banners came up on the gate of a prime MHADA open space at JVPD Scheme, claiming the plot was owned by a developer. It was only last year that the Supreme Court, in a landmark judgement, upheld a citizens’ plea that plots 3 & 6 in JVPD scheme were open spaces and no construction could be allowed on them. It was a 10-year battle fought by local residents, which finally went in favour of MHADA. The banner, which read ‘The property is in possession of Abdul Razzak Khokar and is being consulted by Umra Developers’, was first seen on June 4 by local residents out on their morning walks. These residents raised an alarm about the open space being taken over by a builder. Times ViewThe story of Plot No. 6 JVPD scheme is an inspiring story of a10-year-long citizens’ movement to reclaim an open space. The hoisting of fresh banners by land sharks to grab the plot shows citizens can never let their vigil down. It is also an indictment of MHADA, a public authority that owns over 2,000 hectares across Mumbai, which shows no inclination to protect its own land, especially open spaces. The government must ensure that MHADA discharges its responsibility towards the city by protecting its land from encroachments.Gulmohur Residents’ Welfare Association immediately informed MHADA of the criminal trespass on its property and filed a complaint with Juhu police. “MHADA pulled down the banners but the police simply did not react to our complaint,” said Ashoke Pandit, a local resident and founder of the NGO, Save Open Spaces. Architect P K Das, who along with Pandit was one of three petitioners, said, “It is MHADA’s responsibility to protect its property, especially open spaces which are most vulnerable to encroachment. This open space in particular has been neglected by MHADA. Citizens have won the open space back after a long battle going right up to the Supreme Court. MHADA officials had struck deals with builders to develop this community plot.” Following the SC order, local BJP MLA Ameet Satam had submitted a beautification plan four months ago for the two vacant plots, which residents see as vital to their health and well-being. “The design, which residents submitted to me, consists of a walking track, a children’s play area and seating arrangements. I plan to start the work from tomorrow (June 16) so that the place is quickly spruced up and handed over to the residents. I shall also be placing security guards here so that there is no trespassing,” said Satam. Housing minister Jitendra Awhad said security guards would be deployed outside the open space. “Any executive engineer found to be working with land sharks will be punished. We shall also put boards on all open spaces owned by MHADA in all layouts informing citizens about MHADA’s ownership,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-open-space-in-juhu-encroached-by-developer-despite-sc-order/articleshow/83652057.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Lucknow||Lecturers’ posting orders to be made available online||Lucknow: Promoting digitisation in higher education, for the first time, UP government will make all posting orders of newly appointed lecturers in government degree colleges available online from June 21. In the ongoing recruitment process, over 200 candidates have been selected by the UP Public Service Commission. The candidates had to choose their college online in order of preference. Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, who also has the higher education portfolio, said the online recruitment process will ensure purity and transparency in appointments. “The candidates will be allotted colleges online. The posting orders will be uploaded on the online portal from where the candidates can download them before joining,” Sharma said. According to additional chief secretary higher education Monika S Garg, with no human interference, for the first time, appointments will be done totally on the basis of merit. “Candidates will not have to run for posting orders. They can join after police verification and medical certification has been completed by the college principal,” Garg said. With everything from list of vacancies to posting orders going online, the government has done away with ambiguity and opacity in appointments of teachers in government colleges, said Garg. In the first phase, appointments of lecturers in 14 subjects—psychology, military sciences, sociology, geography, ancient history, Urdu, philosophy, Sanskrit, music, mathematics, history, education, political science and anthropology—will be done. In the second phase, appointments for the remaining nine subjects of English, Hindi, economics, chemistry, physics, biology, commerce, home science and BEd will be held next week with posting orders available by June end. Earlier, the department had taken the initiative of developing e-learning parks in government colleges and providing pre-loaded tablets to state-run colleges. In addition, the department is mulling to develop e-suvidha kendras to bridge the digital divide in universities and colleges. The kendras to be developed on PPP model will help students access e-content.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lecturers-posting-orders-to-be-made-available-online/articleshow/83652052.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The hospital has started off with 15 Covid beds, with private cabin facility, availability of oxygen, doctors on visit, 24x7 resident medical officers (RMOs), nurses and support staff. Founded in 1960, the facility’s daily operations are being run by Hope Foundation. “The hospital has had a long association with the city ever since it was inaugurated by the then community leader, the 51st al Dai al Mutlaq Syedna Taher Saifuddin. As a charitable institution run by the Dawoodi Bohra community, it aims at providing extensive healthcare services to not only members of the community, but everyone, irrespective of their social or religious identity,” said Abdulqadir Vadnagarwala, a Rehmatbai Hospital trustee. Vadnagarwala added, “The hospital became a reliable institution during the period of the 52nd leader, Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin. But operations stopped in the last few years and the revival plan began to take shape in 2016. It is now being undertaken as part of the Project Rise initiative, which is the community’s global philanthropic arm. The hospital is planning to recommence operations in phases and scale it up into a fully functional facility again.” The Dawoodi Bohra community, under the guidance of their 53rd leader, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, continues the effort to extend help to those affected by the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dawoodi-bohra-hosp-turns-into-covid-care-facility/articleshow/83649643.cms||---

The Nasr School is holding a free vaccination drive till June 18 for drivers, cleaners, maids or anyone who fall under the high risk group in association with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). “We are conducting a special vaccination drive for all those underprivileged people who cannot afford Rs 1,000 jab. They can come, register on the spot and get themselves inoculated. The idea is to help more and more people who cannot afford it but fall in the high risk category,” said Mir Mohammed, principal, Nasr School, Khairtabad. Close to 2,000 people are expected to be vaccinated at the school by the end of the drive on Friday. A similar drive is being held at Oakridge International School where they also vaccinated foreign-bound students. “The vaccination drive is not only for the teachers, in-house staff members and their families but also for students who are travelling abroad for higher education. We have tied up with a private hospital which is now conducting the drive even for others. People can register on CoWin, walk in to Gachibowli campus and get the shot on a daily basis,” said Hema C, principal of Oakridge International School. Similarly, Silver Oaks International School has opened its doors to conduct a vaccination drive. “We may never get back into the world that we knew, but it is going to be the power of our collective effort to immunise that will help us bring back the goodness. Hence, Silver Oaks has taken up the social responsibility and urges all the citizens to get vaccinated,” said Seetha Murthy, director of education at Silver Oaks International School.

The bail applications were filed in April by V Madhu (valiya Madhu), first accused in the case, a native of Kallangad, Walayar, and second accused Shibu, a native of Rajakkad, Idukki. CBI, which had taken over the investigation of the case on the high court’s order in April 2021, filed an affidavit in the Palakkad First additional sessions court (Pocso court) opposing the bail applications filed by these two accused in the case now in remand. CBI told the court that if bail is granted there are chances of the probe getting sabotaged and the mother of the girls getting killed. Last month, the CBI team led by Nandakumaran Nair, superintendent of police, Thiruvananthapuram unit, had collected details of the case from the mother and visited the spot where the girls were found hanging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pocso-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-accused/articleshow/83649661.cms||---

The victims were identified as BJP youth wing worker Pankaj Nihalwani (29), a resident of Sindhi Colony near Bani Park, Sumit Dayal (29), a resident of Prem Nagar near Ajmer Road, and Gaurav Verma (30), a resident of Patel Marg in Jhotwara and owner of a C-Scheme cafe. Their friend Kirti Swami sustained severe injuries and is undergoing treatment at the SMS Hospital. The accident took place at about 12.30am on Friday when all the four were heading towards Ajmer Road and their speeding car rammed into an 18-axle truck. The accident happened about 100 metres away from Bhankrota police station, near a slight turn on the intersection. The car’s speedometer showed 120km per hour when it was towed to the police station. Police could not confirm where the four were going when the accident took place, but friends and family members of the victims told TOI that at least two of the friends used to observe fast on Thursday. It is likely that they were going to some highway eatery. “Our team had arrived at the spot as soon as we learned about the accident. The car had hit the trailer truck near Bhankrota chouraha. The car got entangled in the rear of the truck and was dragged for about 500 metres,” said Bhankrota SHO Mukesh Choudhary. The trailer truck was seized by the police. The car had turned into a mangled heap of metal following the accident. The airbags could not save Pankaj who was in the driving seat. He was killed on the spot along with Sumit. Gaurav was writhing in pain when he was taken to the hospital where he later succumbed to injuries. “All four of them were good friends. They had studied engineering at a local college in Jaipur,” said Pankaj’s friend Arpit Sharma. Senior BJP leader Arun Chaturvedi, who had arrived at the SMS mortuary on Friday morning, said Pankaj was a dedicated member of the party and helped a lot of people during the lockdown. Gaurav’s uncle Vimal told TOI that he received the information at about 5am. “I rushed to the hospital where I was informed about his (Gaurav) demise. All through the night my family was calling on his mobile phone, but he did not answer,” he said, adding that no one t ld them an accident had taken place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/3-friends-killed-1-hurt-as-car-rams-into-truck-on-bhankrota-road/articleshow/83652094.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan urges participation of all in mega vaccination drive||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Friday that there is no work as noble as getting the corona vaccine yourself and motivating others to get the vaccine. Vaccines give us protection from corona. If all the people of 18+ in the state get the vaccine, then even if the third wave comes, its effect will be minimal. Chouhan said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while appreciating the work of corona control and vaccination in Madhya Pradesh, has assured that Madhya Pradesh will continue to get adequate number of vaccine doses. So, do the vaccination as fast as you can, he said. Chouhan said that a target of vaccinating 10 lakh people has been set in the state on June 21. Efforts will be made in future also that approximately the same dosages should be taken in the state every day. With this speed, we will complete cent percent vaccination work of 18+ people in the state by October-November. The chief minister was presiding over a coronavirus review meeting through video conferencing at Mantralaya. Medical education minister Vishwas Sarang, chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains, additional chief secretary, health, Mohammad Suleman and others concerned were present in the meeting. Chouhan said that all the in-charge ministers should appeal to the public to get the vaccination done in their respective districts and try that maximum 18+ people should get their vaccination done and also motivate others. He said everyone in the government should remain alert towards corona every day, do maximum testing, and make all your preparations. A complete arrangement of oxygen, ICU beds, children wards, children ICU and medicines etc. should be maintained. The weekly positivity rate of all the 52 districts of the state has come down to less than 1%. 5 or more new cases have come in only 4 districts of the state. There is no new case of corona in 23 districts of the state. Bhind and Burhanpur districts of the state have become coronafree. MP ranks 29th in terms of coronavirus cases among states and union territories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cm-urges-participation-of-all-in-mega-vaccination-drive/articleshow/83649649.cms||---
---||Jaipur||No hallmarking for Rajasthan’s Kundan Meena jewellery||JAIPUR: The state's signature Kundan Meena jewellery has been kept out of the ambit of mandatory hallmarking, the guidelines for which were issued by the Centre on Wednesday, even as the new norms remain silent on antique jewellery in which the purity of gold plays a lesser role in the determination of price. The Centre had issued the guidelines for hallmarking gold jewellery and artefacts to ensure assured quality for consumers. Instead of rolling it out across the country, now hallmarking will be mandatory in 56 districts which have assaying and hallmarking (A&H) centres. In Rajasthan, hallmarking has been made mandatory in 18 districts. For consumers, hallmarking assures that they are not shortchanged and get quality product. Kailash Mittal, president of Jaipur Sarafa Traders Association, said, “Hallmarking will improve the confidence of people in investing in gold or jewellery. This will also benefit the trade. So, it is a win-win situation for both.” When it comes to people wanting to sell their household jewellery, they are not required to get them hallmarked. However, Rajiv Jain, former chairman of the Gold and Jewellery Exports Council, said that the guidelines were silent on antique jewellery. “A committee has been formed to further advise the government on remaining issues. So, we expect a decision on antique jewellery as well. Antique jewellery cannot be melted and made into a different product,” he said. The Centre has considered the case of Kundan Meena and Polki jewellery and put them outside the mandatory hallmarking requirement, he said. “Rajasthan enjoys a special identity for the centuries-old art of Kundan Meena jewellery. These products have increased the brand equity of the city as a hub for jewellery. Gold with multiple carats are used in Kundan Meena jewellery. That’s why it is difficult to hallmark it and the Centre has considered it before keeping it outside the hallmark ambit,” said Jain. He pointed to some jewellery products where hallmarking was difficult. He cited the example of Thewa art of jewellery making which involves fusing intricately woven sheet gold on molten glass. It evolved in Pratapgarh district and its origin dates back to the Mughal age. “It’s so thin that it would be hard to get it hallmarked. There are other designs and art forms for which the hallmarking norms would be a challenge. But the rules will also evolve as new issues crop up. But it’s a good move to have hallmarking," he said. Some said that hallmarking would leave a trail of transaction which can be tracked for tax purposes or income disclosure by income tax authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-hallmarking-for-rajs-kundan-meena-jewellery/articleshow/83652173.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Bopal-Ghuma residents, brace for steeper taxes||AHMEDABAD: Residents of Bopal-Ghuma should now brace for higher property taxes — almost two-and-a-half times what they paid so far. From Monday, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) property assessing teams will come with measuring tapes to your homes and shops to ascertain the area of your properties. Right now, 40,000-odd residents of the area are cumulatively paying Rs 5 crore in tax. After the AMC begins collecting tax, they expect revenue to go up to Rs 15 crore. For instance, Vipul Parekh, a resident of South Bopal who owns a 170-sqm bungalow now pays Rs 900 in tax annually. After the AMC’s tax metric is imposed, Parekh will have to shell out Rs 3,046, inclusive of conservancy tax. After being brought within AMC limits last year, the area will now be taxed under the new carpet area-based property tax system. Last year, Bopal and Ghuma nagarpalikas had issued property tax slips to almost all residents and hence the AMC had to postpone property assessment to 2021. There are close to 40,000 properties in the Bopal-Ghuma area. “The property tax system existing in Bopal-Ghuma is quite arbitrary. For instance, apartments which came up over past 4 years are paying based on carpet area while other properties are paying a flat charge according to the old blanket assessment system,” said a senior South West Zone tax assessor. Most Bopal and Ghuma areas will be in the ‘C’ category of the municipal tax system, where the land jantri value is between Rs 7,000 and Rs 15,000, except for South Bopal which will be under the ‘B’ category. The AMC plans to deploy 10 teams with 3-4 assessors in each. The teams will have to assess up to 35 properties a day. “The process will take about 80 days unless a third wave of Covid hinders the drive,” said a senior AMC official. The AMC had recently completed assessment of newly acquired areas of Nana Chiloda and Kathwada, where about 12,000 properties were assessed and issued bills last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bopal-ghuma-residents-brace-for-steeper-taxes/articleshow/83649709.cms||---

The illegal enclosure—made with with metal girders, net enclosure and cement sheet roof—was erected by Panchsheel Pratishthan Trust promoted by BJP MLC Bhai Girkar. In 2018, Girkar was granted permission by the suburban collector to build a public gymnasium on the recreation ground with his MLC funds. His trust was the only one that applied to take up the maintenance of the ground, along with the gymnasium, and was granted permission by the collector’s office with conditions. The same year, Girkar submitted a written application to Mhada to erect an enclosed turf on the ground. It was rejected in 2019, but the turf still came up. Subsequently, activist Reji Abraham filed a complaint with the suburban collector, Mhada and police. On June 16, Mhada issued a 24-hour demolition notice to the trust.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Junior colleges get ready for internal marking, chase students for projects||MUMBAI: While the marking process for HSC is awaited, junior colleges have started asking students to turn in their internal projects and assignments. With the CBSE giving weightage to Class X marks along with Class XI and XII scores, colleges feel the state may follow a similar methodology. Most colleges have conducted one or more online tests and preliminary exams for Class XII students. They are now asking students to submit their internal projects and assignments. Colleges have also begun tabulating the Class XI marks of HSC students. “The Class XI and XII marks are ready. We are chasing students who are behind schedule to submit their projects,” said a lecturer from a Malad college. All Class XII students registered for HSC exams are to be promoted, but colleges are in a dilemma about students whose scores are poor despite grace marks. “We are getting them to submit additional projects and assignments that can be used to enhance their scores,” said a lecturer. Colleges are facing issues with students who have not attended lectures or attempted a single exam or project. “There are students who had registered for the HSC exam but were absent during the entire academic year. We are making such students do several projects to so that they can at least get the passing score,” said a Wadala college professor. Class XII students, especially those from the science faculty, are anxious about how they will be evaluated for practical exams of 20 marks in each subject. State education officials are likely to meet on Saturday to discuss the marking formula. While Class XI and XII marks will be considered to assess HSC students, incorporating Class X scores will be discussed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-junior-colleges-get-ready-for-internal-marking-chase-students-for-projects/articleshow/83652158.cms||Sandhya Nair

However, the citizens’ accounts continue to be operational, and the contentious posts too have been left untouched for now. Twitter did not disclose to the 18-odd citizens who flagged the tweets, and what Indian laws have been violated. On May 22, 2021, citizens across the state supported the Vainguinim valley residents’ association (VVRA) in its fight against the wall. They posted tweets with hashtags #SaveVainguinimBeach #HandsOffOurSand and #WallontheBeach. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, local MLA Jennifer Monserrate and tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar were among those tagged in the posts. “We will be writing to Twitter and asking them which Indian laws have been violated by our tweets, and who had reported the tweets,” said Aakash Madgavkar, one of the citizens who received the notice. “The main intention of this citizens’ movement is creating awareness about this illegal wall constructed on a public beach, and we want the authorities to take action and demolish this wall and restore the beach before there is any further damage,” he said. Citizens said Twitter had clarified in the email to them that the tweets were not a subject of a legal dispute yet, and that the correspondence was only to inform the citizens of the complaint. “We believe that someone has complained, so Twitter has sent us the notices, but it is not clear yet whether the government or the hotel had reported the tweets,” said one of the citizens who received the notice from Twitter. “Out of our freedom to express ourselves, we want to know who has filed the official complaint. We have consulted the internet freedom movement and legal persons, they have gone through the tweets and not found anything wrong,” the citizen said. A complaint from the VVRA is currently being heard by the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority. While the hotel claims it has permissions for construction of the wall to prevent sand erosion, citizens allege that the structure is being constructed illegally, causing ecological damage to a public beach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citizens-get-twitter-notice-for-posts-against-vainguinim-beach-wall/articleshow/83652138.cms||---

To be released by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the book will be the first-ever document on such trees in the state which are more than a hundred years’ old and have historical, religious or mythological significance. The book has been compiled by the UP State Biodiversity Board and contains details of 951 heritage trees. In March, the board had declared 943 heritage trees in UP and about 130 were shortlisted for inclusion in the book. Later, details of at least eight more trees were verified and they were notified as heritage trees. “A banyan tree in Lucknow’s NBRI has a connection with the First War of Independence in 1857. It is said that Uda Devi, a freedom-fighter, fired at the British from atop the tree. It has also been recently added to the list of the trees which will find place in the book,” said an official in the Board. A tree from Ghaziabad’s Mahamaya temple on which at least 131 revolutionaries were hanged will also be a part of the book. “The list will keep on growing because there might still be a few trees that we have missed out on because UP is a big state. Once the book is printed there would be awareness on heritage trees and more entries would come,” another official said. The state government would conserve heritage trees by developing them into eco-tourism sites. The route map of all the trees would be printed by the board to help researchers and nature enthusiasts reach them. The government order to identify heritage trees was issued in November 2019. Heritage trees are the ones that exist on community land and public land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-may-release-coffee-table-book-on-ups-heritage-trees/articleshow/83652133.cms||---

Board chairman Bhagirath Shetye said that Goa is set to be the first state board to announce its policy for Class XII evaluation, as its formula is in the final stages of being vetted. “Our policy will be out within the next three days. It will be the first state board policy for Class XII students to be declared,” he said. We are in the final stages of finalizing the policy. Now that the CBSE formula has come, we will go through it too,” said Shetye. The state board had called for suggestions from the public on the methods to be adopted to tabulate Class XII marks for the 2021 batch, following cancellation of the public examinations. Shetye said that 52 suggestions in all have been received by the board. “We have received 52 suggestions in all from parents, educationists, students and a few from schools and organisations like GCCI. While some individuals have simply said that all students should be promoted, others have provided more detailed inputs,” said Shetye. Following the announcement of cancellation of the Class XII Goa Board exams, the board has held a series of brainstorming sessions with its various internal bodies over the last one-and-a-half week. Like the CBSE and the Goa Board’s policy released for Class X students, the formula for Class XII is also expected to give students an opportunity to appear for an exam if they are unhappy with their marks. While Class XII internal marks are likely to be given weightage, it is to be seen how much weightage is allotted to students’ performance during the previous academic years like Class X, XII, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-class-xii-in-3-days-board-gets-52-suggestions/articleshow/83652178.cms||---

The beneficiaries will get Covishield dose. The state government has directed all civic authorities to begin free of cost inoculation of those in 30-plus age group at vaccination centres being operated in government and civic body-run hospitals. Accordingly, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and CEO of zilla parishad Yogesh Kumbhejkar have issued orders to this effect on Friday. The Centre had allowed vaccination of 18-44 age group from May 1, but put the responsibility of procuring vaccine from manufacturers on the states. Maharashtra government had commenced vaccination of this age group on May 1 with limited centres, but stopped it on May 12 citing vaccine shortage. Now, vaccination of 30-44 age group will resume from Saturday. The state is likely to also resume inoculation of those in 18-29 group in coming days. A few days ago, the Centre had announced resumption of free vaccination of 18-44 age group from June 21. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari and Radhakrishnan B have urged eligible people to take the jab. “Beneficiaries will have to register and book appointment online. We will not allow on-spot registration and appointment. It is in the larger interest of the beneficiaries and city. Beneficiaries should come to the centre only after taking appointment and not crowd otherwise,” said Radhakrishnan. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said vaccination of 30-44 age group will start at 81 centres. The civic body is operating 98 centres. Inoculation of 30-44 group will not be allowed at three centres administering Covaxin — Mahal Diagnostic Centre, Khobragade Hall in Siddharth Nagar and GMCH. The ZP is running 114 centres. Inoculation of 30-44 group will begin at 66 centres under the ZP of which 53 are public health centres (PHCs) and 13 rural hospitals. Ironically, the NMC and ZP did not update the information on Co-Win and appointments were yet to start till Friday night. NMC sources told TOI, “Registration of 30-plus was allowed in Co-Win for the last few days, but was not started for want of clearance from the government.” Vaccination of 18-plus is being going on at three private hospitals in the city — Kingsway, New Era and HCG NCHRI Cancer Hospital and it is paid jab. As per state’s public health department data, 45,102 people from 18-44 age group have taken the first dose between May 1 and June 17 in the district. Moreover, 8,056 beneficiaries have taken the second shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/30-plus-to-get-the-jab-at-147-centres-in-dist-from-today/articleshow/83647845.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Dehradun||Fake Covid tests at Kumbh: Some panicked, others thought it was spam||HARIDWAR/DEHRADUN: When Ghulam Mohd, owner of a Common Service Center in Haridwar, received confirmation over text in April that his RT-PCR report was awaited, it sent his family into panic. “I hadn’t given my samples anywhere. All my family members were afraid. We were worried that we would be taken away and put into quarantine centres,” said Mohd. Mohd was among one lakh people whose names featured in fake test reports that were issued by a private agency tasked with conducting testing in key areas during the Kumbh mela in Haridwar. On Friday, TOI called up dozens of people under whose names Covid reports were issued. All of them said they had never been to Kumbh; most said their Covid reports, though negative, had sparked fear while some said they had dismissed the texts as spam. Many numbers did not exist. In Madhya Pradesh, Arif, a motor mechanic, has already received three inquiry calls from Uttarakhand authorities and is now worried. “I have nothing to do with this. I don’t even know when Kumbh was held. Please leave me alone,” he implored on the phone. In many instances, those “tested” were missing last names, while names like “Champu”, “Guthka” were also registered, according to a list shared with TOI by the health department. Iqbaljeet Singh, a tour operator in Punjab’s Batala, said he was left puzzled when he got a text about his antigen test in Haridwar. “It was scary,” he said. The texts were automatically generated when names and contact details of those “tested” were uploaded on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal by the private agency which was supposed to have performed the tests. Rajneet, a cook in Maharashtra, and Gopal Lal Dobhi from Rajasthan, both expressed fear of becoming embroiled in a probe. “Will they arrest me? I haven’t done anything,” said Dobhi, a former finance advisor. Nine private agencies and the state government had conducted 4 lakh tests during the festival period in Haridwar after the high court had directed the state to conduct 50,000 daily tests in Kumbh. An FIR has now been registered against a private agency for conducting nearly 1 lakh forged tests in which students were shown as sample collectors and fake names and addresses of people were submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/people-in-mp-maha-pun-got-fake-covid-reports-even-guthka-champu/articleshow/83645186.cms||MS Nawaz

It is learnt that AICC has decided to unite all leaders in the party in Kerala as the party has to be regrouped after the dismal performance in the assembly elections. However, Gandhi is learnt to have given a clear message to the leader that the party cannot entertain the groups anymore. There are speculations that Chennithala will be made AICC general secretary and also a member of the Congress working committee. He is also likely to get the charge of two states —Punjab and Gujarat. After the discussions, which lasted for almost half-an-hour, Chennithala said that he was satisfied with the talks and was ready to accept all the decisions taken by AICC in Kerala. “I had some complaints and concerns in the way the new parliamentary party leader was selected. This was communicated to the AICC leader. Oommen Chandy too had the same complaints over the selection process. I am satisfied with the discussion,” he said. Ramesh said he had always remained a disciplined party worker and he believed that Gandhi had no negative feelings against him. “I have never gone behind any party positions in the party. I am deeply satisfied with what the party has given me,” he said. When asked whether he has been offered AICC general secretary post, Chennithala said there was no discussion in this regard. He is ready to remain as a mere party worker and hence party positions do not matter to him, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ramesh-conveys-concerns-to-rahul/articleshow/83649720.cms||---

A government spokesperson said that RP Polypacks and Kanpur Plastics Limited have set up textile factories in Kanpur city and Kanpur rural for Rs 150 crore and Rs 200 crore, respectively, and have already started production. Sparsh India Private Limited has invested Rs 600 crore for the construction of a plastic factory in Kanpur rural while Rimjhim Steel Company is building a steel rolling mill in Kanpur rural for Rs 550 crore. “However, the biggest draw for investors will be the Mega Leather Park which is being set up in Kanpur. It is spread over an area of 235 acres and will provide employment to 50,000 people while bringing an investment of Rs 5,850 crore. This will be the country’s first leather park,” he said. The park will also generate 1.5 lakh indirect employment opportunities and is expected to house more than 150 tanneries. It will not only facilitate manufacturing of world class leather shoes, purses and jackets, but also their export to other countries, the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/23-investment-offers-for-kanpur-1-1-set-for-rollout/articleshow/83652177.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Track closed due to Covid, Olympic aspirant trains on farms & roads||DEHRADUN: Exactly a week from now, national record holder Ankita Dhyani, 20, will compete in a race that will be the final qualifier for the Tokyo Olympics. She broke a national record in the 5,000-m event at the Junior National Championship in Guwahati in February. She has won the gold in the 1,500-m and 5,000-m events at the Junior Federation Cup in Bhopal. She holds, what many consider, great potential. But the state’s only synthetic athletic track is out of bounds and she has been forced to improvise — practising on barren land, ploughed fields and roads, evading potholes, dodging cattle. “Since April, I had been running on the roads near my village in Pauri. A few days ago, I came to Dehradun. But it’s the same,” Dhyani told TOI. “I start at 4am — roads are empty then — and go on for two hours. Again, at 4pm, when there is a relative lull, I practice for an hour.” The 60th National Inter-State Senior Athletics Championship in Patiala, which begins June 25, is the last stop for sprinters before the Olympics, which kick off in July. But in Uttarakhand, like other states, where all sports activities came to a halt because of the pandemic, all sports grounds have been shut. The state has just one international-standard synthetic athletic track at the Maharana Pratap Sports College but the government has not issued any SOP on sports activities. And it’s not just Dhyani. Anu Kumar, 20, from Haridwar has also been forced to make do with what he gets. He won a gold in the 800m event at the Asian Junior Athletics Championships in Japan in June 2018. While the state’s athletics association is trying to get them the right practice setup, the qualifiers are drawing closer. “It took me two weeks to even get an assurance from the CM’s office. Dhyani has the potential to qualify for the Olympics. It’s very sad that national athletic champions are forced to practise in this manner,” said KJS Kalsi, secretary of the Uttarakhand Athletics Association. “They run wherever they can find space. Across the city, you see people are out in large numbers. Is that how they are supposed to train? Running through crowds?” It is more than just a matter of inconvenience. “They are running on ground that could give them career-threatening injuries. It is impossible to run with spiked shoes on such ground,” Kalsi said. Dhyani was worried about the same: “I can’t run in my spiked shoes because of the uneven ground. Not getting enough practice in spikes will mean I am at a disadvantage at the tournament next week. I have been selected for an international tournament in Kenya in August. Lack of quality practice in the run-up to such big tournaments can really hurt an athlete’s chances.” Yet, Kalsi remains optimistic. “They have had their share of challenges. But I have a gut feeling we will win in Patiala."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/track-closed-due-to-covid-olympic-aspirant-trains-on-farms-roads-dodging-people-cattle-potholes/articleshow/83645209.cms||Mohammad Anab

Speaking to reporters here on Friday, Kappan said that he had informed UDF about his concerns. He said that he was not aware why he was not included in the UDF team which visited Muttil following the tree-felling scam. Though the present UDF leadership is good, the opposition leader was not chosen in the right manner. Chennithala had raised several issues against the LDF government during its previous tenure. These allegations were later found true, he said. Kappan said that he can’t approve the way Chennithala was removed as the opposition leader. V D Satheesan is a good opposition leader, but like the way KPCC president was chosen with the support of all, there was a defect in the way the opposition leader was selected, he said. The election commission did not approve his party’s name as Nationalist Congress Kerala and so it would be renamed as Democratic Congress Kerala or Democratic Congress party, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/oppn-leader-not-chosen-in-right-manner-says-kappan/articleshow/83649822.cms||---
---||Lucknow||SP chief’s claims of low GDP in Uttar Pradesh false narrative: MSME minister||LUCKNOW: A day after Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav blamed the state government’s policies for a drop in the state’s GDP from 6.9% in 2017, when he was chief minister, to 5.6% currently, government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh on Friday said that Yadav’s “false’ narrative” was a figment of his imagination and very different from actual figures. Singh said the State Gross Domestic Product (SGDP) of UP stood at Rs 12,88,700 crore when Yogi Adityanath took over as chief minister and it grew rapidly to Rs 17,05,593 crore in 2020-2021. “This accounts for 8.7% of the country’s GDP and is second only to Maharashtra. It is an achievement considering that the Yogi government had inherited a tale of depravity from the SP government,” he said. Singh added that even the per capita income in UP rose significantly in over four years, despite the handicap of coronavirus pandemic. Singh, who is also the MSME minister, said: “During the 2018 UP Investor Summit, MoUs worth about Rs 4.68 lakh crore were signed. Out of these, work has started on projects worth about Rs 2 lakh crore. I’m surprised that a person like Akhilesh Yadav is so ignorant. UP made a quantum jump to second position in ‘Ease of doing business’ rankings under the Yogi government. It is a defined parameter of creation of conducive environment for investors.” The minister said expressways and new airports were being constructed and employment was being generated even during coronavirus crisis. During the 2020 coronavirus lockdown, foreign companies made a beeline to invest in UP with an investment of about Rs 50,000 crore, the minister said, adding that Yadav also forgot about projects like Jewar airport, Film City in Noida and an investment of Rs 50,000 crore in the defence corridor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-chiefs-claims-of-low-gdp-in-up-false-narrative-msme-min/articleshow/83652217.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: 22% less vaccine doses given in last 7 days than previous week||BHOPAL: A mega vaccination drive is being organised in the state from June 21, with an objective of vaccinating 50 lakh people in a week, however in run up to the drive 22% less vaccine doses were administered in the state compared to previous week. In the 7-day period between June 4 and June 10 a total of around 15.39 lakh vaccine doses were administered in the state. But between June 11 and June 17—the next 7 days—only 11.85 lakh vaccine doses were administered which is 22% less number of doses administered in recent week compared to previous week. Sources said that there were issues related to vaccine availability which led to dip in numbers by a bit, but it is this week only when maximum 5.10 lakh doses were admistered in a single day on June 14. Meanwhile, officials have started preparations for the mega drive. Sensitisation training was provided to professors and teachers, who were informed about the common misconceptions regarding vaccines and their logical answers, said sources. This was done with objective that these people will act as motivators and they will in turn, sensitise and bust myths. “We have adequate manpower to achieve our goals. Districts have been given autonomy to decide upon the motivational measures taken and ensure vaccination as per our set goals”, state vaccination officer, Dr Santosh Shukla said. Under the drive vaccination would be carried out at 7000 centres all over the state. Sources also said that there will be no dearth of vaccine with the supply considerably improving in recent times, like 6 lakh doses were received on Friday itself, and at any point there are around 6-8 lakh additional doses of vaccines, added sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/22-less-vac-doses-given-in-last-7-days-than-previous-wk/articleshow/83649799.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Nagpur||Free accidental, death and health insurance to Nagpur university students for a year||NAGPUR: More than four lakh students stand to gain as Nagpur University has decided to insure them free of cost for the entire first year. The cover will include accidental, death and health. The decision was taken by the management council (MC) in a meeting held recently. NU will pay the premium for the first year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, students would have to pay for the remaining premiums from the following year. “I can’t comment on the council’s proposal as I have yet to get the minutes of the meeting, but last year, the Maharashtra government had directed us to make insurance mandatory for all the enrolled students. Accordingly, we had drafted a proposal wherein a Rs 3 lakh insurance cover would be provided for Rs 11 for every student. This would include accidents, hospitalisation and death. The proposal is pending with the board of deans (BOD),” NU director for students welfare (DSW) Abhay Mudghal told TOI. He added that the state higher education secretary would be convening a meeting with DSWs of all universities on June 23 to review the progress. Vishnu Changde, who had earlier moved the proposal in the Senate to insure all NU students, stated that in the recent MC meeting, he demanded that the administration should pay the first premium keeping the pandemic in mind. “The earlier decision, only for accidental and death insurance, was made a couple of years ago by the previous administration. The decision was inordinately delayed due to one or the other reason and later, because of the outbreak of the pandemic. At that time it was decided to invite quotations from government agencies to avoid controversy and maintain transparency. Accordingly, many agencies had sent their proposals,” he said. Explaining the mediclaim policy, Changde said members insisted that the NU administration must provide it as many were affected by the deadly disease and some even succumbed to it. “It has been decided to frame modalities and invite proposals from various insurance firms. It would take time to take any decision as it would depend on how much these companies would charge. We also need to see what else they would be providing apart from the Covid-19 cover,” he said. A senior official told TOI that the insurance amount would be paid from the university’s general funds in the first year. “For mediclaim, the MC has granted us a month’s deadline to complete the formalities and table a detailed proposal before its next meeting. Two years ago, the University Grants Commission (UGC) had directed all educational institutions to offer mandatory insurance to students. But in the case of health insurance, we can’t make it compulsory for all as its premium would obviously be more than the normal one,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/free-accidental-death-and-health-insurance-to-nu-students-for-a-yr/articleshow/83647887.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The court disposed the PIL filed by Tulja Yuvak Mandal after the temple trust submitted that the PIL was premature since it had only requested the Cantonment Board for permission to shift the temple from the cantonment area to the riverfront. Trust president Sudhir Nanavati submitted that a mere proposal had been made considering security concerns of the cantonment area, the lease issues, as well as the traffic problems caused by heavy rush of devotees on Saturdays. During the hearing, Chief Justice Vikram Nath said that he was a Hanuman bhakt, but this issue should be settled outside the court. Justice Biren Vaishnav commented, “The Almighty is always with you, whether at the riverfront or at the camp.” After the trust insisted that all rituals would be performed before shifting the idol, petitioner’s advocate Amit Panchal asserted that the swayambhu idol is not supposed to be shifted. He gave an example of Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura temples and submitted that it would not be possible if someone insisted on shifting Ram Janmabhoomi temple closer to Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pil-against-shifting-temple-dismissed/articleshow/83649790.cms||---

According to its Ease of Living Index 2020, Delhi ranks sixth on the list, behind Bengaluru, Chennai, Shimla, Bhubaneswar and Mumbai. Delhi, however, ranked as the worst capital in the perception of citizens contacted for the survey. The findings are part of CSE’s latest report, State of India’s Environment 2021. It also ranked Delhi as the fourth best city in terms of governance behind Bhopal, Raipur and Mumbai. To determine the score on the Ease of Living Index, four parameters were used: quality of life, economic ability, sustainability and citizens’ perceptions. The cities were given scores on all four parameters out of 100. Delhi received a score between 50 and 60 on the first three parameters and 69.4 on the citizens’ perception survey. In comparison, Bhubaneswar received a citizens’ perception score of 94.8 and Jaipur, 87.1. Bengaluru was ranked as the best city overall, followed by Chennai. The CSE reports states, “Only one state capital (Bengaluru) demonstrates a decent economic ability, scoring 78.8 out of 100, four other state capitals (Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi and Hyderabad) provide middling economic opportunities. The rest have all scored less than 30 out of 100.” Sunita Narain, director-general, CSE, said, “There is drama in numbers, especially when these numbers give you a trend. Are things getting better or worse? It is even more powerful when you can use the trend to understand the crisis, the challenge and the opportunity. The numbers in the case of Indian cities clearly suggest that the direction of development there is unsustainable.” For the quality of governance rankings of the cities, five parameters were used: services, finance, technology, urban planning and overall governance. Delhi ranked high on services, finance and governance, but received very low scores between 30 and 40 in both the urban planning and the technology categories. This is the second edition of the index, originally launched in 2018. The current index has seen a significant change from that of last year, the most noticeable being the inclusion of citizens’ feedback to establish the livability of Indian cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ill-at-ease-delhi-not-among-top-5-capitals-on-the-liveability-index/articleshow/83652269.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Goa||Controversy over govt empowering collector to invoke NSA in South Goa||PANAJI: The state government’s decision to empower the South Goa collector to invoke the stringent National Security Act (NSA) a day before Goa Revolution Day has sparked controversy, with opposition parties alleging that the move is to suppress the people’s voice. The government, however, said that it’s a routine order. Politicians were quick to react to the notification. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat said that after Congress issued a call to the people of Goa to rise for freedom from BJP misrule, the frightened government under CM Pramod Sawant imposed the NSA in South Goa on Goa Revolution Day. “This is an attempt to suppress the people’s voice and create fear among Goans. I strongly condemn the decision of the government.” However, the chief minister’s office (CMO) issued a clarification after immense criticism on social media. “This is to clarify that under NSA, the order for declaring the competent authority is made every three months,” it said. “This is a routine order which declares the district magistrates as the competent authority to dispose of any proposals received under the NSA Act. This has always been there and is not a new thing. The power is delegated by the state government to district magistrates or police chiefs (as the case may be) across the country.” GFP president Vijai Sardesai too slammed the government, stating that “our very own Pramod Salazar” has murdered the civil liberties Goa fought for “on the 75th anniversary of Goa Revolution Day”. He added that “the government is disguising its hidden anti-goemkar agenda of linear projects and coal transportation to suppress the voice of Goans who want to save their home.” Sardesai stated that “the CM’s actions are a complete betrayal of Goa’s Revolution Day, and has disregarded the sacrifice and honour of our freedom fighters including Ram Manohar Lohia and Julião Menezes”. He also pointed out that the move by the government to “suppress the voice of Goans in South Goa is nothing short of an authoritarian rule, as the CM has not consulted any members of the opposition, nor informed us about his decision.” Reacting to the criticism, Sawant tweeted, “There are certain politicians in the state who are well known for their ‘fotingponn’, ones who thrive on rumours. The people of Goa are well acquainted by their traits to spread misinformation and to create panic.” The home department’s order, issued by under secretary (home-I) Pritidas Gaonkar, dated June 8, was notified in the official gazette on June 17, saying that “in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3(3) of the National Security Act, 1980, the government of Goa, having regard to the circumstances prevailing in South Goa district of the State of Goa, is satisfied that it is necessary so to do, hereby directs that during a period of three months from the date of commencement of this order, the district magistrate of South Goa may also exercise the powers conferred by sub-section (2) of said Section 3, within the local limits of his jurisdiction, if he is satisfied as provided in said sub-section (2)”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/row-over-govt-order-empowering-collector-to-invoke-nsa/articleshow/83652201.cms||---

Centrum Finance, upon conversion to a small finance bank, will acquire the business of PMC Bank that has been under a RBI moratorium since September 2019. A consortium of Mumbai-based NBFC Centrum Finance and fintech Bharat Pe were the bidders who made it till the end although four bidders did look at the books of the failed bank. PMC Bank had collapsed almost overnight after it turned out that the management had colluded with Wadhwans of HDIL to clandestinely provide loans of Rs 6,500 crore or 73% of its total loan book size of Rs 8,880 crore. Read Also‘It’s a bank PMC will be part of, it’s not takeover’For Jaspal Bindra, who headed Standard Chartered Bank’s Asia operations in his 40s, the road back to banking is a challenging one. Bindra, who exited StanChart to turn entrepreneur by acquiring a stake in Centrum in 2016, will have to build a bank by merging operations of a failed local cooperative,The move would lead to the lifting of restrictions. But it is not yet clear to what extent larger depositors would get their money back. The bank registered a net loss of Rs 6,835 crore for FY20 and had a negative net worth of Rs 5,850 crore. Centrum has been given 120 days to convert its operations into a bank. It is only after this conversion that the government can issue a notification under Section 45 of the RBI Act which providers for amalgamation of two banks. The fate of large depositors, including hundreds of cooperative societies, will be known only once the government notification is finalised. A small finance bank is like a regular private commercial bank in most respects except that it cannot give large loans to businesses and must focus only on retail. They have far more headroom to get into new activities when compared to cooperative banks which are largely regional in their business. “The RBI’s in-principle approval is a validation of Centrum’s proven expertise in financial services and BharatPe’s Digital Leadership, both essential for setting up a New Age Bank. Starting with existing capabilities of an NBFC and a Fintech, active and potential customer base, digital reach and technology, should enable the SFB to scale up quickly,” said Centrum and Bharat Pe in a joint statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/centrum-finance-bharat-pe-set-to-acquire-pmc-bank/articleshow/83655576.cms||---

District collector, Avinash Lavania, has asked all the district officials involved in the campaign to meet 100% vaccination target and said their annual confidential reports (ACRs) this year will have reference to their success/ failure in meeting the vaccination target and it's imperative for all of them to meet the target. He further asked officials to reach out to the people in the area they live and motivate them to get themselves vaccinated. Lavania said that we should aim at vaccinating the maximum number of people beyond the age of 18 and vaccination centres should be set up at places, where it is easily accessible to people. Vaccination centres should be set up in schools, community halls, primary health centres and places like this so that people could come there easily. First and second dose both will be administered to persons according to eligibility during the mega campaign, he said. He further said that vaccination strategy is being made at the booth level like in elections and prominent people would be presented as icons to motivate people for vaccination. They could be players, social workers, freedom fighters and religious leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-sets-target-of-1-5l-doses-on-day-1/articleshow/83649825.cms||---

Countering him, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis announced that the BJP would stage chakka jam protests on June 26 across the state to protest against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray led MVA government’s failure to defend the OBC reservation. According to Wadettiwar, the MVA had constituted a commission to study the OBC issues and for that they need this empirical data of 2011 census. “We had earlier dispatched letters to the Centre and even during the recent meeting of CM Uddhav Thackeray with PM Narendra Modi, the same demand was made. However, till date, we haven’t received any response and therefore, it was decided to approach the apex court for directives to the centre to supply the information. Due to cancellation of OBC reservation, over 40,000-45,000 seats are vacant at municipal corporations, zilla parishads, gram panchayats and other places,” he said. Mumbai MLA Ashish Shelar, who was in city on Friday, told media persons that certain senior leaders from MVA are not playing above board. “There are two people who intervened in court against OBC reservation in local body polls. Both of them are connected to the Congress, with one of them being son of a Congress politician from Washim. As per information, one of them is close to Nana Patole. So, it seems that they are themselves filing the objections and fooling the OBC community. And to hide all of this, they are blaming the centre for the debacle,” said Shelar. During the meet chaired by Fadnavis, BJP leaders blamed the MVA government for negligence that led to removal of reservations. The party declared that the OBC community must get their rights back, else they wouldn’t allow local body elections in the state. “We will force the government to provide reservation to the OBCs. If needed, we will move to the judiciary,” the party’s spokesperson said. The decision for a statewide agitation was taken in a meeting attended by party’s senior functionaries, including former minister Pankaja Munde, Chandrashekhar Bawankule, Girish Mahajan, MP Raksha Khadse, Sanjay Kute and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-plans-chakka-jam-on-june-26-to-corner-govt-on-obc-issue/articleshow/83647898.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Social worker files contempt case against former Zilla parishad CEO||NAGPUR: A social worker filed a contempt petition against former Zilla Parishad chief executive officer (CEO) for alleged non-compliance of Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court’s orders (September 13, 2017). While hearing a PIL filed by Mohan Karemore, the HC had directed her to conduct an inquiry into alleged irregularities in procurement of furniture by the ZP. The HC issued a contempt notice to the respondents, including the CEO, asking her to reply before the next hearing. Citing audit objections of 2014-15 obtained under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, the petitioner claimed that the work was sub-divided and awarded to different contractors, while three offers were procured from the open market from unauthorized suppliers. The court had then noted that since objections were raised in the audit report, the concerned office bearers of Zilla Parishad were supposed to submit an appropriate reply. The petitioner had made the state rural development department secretary, public works department (PWD) principal secretary and executive engineer, besides ZP CEO as respondents in the PIL while seeking a through probe into the alleged irregularities in the purchase of furniture. The petitioner received the report from the respondent’s office after which he came to a conclusion that the respondent hadn’t conducted the inquiry. It was conducted by an executive engineer against whom allegations of misappropriation of funds in purchase of furniture for the ZP’s new building were made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/social-worker-files-contempt-case-against-former-zp-ceo/articleshow/83649834.cms||---

As part of its CSR initiative, BDL has set up the plant with a capacity of 960 litres per minute, which is equivalent to 170 to 220 cylinders per day, a release issued by the defence PSU stated. The plant was jointly inaugurated on Friday by the CMD of BDL, Commodore Siddharth Mishra (Retd) and Lt Gen, A Arun, GOC, Dakshin Bhara Area. The plant has an in-built manifold for secondary oxygen supply, in case of power failure, unit malfunction etc. “This plant will be useful for the needy and is the first of the four oxygen plants of the same capacity,” said Commodore Mishra (retd). Three others are planned at Kondapur government district hospital, King Koti government district hospital and ESIC Medical College Hospital. “These initiatives will go a long way in fighting against Covid-19 in the country, in general and in the state in particular,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bdl-sets-up-o2-plant-at-military-hospital/articleshow/83652260.cms||---

While petrol retailed at a new all-time high of Rs 103.08, diesel escalated to a record Rs 95.14 per litre. The price of petrol and diesel in neighbouring Thane and Navi Mumbai was Rs 103.21 and Rs 95.26 respectively. The highest petrol rate in Maharashtra is now Rs 105.42 in Parbhani, while the highest diesel price is Rs 96.60 in Amravati. Transporters have called for an all-India protest on June 28, as a precursor to an indefinite nationwide ‘chakka jam’ in future to oppose fuel price hikes. Diesel comprises 65% of transportation costs, and with prices going up in Mumbai and other districts, it has led to huge losses for scores of transporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-petrol-crosses-rs-103-diesel-rs-95-a-litre-in-city/articleshow/83652280.cms||---
---||Goa||Eye on polls, Goa CM promises 10,000 jobs in 6 months||PANAJI: CM Pramod Sawant said on Friday that the state government would fill 10,000 vacancies in various departments over the next six months. Three weeks after he announced an ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh to those from economically-weaker sections of society who have lost a family member to Covid-19, he said, “Within eight days, forms will be made available at the deputy collector’s office”. Sawant also announced that his government intended to help people whose businesses shut during the pandemic. “Up to 5,000 will be given as help, and forms will be available soon at the deputy collector’s office,” he said. Stating that a lot of people have lost their jobs in the private sector due to Covid, Sawant said that he was concerned about unemployment among youth. Recently, the state government lifted a 2016 ban on recruitment, and Sawant on Friday said that all the posts advertised would be filled, and advertisements for new posts would be issued soon. The CM also announced his intention to “create more technocrats”. “The state government will announce a scheme (shortly) which has been finalised by the directorate of technical education,” he said. Addressing the people of the state, Sawant said that students often face problems in getting admission to engineering colleges, and that this scheme would help them. Stating his desire to “create an atmosphere” to bring industries to the state, Sawant said that plot allotment would soon start at Tuem electronic city, and added that the government is trying its level best to ensure youth get employment. Meanwhile, the CM said that the state would soon start centres in colleges to coach students for competitive exams. He said there’s a need to coach those who wish to join the IAS, IPS, NEET, banking or railways exams. On transport, CM said that the department would bring in a new scheme so that private operators would benefit, but didn’t elaborate on the nature of the scheme. He also said that the Zauri bridge and the under-construction arm of Atal Setu would be complete by December 19. He said that within the next six months, the government would provide good roads.  He also urged people to keep Goa clean, to attract tourists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/eye-on-polls-cm-promises-10k-jobs-in-6-months/articleshow/83652246.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Precautions will be taken, say Nagpur city’s coaching classes||NAGPUR: Decks have been cleared for coaching institutes to start physical classes from Monday with a maximum of 20 students. While the decision to reopen classes has been welcomed, some feel the cap will cause ‘chaos’. The association representing a majority of coaching institutes says members will be taking a lot of precautions for the safety of students. President of Association of Coaching Institutes (ACI) Rajnikant Bondre said there will now be a logistical challenge for those who have bigger batches. “The latest guidelines need to be changed. At least 50% of the room capacity must be allowed. Due to the current situation, it’s not conducive to break up a batch of hundred students into five batches. This means that students will get to interact with their teacher just once a week. Physical interaction is the key for preparing students for competitive exams.” ACI members have also complied with all the guidelines to ensure the safety of students, claimed Bondre. “All of us took due care of everything during the last round of unlock, right from sanitization of premises to maintaining social distancing to personal hygiene in classrooms. In fact, coaching centres are the safest place for students,” said Bondre. He added that earlier this week in Pune, various coaching institute associations had met to discuss the unlock issue. “At that time someone from the media asked us about the risk to students inside coaching classes. I told them that the same students are allowed to visit malls, restaurants, parks and almost all public places where social distancing is not always guaranteed. Crowding is seen everywhere and these students, if visiting these places, are at a risk,” said Bondre. ACI claims that all their members have already ensured social distancing by ‘sealing’ chairs/bences. “We have taped or marked chairs and benches so that two students can’t sit together. Many of us have purchased sanitizing equipment and even trained our staff in Covid appropriate behaviour,” said Bondre. He added that many coaching classes shall ask for a health declaration form and will even check the temperature of students before entry inside classrooms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/precautions-will-be-taken-say-citys-coaching-classes/articleshow/83647920.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Goa||As travel enquiries rise, Goan netizens say in one voice: Pause your plans||PANAJI: Goa hasn’t seen the last of the second Covid wave yet but that hasn’t stopped people from other parts of the country from showing interest in visiting the state. The most popular question on social media appears to be, “Is Goa open?”. While the hospitality industry would like to resume at the earliest, netizens advised those interested to pause their travel plans and leave Goa alone for some time. “The fact that you are travelling itself makes you irresponsible. Just leave Goa alone for some time. We belong to the hospitality sector. We lost our jobs, I lost my mom,” said Shurbhi Sharma, responding to a query in a Facebook group if Goa was open. Currently, to enter Goa, a traveller needs to produce a Covid-19 certificate. Another netizen asked people to put off their plans as the state was badly hit by the second wave. “You can visit at the end of the year or next year. Stay at home,” said Priya Kaloke. Some pointed out that tourists behaved irresponsibly during the first wave and roamed freely without wearing masks, but few said that locals were no less guilty and took liberties in defying precautionary measures. A netizen who went by the name La Celebrite, said she was in Goa in February and took all necessary precautions but locals were very casual. Jessi Bhatia, another person on social media, said, “Travel is open and so is corona.” Most said people should refrain from travelling. Some dished out information that parties are not happening, casinos are closed, people can’t go shopping and shops are permitted to remain open from morning till 3pm. The state will appear unattractive to many but this is also the right time to explore hinterlands of the state, they said. President of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) Nilesh Shah said there’s no point in playing a blame-game, and holding tourists responsible for the increase in cases. “Everybody has suffered and is still suffering. Since the pandemic has started a lot of people have been left jobless and considering that Covid-19 will not vanish any time soon, we need to learn to do business with precautions in place,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-travel-enquiries-rise-goan-netizens-say-in-one-voice-pause-your-plans/articleshow/83652293.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Man molests fiancee, breaks off engagement||AHMEDABAD: A 29-year-old woman from the Chandkhedaon Thursday filed a complaint with police alleging that her fiance who works in the postal department frequently molested her soon after their marriage was fixed in October 2019 but later in December 2020 broke their engagement on the excuse that their horoscopes did not match. In her FIR with Women’s police (west), the woman stated that her parents were looking for a suitable groom for her marriage in October 2019. She said that one of her community members came up with a marriage proposal and introduced Maulik Desai, the accused in the case. As Desai’s parents were not alive, the woman’s father did not want to marry their daughter to him. But later, when Desai pursued his proposal to marry her, her parents agreed to their marriage in October 2019. On November 11, 2019, Desai took her to Indroda Park in Gandhinagar where he molested her for the first time and later when he was dropping her to home, he kept molesting her, alleged the woman. She said that they got engaged at a hotel near Zundal Circle on December 5, 2019. Later, he either met her at her home or at different parks in Gandhianagar and Ahmedabad city where he molested her frequently, she alleged. She said that he used to complain that she was not passionate in romance and she did not know how to kiss. On December 9, 2020, Desai along two of his relatives went to her home and returned a coconut and one rupee saying that his engagement with the complainant has been broken as their horoscopes did not match. She said that as her parents had objected to such an approach, he began defaming her among community members. Ultimately, she approached police and filed a complaint of molestation against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-molests-fiancee-breaks-off-engagement/articleshow/83649842.cms||---

Police said the incident came to light on June 4 when Manpadagaon resident Laxmi Patil filed a missing complaint about her husband Pravin Patil (30). Senior inspector Sanju John said Laxmi’s phone records revealed she had been in touch with Arvind alias Mari Ravindra Ram and Sunny Sagar just before Patil allegedly went missing. During their interrogation, it came to light that Laxmi was in an illicit relationship with Arvind, which her husband had discovered. She then hatched a plot along with her lover to eliminate him. The two beat him with iron roads and strangulated him. Later, Laxmi drove 36km and dumped her husband’s body in a culvert with the help of the two others. Patil’s decomposed body was recovered on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-woman-auto-driver-lover-held-for-killing-her-husband/articleshow/83652373.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Delhi||Discoms help power Delhi govt’s oxygen fight||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has been taking several measures, including ramping up oxygen supply to the capital and setting up oxygen banks in anticipation of a third wave of Covid-19 cases. Power discoms of BSES on Friday said that they were doing their bit for the cause and had contributed 650 portable oxygen concentrators to the government. “This is not the only targeted Covid-related initiative that BSES discoms have undertaken in partnership with the authorities. Earlier, fully equipped ambulances have also been provided to support the city’s health machinery,” a BSES spokesperson said. BSES discoms had handed-over around 850 e-tablets for the use of government school students, the spokesperson added. “These tablets will further facilitate the needy students to get better access to online education,” he said, adding that 100 automatic sanitiser-cum-thermal temperature scanner machines along with the sanitising liquid have also been installed at police stations, mohalla clinics and select public places. “Apart from supplying reliable power supply to all consumers, including hospitals, labs and vaccination centres, Delhi discoms are also lending a helping hand to the needy during these unprecedented Covid times,” he said. He said that BSES discoms have been providing dry food rations, hygiene kits and masks to the needy. Apart from that, over two lakh gloves, three lakh masks, 20,000 hygiene kits and 7,500 PPE kits have been provided in the last few months. The spokesperson said that the government and the authorities were doing a lot in the fight against Covid-19, but these efforts had to be supplemented by the resources of the corporate sector. “BSES CSR programmes are doing their bit,” he said. He said that since the onset of the Covid, the discoms’ CSR programmes have evolved, adapting to the new normal under their ‘Sparsh’ and ‘Suraksha’ initiatives. “For maximising the benefits to the intended beneficiaries, the CSR programs are working in close coordination with the authorities to identify the need gaps and implement the possible solutions,” he said. In anticipation of schools opening in the weeks and months ahead, BSES has been renovating toilets in schools and over 200 toilets have been renovated in 100-odd schools over the past few months, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/discoms-help-power-govts-o2-fight/articleshow/83652297.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Scarred by corona, people in Bhopal are now scared of bats||BHOPAL: There is no clarity or conclusive evidence about the role of bats in the spread of Covid-19, but the news about detection of the first case of Delta Plus variant in Bhopal and a possible third wave of coronavirus have left Bhopalis confused over the presence of bats — especially in areas where they are in large numbers. There are large colonies of bats in Kamla Park, Ginnauri, place near Hamidia hospital, Tulsi Nagar, 1100 quarters, Bhadbhada road and few other areas. So far, the upside-down clumps of bats on trees were n o more than a quirky sight, but the Covid scare has put an ominous twist to it. Citizens who were used to seeing them, are now confused over rumours over bats being the source of coronavirus infection. Those living in areas where the bats presence is high, are trying to stay away from them. “I live in Talaiya which is adjacent to Kamla Park. Presence of bats in the Kamla Park area is turning to be scary. Come visit in the evening in that area and you can see thousands of bats flying all over the sky. Ever since I have heard about a new variant that has been detected in Bhopal, I have avoided taking that road,” said Dharmendra Singh of Talaiya. While visiting Kamal Park, TOI team also noticed the presence of large number of bats. “Banyan and Pipal in Kamla Park are home to these bats,” said Mohsin Ali, a local resident. Bats live in areas behind Hamidia hospita as welll. “I have been seeing these bats since my childhood. It was normal for me. However, with all the rumours, it’s an eerie feeling now. I am afraid to move out, my home and shop is near the area where these bats could be seen flying.” Bats in places like Tulsi Nagar and 1100 quarters have also left the citizens in a fix. “I do not know the science behind bats responsible for Covid, but the detection of new variants somewhere is a disturbing news for me and others as well. I hope there would be no correlation between bats and Covid variants,” said Mahesh Sharma, a resident of Tulsi Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/scarred-by-corona-people-are-now-scared-of-bats/articleshow/83649857.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Nagpur||Doctors save mucormycosis-hit 12-year-old Akola girl’s vision with 3-hour surgery||NAGPUR: A team of experts at Nelson Mother and Child Care Hospital, Dhantoli saved the right eye of a 12-year-old girl from Akola around a month ago, after she was diagnosed with mucormycosis. After the first operation, subsequently a three-hour-long procedure was conducted to clear the fungal load from her maxillary sinus, thus saving the eye. Paediatric intensivist at the hospital, Dr Anand Bhutada said the girl was diagnosed with type-I diabetes, 15 days after recovering from Covid-19. “During her recovery from diabetes she grappled with swelling on the face, loosening of teeth and high-grade fever. Subsequently, she was referred to Nagpur,” said Dr Bhutada, adding that various investigations were done that confirmed presence of mucormycosis, the rare fungal infection rearing its head in many coronavirus patients. “Covid caused diabetic ketoacidosis in the girl, which can be a life-threatening condition. She had landed in coma too,” he said. Senior neurologist Dr Dinesh Kabra, who was part of the team that treated the girl, said she was put on a heavy dose of Liposomal Amphotericin B. “She had to be operated upon twice, but luckily the right eye was saved. It was a sino-nasal mucormycosis,” said Dr Kabra. Ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon Dr Harsh Gupta, who was part of the team that conducted the procedures, said a second surgery had to be done to save the girl’s right eye. “The first procedure was done using an endoscope to avoid scarring. Her right maxillary sinus was affected,’ he said. After some days, the team realized that more fungal load needed to be cleared to save the right eye. “The girl had to undertake treatment at the hospital for three hours and later returned for check-ups. She has recovered well,” said Dr Gupta. AIIMS Nagpur paediatrics department head Dr Meenakshi Girish said that mucormycosis is rare in children and is usually found in those with underlying immunodeficiency. “Whenever immunity goes down, there are organisms which can produce disease in a child who cannot mount an immune response,” she explained. Dr Girish added, “In the context of Covid, if a child receives steroids or any other drug which suppresses immunity, mucormycosis can develop. Just like in adults, Covid can cause mucormycosis in children too, especially if there are underlying conditions like diabetes or if the child's immunity is low because of rare inherited problems.” Dr Meenakshi also pointed out that children undergoing anti-cancer treatment are particularly prone and such children, along with those diagnosed with diabetes are categorized in the ‘high-risk group’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctors-save-mucor-hit-12-year-old-akola-girls-vision-with-3-hour-surgery/articleshow/83647926.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Lucknow||BJP to back ‘popular’ candidates in bid to win maximum zila panchayat seats||LUCKNOW: In a bid to grab maximum seats of the zila panchayat chiefs in the forthcoming polls scheduled on July 3, the Bharatiya Janata Party plans to lend its support to “popular” candidates, who may not necessarily be from the party-fold. In the recently concluded three-tier panchayat polls, the party for the first time announced the list of candidates supported by it, but faced a formidable challenge from the opposition. A top state BJP leader said that in charge and conveners of various districts have been asked to get the inputs about candidates who garner more support compared to candidates backed by parties, including the BJP, in the ZP ward elections held in April. “The party will do all the ‘homework’ to ensure the maximum number of candidates win with its support in the ZP chairperson elections,” a senior BJP leader, closely associated with the panchayat polls campaign, told TOI. The nominations for ZP chairperson elections in 75 districts is due on June 26, while polling and counting will be held on July 3. The election happens to be an indirect one with 3,050 ZP ward members choosing their head in respective districts. Though not conducted on party symbols, the rural local bodies’ polls got touted as a semi-final electoral battle before the high-stake UP assembly elections. This got further accentuated when BJP formally announced the list of candidates officially backed by it, stoking a political frenzy in the opposition camp which also threw its weight behind different candidates to shape up a high pitch electoral contest. Sources said that the saffron party was weighing all options, which also included taking and lending support to candidates who garnered more popular support in their respective regions. BJP’s move two days after state unit chief Swatantra Dev Singh visited SP’s pocket borough of Etawah and Mainpuri to meet the local party leaders, in an apparent exercise to chart out party’s blueprint vis-a-vis ZP chairperson elections. He later claimed that the party would defeat the SP in its own stronghold in the forthcoming ZP chairperson polls. It was only recently that BJP and SP crossed swords after the latter unleashed an attack on Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust over its alleged irregularities in land purchase for the proposed Ram Temple. Even as SP chief Akhilesh Yadav demanded resignation by trust members and an independent inquiry, the BJP hit back accusing the SP leadership of having blood of Kar Sevaks on its hands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-to-back-popular-candidates-in-bid-to-win-maximum-zp-seats/articleshow/83652290.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Damaged roads, gaping potholes add to commuters’ woes in rains||BHOPAL: Barely after the first few lashings of rain in monsoon season, potholes have started appearing and upper crust of the roads can be seen coming off at several places in the city. But roads connecting the city to colonies on outskirts of the city, which were dug up for laying of pipelines and not properly restored, are the ones which give a nightmare to residents of those colonies as the rain starts. Barrai road in Katara Hills, road connecting Danish Square to Salaiya and the road connecting Bhadbhada bridge to Ratibad and Nilbad are some glaring examples of this neglect. Besides, there are roads in posh areas like Shahpura, Gulmohar and Trilanga, which either remain dug up all the time or remain in bad condition. Service lanes connecting various colonies to the main roads in upmarket areas also turn muddy and difficult to commute during the peak monsoon season. “The road connecting Danish Square to Salaiya was dug up for laying of pipelines. There were two agencies involved in the work. The restoration work carried out by them was poor and since then, we have nightmares as the rain starts. The mud starts sinking into the road, making it difficult for us to drive on it. We have made complaints hundreds of times and repair work has been carried out at least 25 times, but to no avail”, said a resident of the area, Vineet Chaudhary. Pramod Yadav, who also lives in the same area, said, “It’s a stretch of not more than 3 kms but if you drive your vehicle on this stretch during rainy season , you feel as if you are doing a stunt. Two-wheelers and light four-wheelers on several occasions skid off the road during rainy season” . Hundreds of people living in colonies in the extended Katara Hills region face similar problems during monsoon due to incomplete Barrai Road, which connects colonies in the area to the city.. “It has been more than 4 years, but only 30 to 40% CC Road has been constructed till now”, said Narendra Patil. “In Trilanga, roads are reasonably good but as you take a turn from Shaitan Singh Square, there are two big potholes on the road and if you are not careful, your two-wheeler could slip right into them”, said Alok Shrivastava, a resident of Trilanga. Agencies like Capital Project Administration (CPA), PWD and BMC claim they were not allowed to undertake repair work during the lockdown. Chief engineer, CPA, Ravi Mittal said, “After the unlock, the maintenance work is in progress on CPA roads.” Mittal said, “Shahpura road connecting to Chunna Bhatti square has been dug up by BMC and once they complete their work, we shall repair the road.” TOI tried to contact Public works department (PWD) Chief engineer, Sanjay Muske, for comments but he refused to talk BMC commissioner KVS Chaudhary also said, repair of damaged roads is in progress and the dug up patches would be repaired permanently after hydro testing. “The patches dug up for maintenance can’t be repaired immediately after completion of work. Those patches are left for hydro testing and once it is done, it would be repaired for good,” said Chaudhary adding “I am inspecting under construction areas, three days a week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/damaged-roads-gaping-potholes-add-to-commuters-woes-in-rains/articleshow/83649894.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Delhi||Delhi: Vaccine Express is helping poor shrug off hesitancy||NEW DELHI: Deepak Meena, a 25-year-old student at Delhi University's School of Open Learning, wasn’t sure about getting himself vaccinated for Covid-19. On Friday, however, a group of people came to his East Vinod Nagar home to speak to him about the vaccine registration process and promised to give him a ride to the inoculation centre in the Vaccine Express. Meena need not have fantasised about the promised mode of transport. The express is nothing but an autorickshaw, an e-rickshaw, even a motorcycle, plying in over 50 slums of Delhi as part of the initiative called India Against Corona started by NGO Turn Your Concern Into Action (TYCIA) in an effort to fight the Covid pandemic. The drivers hired for the Vaccine Express are men whose livelihoods were adversely affected by the lockdown. "Our aim is to counter vaccine hesitancy which is prevalent not only in rural India, but also in the slums of Delhi and other cities,” said Mohit Raj, co-founder, TYCIA. He said that people were not only resistant to the Covid vaccine, but also suffered accessibility limitations due to the big distance between them and the vaccine centres. “Our Vaccine Express gives them the ease to cover whatever distance there is between their house and the vaccination centre,” added Raj. TYCIA’s ‘frontline warriors’ go to the several slums in the city and help people with the registration for the vaccine. “If there are people hesitant to receive the jab because they have pre-existing morbidities, we tele-counsel them. Over eight days, we have helped 1,500 people. We plan to take this initiative to rural India now,” said Raj. Ramesh Kumar, a coordinator, added, “Initially, we started an ambulance service for people from these impoverished areas. Then we decided to go for vaccination logistics. We have two e-rickshaws, four autorickshaws and four motorcycles to ferry people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wheels-of-change-vaccine-express-is-helping-poor-shrug-off-hesitancy/articleshow/83652363.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Goa||Goa CM threatens police action against netas who slam cops||PANAJI: In a direct threat to the political parties taking to the social media to unnecessarily criticise the government, especially police, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday told the police department to “show them their place”. “I have seen political parties criticising police. What do they think of themselves? I think police should show them their place,” Sawant, who also holds the home portfolio, said after inaugurating Colvale police station. “I don’t mind if a politician is criticised. As a chief minister, if people abuse me, it doesn’t matter. I will continue to do my work, but at least don’t criticise my department,” Sawant said. “Doctors have done a good job in the pandemic. They should be appreciated. Police department is doing a good job, appreciate them,” he said. For the past couple of days, the opposition has been relentlessly attacking the government over “the law and order situation” in the state and demanded Sawant’s resignation as the chief minister. Sawant’s threat to politicians comes a day after he came down heavily on the opposition for “damaging the state’s image” and taking to the social media to point out his government’s failure on a host of issues, including the mismanagement of the Covid situation that saw the government getting a rap from the Bombay high court for deaths due to shortage of oxygen supply. It also comes nearly six months before the assembly elections with a clear signal going out to the opposition that the government will not tolerate any criticism of its departments. After inaugurating the Colvale police station, Sawant said that people in the area are involved in “illegal matka” and are “acting smart”. “They are unnecessarily commenting, and it has to stop. The crime rate has to come down,” he said. Sawant claimed that North Goa SP Shobhit Saxena “knows everything” about such crimes, and that Goa police would act against them. “Those involved in crime should immediately stop, else we will act against them.” He also told police to “give justice to the people and act against criminals”. Sawant also advised the opposition not to damage the state’s image. “The state belongs to all of us. In the name of politics, we should not spoil the name of our state and tarnish our image in the country,” Sawant said. Sawant also congratulated Goa police for doing a good job. He said Goa police would soon fill 940 vacancies and 150 PSI posts. He also said that 250 more posts would be advertised for Goa police, and home guard posts would also be filled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-threatens-police-action-against-netas-who-slam-cops/articleshow/83652355.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat housing board extends date for penalty payment||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat housing board (GHB) has extended the time for residents for paying 50% of the penalty towards the illegal construction in their premises till July 31. Such individuals that pay the requisite penalty fee can convert their individual GHB apartment or tenement into freehold. In a detailed press release, GHB has claimed that flat and tenement owners who have illegally constructed rooms, or have encroached upon margin spaces or added floors can now regularize it by paying a penalty. The state government had offered a 50% exemption in this penalty sum till July 31. “For residential units the penalty fee will be decided according to the jantri rate of the open plot in the vicinity of the GHB housing,” said a senior GHB official. In case of non-residential properties the penalty will also be according to the prevailing jantri rate of the area. Sources in the GHB claim that a number of properties are stuck in legal issues which has stalled redevelopment projects. “A number of GHB societies had received offers for redevelopment. But owing to the illegal constructions residents could not apply for the same. This process will help accelerate the process,” said the GHB official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ghb-extends-date-for-penalty-payment/articleshow/83649886.cms||---

A brain tumour occupying a near 6cm lesion in brain was removed using an incision of 5cm and under a surgical microscope by neurosurgeon Dr Akshay Patil at KRIMS Hospital. This is the first surgery on a one-month-old baby's brain in Central India, claimed doctors. “Had it not been noticed in time, this tumour could have been fatal. Such a big tumour is rare at this age,” said Dr Patil. The baby’s parents hail from Anjangaon town in Amravati district. They told TOI that the boy’s head was suspected to be larger than normal, so they approached paediatrician Dr Amarjit Wagh. “Doctors advised us to get an MRI test done, which showed a tumour in the baby’s brain. The paediatrician referred us to Dr Patil, who decided to conduct a surgery,” said the baby’s father. Doctors explained the complications and probable dangers of the surgery to the parents. “Such a brain surgery on a one-month-old baby is extremely risky. The risk of bleeding is higher because the tumour has a network of blood vessels. In addition, there is a risk of post-operative malformations. Sometimes, even a ventilator may be used for breathing,” said Dr Patil. The tumour was not cancerous, thankfully, and was not spreading to other parts of the body. So, surgery was the only option. Anaesthetist Dr Ashutosh Jaiswal teamed up with Dr Patil in this surgery, and the baby recovered well under the paediatric treatment of Dr Sandeep Yadav after the surgery. “The baby is getting breastfeeding, moving his limbs and most importantly, smiling. We discharged the patient on the fifth day post surgery,” said Dr Yadav. According to doctors, such tumours are rare and should be treated with surgery. Nagpur now has all the advanced facilities needed for surgeries on infants. Complete removal of the tumour with surgery offers total cure to the baby. These tumours rarely come back. In most cases, patients with such tumours recover well after surgery. When asked why such tumours occur, doctors said that the reason is largely unknown. “It is possible that certain infections, genetic factors, immune system problems, or environmental factors play a role in causing these tumours. In some cases, they may be linked with some rare gene changes or genetic mutations,” said Dr Patil.

Raju, 72, who is physically challenged with both his legs paralyzed from birth, filed the complaint with the help of his brother’s son Satheesh at the office of district police superintendent on Thursday. The complaint was filed against his sister Vilasini, her husband and their son. Earlier, Raju, who is a bachelor, was staying with his sister. According to Raju, several individuals and organizations extended help to him after PM’s reference in ‘Mann Ki Baat’. “Since I did not have a bank account, well-wishers in my native helped me start an account in Federal Bank in Kumarakom. I wanted to make Vilasini the nominee but on her insistence the account was made a joint one between me and her,” said Raju in the complaint. After help he received from various quarters, the amount accrued in the account was Rs 21 lakh. The scrap merchants’ association and another well-wisher gifted him a boat each. Rajappan was recently honoured with World Protection Award by the Taiwan government. He received around Rs 7 lakh as award money, which was credited to his bank account. “After this, I was made to remain in the house and was not allowed to meet any relatives. They also beat my brother who came to meet me,” said Raju. Raju dreamt of building a small house and several well-wishers promised help if he possessed own land. Hence he requested his relatives to give three cents of land as his family share. All his siblings agreed to it except Vilasini, who demanded Rs 10 lakh for signing the agreement, Raju’s complaint said. Meanwhile, Raju noticed that Rs 5 lakhs was withdrawn from his account without his knowledge on February 12 and another Rs 8000 on March 17. He had withdrawn only Rs 3 lakh from the account using cheques on three occasions, he said. He said that both the boats gifted to him were in the custody of Vilasini and family. Raju demanded a proper investigation and wanted his money and boats back. Raju is currently staying alone in the ancestral home. His brother and son Satheesh are providing him with food and taking care of his needs. Everyday Raju scours Vembanad Lake and the tributaries of Meenachil river for plastic waste discarded by tourists. Raju is usually home after sunset, only to resume his duties the very next morning. This has been his routine for the last 15 years and he earns his living by selling the collected plastic to scrap dealers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vembanad-cleaner-accuses-kin-of-cheating/articleshow/83649930.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

Speaking during the inauguration of a flyover at Nandgaon in Hinganghat, Wardha, the minister said he had initiated the project when he had the charge of shipping, but of late, its work was moving at a snail’s pace. The government had planned to develop two such dry ports in Wardha and Jalna to facilitate export-import trades and improve connectivity with Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust in Mumbai from the hinterlands of Vidarbha and Marathwada. Spread over 346 acres, the Sindhi port is expected to provide direct employment to over a thousand people. Nitin Gadkari unveiled the beautification under Liberty flyover on Residency Road, Sadar on FridayCalling on the local leaders to help farmers, the city MP assured them to provide a train comprising six cold storage container bogies to Hinganghat farmers for selling their produce, not only across the country but also abroad. “We send 20 containers to Dubai and seven to Canada from Wardha containing vegetables and other produce of farmers. If Agriculture Market Produce Committee (APMC) and local leaders could take a lead from here, the products of farmers here could reach places. The technology is changing today and its proper use could provide longevity to perishable goods. At my home, we use onions that are about a year old, but remain fresh due to use of individually quick-frozen (IQF) technology,” he said. Responding to local leaders’ demand for deepening Vena river in Hinganghat, Gadkari said he would request NHAI contractor to excavate its silt for free and use it for road construction. “We had successfully implemented this pattern in Akola, Buldhana, Latur and other places where rivers are not only cleaned, but also led to recharging of ground water in nearby areas. So far, 900 villages have been benefited with this experiment and 2,800 wells were charged. Hinganghat too would get 24x7 water after it,” he said. Briefing about the Nag river project, the minister called on locals to develop Vena river into a tourist spot by building a river front and starting water taxi services there. “It should have boating facilities and food courts to attract tourists. I will help you in this project. Also, there’s no need to destroy houses for the Jamtha bypass. I’ve instructed the officials to prepare a design of a rotary there to resolve the issue. I would have inaugurated the project online, but I preferred to come here to meet and support you in the good works,” he said. While lauding the new flyover’s design, the two-time MP said its alignment was however wrong as it divided Hinganghat into two parts. “Ideally, any flyover is planned so that it shouldn’t come into the city for 15-20 years. Due to it, a black spot has been created at some distance and therefore, I immediately asked NHAI officials to make a design for a new flyover there to prevent accidents,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nhai-to-buy-sindhi-dry-port-convert-it-into-logistic-park-gadkari/articleshow/83649900.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Till date, over 10,000 households have registered for it, with the help of a mobile app. Various residential welfare associations (RWAs) have identified designated locations such as community halls, open areas at places of worship and clubs to administer the vaccine. “Nearly half a dozen private hospitals are administering the vaccine doses to the households. Those who have registered themselves on the app will automatically receive a message specifying the date when the jab will be given,” UFERWAS general secretary, B T Srinivasan, said. Instructions to the concerned RWAs have already been issued to make arrangements to administer the vaccines and also provide an ambulance, in case of any emergency. The RWAs are also coordinating with officials of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to keep the vaccination premises clean, said a member of RWA Madhapur. “We are working with private hospitals and are hoping that the drive will go off smoothly. We are expecting a lot of people to sign up for it,” said a member of RWA Sainikpuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mega-vax-drive-kicked-off-will-cover-3-5-lakh-households/articleshow/83652337.cms||---

Parisar surveyed the speed of vehicles in four cities, including Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad. Of the 34 roads surveyed in these cities, 26 had a speed violation of 60% or higher, with 5 showing 90% or more vehicles exceeding the speed limit. In Nagpur, the team surveyed eight roads — High court road (Palm road), Central Jail Road (Wardha Road), Amravati Road, Wardha Road near Chhatrapati Chowk, Hingna Road, Futala Lake Road and Katol Road. The survey was done during morning, afternoon and night hours. The team monitored and studied 7,560 vehicles on these roads in December 2020. The vehicles comprised 65% two-wheelers, 28% four-wheelers, 5% autorickshaws and 2% heavy vehicles. The survey found that Central Jail Road had the highest percentage of violations (87%), whereas at Maharajbagh Road, it was only 30%. All other roads saw speed violations in the range of 50% to 71%. Six out of 8 roads showed higher speed in the mornings, while the remaining two indicated the same in the afternoons. Also, four-wheelers were driven at higher speeds on 6 out of 8 roads, with only Maharajbagh Road having faster two-wheelers and Raj Bhavan Road having heavy vehicles with a higher speed. “We found that in the morning, the speed tends to be higher at 77%, with 46% of vehicles going above the restricted speed limit as compared to 32% at night,”said Sandeep Gaikwad, senior programme associate of Parisar. Gaikwad explained that speeding was one of the major causes of road accidents. But the enforcement agencies never considered it as a serious issue but largely focused on enforcing rules like wearing helmets, using seat belts, curbing wrong side driving etc. The agencies rarely launched any drive to enforce speed rules and create awareness thereof, he pointed out. “We conducted the speed survey and now we will meet the Maharashtra director general of police and submit our findings,” he said, adding, “Our focus is to curb accidents due to speeding.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/zip-zap-zoom-wardha-road-tops-the-speed-violation-chart/articleshow/83652326.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

A senior police officer of the city said that they held a meeting on Friday in which the temple trust proposed to hold the Jal Yatra with 50 persons, one elephant and only five ‘kalash’ to keep it a low-key affair and avoid crowds. Usually, the Jal Yatra is held with five elephants and 108 kalash with at least 150 persons in the procession. Last year, the Jal Yatra was not held due to the Covid-19 pandemic which continues to be a concern this year too. The officer said that they have forwarded their proposal to the state home ministry which will take a decision on holding of the procession. He said that the government has still not allowed more than 50 persons in a wedding and more than 20 persons in funeral or burial. So, the state government has to issue a notification regarding the Rath Yatra before it can be held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jal-yatra-with-just-50-people-proposed/articleshow/83649934.cms||---

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday released an order, increasing the dearness allowance for unskilled, semi-skilled, skilled and other workers in all scheduled employments with effect from April 1, 2021. “These steps have been taken in the interest of the poor and working class who have suffered disproportionately due to the current pandemic. This order shall also benefit those in clerical and supervisory jobs,” he said. Sisodia added that people in the unorganised sector who are employed on minimum wages should not be deprived of dearness allowance. “Factoring in the dearness allowance, revised rates of minimum wages have been announced,” he said. With the hiked dearness allowance, the monthly wages for unskilled labourers have been increased from Rs 15,492 to Rs 15,908, Delhi government stated. For semi-skilled labourers, the wages have been enhanced from Rs 17,069 to Rs 17,537. For skilled labourers, it is now Rs 19,291 instead of Rs 18,797. Additionally, the minimum wage rates for the supervisor and clerical cadre of employees have also been increased, the statement said. The monthly wages for non-matriculate employees have been increased from Rs 17,069 to Rs 17,537 and for matriculate employees, from Rs 18,797 to Rs 19,291. For graduates and those with higher educational qualifications, monthly wages have been increased from Rs 20,430 to Rs 20,976. “Although we have had to cut down on many expenditures, keeping in mind the interests of our working class, this decision has been taken,” Sisodia said. “Every section of the society has been adversely affected due to the pandemic. Adding to the woes of the masses is the soaring prices of daily essentials such as oil and pulses,” he added. “I hope that this increase in wages will provide some relief to our labour brethren,” Sisodia said, adding that the minimum wages of Delhi are the highest among the states in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-hikes-minimum-wages-to-help-poor-tide-over-covid-crisis/articleshow/83652443.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Low-cost sensors could track air pollution hotspots, says study||MUMBAI: Expect better air quality as the state government plans to set up more accurate, low-cost monitoring sensors to identify air pollution hotspots in the Mumbai region. Twenty of the 40 low-cost sensors developed by four start-ups have shown an accuracy of 85-90% vis-à-vis regulatory grade monitors during a seven-month pilot project by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) in partnership with IIT-Kanpur and Bloomberg Philanthropies. Track the pollution level in your cityBetween November 2020 and May 2021, 40 sensors from Respirer Living Sciences, Airveda Technologies, Personal Air Quality Systems and Oizom Instruments were deployed alongside MPCB’s regulatory-grade air quality BAM (Beta Attenuation Monitoring). The low-cost, indigenously created sensors can produce 1-minute data for PM2.5 (particulate matter measuring size less than 2.5 microns) and PM10 (particulate matter measuring size less than 10 microns). The sensors were solar-enabled and featured real-time communication for data transmission. Experts said that the study shows that these low-cost sensors could be a good option to make Mumbai region’s monitoring network more dense and help keep tabs on additional hotspots, which could help the administration take immediate corrective actions to keep the air clean. The study findings were presented at a webinar on Friday with participants from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, ministry of housing and urban affairs, central and state pollution control boards, technical experts, media, and civil society to discuss the way forward under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). “Maharashtra has the highest number of non-attainment cities and macro planning is needed to monitor the implementation of the NCAP. So, the data from these low-cost sensors will help us identify the air pollution hotspots in the state,” Dr V M Motghare, joint director (air quality), MPCB, said. Prof S N Tripathi, head of department of civil engineering, IIT-Kanpur, and national coordinator of NCAP, said: “The future of air quality monitoring lies in a hybrid approach combining regulatory grade monitors and sensors to provide hyperlocal data at a high temporal frequency. The results from the Mumbai sensor experiment clearly demonstrate that indigenous sensor technology is ready to be deployed at scale for air quality monitoring in the country.” Sudhir Srivastava, MPCB chairperson, said, “We have about 100 monitors for the state’s large area and this is a patchy network when what we need is a very dense network, but we realise that the cost of regulatory grade sensors is a prohibiting factor. Through the study we now have a lot of data and it enables us to compare it (data from low-cost sensors) with regulatory grade monitors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-low-cost-sensors-could-track-air-pollution-hotspots-says-study/articleshow/83652514.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

A virtual workshop, ‘Assessing Significance of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad’, was organized on Friday focusing on “history of cricket in Ahmedabad and the architectural and structural ingenuity of the site”. Last October, the SVP Stadium was put on the the World Monument Watch list 2020 by New York-based WMF as an endangered landmark along with 24 other sites including the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The Getty Foundation announced a $2.2 million fund grant to be shared among 13 20th-century buildings in the world that were on this watch list. The SVP Stadium will be one of the beneficiaries of the ‘Keeping It Modern grants’. Mahendra Raj, the structural consultant who designed this innovative structure, was overwhelmed that the building was getting conserved during his lifetime. “I have been fortunate enough to be involved with a number of large span and bold structures. This stadium in Ahmedabad was the first of its kind at the time. I am very happy that it was selected to be on the World Monuments Watch List and that it will be preserved and maintained in my life time. I hope some of my other structures too get selected as they also have the same quality.” He further added, “I am happy too that the Getty Foundation has taken up the cause of preserving concrete structures that were built in the 50s and the 60s, as they do need attention.” “Day two saw participants from Italy, Belgium, Morocco, Brazil, and US. The case studies had examples of all manners of stadiums and focused on the community and associational values of stadiums,” said deputy municipal commissioner, Nitin Sangwan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wmf-holds-first-workshop-towards-saving-svp-stadium/articleshow/83649994.cms||---

The bench comprising Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Virendra Singh reserved judgement on the petitions filed by law students Sanyam Jain and Nupur Tapliya after being apprised of the court e-committee's decision recommending that there should be live telecast of the proceedings in the high court. The petitioners had contended that the Supreme Court had issued guidelines for live telecast of court proceedings and live court proceedings in the MP high court should be allowed following the guidelines issued by the apex court. They further contended that it would enable litigants and general people to see the court proceedings and understand the justice dispensing system of the country. It would also enable reporters to cover the court proceedings easily, they argued. They further said that high courts of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Delhi have already started live telecast of court proceedings. During hearing of the petition, the court was apprised of the fact that the e-committee of the high court which met to discuss the issue has recommended one-way live telecast of the court proceedings, following which the court reserved its judgement on the petitions.

Now, the much awaited elections would be held on July 23, HCBA secretary Prafulla Khubalkar said. Earlier, the voting was scheduled on June 19, but in view of the ongoing position where the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court is conducting virtual hearing, the poll panel has decided to defer the already delayed elections further. “The circumstances being beyond the control of the executive and the election committees, the HCBA, in order to explore a final effort to ensure polling as per the existing election programme postponed it till July 23 from 9.30 am to 5 pm. The process of counting of votes and declaration of results would be held from 5.30 pm onwards on the same day,” Khubalkar informed. He clarified that the ballot papers printed for the polling with March 25 date would be used on July 23 without any changes. “The new date would be subjected to resumption of HC’s physical working. It is also clarified a fresh election programme would be declared,” he said. As per a section of lawyers, even the new date courted the controversy, as HCBA hadn’t sought permission from the Bar Association of Maharashtra and Goa before fixing it. The Bar Association members warned the HCBA of action in case they failed to seek the permission. On other hand, the HCBA members clarified that July 23 is a tentative date and the entire programme was yet to be finalized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hcba-polls-deferred-for-6th-time-due-to-pandemic/articleshow/83649999.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||GK residents seek early steps to check monsoon seepage||New Delhi: To avoid water seepage in basements like last monsoon, Greater Kailash II residents have urged the authorities to implement the measures recommended by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) in its final report released this March. They have asked Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to construct five-six heavy-duty tubewells or use the existing ones meant for domestic supply during the monsoon. The residents welfare association (RWA) has also asked DJB to reactivate heavy-duty pumps at three earmarked parks and install one more at Uday Shankar Park in E Block for pumping out underground water before the level increases and floods basements. Residents have requested National Green Tribunal (NGT) to give permission for pumping out water by allowing desealing of residential borewells as the groundwater in the area was found to be abnormally near the surface, even at a depth of 15ft. In August 2020, residents of M, E, S and some other blocks at GK-II faced a strange problem, when their basements started getting flooded every day, with water seeping in from the ground and walls. Worried that the stagnant water could damage their house foundations, residents had approached the authorities concerned. While neither drains nor water supply pipes seemed to be the source of the extra water, CGWB had found that the groundwater level was high in the area, causing the seepage. RWA president Sanjay Rana said the monsoon was again round the corner and residents were scared of facing flooding in basements this year too. “While South Delhi Municipal Corporation has reactivated the tubewell at Tikona and Sehgal Market I parks and Rock Garden, we are asking them to activate the fourth testing site too, considering some people have already started complaining about seepage,” he said. A corporation official said the pumps at three parks were activated on Wednesday, but couldn’t provide any information about Uday Shankar Park. “Considering that DJB has a major role to play, we are requesting it to implement all suggestions recommended by CGWB. The officials informed us that planning had been done but we were yet to see any execution on the ground,” said Rana. In its final report, CGWB has recommended DJB to use groundwater for supply in E, M and S blocks of the neighbourhood between April and October 2021 after obtaining permission from the Delhi advisory committee. “DJB was also recommended to construct seven to eight number of piezometers at suitable locations to monitor change in the water level regime,” it stated. A DJB official said they had requested all stakeholders to install heavy-duty pumps to remove water during monsoon to control the water level. “Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has already made arrangements and so have we. As far as long-term measures, such as constructing tubewells, are concerned, it is a time-consuming process, but the work is in progress,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gk-residents-seek-early-steps-to-check-monsoon-seepage/articleshow/83652484.cms||Vibha Sharma

Retailers and restaurateurs say this has hit business in Mumbai. Being at Level 3, the city has not been allowed to reopen its malls and multiplexes and it must shut dine-in at restaurants after 4pm and on weekends. In Thane, Navi Mumbai and Pune, malls, multiplexes and restaurants have been allowed to operate at 50% capacity and shops as per regular business hours as they fall in the Level 2 category. Rima Kirtikar, chief marketing officer at Viviana Mall, Thane, said retailers at their facility have been getting customers from Mumbai. Jayesh Sharma from Mumbai visited his friends in Thane recently to celebrate a professional achievement. “A few of my colleagues and friends stay in Thane and the suburbs and we thought of celebrating there as restaurants are open till late,” he said. Business owners in the city are upset. Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR), too, said Thane and Navi Mumbai have been pulling in Mumbaikars. “Towards the weekend, a lot of people are moving for recreation beyond Mumbai, causing losses to restaurants and shops in the city which have been in a precarious financial condition since the first lockdown,” said Shivanand Shetty, president, AHAR. Senior state government officials said due to porous borders between different cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, imposing strict restrictions in one city while allowing more relaxations in another may not help keep the Covid-19 infection in check. Vihar Paymode, co-owner of a night club in Thane, said they too have been getting customers from Kalyan and Mumbai. Sherry Bhatia, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), said, “Over 80% of a restaurant’s business happens in the evening hours and on weekends but we are not allowed to operate during these prime hours. Keeping a restaurant open only during the day translates into more expense than revenue.” Bhatia added the government has turned down their request for discounting fees due to the lockdown and paying excise licence fee in installments. Viren Shah, president, Federation of Retail Traders’ Welfare Association, said he has approached NCP chief Sharad Pawar regarding the BMC not opening up the city despite it being eligible for a Level 1 unlock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaikars-head-to-thane-n-mum-as-malls-evening-dine-in-shut-in-city/articleshow/83654424.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

---||Bhopal||Three arrested for using nude video call trick to extort money in Bhopal||BHOPAL: Cyber-crime branch on Friday arrested three accused, including two from Rajasthan and one from Haryana, who were involved in sextortion. The accused made fake profiles on various social media platforms posing as women and befriended men. They then lured them to make WhatsApp nude calls using recorded live chat of women and then recorded the victims’ calls. Using these obscene videos, they blackmailed the victims and demanded extortion money. Police have recovered bank details of the accused, which suggest that they earned almost Rs 60 lakh in the last one year, using this modus operandi. The accused have confessed that they extorted money from 50-60 MP based victims, but in most of the cases, the victims didn’t report the matter to police, fearing social ostracisation. Apart from MP, the accused also extorted money from victims in other states including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Delhi. Cops have seized five mobile phones, three ATM cards, 10 SIM cards, five memory cards and other documents from their possession. Their bank accounts were frozen. ASP Ankit Jaiswal said, that two Bhopal-based victims had filed complaints with the cybercrime branch that they received friend requests from Facebook accounts opened in the name of women. When they accepted the friend requests, they asked them to chat on WhatsApp. While chatting on WhatsApp the women asked them to make nude video calls and recorded them and eventually started blackmailing the victims. Fed up of regular harassment the victims approached police and filed a complaint. Jaiswal said, police registered a case and tracked the accused using technical analysis. The accused in the first case was identified as Wasim Khan, a resident of Firozpur Jhirka Mewat in Haryana and in the second case the accused were identified as Purshottam Meena and Yadram Meena, both residents of Alwar in Rajasthan. Wasim runs an online kiosk while Purshottam is doing his post graduation and Yadram is a contractor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/three-arrested-for-using-nude-video-call-trick-to-extort-money/articleshow/83650071.cms||---

He is keen to build a memorial at Jammu and Kashmir as a tribute to the heroes. Jadhav started the “nation’s first patriotic road trip” from Bengaluru on April 9, 2019 and has been driving continuously except during the few months of lockdown last year. Hailing from Aurangabad, Jadhav had shifted to Bengaluru in 2004. Apart from the teaching career, he had even started a musical band. Before commencing his unique road trip, Jadhav had also collected donation for the families of the martyrs. On his non-sponsored and apolitical tour in his sedan fitted with a caravan, Jadhav had encountered numerous challenges and hardships. But it also took him on cloud nine on a few occasions like when he was the only civilian invited for the inauguration of the memorial for the 40 Pulwama martyrs on February 14 last year. Jadhav had then handed over the urn containing the soils from the courtyard of 40 martyrs of the central paramilitary forces. There was yet another moment of glory for him when Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar interviewed him as a part of his ‘Bharat ke Veer’ initiative. Jadhav, who was moved by the sacrifices of soldiers during the Pulwama attack, wanted to contribute something for the nation in his own way. “I did not took any sponsorship from any corporate company or any political outfit but depended completely upon the contributions from the common people and organizations,” he said. Some helped him with food, others with fuel. “Another offered to foot my bills for the garage services and maintenance. All were driven by high respect for the armed forces,” said Jadhav. Most of the time, Jadhav slept in the car. “Irregular sleep and food made me sick but the determination to complete the mission has kept me alive,” he said. During his fascinating journey, Jadhav came across stories of human sacrifices. “In Punjab, I met the family of a Pulwama martyr. He was engaged and scheduled to get married the same year,” he said. Jadhav recalled a nightmarish experience when his vehicle had a breakdown in the forest in north-east and managed to continue the journey with help from the locals. “I also had a tough time driving through the Mumbai floods in 2019. My vehicle got damaged,” he said. Jadhav also met the families of Kargil martyrs and visited the memorials of India’s first commander-in-chief KM Cariappa and also Field Marshal Sam Maneckshaw. He intends to wrap up his journey on August 15. “I am planning to visit schools and colleges to share my experiences and inspire the student community,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nations-1st-patriotic-road-trip-brings-jadhav-to-city/articleshow/83650077.cms||---

The victim is Sewan Qureshi. His father, Ashrafali, said in his FIR filed on Thursday with Vejalpur police that his son is critical. Sewan was stabbed on Wednesday night and is being treated at SVP Hospital. The attack occurred when Sewan went to a neighbourhood paan shop to buy gutka. His friend Aman Shaikh, 25, a resident of Juhapura, was near the shop. Shaikh saw Sewan buying the gutka and told Sewan to get some for him too. When Sewan said he had no extra money, Shaikh became angry and began abusing him. The FIR said that when Sewan objected to the abuse, Shaikh stabbed Sewan in his stomach and slashed his thighs. Hearing Sewan’s screams, some passersby rescued him. Later, Sewan was taken to Sola Civil Hospital from where he was transferred to Asarwa Civil Hospital. Ashrafali said it initially appeared that Sewan had not suffered severe injuries so he was taken back home. But later in the night, Sewan began vomiting blood and his condition deteriorated. He was rushed to SVP Hospital where injuries to his intestines were detected. Sewan underwent a surgery and is in the ICU. Vejalpur police have registered a complaint of attempt to murder and have begun an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-stabs-friend-for-refusing-to-buy-gutka/articleshow/83650100.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Shadow of Class 11 over Boards irks students||BHOPAL: Shalini Parihar had been studying the entire year for her Class 12 Boards. Her scores in Class 10 and Class 11 were average but she was working to change that this year. The 30:30:40 formula has put her mind ill at ease as she think she could have done better in board exams. “I was not well when I appeared in Class 10 exams, my Class 11 results were also not satisfactory. I was confident to score better studied very hard this year. But with the weightage distributed over the three classes, I do not hope to get as much marks as I thought I would,” she said. CBSE will decide Class 12 results on 30:30:40 formula, which takes into account a student’s performance in the last three examinations (class 12, 12 pre-board, the class 11 finals, and class 10 board) to settle at a score for the theory component of the examination that could not be held. Parihar is planning to appear for the exam instead of accepting the CBSE formula-based marks. “I am told that CBSE has allowed the students who are not happy with the formula to sit for exams when the pandemic gets over. I will sit for exams,” she said. “I had good marks in class 10 but due to preparation for JEE, I could not spare much time for Class 11 exams. Now, CBSE is saying that it will give 30% weightage to Class 11 exams. Now, my overall result will suffer. I do not know what will happen if I sit for exams,” said a student Ashish Rajvaid. Even the teaching faculty said that considering previous years marks may disturb several students’ results. “Students are planning to take admission in colleges. They will get it on the basis of Class 12 marks. There is still no clarity about what formula colleges will apply to consider admission of students. I am afraid that several students may not get good colleges just because they had average marks in Class 10 and Class 11,” said a teacher Anil Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shadow-of-class-11-over-boards-irks-students/articleshow/83650094.cms||---
---||Agra||NHRC seeks UP's reply on chaining of convict, 84||AGRA: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Friday issued a notice to Uttar Pradesh government seeking its response within six weeks over the chaining of an 84-year-old ailing jail convict at a hospital bed in Etah district last month. In a stern observation, the NHRC said, “Keeping such an old and ill prisoner in jail indicates that the Sentence Review Board in the state is malfunctioning”. On May 13, visuals of Baburam Balram Singh, too frail to move, breathing heavily and chained to a hospital bed in Etah, turned up on social media platforms. Singh was found tied to a hospital bed in the non-Covid-19 ward of the hospital. Taking cognizance of the matter, director general (prisons) Anand Kumar had suspended the jail warder and ordered an inquiry. TOI had earlier reported Singh's age as 84 citing jail official quotes. But the NHRC, based on the complaint, has mentioned his age as 92. A month on, taking note of a complaint, NHRC issued a notice to the chief secretary of UP, seeking a report telling the rights body when the last meeting of the Sentence Review Board was held, how many cases are pending before it and in how many cases have sentences been commuted in 2020 and 2019. The NHRC also asked the UP chief secretary to cite in his report as to what system is followed in jails for referring matters to the board. The commission observed that under section 433 of Cr PC and Prison Rules, the government has powers to commute the sentence through the board. The functioning of the board should be improved for the protection of human rights of prisoners and decongesting jails to relieve the government from the burden of taking care of such old and ill inmates, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ups-sentence-review-board-malfunctioning-nhrc-on-chaining-of-prisoner-84/articleshow/83648134.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan hails PM Modi for topping global rating chart||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Friday welcomed the highest rating given to Prime Minister Narendra Modi among top 13 global leaders and said that Modi is the most popular leader in the world. Chouhan also thanked the Prime Minister for providing free vaccines to all citizens and said to fulfill Modi's dream, a mega vaccination drive was being launched in Madhya Pradesh on June 21 with a target of 10 lakh jabs in a day. "Shriman Narendra Modi ji is the most popular global leader, is what the world says. An American data intelligence firm conducted a survey which declared Modi ji as the most popular leader among all other global leaders. This is a matter of pride for the country and all of us," said Chouhan after a party meeting at the BJP state head office. Prime Minister Modi’s global approval rating might have fallen to 66% down from a previous 75%, a survey however revealed that it is still higher than world leaders from 13 countries, including Joe Biden of the United States, Vladimir Putin of Russia, Emmanuel Macron from France and Germany's Angela Merkel. The survey ‘Global Leader Approval Rating Tracker’, was conducted by an American data intelligence firm Morning Consult, which tracks approval rating from world leaders from 13 countries -- Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States -- on a weekly basis. The tracker, last updated on 17 June, showed 66% approval for Modi while 28% disapproved him. This is an improvement from a 32% disapproval rating on May10, 2021 when India's second wave of coronavirus was at its peak and the government was largely blamed for worsening it by going ahead with elections in five states and allowing religious congregations. Chief minister thanked Prime minister Modi for Covid-related support and said. "I also want to thank Modi ji because the central government will provide free vaccines to all citizens. Chief ministers (like me) had appealed that the states cannot handle vaccination drives and the center should take this in its own hands. There is Yoga Day on June 21. We will launch a mega campaign to provide free vaccines to all citizens who are eligible (above18 years of age). We have decided to start the vaccine drive in Madhya Pradesh from this day," said Chouhan. The chief minister also said that 7,000 vaccination centres across the state would be established to make the drive successful. "Every motivator, including eminent people of the society, ministers, MLAs, MPs, workers of political parties, social workers and different personalities of Madhya Pradesh will participate in the drive on June 21 to complete 10 lakh doses in a day," he said. Chouhan further said that the government has decided to effect transfers and posting in the state on humanitarian grounds. "There was Covid-19 crisis last year which continued this year too. We have decided that some transfers which are necessary on administrative and humanitarian grounds, will be done from July 1 and 31," said Chouhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/chouhan-hails-pm-modi-for-topping-global-rating-chart/articleshow/83650150.cms||---

Pictures of the flooding went viral on social media as people expressed anguish over the NMC’s lack of preparedness. “Waterlogging is a yearly problem. There is always threat of accidents by driving on rain-battered roads. Authorities must build a proper drainage system,” were some of the common complaints of the residents. Localities like Sangharsh Nagar, Haider Ali Maidan in Prabhag 3 witnessed knee-deep waterlogging till Friday morning. Many houses were flooded after rainwater gushed into residential localities in Sangharsh Nagar. Similar situation was seen in Indiramata Nagar locality where rainwater entered almost every house. Residents told TOI that they had alerted the office of assistant municipal commissioner of Satranjipura zone, but nothing was done. The zone did not take up any pre-monsoon activity like cleaning of stormwater networks, sewerage lines etc. If such is the situation in the first spell of rains, residents fear worsening times in the coming days. After TOI informed municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B about waterlogging in the locality, Satranjipura zone team rushed to Indiramata Nagar on Thursday night and drained out water from the locality. Residents led by Shanawaz Sheikh on Friday gheraoed the Satranjipura zone office to raise the issue. A similar situation was witnessed in many areas in South and East Nagpur. Residents from these parts blamed the poor pre-monsoon work like every year. The downpour and waterlogging also slowed down traffic flow on key roads in and around the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/waterlogged-homes-expose-nmcs-rain-preparedness/articleshow/83650154.cms||---

Besides, at least 61 criminals have been booked under the Gangster Act and properties of seven of them worth Rs 50 crore have been confiscated in Agraregion. During the month-long 'Operation Prahar' from May 15 to June 15, police have taken strict action against criminals whether it was related to arrest of wanted ones or taking action against those booked under Gangster or Goonda Act in four districts of Agra, Firozabad, Mathura and Mainpuri. In the first and third phases of polling during the recent state panchayat elections, violence was reported from certain districts, including Agra and Firozabad, where miscreants tried to capture booths and loot ballot boxes. On Friday, inspector general of police (Agra range) Naveen Arora said, “The NSA has been imposed against 10 people — seven from Agra’s Rihawali and Nagla Paltu villages and three from Firozabad’s Bharauli village." He added that 61 criminals have been booked under Gangster Act, including Agra (37), Mathura (11), Firozabad (9) and Mainpuri (4). Criminals whose illegal property have been attached include land mafia operator, Vishnu Prakash Rawat, who allegedly shot a property dealer Haresh Pauchori dead publicly, in Agra last December.

---||Delhi||Delhi: High diesel prices, rain fuel spike in veggie rates||NEW DELHI: Vegetable prices have risen sharply in the past 10 days following increase in diesel prices and rain at various places. The prices have increased marginally in the wholesale markets, but the retail prices have shot up significantly affecting the household budget of several families many of which have been financially hit due to Covid-19 and lockdown. In the retail market, onions are being sold for Rs 40 to 45 per kg, beans Rs 90-100, tomatoes Rs 30 to Rs 35, brinjals Rs 50-60, peas Rs 90-100, cabbage Rs 20-30, cauliflower Rs 60-70, cucumber Rs 40-60, lady’s finger Rs 40-50, lemon Rs 40-60, pumpkin Rs 20-30 and capsicum Rs 40-60. Many of these vegetables have seen an increase of 50% to 100% in their prices in the retail market in the last 10 days. Adil Khan, chairman, Agriculture Produce and Market Committee, Azadpur said that the cost of vegetables had gone up in the wholesale market primarily due to increasing diesel prices escalating transportation cost and also, due to rains in different states that supply vegetables to Delhi. The wholesale rate of onions on June 19 was Rs 17.5 per kg, three rupees more than the rate on June 9. Almost all the vegetables have reported an increase in their wholesale rates and only the rates of lemon, pumpkin, cauliflower and gourd have declined. An official said that the retailers were paying more for transporting the vegetables from the wholesale market to the vegetable shops and they were adjusting the difference by hiking the rate of the vegetables at their own level. “Usually a retailer sells at 2 to 2.5 times higher than the wholesale rate and since the retail market is unregulated, prices vary. Another major reason for varying prices is the quality of vegetables they sell with premium quality being costlier,” said an official. Khan said that due to rains, the plucking of vegetables gets hit as the vegetable growers find it difficult to get farm labourers. The rains also damage the vegetables in the farms, which hits supply and demand ration leading to higher prices. Vegetables are supplied to Delhi from Haryana, Gujarat, Rajasthan and different parts of Uttar Pradesh many of which have received rains recently. A retailer said that vegetable costs had spiralled in the wholesale markets and the transportation cost had increased 20% to 30% due to which their income had been badly hit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/high-diesel-prices-rain-fuel-spike-in-veggie-rates/articleshow/83674617.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Mumbai||We do not want a ‘rob Peter to pay Paul’ situation: HC on O2 supply||Mumbai: The state on Wednesday informed the Bombay high court bench at Aurangabad that no Covid patient in Maharashtra died only for want of oxygen. But the HC said, “We do not want a situation like “rob Peter to pay Paul”. The bench of Justices R V Ghuge and B U Debadwar said oxygen supply to non-Covid patients ought not to be disrupted to supply oxygen to Covid patients. “This would be counterproductive,’’ said the bench, adding it “would not tolerate’’ any “painful death’’ of a non-Covid patient for want of oxygen. An Aurangabad HC bench which is hearing a suo motu criminal Public Interest Litigation on Covid related issues including infrastructure, availability of oxygen, ambulances, action against maskless and helmetless, ventilators and added to the list the rise in cases of mucormycosis. The HC said, “We appreciate the efforts of the Government of Maharashtra in achieving this position,’’ and added that it had no doubt it would step up to ensure all levels right up to talukas are covered to ensure “mortality rate is controlled’’. The chief public prosecutor D R Kale said there were 397 Covid hospitals and as on May 18, there was a buffer oxygen stock of 100 MT. Advocate Rahul Chitnis for the Food and Drugs Department sought a modification of the HC’s earlier order to supply 218 MT of oxygen per day to Aurangabad division as he said there should not be a fixed quota per day. The HC said, “We find that the situation is dynamic.’’ The state said there will “never be a situation where any patient would die only due to shortage of oxygen’’. “If this happens, the nodal officers and (officer who file the affidavit) may be held personally responsible,’’ said Chitnis on instructions from the officers. The HC said it accepted Chitnis’ contention and refrains from insisting on supply of 218 MT oxygen to Aurangabad division per day, adding, “But, we make it clear that if there is an uproar or a hue and cry that there is a shortage of oxygen in this part of the state and in the event of patients being turned away by hospitals / doctors due to lack of oxygen supply or in the unfortunate event of death of patients due to such reason, we would hold Saurabh Vijay and the 4 Nodal Officers, personally responsible for such unfortunate incidents…’’ The HC directed the officers to decide and supply oxygen with “utmost care’’. The HC said the experts could decide on what the buffer stock of oxygen would be. But it suggested that it should be between 40 and 50 MT in view of the Supreme Court’s observations. The HC said the state must “bear in mind that our nation is not dealing only with Covid patients. There are several others like cancer patients, heart patients, kidney patients etc.’’ The HC also took serious note of the rise in mucormycosis cases and deaths and said it would hold a sitting on May 21 for this issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/we-do-not-want-a-rob-peter-to-pay-paul-situation-hc-on-o2-supply/articleshow/82784463.cms||Swati Deshpande

In the PIL, lawyer KC Jain has demanded SICs should allow virtual hearings as a permanent feature like the Central Information Commission (CIC) and Chhattisgarh State Information Commission to promote a hybrid system of hearings — both physical and virtual. The PIL has been listed for hearing on July 1. Jain said, “Most SICs conduct physical hearings only and applicants have to sometimes travel several hundred kilometres for the same. Due to prohibitive cost and other hardships involved in travelling, a majority of RTI applicants give up their attempt to obtain information." The RTI activist contended that “the mechanism of virtual hearing should be through video conferencing via NIC or other digital platform or WhatsApp”. It can even be through audio conferencing. He added that hearings through video or audio conferencing would lead to expeditious disposal of the matters before the SICs, “heavily burdened with a backlog of matters”. In the PIL, the apex court’s intervention has also been sought for creating self-contained user-friendly digital portals of the SICs with various facilities such as filing of online RTI appeals and complaints, showing case status of pending/decided matters, orders of SICs and lists and annual reports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/sc-notice-to-28-state-information-commissions-over-pil-seeking-virtual-hearing/articleshow/83648207.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Delhi||Delhi University aspirants plead against common entrance||NEW DELHI: Delhi University becoming part of Central University Common Entrance Test (CUCET) at the last moment will be unfair for students as it would reduce their options to change streams and won’t give them enough preparation time, a group of Class XII students has argued in an email sent to teachers and DU officials over the past few days. One of these students, who comes from a village about 100km from Jhansi in Madhya Pradesh, told TOI, “I dropped out last year as I wanted to figure out what I am actually interested in. Now I want to pursue physics (H). I had really studied hard and scored above 96%. Now suddenly how are we to prepare for the entrance? Isn’t a central university meant for those who cannot afford?” The students have come together on Telegram and decided to send a request to DU before it takes a decision. The Union education ministry will take a decision on CUCET next week. In the over 1,000-word email, they have elaborated on different aspects and argued on why CUCET should not be adopted this year. “Syllabus, pattern, date, duration and mode for the exam were not announced earlier. It will be tough for the students to compete in a pan-India exam without adequate preparation... Though there were rumours about CUCET, nothing was officially declared,” they wrote. CUCET was conducted for universities with subject-specific exams, while universities like DU “has courses which are open for students who had not studied the subject before... Such group of students will face problems in competing in the entrance exams where there is a subject-specific test”, they added. A student told TOI, “The best part about DU is that BA courses are open to all irrespective of the stream one has studied. The science course like maths and statistics are also open to arts and commerce students. But CUCET so far requires students to study physics-chemistry-mathematics/biology if they are to appear for the test. If DU adopts the same eligibility criteria, it would simply restrict students from joining these courses.” Adopting CUCET will also mean only those with access to online paid courses can go on with preparation, they argued. “Suddenly announcing the exam would leave students with no resources to prepare, particularly during the pandemic,” the email added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-aspirants-plead-against-common-entrance/articleshow/83652593.cms||Shradha Chettri

A division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Kilor directed the government to inform it measures taken so far to strengthen the base of the historic temple to save its rocks from collapsing. “The parties to place on record latest updates and status about various steps undertaken so far for preservation and conservation of the heritage monument. They would also inform on the steps taken for preventing landslides and loosening of soil from the hill on which it is situated,” said the bench. While adjourning the hearing till July 14, the judges asked respondents to apprise them about progress made in the pending civil suit related to the temple. “The respondents should also inform on the proceedings pending before joint charity commissioner for finalization of the scheme for governing temple affairs, which is found to be a public trust as per his order.” Earlier, senior counsel and amicus curiae Anand Jaiswal informed that a Narasimha temple located on the temple premises at Ramtek is even older than the Ram temple. Jaiswal informed that he would like to accompany the government’s team that would visit the temple for inspection. The court was hearing suo motu plea (PIL No. 13/2010) based on various media reports exposing dilapidated condition of the historic temple, thronged by lakhs of devotees every year and which was on the verge of collapse due to lack of maintenance. A Ramtek resident Amit Khot had also filed a PIL citing various media reports which mentioned that the over 700-year-old temple belonged to Wakataka era along with other temples like Kewal Narasimha and Rudra Narasimha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-seeks-progress-report-on-ramtek-temple-repairs/articleshow/83650245.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The incident took place after the little boy, Krishna, sat in his father’s parked car and started playing games on a mobile phone. According to Krishna’s uncle Girish Agarwal, the boy went to serve his father tea at his shop, 100 metres away from their house, around 4 pm on June 16. “Krishna took his father’s mobile phone for playing online games and sat inside a parked car near the shop. The i20 was bought two months ago,” Agarwal said on Friday. After an hour, his father, Rinku, asked one of his customers to check with his son who had been playing inside the car. He was shocked to know that his son was lying unconscious. The boy was rushed to a private hospital, but doctors declared him dead. Agarwal said Krishna, who was the only son among five siblings, took two selfies before his death. He was sweating profusely. “Electronic gadgets took him away from us,” Agarwal said, adding that he was fond of playing mobile games and didn't realise that he was trapped by the car lock. “Krishna could have been saved if he had raised an alarm or had made some effort to come out,” the uncle said. No FIR has been registered as yet, police said. This is not an isolated case in Uttar Pradesh. Last month, four minor children, including two girls, died of suffocation after they remained trapped for four hours inside a parked car with a central locking system in Baghpat’s Singaulitaga village. Two years ago, five-year-old Mohammed Zahid died after getting trapped inside his father’s car in Muzaffarnagar district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/boy-8-suffocates-to-death-while-playing-mobile-games-inside-parked-car-in-mathura/articleshow/83648238.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Delhi readies to tackle 45,000 Covid-19 cases a day||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s health infrastructure was stretched to breaking point when new single-day Covid-19 cases reached 28,000 in the recent past. There was a sense of a doom in the atmosphere. But with that experience behind it, Delhi government is gearing up to handle 45,000 infection cases daily in the worst-case scenario should the coronavirus make another surge. Experts say that Delhi should be ready to handle 37,000 single-day under normal circumstance but have the wherewithal to handle 45,000 if the virulence is very intense. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal recently cautioned that a third wave of infections is very likely, citing information from the United Kingdom about Covid rebounding there. This possibility and the existing situation were discussed at a high-level meeting where lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and the CM exchanged views with experts on ramping up the capital’s health infrastructure to handle an aggravating situation. The state government has constituted three committees to oversee the supervision and management of the Covid situation. One will work on the mitigation and management of the third wave, the second committee on preparing an action plan for augmenting the health infrastructure and the third committee will focus on paediatric aspects treatment of infected children. Extensive work is under way to boost the oxygen setup to prevent the sort of crisis the city experienced at the peak of the recent wave. Soon Delhi will have 65 oxygen generation plants capable of producing 64.7 metric tonnes of the gas — it currently has 33. The government has also said that cryogenic oxygen bottling plants with a capacity of 12MT will be installed and commissioned by July 31. Three liquid medical oxygen tanks capable of storing 171MT capacity have already been installed. Another two LMO storage tanks with capacity to hold 100MT are likely to arrive in the city by June 30. A committee has also been constituted to assess the oxygen supply infrastructure in Delhi government hospitals with 100 or more beds. The panel is also mandated to examine the adequacy of provisions made in the expansion plan and suggest the way forward. Two task forces are overseeing the preparations for the possible third wave of Covid infections. The CM and the LG are closely monitoring the ongoing preparations to ensure that all arrangements are in place as soon as possible. The CM’s office said in a statement on Friday that Kejriwal had convened a meeting in view of the highly probable third wave of Covid where the LG was present. The meeting discussed the full action plan and roadmap set by Delhi government in dealing with the pandemic. A presentation inclusive of all the extensive preparedness measures was made, highlighting the enhanced healthcare infrastructure that the state government has been building since the outbreak of Covid. Kejriwal apprised the LG about oxygen generation plants, cryogenic plants, liquid medical oxygen shortage, oxygen and bed management in hospitals and the arrangement for medicines and vaccination. The statement said, “If the third wave comes and oxygen demand increases, Delhi government has worked on a war footing to maintain a rigorous supply of oxygen. CM informed the LG about the oxygen infrastructure in detail. CM also apprised the LG that for a worst-case third-wave scenario and the general situation, other preparations, including augmentation of beds, is being done. The government is working continuously on how many oxygen beds and ICU beds will be required during that time. In view of this, Delhi Government has formed a committee to enhance and strengthen the health infrastructure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-readies-to-tackle-45k-cases-a-day/articleshow/83652591.cms||AlokKNMishra

Party's national president Jagat Prakash Nadda will inaugurate the meeting. This is the first time after the appointment of Vishnu Dutt Sharma as party's state chief and second time in three years, a meeting of the state body will be conducted. BJP said that the party would also participate in the mega vaccination drive launched by the state government. "The state executive committee meeting of BJP will be held on June 24. Only a prescribed number of state officials will be present in the party state head office as per the corona protocol. State officials and executive committee members will virtually connect with the respective district offices. Party's national president Jagat Prakash Nadda will inaugurate the physical and virtual meetings as the chief guest. State issues including political proposals will be tabled in the meeting," said BJP state chief Sharma on Friday.

---||India||Two jabs done, but CoWin still tells lakhs they are due for second shot||As part of a data-correction exercise, state governments have detected lakhs of Covid-19 beneficiaries who are fully inoculated but are still being shown on the CoWin app as due for the second shot. While the Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu governments have each detected one lakh duplicate entries in their respective states, the West Bengal government has found five lakh such cases. At least 13 other states have detected duplicate entries but are yet to compile numbers. Health departments in these states are now engaged in a huge data-scrubbing exercise to change the status of such beneficiaries on the CoWin app. While most state officials said beneficiaries desperate for the second jab have registered using multiple phone numbers and IDs, leading to duplication, some have had unique problems. Like Bengal, where elections were held recently and Election Commission's mandate to get poll officials vaccinated led to confusion and duplication. In Gujarat's Banaskantha, Dileep, an engineering student, took the vaccine on May 1 as an offline candidate. "We took the jab offline after we were told by urban health centre personnel that many in the 45+ group, who had booked slots, had not turned up resulting in surplus vaccines." Dileep was in for a shock when he checked his vaccination status - his phone number was registered in the name of a woman, Meena Suthar. "This may mar my access to a vaccination certificate," he said. Bhavi Shah, a senior resident doctor in a medical college in Gujarat's Palanpur took two doses on February 9 and March 31. But she received two more messages about being vaccinated on April 4. "Those messages had different birth years mentioned," she said. States that have detected duplication but are yet to compile the numbers include Madhya Pradesh, UP, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Goa, Odisha, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Haryana and Jharkhand. Most of them have written to Centre to weed out the extra names and find a remedy. Mumbai has begun an exercise to trace 50,000 to 60,000 people who have not turned up for their second shot despite completing the interval. "Duplication in entries could be the key reason. If one has registered with a different number, complete vaccination may not reflect against that number," said Dr Sheela Jagtap, head of the city's immunisation department. Like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu too has detected at least one lakh additional registrations in the healthcare workers group. This happened as hospitals and the state government added names simultaneously of doctors, nurses and paramedical staff in the CoWin portal, which inflated the target. West Bengal has sent a list of around 5 lakh duplicate entries to the Centre for rectification. Explaining the confusion caused by EC's directive that all poll officials should be vaccinated, an officer said a large number of such people - police, civic or healthcare staffers - were already vaccinated as frontline workers. These were done partly in online-offline mode due to the initial CoWin glitches. The offline data was uploaded in bulk later when the glitches eased. After the model code of conduct kicked in in February, the state home (election) department also started registering poll officials, many of whom were already vaccinated.

Even though the health panel has reserved its judgment, it has sent a report to the state health department on its findings about the three facilities. The management of the three facilities has also been asked to deposit Rs 15 lakh with the commission till cases against them are disposed off. Earlier, a team from the commission inspected Apex Clinic Private Limited Behala, Good Samaritan Hospital Park Circus and Ujjiban Hospital in New Town after complaints by the relatives of Covid patients who had gone to these facilities for treatment. “Our team that inspected the three facilities found infrastructure deficiencies. The report on our findings has been forwarded to the health department. There have been complaints against doctors and nurses who do not have the adequate qualification,” said Justice (retired) Ashim Kumar Banerjee the commission chairman.

---||Delhi||4 agencies picked to carry out tree transplantation||New Delhi: The forest department has empanelled four expert agencies to carry out tree transplantation in Delhi and a construction agency will have to choose one among them for the projects. According to the tree transplantation policy, which was notified by Delhi government last year, a minimum of 80% of trees affected by a development or construction project will be transplanted, and 80% of the transplanted trees must survive after transplantation. Additionally, compensatory plantation of 10 saplings for each tree will continue. According to sources, the tree transplantation cell, which was constituted earlier this year to facilitate the process, had received over 10 applications. “However, the forest department had constituted an expert committee that finalised four agencies after scrutiny of technical bids and expertise. The selected agencies will adhere to all technical specifications for tree transplantation. The project developer will be required to select one of the four agencies for the work,” said a forest official. According to the policy, trees should be properly preserved, and no trees should be unnecessarily removed for development projects. When onsite preservation is not possible, scientific transplantation of all the affected trees should be the new norm instead of felling them. At least 80% of the trees that are affected by developmental activities and cannot be preserved onsite should be transplanted. After the transplantation, social audits would be done by roping in locals to assess the success of the projects. “Local committees comprising citizen groups, professionals and experts should be constituted by the forest department. Tree committees will be responsible for carrying out regular monitoring of all projects involving compensatory plantation or tree transplantation of 100 or more trees/saplings in their areas, and to certify their tree survival rate at the end of one year,” said the policy. “Tree Authority of Delhi will be the apex body responsible for regular monitoring of the implementation of the prescribed procedure for the transplantation and evolving new norms, mechanisms and best practices to achieve the objective of ensuring successful tree transplantation in Delhi,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-agencies-picked-to-carry-out-tree-transplantation/articleshow/83674686.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Mumbai||Mumbai moves to Level 1, but Level 3 curbs stay||MUMBAI: Nearly 25 of the state’s 36 districts, including Mumbai and Thane, are eligible to be upgraded to the Level 1 category that allows for near-total unlock, according to the weekly review of Covid-19 indicators, part of the state government’s five-level unlock plan. However, with the danger of a third wave looming and fear of the highly transmissible Delta variant, cities like Mumbai are treading with caution and will continue at the current Level 3 relaxations. Mumbai’s weekly positivity rate from June 11-17 fell to 3.8%, and oxygen bed occupancy dipped to 23.5%, qualifying for Level 1 relaxations. KDMC, Mira Bhayander and Palghar now down to Level 3The Level 3 restrictions “which have been in force as per orders issued last week will continue in Mumbai till further orders,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health) on Friday. BMC chief Iqbal Chahal had last week said Mumbai will remain under Level 3 restrictions till Covid cases come down to around 100-200 per day. Thane district, which is also eligible for a Level 1 unlock, will continue to be on Level 3. Thane collector Rajesh Narvekar said the high positivity rate and low testing rates in select areas, including rural stretches during the last one week, has impacted the overall grading. Meanwhile, in MMR, Thane city and Navi Mumbai will continue at Level 2, while Kalyan-Dombivli goes from Level 2 to Level 3 and due to increase in positivity rate, and Palghar district, including Vasai-Virar corporation, has also gone from Level 2 to Level 3 just in one week. Even Mira Bhayandar corporation, which was at Level 2 last week, has been downgraded to Level 3 in line with the other corporations in Thane district. These changes will come into effect from Monday, June 21. Raigad district, including Panvel civic corporation, will continue at Level 4. Pune city will continue to be in Level 2, while Nashik city is likely to be upgraded to Level 2, and Aurangabad city and district will open up from Monday. In Palghar district, including Vasai-Virar, positivity rate crossed 5.18% and oxygenated bed capacity was 18.24%, said district collector Dr Manek Gursal. Officials said 282 deaths were reported in the district between June 6 and 17. Of these, 146 were in Palghar taluka. District officials said overcrowding was found in several public places. People were not adhering to protocols, including wearing masks. Despite coming under the Level 1 category, KDMC has placed itself in Level 2 and has issued a notification allowing shops and malls to open from Monday, while cinema halls and wedding halls can operate with 50% capacity. Mira Bhayander municipal corporation, which was upgraded to Level 2 last week, returns to Level 3. “We have a positivity rate of 1.5% and bed occupancy is 8%. But with neighbouring areas being or going for Level 3, we have decided to follow suit as a precaution,” said Dilip Dhole, MBMC commissioner. At the state level, the weekly positivity rate has dropped to 5.24% and oxygen bed occupancy is 13.5% Also, the total bed occupancy in absolute numbers now is 16,570, down from 20,167 last week. Currently, only three districts--Raigad, Ratnagiri and Kolhapur--have a positivity rate of over10%, but that too is on the decline. Kolhapur has the highest positivity rate of 13.7%.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: PMC depositors welcome ‘first step towards bank restoration’||MUMBAI: It was as if “the sun came out” on Friday for the weary depositors of PMC Bank who have waited a year and a half to recover their money. Lakhs of account holders have deposits ranging from a couple of lakhs to crores of rupees in the cooperative bank that went bust in September 2019. On Friday, Reserve Bank of India’s in-principle approval of PMC's takeover by Centrum Finance brought them relief and cheer. Although the takeover process could take months to fructify, common account holders burdened by healthcare bills during the ongoing pandemic are pleased light is shining at the end of the tunnel. Clifford D’Souza, a senior citizen from Andheri East, underwent a long spell of hospitalisation from March 10 to 25 due to Covid-19. He said on Friday, “Fortunately I was able to withdraw Rs 3.5 lakh for my treatment, thanks to the RBI guidelines that provide for emergency funds for PMC depositors who suffer from corona. So my liability in PMC Bank has reduced. I have only a fraction of my deposit left.” D’Souza cautions the road to recovery could take up to a year. “It remains to be seen how the liability of PMC Bank is addressed. It is not as if all account holders can line up outside their branches right away and demand to withdraw their money. Only once the road map is designed and the fine print released can all depositors be assured that they will recover their investment,” he said. Arati Salgaonkar, a public relations professional from Veera Desai Road, said, “There is much excitement on our PMC WhatsApp groups. This news comes as a huge relief because many people had given up hope. Of course we knew takeover negotiations were underway, but the actual announcement brings ecstasy. Hundreds of people have worked so hard to make this happen, writing to the finance minister, the Prime Minister and the Reserve Bank of India. This victory is a group effort.” Another depositor, Anita Lohia, said, “It’s a great victory for PMC warriors who fought tirelessly. We have held more than 100 protests, written thousands of tweets and mails to the authorities, met most of the Central and state ministers and finally got the results of our hard work. Our ‘never give up’ attitude finally won. Satyamev Jayate.” A PMC employee from the western suburbs expressed hope that the path ahead would be smooth. “We are being paid less than half our salaries, so one can imagine the pressure, especially in these stressful days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pmc-depositors-welcome-first-step-towards-bank-restoration/articleshow/83643234.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

While leaving this world, the 55-year-old, who was declared brain-dead on Thursday, ensured that her organs give a new lease of life to five and bring smiles to many faces. The Patel family, hailing from Gandevi of Navsari district, decided to donate Kalpnaben’s organs after doctors declared her brain dead. The process was initiated late last night and organ harvesting of her two kidneys, a liver and two corneas was done on Friday morning. “My mother was a religious person and she never shied away from helping others. She always wanted everyone to be happy and smiling. By donating her organs, we will bring smiles to the faces of the members of the five families whose loved ones would get a new lease of life. It’s a perfect tribute to my mother,” Pratik, Kalpnaben’s son, said. Incidentally, as many as 19 organs have been donated in the last 12 days in Surat with the families of three brain-dead patients coming forward to support the noble cause. As per her family, Kalpnaben complained of high blood pressure and suffered from paralysis on June 3. She was rushed to a local hospital in Gandevi town. After primary treatment, she was referred to a private hospital in Surat where she was diagnosed with brain haemorrhage. Kalpnaben underwent a brain surgery but her condition didn’t improve. On Thursday, doctors declared her brain-dead and informed Donate Life founder Nilesh Mandlewala about her. “As soon as we received the message, we reached the hospital and met her family members including her sons — Pratik and Vivek — and explained the importance of organ donations. They agreed for organ donation as they wanted to help others,” Mandlewala told TOI. After receiving the consent for cadaver donation, Mandlewala informed State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) convener Dr Pranjal Modi in Ahmedabad. The two kidneys and a liver were allotted to Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Centre (IKDRC) for transplantation. Two corneas were donated to Surat-based Lok Drishti Eye bank. Kalpnaben is survived by her husband Thakorbhai, two sons Pratik and Vivek and two daughters Hetal and Jinal. Vivek works as a safety officer in Hajira-based company while Pratik is employed as engineer in state-run ONGC in Ankleshwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/brain-dead-navsari-woman-writes-new-chapter-in-5-lives/articleshow/83648639.cms||---
---||Mumbai||TMC to build govt building on lines of Mantralaya||THANE: Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) will construct a unified government building on the lines of Mantralaya in Thane to house all local level state and central government departments located in station area premises, in a bid to free up horizontal space in the area. TMC was asked to step in and prepare a detailed report by cabinet minister Eknath Shinde during a presentation of the project recently before the urban development department. The project, in the conceptual stage for a few years, may now inch towards reality, said officials. There are 25 offices of various departments, including the tehsildar, public works and revenue departments, zilla parishad and forest officials, among others, operating from old structures. The idea, said officials, was to decongest the station area and use the freed-up space for parking and recreation. A saleable component will be made available to make the project lucrative, hinted a TMC official. “A huge parking lot for 2,500 vehicles is being considered,” said Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tmc-to-build-govt-building-on-lines-of-mantralaya/articleshow/83643500.cms||Manoj Badgeri

---||Kolkata||Tolly technicians return to studios but some issues still need attention||KOLKATA: Life in Tollywood returned to normal on Friday after more than a month of shooting at home and on the floor without technicians. Viewers, who were in a lather as the charm of watching soaps had run dry, are happy that they will not have to watch unprofessionally-shot serials now.  Actor Vivaan Ghosh was thrilled to meet his technician friends on the sets of ‘Krishnakali’. “Shooting is a teamwork. Working with technician friends is like oxygen for me,” Ghosh said.  Actress Ushasie Chakraborty was having a tough time using hair extensions while shooting at home. “I am so relieved to get to work with hairdressers Moonmoon Dutta and Moonmoon Marik now. Biswajit Mondal has ensured that my makeup doesn’t look patchy. Finally, I am looking like the character of June Aunty that I was playing,” she said. However, some grievances still remain and state minister Aroop Biswas, who is also the chairperson of Telly Academy, chairperson of Trinamool Congress’ cultural cell Raj Chakraborty and actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee are now trying to iron them out. “We are going to hear both sides and find a roadmap to ensure that no glitches remain,” Chakraborty said,” Chakraborty said. More clarity is required regarding the signing of an MoU between Federation of Cine Technicians & Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI) and Welfare Association of Television Producers (WATP) that is supposedly required to start shooting any new serials in Tollywood. “We have some differences of opinion that need to be settled,” said director Saibal Banerjee, president of WATP. The issue of signing an MOU is a bone of contention. “We have been waiting for two years and nine months for them to sign the MOU,” FCTWEI president Swarup Biswas had earlier told TOI. One of the clauses in the MoU requires WATP to seek written permission from FCTWEI for shooting a project for over 23 days in a month. A producer on conditions of anonymity said, “Keeping in mind the norms of the Competition Commission of India, it will be problematic for WATP to sign any MoU with FCTWEI where they agree that no technician will be allowed to work without the unique card that is issued by FCTWEI. That effectively means producers have to promise to only work with technicians from FCTWEI. At the most, WATP can agree to an MoU on matters ensuring the welfare of technicians according to the law of the land.” Chatterjee said, “As far as the MOU and other issues are concerned, we will ensure that in the coming week all differences are ironed out and communication between all grieving parties is transparent and prompt.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tolly-technicians-return-to-studios-but-some-issues-still-need-attention/articleshow/83650283.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Mumbaikars head to Thane, N Mum as malls, evening dine-in shut in city||Mumbai: While Mumbai continues with Level 3 restrictions which allow for limited opening up of retail outlets and restaurants, neighbouring Thane and Navi Mumbai have been hosting customers and patrons from the city as malls are operational there and dine-in in eateries and shops open as per normal business hours. Retailers and retaurateurs say this has hit business in Mumbai. Being at Level 3, the city has not been allowed to reopen its malls and multiplexes and it must shut dine-in at restaurants after 4pm and on weekends. In Thane, Navi Mumbai and Pune, malls, multiplexes and restaurants have been allowed to operate at 50% capacity and shops as per regular business hours as they fall in the Level 2 category. Rima Kirtikar, chief marketing officer at Viviana Mall, Thane, said retailers at their facility have been getting customers from Mumbai. Jayesh Sharma from Mumbai visited his friends in Thane recently to celebrate a professional achievement. “A few of my colleagues and friends stay in Thane and the suburbs and we thought of celebrating there as restaurants are open till late,” he said. Business owners in the city are upset. Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR), too, said Thane and Navi Mumbai have been pulling in Mumbaikars. “Towards the weekend, a lot of people are moving for recreation beyond Mumbai, causing losses to restaurants and shops in the city which have been in a precarious financial condition since the first lockdown,” said Shivanand Shetty, president, AHAR. Senior state government officials said due to porous borders between different cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, imposing strict restrictions in one city while allowing more relaxations in another may not help keep the Covid-19 infection in check. Vihar Paymode, co-owner of a night club in Thane, said they too have been getting customers from Kalyan and Mumbai. Sherry Bhatia, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), said, “Over 80% of a restaurant’s business happens in the evening hours and on weekends but we are not allowed to operate during these prime hours. Keeping a restaurant open only during the day translates into more expense than revenue.” Bhatia added the government has turned down their request for discounting fees due to the lockdown and paying excise licence fee in installments. Viren Shah, president, Federation of Retail Traders’ Welfare Association, said he has approached NCP chief Sharad Pawar regarding the BMC not opening up the city despite it being eligible for a Level 1 unlock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaikars-head-to-thane-n-mum-as-malls-evening-dine-in-shut-in-city/articleshow/83647799.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

Sachin Chavan (38) worked as a tour and travel agent and part-time auto driver. A bank in 2012 had lodged a complaint against 59 credit cooperative societies’ office-bearers for manipulating loan documents and cheating it of Rs 119 crore. “The bank had sanctioned loans to more than 500 persons who applied through the 59 cooperative societies. Some amount was repaid. When the bank probed it, it found many loan documents were manipulated/forged,” said a police officer. He added that in some cases, while genuine documents of an account holder (in the credit society) were used while seeking a loan, the money was given to some other persons. The bank then got police to file an FIR. “In the case of Chavan, former chairman of Aniruddha credit co-operative society, a Rs 4-crore loan was taken from the bank. Only some amount was repaid,” said police, adding that Chavan was into booking luxury bus tickets for commuters. “Sometime, he would drive an autorickshaw to earn money,” the officer said. Police probed 14 societies and arrested 32 persons. Aniruddha has gone into liquidation, said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-credit-soc-ex-chairman-held-in-rs-4cr-loan-cheating-case-by-eow/articleshow/83652700.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Party president, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, will address party workers and office bearers online, instead of holding traditional grand-scale celebrations. The party has asked all shakha pramukh (branch heads) to hold hoisting of saffron flags at their respective Sena shakhas on Saturday morning and has suggested they hold social and health awareness programmes such as blood donation camps while adhering to Covid norms. A Sena leader said due to the pandemic and the threat of a third wave, the party has decided to celebrate the fundation day in a low-key manner and avoid gatherings. “Considering the pandemic situation, we have asked party workers not to organise events that will encourage crowds. Instead, they can organise health awareness programmes while strictly adhering to Covid norms,” said the leader.

---||Lucknow||19 TA jawans to get terminal gratuity: Military tribunal||LUCKNOW: The armed forces tribunal circuit bench, Nainital, under regional bench, Lucknow, has directed the defence ministry and other respondents, including additional director general of territorial army (TA) to grant terminal gratuity services to 19 jawans, who moved the bench after being denied post-retirement dues. Majority jawans had served in the army for two decades and after retirement joined Territorial Army (Ecological Kumaon) 130 Infantry battalion. Further, they crossed their service tenure of minimum five years, which is essential for terminal gratuity eligibility. But, after retirement, all 19 were denied gratuity. As per the tribunal order copy, the provision for terminal gratuity was discontinued in Territorial Army in 2018. Also, jawans at time of enrolment were apprised on terms of engagement in Ecological Battalion and specifically told that terminal gratuity would not be granted. “This was accepted and signed by applicants,” stated the government counsel. The government counsel also argued that since applicants were already getting service pension for the previous service in army, their claim for grant of terminal gratuity does not stand. However, petitioners argued since they joined TA way before the Government of India order, they are entitled to terminal gratuity as their services shall be governed by old rules. Overruling the TA argument, AFT bench head by Justice Umesh Chandra Srivastava and Vice Admiral Abhay Raghunath Karve stated applicants are entitled to terminal benefits for services in Territorial Army as per pension regulations. “It is a sound principle of jurisprudence that a prior law is not easily held to be abrogated by a posterior law, expressed in general terms and by the apparent generality of its language applicable to and covering cases, of which the particular law is but one. The bench cited the Supreme Court judgement in the case of Union of India vs Sri Somasundaram Vishwanath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/19-ta-jawans-to-get-terminal-gratuity-military-tribunal/articleshow/83652644.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Pradhyman Nagar police booked the owner Himanshu Mehta (43) and detained him. Inspector LL Chavda said, “We have detained Mehta because he had full knowledge of the prostitution racket thriving in his hotel.” Meanwhile, cops also found the mother and two brothers of the minor girl who was rescued from the hotel during Thursday’s raid. Along with the minor, who is 16 years old, police also found a woman from Maharashtra who was forced into prostitution in the hotel. Police had arrested Prabhudas Kakad and Jayshree Chavda who were operating the racket and hotel manager Mehul Chotalia on Thursday on the basis of the statement of the woman. Cops had gone to the hotel following information that a minor girl from Uttar Pradesh was confined inside a room that was booked by a person named Santosh. Investigation revealed that Santosh owns a factory in the Aji Dam area where the minor’s family members were working. All are natives of UP. Police claim that the minor had eloped with Santosh two months ago and he had booked the room to keep her in the hotel. It is, however, not clear how Santosh could afford to keep the girl for such a long time in the hotel room and pay the rent. Deputy commissioner of police, Manoharsinh Jadeja said, “We are still recording statements of the girl’s family members and have also got contact of Santosh who is in UP.” Jadeja claimed Santosh has agreed to return to Rajkot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/sex-racket-thrived-inside-hotel-with-owners-knowledge/articleshow/83648786.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Why can’t roadways employees be paid Rs 20 crore from CM relief fund; asks Uttarakhand high court||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court on Friday asked the state government why it cannot release Rs 20 crore from the CM’s relief fund to pay the salaries of the roadways workers, whose wages have been pending since February. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma said that it can see no point why the money is not being released. “... That was the only purpose the fund was created for,” the judges said. The HC’s remarks came while it was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) highlighting that the roadways workers have not received their salaries for months and that the state transport corporation has no funds to pay the wages, amounting to more than Rs 90 crore. The chairman of the state transport corporation, Ashish Chauhan, who was present in the hearing, informed the court that they have already asked the state government for the money but have only received an assurance that a soft loan of Rs 20 crore will be extended to them. Chauhan told the court that the corporation had asked the government to release Rs 20 crore from the CM relief fund but is yet to receive any money from the government. The court has now directed the state government to respond within a week about the status of the soft loan and whether the money will be released from the CM relief fund. Meanwhile, the court has also directed the government to state whether the government plans to acquire the land belonging to the corporation which is located on the Haridwar road in Dehradun and if it is willing to pay Rs 250 crore for the property. The HC had last year stayed the sale of land belonging to the transport corporation since the state was “paying a meagre amount of about Rs 20 crore as compared to the market value of the land which is estimated to be around Rs 250 crore.” The HC on Friday again asked the government if it would pay the market price for the land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/why-cant-roadways-employees-be-paid-rs-20-crore-from-cm-relief-fund-asks-uttarakhand-hc/articleshow/83648278.cms||Prashant Jha

In the video, Vidya is seen getting poetic while sharing her fabulous experiences in MP during the film shoot. “I got a chance to spend time in MP during the shoot of my film ‘Sherni’ and discovered some stunning places and landscapes. The waterfalls and forests there, gave me a lot of peace while the colourful culture of MP provided real happiness to my soul. Greenery of its jungles refreshed me and I found myself there. It was heartening to see that these jungles have been lovingly nurtured by people of Madhya Pradesh.” According to a senior official of MP Tourism Board, Vidya also enjoyed the local cuisine and shopped for some exotic handlooms of the state, which are popular across the world. MD of tourism board, however, made it clear that thrust right now is on safe and responsible tourism because that is the only way to beat the pandemic cycle and ensure the safety of everyone. He said, there are other steps which are also being taken across the state for complete safety of tourists. “Almost 100 per cent of our frontline hospitality staff has been vaccinated and we also request the tourists to get themselves vaccinated, so that they stay safe. We follow strict Covid protocol at all the destinations and expect our tourists to be responsible as well. They must ensure there are no excesses on nature. While our endeavour is definitely to increase the tourist footfall, we also aim to reduce the carbon footprint, substantially,” said Shukla. Tourism secretary said, post pandemic, people need to heal from within and MP has the most out-of-the-box wellness destinations, which are set in the bosom of nature, away from the hustle bustle of regular hill stations. “Right from spiritual tourism spots to heritage, archaeological and wildlife destinations, our tourism landmarks are set in a wide expanse. So people can come and beat their lockdown blues and rejuvenate themselves, here,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/i-found-myself-in-mp-jungles-says-vidya-balan/articleshow/83650315.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi
---||Delhi||Delhi: Baba ka Dhaba owner in ICU after suicide bid||NEW DELHI: A few months ago, during the days of privation due to the Covid-19 lockdown, Kanta Prasad shot to fame after a YouTuber posted a video of the octogenarian in tears at not being able to earn anything at his small Baba ka Dhaba in south Delhi. The old man is again in the news. Apparently, he tried to kill himself on Thursday. His family informed the media that he is now recovering in a hospital. Atul Thakur, DCP (South) said on Friday that police received information from Safdarjung Hospital around 11.15pm on Thursday about Prasad being admitted there. “A police officer reached the hospital and collected the medico legal case document, which mentioned intake of alcohol and sleeping pills as the cause of Prasad being found unconscious” said Thakur. “In his statement, Kanta Prasad’s son, Karan, said his father had consumed alcohol and sleeping pills. Further enquiries are being undertaken.” On Friday, Karan told TOI that his father had been depressed for the past few days. Apparently, the elderly man was caught up in some controversy over the events following the social media attention he got last year and the help that poured in from sympathetic citizens. “He didn’t run the dhaba on Thursday though he went there,” said Karan. “Around 3.30pm, his condition deteriorated and we rushed him to a nearby hospital from where he was referred to Safdarjung. He is admitted to the ICU.” Last October, Prasad and his wife, Badami Devi, shot to instant fame after a video of the teary-eyed dhaba operator went viral. The day later, the nondescript dhaba at Malviya Nagar had serpentine queues of customers from early morning. The couple received cash and stocks of food items from people across India. They were flooded with offers of sponsorships from companies, while a few even proposed opening Baba ka Dhaba franchises in other states. The couple was also able to undergo free cataract surgery. However, their story turned ugly in the first week of November when Prasad went to the cops alleging financial irregularities by the YouTuber, Gaurav Wasan, who had posted the video and triggered off the wave of contributions, both financial and in kind, for the old couple. However, Prasad was criticised by people on social media for acting against the man whose video had not only made him famous, but also helped him weather the lockdown penury. Prasad was in the news again when he opened a restaurant in December last year. “My brother and I oversaw the restaurant’s operations while my father continued to run his dhaba,” said Karan. “The dhaba was closed for some days after my parents’ cataract surgery. The restaurant did not prove successful because its location was not right.” News recently surfaced of both the restaurant shutting down and Prasad apologising to Wasan for his allegations. The YouTuber told TOI, “After Baba apologised to me, I went to meet him. I forgave him.” Tushant Adhlaka, who helped Prasad open the restaurant, said, “Baba has changed his view about the complaint he lodged against Wasan. I don’t know why he did that. I met him last in February, but he called me a few times after that and spoke normally to me.” He added, “Even after starting his restaurant, Baba continued to run his old dhaba. Perhaps his sons did not devote proper time to the restaurant. The restaurant’s business was also affected by the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bitter-turn-months-after-lockdown-lifeline-depressed-baba-gives-up-hope/articleshow/83652706.cms||Sakshi Chand

The incident happened on Thursday and was recorded by a bystander, in which four persons of an extended family can be seen chopping off the legs of the dog one by one, using an axe. The fourth leg of the dog was left unharmed since he was tied with a rope through it so that he couldn’t run away. The 1.52-second-video went viral, in which the four persons were seen hitting the axe with full force, leaving the dog in severe pain. The accused showed no mercy towards the injured dog and moved around him to see him tormented by the pain. The eyewitness told police the accused had left the place while the dog was profusely bleeding. The other two accused out of the police net are two brothers, Sonu and Jeetu Meena. “The owner of the dog, Kaluram Meena got to know about the incident and rushed to the spot to see his dog in a pool of blood. He took the injured dog to the veterinary hospital but it was too late. The dog died due to excessive blood loss from the body,” said Ram Bhajan Meena, ASI, Reni police station. Kaluram confronted the accused, who turned out to be his neighbours and filed a case against them in the police station. Disclosing the reason behind the brutal attack, Ram Bhajan told TOI, “The accused were under the impression that the dog killed their goat which went missing on Wednesday. They were waiting for the right time to take revenge and abducted the dog on Thursday morning from the farmland.” “The remaining two accused will also be nabbed soon,” said the police. People for Animal, state coordinator Babulal Jaju told TOI that the gravity of the crime is akin to a brutal murder. “Our demand is that Alwar police should treat the case as a cold-blooded murder and book the accused in the non-bailable offence,” said Jaju.

---||Delhi||Farmers’ protest regains steam, so do Covid fears||Ghaziabad: The number of protesters swelled at UP Gate on Friday after farmers arrived in large groups from Udham Singh Nagar, Shahjahanpur and Bulandshahr in tractor trolleys to prop up the agitation, which hasn’t had wind in its sails of late because of the pandemic and cane season commitments. The renewed crowd helped the protest regain steam but also immediately triggered concerns about the spread of infection with masks scarcely visible among the large gathering. The farmers said since their work in the fields was over and Covid cases had started to subside, they had decided to return to the protest site where they have been agitating since November last year. The return of the farmers is part of a roster prepared by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) to increase numbers at UP Gate. According to the formula, specific dates would be given to farmers from a cluster of districts to reach the protest site. Commuters bore the brunt, meanwhile. Milan Kumar, who had to reach his Connaught Place office for a meeting around 11am, was almost an hour late. “This is after I left home around 9.30am. I had a very important meeting with my seniors in office but had to cancel it because I got stuck in the snarl,” he said. Ramanand Kushwaha, SP (traffic), agreed they had been informed about the movement of farmers towards UP Gate. “We had made arrangements for smooth traffic. But the farmers occupied one of the lanes and this led to the snarl. A police team reached the spot and guided vehicles going towards the Delhi side,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farmers-protest-regains-steam-so-do-covid-fears/articleshow/83652701.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

Maharashtra is in the process of amending its law to neutralise the ill-effects of the central legislation on farmers. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been asking for the protesting farmers’ demands to be met too, according to SKM. Governments led by other parties in a few other states have stood with the farmers’ movement and joined their calls for countrywide action. Even BJP’s own leaders have been asking the central government to resolve the farmers’ issues, it said. “This is what the government ought to be prioritising, not a slander and defamation campaign,” stated the morcha. It also stated that feeling the BJP government was not serious on remunerative prices of crops, farmers across the country had started demanding minimum support price (MSP) as a legal guarantee for all. Responding to a call by All India Kisan Sabha, farmers organised protests demanding guaranteed remunerative price of milk at least Rs 35 per litre in 20 districts of Maharashtra on Thursday. The Covid pandemic and lockdowns have resulted in milk price crashing to nearly Rs 20 per litre, stated SKM on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/more-state-govts-for-repeal-of-farm-laws/articleshow/83652696.cms||---

AAP workers gathered outside Gandhi Park in Dehradun wearing black armbands as a mark of protest against the BJP government. Party workers raised slogans against the government claiming that it failed in the last 100 days. "The 100-day tenure of Tirath Singh Rawat has been very disappointing. People have felt cheated under the regime of both Trivendra Singh Rawat and the current CM," said Vishal Chaudhary, vice-president of AAP Uttarakhand. He alleged that not a single work was done during the tenure of this government and at the same time the "rapid testing scam that came to the fore in Kumbh has put the state to shame". Blaming the ruling party, Chaudhary said, "Earlier, BJP gave zero work CM to the state. Now, it has given a zero vision CM to the people who have now made up their mind to give the answer to BJP in the 2022 assembly elections."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/100-days-of-tirath-govt-aap-holds-protest-in-assembly-constituencies/articleshow/83648375.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Dehradun||Himachal receives huge tourist influx; Uttarakhand hoteliers also hope for spike in footfall||MUSSOORIE/DEHRADUN: While Himachal Pradesh did away with the mandatory RT-PCR requirement for tourists a week ago, those entering Uttarakhand are still needed to carry a Covid-negative certificate. This, coupled with the fact that most shops are closed due to the ongoing Covid curfew in the state, has led tourists to rush to Himachal while Uttarakhand has received only a lukewarm footfall, the state’s hoteliers have alleged. “We are not looking for a massive tourist influx, since we are aware of the risks involved. We just want enough tourists to visit so that our business stays afloat. Currently, tourists stay locked up in their rooms for most part of the day due to the curfew. When they can go out, there aren’t many places to go as most attractions are shut due to the lockdown,” said Rajkumar Kanoujia, joint secretary of Mussoorie Hotels Association. The peak season of June was a washout in 2020, as was most of this year’s summer season, but now, hotels in Mussoorie have had 50% occupancy for the first time in two months. Hoteliers said they believed once the markets open up and the curfew is relaxed, like Himachal, Uttarakhand, too, will receive decent tourist footfall. “Himachal has relaxed Covid curbs and is certainly getting more footfall than Uttarakhand. We do have decent bookings for the weekend and believe once the shops and tourist spots are opened, we will see a spurt in tourism. The current tourist footfall is encouraging, we hope more hotels will be able to open up as tourism picks up,” said Sandeep Sahni, president of Uttarakhand Hotel Association. He added that only about 60% of hotels in the town have opened up and gradually more hotels are expected to open. Some days back, a delegation of Doon Valley Hotel and Restaurant Association had met chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat, seeking government intervention to save the tourism sector. They pointed out that effectively, hotels had operated for only three out of the last 15 months. They requested the CM to lift the RT-PCR requirement on tourists and allow hotels to operate at 50% to 75% occupancy. They also sought a guarantee from the government that no lockdown would be announced in a last-minute fashion in the future, saying closing down banquet halls, restaurants etc on “short notice” with “little or no warning” is an expensive affair. When contacted, state agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal told TOI, “Seeing the decline in Covid numbers, we are planning a phase-wise unlock from June 22. However, allowing tourists who are fully or partially vaccinated (without a Covid test) is unlikely as they can still be carriers. However, we can opt for antigen tests at entry points for tourists. In a day or two, we will release our SOPs for the week commencing June 22.” He added that it was not possible to start the Char Dham Yatra before July 1. “Our preparations are underway and we will take a decision taking all factors into account,” Uniyal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/himachal-receives-huge-tourist-influx-ukhand-hoteliers-also-hope-for-spike-in-footfall/articleshow/83648371.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Chandigarh||Farm groups: BJP outburst part of slanderous drive||Bathinda: Farm groups have termed BJP leaders and supporters’ outbursts against farmer protests as a part of a slanderous campaign linked to the saffron party’s defeat in three states, especially West Bengal, in May. The claim comes two days after a man was burnt alive near the Tikri border protest site. His family had accused the protesters for the death. The BJP’s campaign, according to farm groups, points to a fear psychosis in BJP leadership, which fears a repeat of its dwindling political fortunes in the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. A day after the Tikri death, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had on Thursday night stated that incidents of violence and immoral acts were on the rise at farmer protest sites. “After Manohar Lal Khattar met Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday, it is reported that on the grounds of inappropriate incidents at the protest sites, and deteriorating law and order, a crackdown is being planned. But we warn against such efforts. The government has repeatedly failed in the past and will fail now too,” said Sanyukta Kisan Morcha leaders, including Darshan Pal. “In a democracy, the government is expected to accept legitimate demands of protesters, but the BJP government is unnecessarily prolonging this agitation, defaming it and hoping that it will just dissipate. This is not going to happen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-groups-bjp-outburst-part-of-slanderous-drive/articleshow/83652736.cms||Neel Kamal

Assistant municipal commissioners of all 10 zones have issued notices to all such property owners — both residential and commercial — under relevant sections of the MRTP Act. After conducting a survey to identify unauthorised structures, all 10 zones have submitted the report to the NMC’s anti-encroachment department for further action. The zonal offices have acted against 337 property owners, who have either violated sanctioned plan or constructed without seeking permission from the NMC’s town planning department, while 731 such property owners have escaped action so far. Of the remaining, 90 property owners have approached the court, while 60 have submitted revised sanction plan and 125 have moved the state urban development department in Mumbai to get their illegal structures regularized. As per the survey, Laxmi Nagar zone accounted for the highest number of illegal structures at 288, while Ashi Nagar zone 286, Gandhibagh 177, Mangalwari 167, Dharampeth 143, Satranjipura 78 and Dhantoli zone 65 (for list of all 10 zones please see box). Gandhibagh, Dharampeth and Mangalwari zones have a huge chunk of illegal commercial structures, the survey revealed. Though the state government had in December 2020 implemented unified development control and promotion regulations (DCR) paving way for regularizing illegal constructions, it received poor response. Only 60 property owners — mostly from Laxmi Nagar (15) and Ashi Nagar (19) — got their illegal constructions regularized by paying the requisite fee and penalty. Most unauthorized buildings have been constructed trampling on the prevailing DCR and dusting off all construction criteria due to political patronage and disregard to the town planning department, sources alleged. Apart from bending FSI rules, in most cases unauthorized constructions were found violating the sanctioned plans. Therefore, it is impossible to redevelop these buildings as per rules, once they are in disrepair. “The unified DCR provides an increased FSI required for redevelopment and paves the way for providing a secure shelter to the beneficiaries of illegal constructions,” said an official from the civic body. A senior official claimed the civic body will launch a special drive against illegal properties soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1348-illegal-buildings-in-city-nmc-action-against-337-only/articleshow/83650363.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The news of the youth atop the tower brought the area SDM and police to the spot. They spent some four hours trying to persuade the youth, identified as Mohammed Mueen, 22, to come down. When he finally climbed down, the youth claimed he went up the tower “for fresh air”. “ It was too hot and I wanted to relax in a cool environment, therefore, I went to the top of the tower. Now, I am feeling good,” Mueen told the police. According to police, some villagers had spotted the youth sitting atop the tower and alerted the authorities. MS Gill, station house officer of the Budhana police station, said, “He was handed over to his family after a medical examination. He is fit and fine. A written warning was also given to him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/youth-climbs-atop-mobile-tower-for-fresh-air-sending-mngr-admin-into-a-tizzy/articleshow/83648391.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Kamal Nath said that a hundred of these convicts are serving their sentence for rape of girl children. Taking to twitter on Friday, the senior Congress leader said, “There is information that the Shivraj government is preparing to release on parole nearly 400 rapists serving life term in the state.” Nath said that the government is quoting corona spread as the reason for the proposed release on parole. He also alleged that a hundred of these convicts are guilty of allegedly raping innocent little girls. “This decision is highly condemnable,” the former CM tweeted. Kamal Nath also questioned the logic of the decision when the second wave of corona has nearly ended. “When the second wave of corona in the state is on the verge of coming to an end, then many question are being raised on this decision. The state ranks among the top in cases of rapes in the country and there is discontent in the families of victims regarding this decision. The government should immediately stop this decision,” Nath said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/withdraw-decision-to-release-400-rape-convicts-on-parole-nath/articleshow/83650378.cms||---

---||Mumbai||SC restores to Mumbai couple baby ‘orphaned by court’||MUMBAI: A childless city couple have got interim custody of an infant taken away from them over two years ago following a Supreme Court order. The state child welfare committee (CWC) had taken away the child on allegations that the adoption unlawful. While the couple claimed that they had adopted the girl, at present 2.5 years old, legally, the Bombay HC had in March dismissed their plea for a reunion with the child. The biological mother, a single, submitted before the HC and the SC that she willingly gave her child to them for adoption and they had helped her with the birth. The couple’s plea before the SC was that the child was missing out on love and care from them due to “non-purposive interpretation” of law. Admonishing the judicial system for going strictly according to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act without considering the situation the toddler was subjected to, the SC bench said, “Generally, a child is orphaned by natural events (when both parents die). But in this case, the girl was orphaned by order of the court.” The Bombay HC order passed by a bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale had rejected the couple’s contention, made through senior counsel Raja Thakare, that the CWC had acted illegally. Thakare argued that process was valid under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act and the CWC could not invoke provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, under which adoptions follow a separate process. The HC had said it was in the “best interest of the child” that she continues to be in custody of the CWC which placed her in care of a trust that runs an adoption agency. Fearing that the baby may now be placed for adoption, the couple approached the SC. The biological mother of the child supported their petition, with senior counsel Salman Khurshid appearing for her. Thakare, with advocate Siddharth Jagushte, cited a Rajasthan high court judgment of 2004 to submit that adoption under a person law will not be governed by guidelines prescribed for ‘Adoption of Indian Children’ issued by the Centre. Those guidelines are applicable only to children who are orphans and destitute or whose biological parents are not traceable or have relinquished or surrendered their children for adoption. The SC issued a notice to the state government seeking a counter-affidavit from it within three weeks and posting the next hearing after four weeks. It directed that “in the meantime, the custody of the child be handed over to the petitioners”. The couple said the child was born to a domestic help and they had notarised the adoption deed in January 2019, the same month the child was born. In June, the CWC filed a criminal case against them and “immediately took” the child from their legal custody, they alleged. The CWC said the adoption deed was not registered. The HC said it found no indication that the child was adopted under provisions of the Hindu law and that though the mother said the couple gave her Rs 20,000 for medical expenses, the “material on record indicates child was given away to the petitioners in exchange of money”. Childline, an NGO, had told the CWC on January 17 that it felt there was a “possibility” of the biological mother having sold her child. The CWC directed the NGO to supervise the mother and in June 2019 lodged the FIR against the couple in Mumbai, invoking section 80 of JJ Act alleging failure to follow proper adoption procedure. The offence attracts a maximum 3 years in jail or Rs 1 lakh fine or both. The couple termed the FIR “vague and false implication”. The couple, married for 10 years, said the HC had rejected their writ petition erroneously and hence they filed the special leave petition before the apex court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-restores-to-city-couple-baby-orphaned-by-court/articleshow/83654672.cms||Swati Deshpande

For the same, the child commission is looking at engaging youth volunteers who can campaign in rural areas as well as help the children get access to authorities. Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, “On my recent visit to villages in Jodhpur, I interacted with children who have been orphaned and the administration had their details. However, in some villages, there were instances when we found that the children have lost their parents, but no authority was aware of it as the families themselves did not know about the helpline numbers etc. This made us realise that there is a dire need for more campaigning about it in the rural areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/more-awareness-on-govt-aid-for-orphaned-kids-needed-in-rural-areas-officials/articleshow/83650406.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

Farmers have started holding meetings at villages in Jind district to chalk out and implement a strategy in this direction. They also urged people to avoid any confrontation. While they said they would not force anyone to do this, they resolved to take necessary steps if the BJP-JJP government tried to split them at village level. Committees comprising women, youth and people from weaker sections are being formed at village level to keep a close watch on elections and to maintain peace. These will ensure coordination between people from all sections of society as the saffron party is still seeking to defame the farming community. “The selected candidate will ensure development works in villages with more energy. Haryana government is seeking a split and adamant but farmers will foil their so-called divide and rule policy this time too. Moreover, eligible candidates who support farmers’ agitation would be favoured,” several farmers said. Capt (Retd) Randhir Chahal, one of the protesters at Khatkar Toll Plaza said “Jawan and Kisan” were both fighting together to repeal the three anti farmer laws. BKU (Charuni) Jind president Azad Palwa said, “We are preparing to avoid confrontation in the elections as the saffron party will try to create a rift between farmers in the name of sarpanch’s post. BJP’s previous ploy has been foiled by farmers and this time, they are ready to defeat them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-jind-support-sought-for-candidates-against-farm-laws/articleshow/83652759.cms||---

But that was not to be as Idris, booked earlier this week for allegedly giving a communal twist to the June 5 assault of 72-year-old Bulandshahr resident Abdul Samad in Loni, did not make an appearance. Policemen, both in plain clothes and khakis, on their patrol cars and bikes, kept a hawk eye on all routes leading to the district court in the collectorate area, where the Ghaziabad police chief’s office is also located. A local Samajwadi Party functionary, Idris had become involved in the case early. He had earlier this week told TOI he was called by locals to intervene after Samad was assaulted and his beard cut, the video of which started being shared on social media this week. An FIR was filed to investigate the assault on June 5 but it was in connection with another video – in which Samad alleged he had been the target of a hate crime – that two FIRs were filed this week, the first against Twitter, a news portal and six individuals who had shared the video and the second against Idris who, police claim, hosted a Facebook Live session with Samad by his side and allegedly made certain provocative comments. Idris was booked on June 16 under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 505 (publishing or circulating any statement, rumour or report with intent to incite) of the IPC and under Section 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the IT Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/key-figure-in-video-probe-keeps-up-cops-guessing/articleshow/83652798.cms||Abhijay Jha

While allowing the petitioner, Pranvesh, to withdraw the PIL and file a fresh one, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjay Yadav and Justice Prakash Padia observed, “Having gone through the entire petition, we are of the view that the petitioner has not done much research work in respect of rites and customs which are prevalent among various communities living along the bank of river Ganga.” “Therefore, we are not inclined at this stage to cause any indulgence instead to allow the petitioner to withdraw the petition with a liberty to file fresh petition after inquiry and research in respect of the practice of last rites in various communities which are residing along the bank of Ganga," the bench said, adding "with a liberty above, the petition stands disposed of as withdrawn.” The petitioner’s plea was that during the second wave of Covid-19, there were many who succumbed to the disease but were not cremated properly.. He also pleaded before the court to pass order to prevent/stop burial of dead bodies near the river. The court refused to pass ‘any order at this stage’. There was much uproar at the peak of Covid infection in April and May this year when bodies were found buried along the rivers and it was alleged that kin of deceased persons couldn't afford the cost of cremation and hence went for the burial. The state government, however, clarified that it was the tradition among many communities living along the Ganga to bury their dead on the banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-refuses-to-entertain-pil-on-bodies-buried-near-ganga/articleshow/83652821.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Delhi||Delhi: Palika Bazaar traders may move court over service tax on licensing fees||NEW DELHI: Traders of Palika Bazaar are planning to take legal recourse against the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC)’s decision to impose service tax on licensing fees from June 2007 to June 2017. The shopkeepers claim that they have been given only 30 days to submit the tax from the date of receiving the notice. Traders of Palika Bazaar and Sarojini Nagar had recently written to lieutenant governor, chief minister and the NDMC chairman against the decision, calling it “illogical” to charge a lump sum amount for 10 years all of a sudden. “Neither in the licensing deed (during the time of renewal) nor by the officials, the concept of charging service tax was stated to the traders and hence, this could not be claimed lawfully. Further, the amount mentioned in the deed as licensing fees includes all charges and amount, so no question of paying service tax above the licensing fees arises,” the traders’ petition to NDMC stated. “The amount of service tax is being raised based on the market rent/licensing fees of the shops. In Palika Bazaar, the amount is running into lakhs. It is not our fault that the civic body could not raise the bill earlier and now, they are demanding an amount for 10 years in one go. We have gone through our lease deeds and find the charges illogical. The service charge for a shop, which has monthly rent of Rs 50,000, will now go up to Rs 3.5 lakh. If we don’t get a satisfying reply from the authorities, we will be forced to approach the high court,” said Baljit Kohli, president of Palika Bazar Traders’ Association. “We have requested the officials in the NDMC’s estate department to be considerate about our existing situation and give us rebate and extend the deadline to submit the amount,” said Ashok Randhawa of Mini Market Traders’ Association, Sarojini Nagar. A senior NDMC official, however, said that the amount had been raised as per laws. “Moreover, we have already paid the amount on behalf of traders to the Government of India. The demand notices for the outstanding service tax have been sent to all licensees concerned.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-may-move-court-over-service-tax-on-licensing-fees/articleshow/83652867.cms||Vibha Sharma

Police fished out their bodies from a canal on Wednesday. Their respective families identified the bodies. Police suspect that the couple ended their lives because their families were against their relationship. Giving details, Dharamveer Singh, Bijnor superintendent of police, said both were residents of Mahamoodabad village under Sherkot police station area. However, they belonged to different castes and their relationship was not approved by either family. Facing opposition from their families, the 19-year-old youth and the girl, 18, went missing on the evening of June 14. The girl’s family lodged a complaint against the youth, accusing him of abducting their daughter. Police booked the youth under IPC section 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc) and provisions of the SC/ST Act. It was while searching for the girl that the bodies were spotted floating in the canal in Seohara police station area. Prima facie, it seems, that they ended their lives by jumping into the canal as no injury marks were found on their bodies during preliminary investigation. However, police are awaiting the autopsy report before drawing any conclusion. A probe is on, the SSP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/missing-couple-turns-up-dead-in-canal/articleshow/83648439.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Delhi||Car driven by drunk cop rams cab, 1 dies||New Delhi: A 30-year-old man was killed after a speeding car rammed another car on Barapullah flyover late on Friday night. The car driver, a Delhi Police constable, has been arrested. Police have found that the constable was drunk at the time of the accident. The man who died has been identified as Prem Pal, who lived in Mahipalpur and belonged to Jaipur. The arrested constable is Mohit Bhardwaj (35), a resident of Gautam Budhha Nagar. According to police, the accident took place around 10.45 pm. A police team that reached the spot found that a Swift Dzire car driven by one Prem Pal had been rammed by a Mahindra KUV 100 car that Bhardwaj was driving. Initial probe revealed that the Mahindra K100 had hit one Swift Dzire cab from the rear and Prem Pal, the driver of the cab, sustained critical injuries. “He was rushed to the hospital where he succumbed to his fatal wounds. His body was then sent for a postmortem examination and family members were informed. A forensics team was also called on the spot for a detailed inspection,” police said. Further inquiry revealed that the offending vehicle was being driven by Mohit Bhardwaj, a constable in Delhi Police, currently posted in New Delhi district. “On medical examination, it was found that the accused had consumed alcohol and his alcohol level was 63 mg per 100 ml. A case of causing death due to negligence and rash driving was registered against Bhardwaj and he was arrested. Both the vehicles have been seized,” said police. The deceased was not married. His parents live in their native village in Jaipur. A woman named Anu (28) told police that the deceased was living with him and both were in a relationship for the past eight years. Bhardwaj, police said, is a constable in Delhi Police since 2009. He is presently working in the Motor Transport section in New Delhi district. He is married and has one child.

Sharma reportedly said the BJP leaders were in a sickening habit of grabbing headlines. “Rathore counts nowhere; he is neither in Vasundhara Raje camp nor in Satish Poonia camp,” Sharma was quoted.Rathore retorted by tweeting, “You are right, health minister. I am counted nowhere. As a BJP worker I have been elected MLA seven times in a row with people’s love and blessings. Friend, you started your political journey with me, but your working style has been such that you could reach the assembly just twice despite contesting seven elections.”Rathore, who was health minister in the previous BJP government, then attacked Sharma over corona management in the state. “Health minister, you who are guilty of killing thousands due to corona mismanagement in the state, were an expert in getting yourself a red carpet welcome even after sensitive incidents like deaths of children in Kota and in keeping yourself busy being photographed with film actor Salman Khan’s bodyguard during the pandemic.”Rathore added, “You have been a complete failure in improving infrastructure and human resources in the medical field. If you accept my challenge, then why fear a fair investigation into irregularities in medicines, equipment and vaccines by a third party or a retired judge?”Health minister Sharma responded in a series of tweets. “Rathore ji, you contested the first election for Janata Dal in 1980 to defeat former BJP state president Jagdish Prasad Mathur and you got merely 2,000 votes. In 1985, you again contested for Janata Dal from Churu but lost your deposit. In the subsequent elections, you won from Janata Dal, but dissolved the party and joined BJP. I won three elections, including one for Ajmer Lok Sabha, in which the BJP suffered a crushing defeat in all eight assembly segments.”Sharma added, “You too were a health minister, but could not handle the system and the officers would not listen to you. You had then said in Kota that you were ashamed to be the health minister. You should not forget that.”Rathore and Sharma continued to target each other, often in humour and occasionally in poetry, as the Twitterati enjoyed the exchanges at the duo’s cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/present-and-former-health-ministers-attack-each-other-on-twitter/articleshow/83650469.cms||---

The plan is also to use some of the proceeds from the leasing out for repaying the debt the department is looking to raise for the Rs 500 crore tourism development fund announced in the budget.The proposals were discussed in the review meeting by the chief minister on Monday in the presence of chief secretary, principal secretary (finance) Akhil Arora and other senior officials from the tourism department and the government.While it is not clear whether the Rs 500 crore budget allocation for the tourism development fund hinges on the success of the leasing out RTDC hotels, one thing is sure that the finance department is against pumping money into a corporation whose financial condition has gone from bad to worse with half-hearted revival attempts in the past.“We will explore all the options including taking funds from the government and raising debt for the Rs 500-crore tourism development fund. The government will support us for development fund, if required we will raise debt. We are keeping all the options open. We will work out with the government whether RTDC lease out money will be used to repay the debt,” said Gayatri Rathore, principal secretary, department of tourism.According to multiple sources who attended the review meeting, the chief secretary said that RTDC’s losses of over Rs 170 crore is not unmanageable given the size of its underlying assets. As part of the restructuring plan, the chief minister had allocated Rs 10 crore in 2021-22 budget for the renovation of seven RTDC operated midway motels. In the previous year budget, the hotels of the corporation were allowed to open retail liquor shops to shore up their profits.Rathore said the restructuring will take time and they are working on it. That will take a little bit of time but we are on it. “We have to look at the ownership and title of the properties and the legality for restructuring. It will take time.”According to the sources, the department is planning to lease out the hotels for 20 years which will not result in ownership change.In the meantime, the employees union of RTDC has given calls for staging protests against the leasing out. “The government never took revival seriously and it was a piecemeal approach. There some hotels which are making profits and others can also make profit. It’s the government which has failed to run the corporation properly. We will launch agitation across the state if the government goes ahead with its leasing out exercise and reverse deputation of employees,” said Tej Singh Rathore, president of RTDC employees association.GFXRTDC Tourist unitsUnits Operational closed units TotalHotels 25 16 41Midway (motels) 5 17 22Cafeteria 4 4 8Dormitories 0 3 3Total 34 40 74||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-begins-process-to-lease-out-rtdc-hotels/articleshow/83650498.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Hyderabad||Drug cocktail a game changer, say Hyderabad doctors||HYDERABAD: With several variants of the novel coronavirus in circulation causing mild to severe infection, Hyderabad doctors vouch for monoclonal antibody cocktail for quick and effective result in controlling the viral load. About 100 Covid-19 patients have so far undergone antibody cocktail treatment at various hospitals in the city with successful outcomes. Most of the patients were discharged the same day. City doctors describe the cocktail of casirivimab and imdevimab, the two monoclonal antibody drugs currently in use in India, as a game changer in treating cases within the first seven days of infection. Stating that cocktail drug is effective in reducing requirement for hospitalisation in about 70% of eligible patients, Dr KB Chetan Reddy, consultant physician and critical care specialist, AIG Hospitals, Gachibowli, said monoclonal antibody treatment is a game changer provided it is given within the seven days of onset of symptoms. The cocktail is becoming popular as it administered as outpatient treatment and the patient can leave for home after one hour of observation. According to Dr Suneetha Narreddy, consultant, infectious diseases, Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills, data shows that the cocktail works best within three days of symptom onset and is efficacious up to seven days from symptom onset. The emergency use authorisation approval is for up to 10 days of infection (symptoms). “High viral load is present usually up to first five days of symptom onset. Hence, this medicine is best given within five days of symptom onset,” she said, adding that though the recommended dose is 1,200 mg, the cocktail works even at a lower dose of 600 mg. Explaining how the cocktail works, Dr Bruno Jolain, chief medical officer, Roche Pharma India, said monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful pathogens such as viruses. They are specifically directed against the spike protein of the novel coronavirus. “The cocktail remains efficacious against widest spread variants and reduces the risk of losing its neutralisation potency against new emerging variants,” Dr Bruno said. In-vitro assay studies showed the K417N mutation has no impact on the neutralising activity of the cocktail, he said. Dr Hari Kishan Gonuguntla, lead, interventional pulmonology, Yashoda Hospitals, Secunderabad, said the cocktail can avoid hospital admission, besides being cost-effective. “There are no major side effects. This is going to be the standard of care for mild to moderate disease with high risk of progression that could prevent hospitalisation and mortality to a larger extent,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drug-cocktail-a-game-changer-docs/articleshow/83650537.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Delhi||Such breach of Covid norms will hasten third wave: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: A concerned Delhi High Court took suo motu cognisance of violations of Covid-19 protocols in various markets of the city, cautioning that such a breach will only “hasten” the third wave and can’t be permitted. “We have paid a huge price in the second wave. Yet people behave in this manner. It is unfortunate. We don’t know if there is any household which has not suffered in the second wave, closely or remotely,” a bench of justices Navin Chawla and Asha Menon remarked after an AIIMS doctor shared certain photographs with an HC judge of markets being crowded. “We as a citizen of this city are worried when we see these images,” the court said, adding that “such breach will only hasten the third wave, which is likely to come, and this cannot be permitted.” “If this behaviour of flouting Covid-19 norms continues, we will be in great trouble. God help us if all that happens.” Issuing notice, it asked the Centre and Delhi government to take strict measures, sensitise shopkeepers and hold meetings with market and vendor associations in this regard. It also sought a status report from governments and Delhi Police. Observing that people need deterrence but it should come from within, the court fixed the next hearing on July 9, directing that the matter be placed before the Chief Justice. While the authorities assured the court that strict measures are already being taken to ensure the protocol is maintained in markets and also followed by street vendors, the bench said that certainly more measures were required to be taken. “It can be in the form of more interactions with market and vendor associations and more civil defence and police personnel being deployed at markets and hawkers’ places.” The high court said, “Government officials and bureaucrats must apply their minds to normalise the lives of Delhiites with compliance to all the protocols as we cannot have lockdown always.” It said proper sanitisation was required. “People cannot be stopped from doing their jobs since it’s about their livelihoods, but they have to follow the protocols strictly because if they catch the infection, they will take it home and spread it further.” One of the counsels said there have been more shocking photographs of malls where people could be seen violating the Covid-19 norms and it is not that only small vendors do not adhere to protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/such-breach-of-covid-norms-will-hasten-third-wave-hc/articleshow/83650676.cms||---

While stating that the party has “not given thought” to such an alliance, he claimed “there is no issue” regarding the partnership. Asked whether his son Siddesh, a ZP member, would contest the assembly , Naik said that that there are “still six months left for the election, and the party will decide”. Replying to a query on whether he would ask BJP for a ticket for his son, the Ayush minister said that in BJP, individuals do not request the party. Political observers are keenly watching for a possible BJP-MGP alliance mainly because of the turbulent recent history between the two parties. In 2019, MGP was dropped from the cabinet after two of its MLAs joined BJP. The decision was taken after MGP president Pandurang Dhavalikar decided to contest against BJP candidate Subhash Shirodkar in the Shiroda by-election. MGP had joined the government in 2017 on condition that then defence minister Manohar Parrikar return to the state and take over as chief minister. Both BJP and MGP had fought that election independently, and BJP won 13 seats, down from 21 the previous election. In 2012, BJP and MGP had a pre-poll alliance, and won comfortably. Later, in 2016, then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar dropped MGP from the cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/party-will-decide-on-alliance-with-mgp-says-shripad/articleshow/83654759.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai’s six sewage plants India’s costliest: BJP||MUMBAI: After it emerged that companies have bid more than 30% above the BMC’s estimates for six Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), BJP accused the civic body of spurring cartelisation with restrictive tender conditions and setting up the costliest STPs in the country. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, after studying data on setting up of 60 STPs across India, including at Navi Mumbai and Delhi, pointed out that the average cost of sewage treatment comes to around Rs 1.7 crore/ million litres per day (MLD). But going by the tenders received by the BMC, it would amount to Rs 7.5 crore/ MLD, or almost six times higher than the national average. Times ViewTenders for the plants have been scrapped several times in the past over cost escalation and poor response from bidders. The BMC’s Mumbai Sewage Disposal Project-II has been moving at a snail’s pace for more than 15 years now, and it is high time it’s completed. But the BMC must execute the important project in a transparent manner, without unnecessary cost escalations and with satisfactory explanations on the allegations made so far.BMC terms creating cartels, scrap STP tenders, says FadnavisBJP’s Devendra Fadnavis demanded that the inflated tenders for the sewage treatment plants must be scrapped. “The STP project is very important and it has been pending for close to five years. But we can’t let it happen in this way. The BMC must scrap the current tenders and call for fresh tenders. This important project must be executed in a transparent manner where there is a competitive tender process and not a restrictive system,” Fadnavis told TOI. Charges of cost escalation have dogged the BMC’s ambitious project of a chain of seven STPs to stop polluted waste from entering rivers and the sea and delayed the critical project. For six of these (see box), it has received bids, taking the total to over Rs 15,000 crore. The BMC has decided to invite a fresh tender for the seventh STP at Malad. “I had done a lot of follow-up for setting up new standards for sewage discharge into the sea. But the BMC’s costs are not justified at all. The tender conditions were so restrictive that only a few companies could participate and there was large-scale cartelisation. I have shared data of the rates of over 60 STPs across the country. The BMC’s rates are close to six times over the average cost, which is unacceptable and unexplainable,” Fadnavis added. The BMC’s plan to upgrade/rebuild completely the STPs is part of the Mumbai Sewage Disposal Project-II (MSDP). Under the project, which has been moving at a snail’s pace for more than 15 years, the civic body will spend more than Rs 15,000 crore to rebuild STPs. The seven plants will have the capacity to recycle around 1,700 million litres of water daily. Additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu had said the BMC has formed three committees with technical and financial experts to study the technical proposals and do a complete cost analysis to arrive at reasonable rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-terms-creating-cartels-scrap-stp-tenders-says-fadnavis/articleshow/83652959.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||School dropout kingpin of Kandivli society vax fraud, arrested with 3 aides||MUMBAI: A school dropout has turned out to be the mastermind of the fraudulent vaccination camp at Kandivli’s Hiranandani Heritage society. Mahendra Singh, 39, used to be a clerk with the Malad Medical Association for over a decade. Between Thursday night and Friday, the police arrested Singh along with three others for conducting fraudulent camps at nine locations in Mumbai. Besides, a person has been detained in Madhya Pradesh. While the question as to whether the vaccine was spurious has not been resolved, cops believe the vials could’ve been adulterated as their seals were broken. “The vaccines were not procured from an authorised source, which led us to file an FIR,” additional commissioner D Sawant said. Cops looking for doc fraudsters tied up with to source vaccinesThe police have arrested four persons for conducting fraudulent camps at nine locations in Mumbai. Additional commissioner Dilip Sawant said about the Kandivli vaccination drive, “The organisers did not inform the BMC, which is mandatory. Not a single doctor was present at the site, nor were any arrangements made for attending to adverse effects, if any, arising out of inoculation,” he added. Besides Singh, police have arrested Sanjay Gupta, 29, whose role was to remain present on site and make arrangements for the camp. Gupta would collect money from vaccine beneficiaries and hand it over to Singh. Police have seized Rs 9 lakh from Singh’s account. Two employees of private hospitals, Chandan Singh alias Lalit and Nitin Mode, both 32, are the others arrested. The duo used hospital ID-passwords without authorization to log in to the CoWin platform. “The vaccines were ferried to the site by Qareem Akbar Ali, 21, who has been detained from a railway station in Madhya Pradesh while he was trying to flee,” said senior inspector Babasaheb Salunke. Qareem, who has a nursing diploma, was apparently headed for his native place in Bihar when he was held from the Kurla-Patna Express at Satna station. Police are still in the dark about where the vaccines were sourced from. They are looking for a doctor the gang had tied up with for sourcing the vaccines. Besides the doctor, police are yet to arrest Rajesh Pandey, ex-employee of Kokilaben Ambani Hospital who would refer citizens to Singh for vaccination. At the Hiranandani Heritage society camp on May 30, nursing students were hired from a nursing college in Charkop for administering jabs. The students are being quizzed. “Vaccination certificates generated via CoWin mentioned incorrect dates, timings and locations of inoculation. We are considering them as forged documents,” said an officer. Mahendra Singh had been removed from the Malad Medical Association, a 57-year-old organization with 1,600 members. “His attendance was very erratic of late,’’ said Dr Anil Suchak, former president of the association. Singh would earn between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000 a month. He pulled off most of the fraudulent vaccine camps in the May-June period. As the association held regular conferences and weekly meetings at his hall in Malad, Singh had ample opportunity to bond with doctors and sales and marketing personnel of various companies and hospitals. “We were aware he would take on assignments with individual doctors or associations, including Indian Medical Association. He knew what was needed to organize medical conferences,” said a senior doctor. The outdoor assignments became so many that he had little time for the association, prompting them to ask him to leave. BMC’s R/Central ward office has initiated an inquiry into a vaccination camp at Borivli’s Aditya College, which was organised on June 3 by the same group that carried out the Kandivli camp. Over 210 people, comprising hospital staff, were vaccinated. “The BMC was not informed about the camp. The beneficiaries were charged over Rs 1,000 each when guidelines say they cannot be charged over Rs 750,” said ward officer Bhagyashree Kapse. -With inputs from Bhopal||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/school-dropout-kingpin-of-kandivli-soc-vax-fraud-arrested-with-3-aides/articleshow/83654775.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Hyderabad||‘Shift in lifestyle must post unlock to keep Covid in check’||HYDERABAD: As pubs, gyms, malls and other commercial establishments prepare to throw open their doors to public — with unlock rules expected to kick in soon — experts stress the need for a shift in lifestyle, to keep Covid-19 numbers in check. Their recommendations: Opting for hotels and clubs that have strict Covid-19 checks in place, seeking prior appointment to visit salons and only stepping in to boutiques, gyms etc where the entire staff is vaccinated. “There is evidence to prove that large congregations turn into super spreader events. So, seeking prior appointments while visiting public places will be very effective in preventing congregations,” said Saswat Mishra, assistant professor, centre of health care management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), cautioning people against letting their guard down, even with a dip in Covid-19 cases. “People need to adapt to a new normal to maintain balance between economy and Covid-19 protocols. How the situation pans out will entirely depend on how people behave in general and how administration responds to it,” he added. While the state health department had earlier suggested that malls test their staff regularly, to assure customers of the premises being safe, some establishments have already started rolled out certain safety measures. “Along with getting our staff tested every week, on rotation basis, we also sanitise the kitchen with UV mechanism after every shift. Maintaining enough space between tables is also key,” Dheeraj Keswani, managing director of Heartcup chain, said. Queue management is another aspect that many are stressing on —especially in larger stores — to avoid overcrowding. “We developed a queue management system for stores during the first wave and it was used by big communities that have stores within their premises. In the same way, big malls and restaurants too can adopt it,” said, K Viyanandh Reddy, founder of Loan Yantra. “There should be provision for people look at the heat map (number of people at the given place at a given time) before stepping out,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shift-in-lifestyle-must-post-unlock-to-keep-covid-in-check/articleshow/83650610.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The presentation also emphasised the need to improve the electric-charging station infrastructure to encourage more people to switch to electric cars and bikes by 2025. Thackeray was positive about the project and asked for the draft policy to be submitted in the cabinet soon. There are plans to encourage e-charging points in housing societies, government buildings, and MSRTC bus stops, besides petrol pumps and at malls in future. The presentation mentioned over 2,300 charging stations. An official said: “Also, incentives are being planned to attract industries from the sector to set up in Maharashtra.” Transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said the 2018 electric vehicle policy focussed on attracting investments and incentives, while the 2021 policy draft is keen on infrastructure. “There has to be affordability and good infrastructure to push for e-vehicles,” Dhakne said, adding that the CM asked senior officials for their feedback on the proposed policy and the larger benefits to citizens. The presentation pointed out that the state’s share of the country’s EV registrations was around 12% (32,000 vehicles).

---||Mumbai||2021 EV policy: Maharashtra push for li-ion battery gigafactory||MUMBAI: As part of the revised electric vehicle (EV) policy, the state transport ministry on Friday made a presentation before chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for a gigafactory—the first of its kind in the state—to manufacture advanced lithium-ion batteries. The presentation also emphasised the need to improve the electric-charging station infrastructure to encourage more people to switch to electric cars and bikes by 2025. Thackeray was positive about the project and asked for the draft policy to be submitted in the cabinet soon. There are plans to encourage e-charging points in housing societies, government buildings, and MSRTC bus stops, besides petrol pumps and at malls in future. The presentation mentioned over 2,300 charging stations. An official said: “Also, incentives are being planned to attract industries from the sector to set up in Maharashtra.” Transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said the 2018 electric vehicle policy focussed on attracting investments and incentives, while the 2021 policy draft is keen on infrastructure. “There has to be affordability and good infrastructure to push for e-vehicles,” Dhakne said, adding that the CM asked senior officials for their feedback on the proposed policy and the larger benefits to citizens.

Giving details, senior superintendent of police Abhishek Yadav said Shadab led a gang that sold drugs in Haryana, UP, Delhi and Uttarakhand, particularly targeting students. In 2019, police recovered 41 kg of ganja from the gang. A shop was raided and 65 kg of ganja worth Rs 12 lakh, along with small quantities of smack and charas, all packed in 32,000 pouches were seized. The investigations indicated Shadab’s involvement. In August 2020, during routine vehicle checking in Nagar Kotwali police station area, police stopped a car and on searching, found 750 grams of smack in it. They arrested two men travelling in it. They were identified as Shadab and Sameer, residents of Muzaffarnagar, with over a dozen criminal cases registered against them. Soon, seven other members of the gang were arrested and smack with a total value of Rs 60 lakh was seized from them, police added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/drug-traffickers-shops-house-valued-at-rs-1-cr-attached-by-mngr-police/articleshow/83648594.cms||Mohd Dilshad

All the six patients did not progress to severe Covid illness post-therapy, doctors said. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system to fight the virus and help patients make a quick recovery. It is meant only for patients with mild to moderate symptoms. The single-dose therapy costs Rs 60,000. "We treated two patients with monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy. Both have quite a few comorbid conditions. But they responded well to the treatment and did not develop any Covid associated complications," said infectious diseases expert Mahesh Lakhe. One of the two patients was an 83-year-old man having diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension and a lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Another was a 70-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease, diabetes and has undergone various surgeries in the past. She had moderate Covid. "Both patients were given the therapy within three days of Covid positive report and less than a week of symptoms. They had mild to moderate infections and did not require oxygenation. But both had a high-risk profile to develop severe Covid," Lakhe said. Senior physician Dilip Mane treated two patients with the antibody cocktail. "Both had moderate Covid and were treated within seven days of the onset of symptoms and diagnosis. One of them, a 55-year-old man, recovered within five days. The other woman (65) took seven days. Both are good post-discharge," he said. Doctors are divided over its overall usefulness as a therapy. "With the results we are seeing in India, single-dose cocktails of monoclonal antibodies seem to be a highly effective way to stop disease progression in people who may develop severe infection, and thereby reduce chances of ICU admission as well as death," Lakhe said. "The cocktail therapy is not a miracle drug. Studies have shown that it can reduce hospitalisation or repeat emergency visits by about 70%. Currently, evidence is not robust for its usage," said infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag. The therapy is not meant for every Covid patient. "Only those who are not on oxygen therapy, have multiple comorbidities are considered for the therapy," Prayag said. "Studies have shown that it works against variants like B1.617. However, efficacy may reduce as new variants emerge," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/single-dose-cocktail-helping-patients-recover-faster-docs/articleshow/83655754.cms||Umesh Isalkar

While many students and parents conveyed that 30% weightage for students’ Class X and XI scores would be unfair, schools maintained that the CBSE has come up with the best possible formula given the pandemic and time constraints. “For students who have worked really hard, it is a bit difficult to accept the formula. But given the present scenario, it is the best one. Also, those who are not happy with their results will have the option to answer an exam later according to the CBSE,” said Joble Bijoy, principal of Vidya Vikas Academy, Margao. Anupama Mehra, principal of Navy Children’s School at Chicalim, said Class XII students are a bit disappointed with the formula, but a board like the CBSE — with lakhs of students across India — had to take every single student’s situation into consideration. “Given the current Covid-19 pandemic, the CBSE had the task of looking at the whole country and coming out with the best possible holistic solution. We as head of institutions must honour that. Let us try to consider that there is a solid 40% weightage to Class XII internal, practical marks etc,” she said. Schools, however, will face some challenges while implementing the formula provided by the CBSE, Mehra said. “Students usually do well in Class X, but their performance declines in Class XI. Now, there will be weightage given to students’ performance in Class XI. Also, some schools could manage offline tests, while others had them online, so there is no parity or common yardstick to compare performance. Then there are students who come from different boards. How do we assess the marks they scored in the junior class?” she asked. Also, the fact that CBSE allows students of Class XII to change their optional subjects is worrying school managements. They said that in such cases, there will be no Class XI marks of the student in the same subject to compare with. “There is a general unhappiness among parents about how Class XII scores will be calculated. They are now seeking justice from the school, which is caught between the parents and the board. The school will have to honour whatever marks the student has scored in Class XI,” said a school head. Principal of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Bambolim, R A Patil, said parents and students should be relieved that they have been spared the trouble of going through an exam during the pandemic. “The CBSE has asked us to take into consideration Class X and XI results and so, consistently performing students will benefit. This formula will also help expedite the results,” he said. Capt Nikhil Saolapurkar, whose daughter is studying in Class XII, said the CBSE has come out with a fair assessment formula given the limited time and dynamic conditions. “People in urban areas have access to high-speed internet and are at an advantage. Rural children and even the underprivileged in urban areas are having problems connecting to classes online. Considering all these factors that the CBSE has to look at, it was good to consider marks for Class X and XI where exams were held under normal circumstances,” he said. Sian D’Souza, a Chicalim-based Class XII commerce student, said most of the colleges she has applied to are relying on entrance tests for admissions during the pandemic. “Right now, we can’t help it and can’t do anything about our previous marks. The CBSE has no other way out either, so it has to consider previous years’ marks. Even if there was an exam, it would not have been conducted with the same zeal as before,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/students-parents-flood-schools-with-queries-over-cbses-class-xii-formula/articleshow/83652975.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Goa||GCCI for structural audit of old bridges||Panaji: The state government should immediately conduct a technical and structural audit of all bridges and culverts in Goa, particularly those that were built by the Portuguese, said Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) on Friday. GCCI president Manoj Caculo said that despite a similar petition made in 2016, the government has yet to act upon the request. GCCI has written to chief minister Pramod Sawant, public works department (PWD) minister Deepak Prabhu Pauskar and PWD principal chief engineer Uttam Parsekar urging them to ensure preventive measures are taken to avoid a tragedy. “Most of the bridges and culverts in Goa barring a few major ones were built during the Portuguese era,” said Caculo. “They were designed for certain carrying capacities keeping in mind the limited traffic projections envisaged at those times. These bridges and culverts are very old and we are uncertain of their present conditions and current load bearing capacities.” Caculo has also asked the government for information on the status of GCCI’s earlier request as there was no evidence to show that the departments concerned had taken any corrective measures. GCCI’s letter comes just days after a portion of the unused bailey bridge at Borim collapsed. The industry body also reminded the government of the Mahad incident in 2016 where an old bridge along the Goa-Mumbai highway collapsed killing people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gcci-for-structural-audit-of-old-bridges/articleshow/83652986.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Covid traces found in Sabarmati, lakes||AHMEDABAD: The city had recorded a major spike of Covid cases in the April-May period during the second wave. The virus is not only in the air — considered the primary medium of the spread — but also in water, a study carried out by experts from multiple institutes has revealed. The paper, ‘The Spectre of SARS-CoV-2 in the Ambient Urban Natural Water in Ahmedabad and Guwahati: A Tale of Two Cities’, is currently in preprint. It is authored by experts from IIT-Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn), IIT-Guwahati, GBRC, and JNU with Prof Manish Kumar of IIT-Gn as lead author.  The researchers said that 26% of the samples (eight of the 31) were found to be positive (showing virus presence). “A higher SARS-CoV-2 genome concentration was observed in Sabarmati River (492 copies/lakh litres of water), followed by Kankaria (318 copies/L) and Chandola (75 copies/L),” the paper said. “The number of active Covid-19 cases in Ahmedabad on the day of sampling matched the gene amplification and detection patterns (viral genetic load) in surface water rather well.” Prof Kumar said that they had earlier showed the presence of Covid-19 in wastewater as an efficient way of surveillance. “We started with a question — can the places where wastewater treatment is not happening be included in surveillance,” he said. “Thus, we chose surface water. It can add another layer of surveillance.” Prof Kumar added that the viruses found from the samples are not ‘live’. “We checked for traces of the virus in a given sample through RNA or genes,” he said. “So far, we have not seen any definitive proof that the virus spreads through water. Thus, citizens need not fear about virus in the water.” Experts have long stressed on water surveillance as an effective method to predict a spike in cases. One researcher said that even in these lakes, the source largely remains treated water. Thus, the presence can also indicate the way the water is treated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-traces-found-in-sabarmati-lakes/articleshow/83650686.cms||---
---||Kochi||Online gaming: Ernakulam police to launch awareness drive||KOCHI: Ernakulam rural police are set to launch an awareness campaign about the ideal practices to be followed by parents and children while surfing online after a Class IX student in Aluva ended up losing nearly Rs 3 lakh by playing online games. Police said that the money went missing from the account of the boy’s mother. The incident happened at Aluva and an investigation launched by the district police chief (Ernakulam rural) SP K Karthick into a complaint received by him led the police to the boy who used his mother’s account to play online games. The mother had filed the complaint after finding that she lost money from her account. As per the directive of SP Karthick, a special team of cyber police was entrusted with the investigation. Police said that the investigation revealed that the boy had become addicted to online gaming and used to pay up to Rs 4,000 to play the game. Police said that he started off by paying small amounts like Rs 40 and later went on to pay higher amounts. Investigators found that the boy even paid money up to 10 times in a day. The parents realized that the money went missing when they accidentally checked their bank statement one day. By the time the parents realized that the money went missing, a huge sum was already paid by the boy to play the online game. Police have issued an advisory to parents in the wake of the incident alerting parents to be more watchful of children using the internet especially since studies are also going on online. “It is ideal that the parent knows the locking pattern or passcode of the phone. Also, parents should keep a constant watch of their children’s activity online. Also, discourage children from using digital devices too much and during late nights,” said police. Police said that parents need to be extra careful not to link their bank accounts to the devices which their children use. SP Karthick said that awareness classes on this subject would begin next week onwards. Youth held under Kaapa: Police on Friday arrested an Ayyampuzha native, who was allegedly involved in several criminal cases under the Kerala Anti-Social Activities Prevention Act (Kaapa). The arrested person was identified as Somi (36). He has cases against him in Ayyampuzha, Kalady and Angamaly police stations. Police said that he has been lodged at Viyyur central jail as part of the preventive detention for six months under Kaapa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/online-gaming-police-to-launch-awareness-drive/articleshow/83648614.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik zilla parishad favours one Covid care hub per taluka||NASHIK: The Nashik zilla parishad has decided to close down several Covid care centres (CCCs) across the rural district due to the drop in the number of Covid patients. While there are 40 Covid care centres across the rural district, the aim is to keep one facility operational in every taluka. However, a taluka reporting comparatively more Covid patients will have two Covid care centres operational, said Nashik zilla parishad CEO Leena Bansod. There are a total of 15 talukas in Nashik district. There is a significant drop in the number of fresh patients in the rural district. Thus, the ZP aims to close down Covid care centres, which did not have any patients for a long time. The focus would be then shifted to the non-Covid patients, an official said. After a series of measures taken at the taluka level and village level, apart from the restrictions imposed by the district administration and the action by the Nashik Rural police, the rate of daily cases has reduced significantly in the rural district. Thus, most of the Covid care centres are either empty or have very few patients. Some hotspots in the rural district like Sinnar and Niphad have more Covid active patients. The health departments of the talukas concerned are trying to make institutional quarantine mandatory for Covid patients to further stop the spread of the infection. Nashik’s positivity rate has declined from 7% to over 4. 5% and the oxygen bed occupancy is now at 9%, which was around 17% last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/zp-favours-1-covid-care-hub-per-taluka/articleshow/83646438.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Goa||Will contest as independent in event of BJP-MGP alliance: Govind Gaude||PANAJI: A week after he expressed his willingness to contest the 2022 assembly  on a BJP ticket, art and culture minister Govind Gaude said on Friday that if the saffron party forges a pre-poll alliance with the MGP, he would contest as an independent. “I will contest as an independent candidate. I have contested elections twice as an independent candidate, and I have reached here on merits. I will never bow down for a ticket,” he said. In 2007 and 2012, the Priol seat was won by Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar, a top MGP functionary who is the party’s default candidate for the seat. Gaude said that he has developed Priol constituency and that BJP supported him in the last election. “If they offer me a ticket, I will ask my supporters and decide,” he said. Reacting to his interview which went viral on social media, in which Gaude claimed he would never join BJP, he said that it was a move by the opposition to tarnish his image. “The opposition does not want me to grow in politics,” he said. Last week, Gaude said that he was willing to join BJP “provided the party nominates him as a candidate for the 2022 assembly election”. Gaude won the 2017 assembly elections with the support of the party, and has since been cabinet minister in the BJP-led government, both under the chief ministership of Manohar Parrikar and later Pramod Sawant. In 2019, Sawant, soon after taking over, dropped independent MLA Rohan Khaunte and GFP from the cabinet. During the 2012 assembly polls, Gaude contested from Priol constituency, where he battled the BJP-MGP alliance candidate Pandurang Dhavalikar and lost. Gaude had said that as MGP and Congress are not options for him, it leaves only BJP. “I have a good relationship with BJP functionaries and MLAs, and it would be better to join BJP,” he had said. I have contested elections twice as an independent candidate, and I have reached here on merits.

The civil registration system’s (CSR) annual reports till 2016 reported SRB based on all birth registrations during the year. Now, the SRB is calculated only after excluding births registered more than a year after the event. As per its recent report, Telangana is one of the 10 major states which crossed 90 per cent of registration of births. In 2019, Telangana registered 8,41,268 births, an increase from 6,52,791 in 2018. Of the 8.41 lakh births, 4.30 lakh were male and 4.10 lakh were female. In 2017, the SRB in Telangana was 915. It increased to 924 in 2018 and touched 953 mark in 2019, indicating a steady improvement. The increase in SRB to 953 in a span of three years has been attributed to general awareness and reduction in child marriages, especially in rural areas. “There has been a sustained effort to enhance awareness among people regarding girl child. The number of child marriages have reduced over the last few years. In areas like Nalgonda, where child marriages are highly prevalent, there have been fewer cases in the last few years,” said Ch Murali Mohan, chairman of Sadhana Foundation, an organisation working for the welfare of marginalised sections. Focused government schemes that encourage girl child birth have also been attributed for the increase in SRB. “The government has been actively taking up measures to ensure that the pregnant women are taken care of. Whether it was the KCR Kit for pregnant women at Anganwadis or other schemes that encouraged accessible education, especially for the girl child, it definitely led to a change in people’s mindset,” said Dhanasiri Prakash, general secretary of Child Rights Protection Forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sex-ratio-at-birth-improves-from-915-to-953-in-t/articleshow/83650684.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Kochi||Kerala: De-addiction centre for women opened in Ernakulam||KOCHI: The social justice department has started a de-addiction centre exclusively for girls and women in the district. The centre – Nirmal Nikethan Mukthisadan – is being run by the sisters of St Francis Convent at Angamaly under the Archdiocese of Ernakulam-Angamaly. The centre has been launched as part of the ‘Nasha Mukt Bharat’ of the ministry of social justice and empowerment. “We are seeing a rise in the number of women with alcohol and opioids addiction. Ernakulam was one of the cities surveyed by the ministry in its study. A team of specialists, including psychiatrist, gynaecologist, paediatrician and counsellors will be involved in the rehabilitation programme,” said district social justice officer Subair K K. He added that while the centre was exclusively for women in the state, there are four other walk-in de-addiction centres. The treatment will be anywhere between 30 and 90 days with regular follow-ups. The place has a provision for women to take their children in the event of lack of family support for the child. Located at Azhakam in Njalookara near Angamaly, the centre is providing counselling services for women who are addicted to drugs, alcohol, mobile and internet, and those facing relationship issues. Counselling for individuals, family group therapy and awareness classes form part of the treatment programme. Relaxation programmes include yoga, dance, music, vocation training and art classes. “Medicines and treatment are free of cost and employees at the centre are women only. Food and accommodation are provided within the premises during the treatment period and regular follow-ups are being provided for patients after treatment, said Mukthisadan director Fr Joseph Parekkattil. He said that they already have a sister concern by the same name at Pookkattupady, which has been working in the field of de-addiction for the last 31 years. The de-addiction programme begins with complete detoxification of the substance/drug in the body before any kind of therapy sessions. The 12-step process varies from one month to three months depending on the severity of the addiction. According to the general operations of a de-addiction centre, following the complete detox, the inmates will have group meetings, talks from individuals and peer educators about their experiences and inspirational bonding sessions. Daily activities include morning meditation, individual therapy sessions, group therapy, substance abuse education, exercise sessions, and counselling among others. Normally, bystanders are not encouraged. But in case of critical patients who may be suffering from geriatric and mental disorders or have chronic diseases like cirrhosis, neuropathy, diabetes, injuries, etc, bystanders are allowed based on the patient’s medical evaluation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/de-addiction-centre-for-women-opened/articleshow/83648603.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

All restaurants welcomed people with 50% seating capacity and weekly markets were also allowed to function with stringent restrictions. With more relaxations being allowed as part of Delhi government’s gradual unlocking process, the number of people on the streets has gone up and so has the number of people getting penalised for violating Covid norms. According to Delhi government figures, as many as 20,361 challans were issued across the 11 revenue districts of the capital from Monday (June 14) when Unlock 3 came into effect to Thursday (June 17), with an average 5,090 challans being issued every day. The previous week, when shops were allowed to open on an odd-even basis, 4,192 challans were issued on average every day and the week prior to that, when manufacturing units and construction sites were allowed to open first, 3,870 challans were being issued per day on average. Delhi was under lockdown the entire month of May, except on May 31 when the unlocking process first began. The entire month saw 77,715 challans being issued by the district authorities, which comes to about 2,507 per day on average. The month of June has already seen 70,670 challans being issued in the first 17 days, with an average of 4,157 per day. District authorities say that with the rise in number of people stepping outside, it is necessary to keep a close watch on those not wearing face masks, spitting, not ensuring social distancing, etc. According to sources, nearly 250 enforcement teams across the 11 districts are deployed to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour at public places. The strategy adopted for targeting public places that witness more violations changes according to the nature of the ‘hotspot’. For instance, Anand Vihar ISBT is an important focus area for testing, awareness and enforcement for the Shahdara district administration as it is one of the busiest border areas of the city. The district, in fact, has issued 8,498 challans this month, which is the third highest after South East (9,910) and North (9,839) districts. On the other hand, for the East district administration, the biggest hotspot is Ghazipur mandi, which sees significant footfall throughout the day. The district administration has deployed its teams that visit the mandi twice daily for enforcement, and also for distribution of masks and sanitisers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/daily-challans-peak-to-5090-as-more-people-step-out-of-homes/articleshow/83650744.cms||---

The keel for the frigate was laid by vice-chief of naval staff, vice-admiral G Ashok Kumar. GSL aims to deliver the first warship in 2026 and the second six months after the first. The ship under construction is part of the indigenous shipbuilding programme being executed under a technology transfer programmw with Russia’s Yantar Shipyard. In 2018, India and Russia signed a suite of shipbuilding contracts regarding four Project 11356 frigates, with two ships being built by Yantar Shipyard and two being built by GSL based on technology shared by Russia. “There are considerable changes in the design of the ships to be constructed at GSL as significant indigenous content is being fitted on these ships,” said Kumar while speaking on the occasion. The hulls of the two ships are being built with indigenous steel. The ministry of defence and GSL inked the contract for the two ships in January 2019. “Keel-laying is a major milestone activity in the construction of the ship, symbolising formal commencement of the construction process,” said GSL chairman and MD, B B Nagpal. “It is for first time that these vessels of such vast complexity are being constructed locally,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gsl-starts-work-on-second-frigate-for-navy/articleshow/83653016.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Puri seeks clarity on SAD-BSP’s claim of sharing ‘Panthic’ seats||New Delhi: Claiming to be a proud Sikh, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday questioned the “seat-sharing” arrangement between the SAD and BSP for the assembly polls in Punjab next year and sought clarity about the “Panthic” seats being given to Mayawati’s outfit to contest. “There are two parties, who have formed an alliance … we have no idea about how they will contest, same symbol or not. There were some negative remarks about the alliance too. However, one party said that the other one has been given some panthic seats,” Puri said at a press conference, and added, “I am a very proud Sikh and consider the entire land of Punjab is holy and Panthic.” Without taking any name, Puri referred to SAD giving ‘Panthic’ (pious) seats such as Anandpur Sahib and Chamkaur Sahib, major Sikh pilgrim centres, to BSP. He said it is not clear what they (SAD-BSP) meant by “Panthic” seats. “But like I know about Sikhism and those who certify a Sikh and a non-Sikh don’t know that Sikhism is an egalitarian religion. There are no differences,” the Union minister said, adding, “We all sit on the floor and partake in Guru ka langar.” He said if there are differences, they have been created outside. “Our Sikh Gurus never taught these things, it was never in their minds.” Puri cited several steps of the Modi government saying it abolished a “blacklist” carrying names of 333 Sikhs, granted citizenship to thousands of Sikhs oppressed in different countries, ensured action in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, gave FCRA registration to Golden Temple to receive foreign donations, launched 14 trains to connect holy Sikh sites and gave GST exemption to langar services run by gurdwaras. He also renewed an offer of dialogue with agitating farmers and at the same time attacked the Punjab government for “profiteering” on Covid vaccines. “The PM personally and the government have made it repeatedly clear that if there are any doubts, they are ready to sit with the agitating farmers but the template has to be for the benefit of the farmers,” the minister said. Puri was accompanied by party spokesperson Sambit Patra, who said that the report of a farmer being forced to stage self immolation was a heinous incident and should be probed by agencies. “Democracy has space for agitations not crime,” he said. Puri said the government is open to all suggestions. He said it has been a year since the farm laws were promulgated as ordinances and none of the expected repercussions of the new laws like abolition of mandis or MSPs have come true. He also maintained that procurement has not just broken all records in rabi as well as kharif seasons, farmers have been given Rs 26k crore as direct cash transfers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/puri-seeks-clarity-on-sad-bsps-claim-of-sharing-panthic-seats/articleshow/83650731.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Madurai||No DPC should be shifted for political reasons, says HC||Madurai: Direct procurement centres (DPC) which are established to procure paddy from the farmers should not be shifted for any political reasons, the Madras high court has said and directed the Pudukottai district collector to take a fair decision in a plea which sought not to shift a DPC in the district.The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by C Prabhakar, seeking the authorities not to shift the existing DPC at Kidarampatti village to any other location.Senior counsel appearing for the state submitted that shifting is necessitated due to inconvenience and if it is shifted, it would be shifted only to a government land.A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that it is seen that the DPC was established at the village in March 2020. Unfortunately, the authorities have not given any instructions as to what was the inconvenience for shifting the DPC.“Surprisingly, from April 2021, we have got as many as three such cases where there is allegation that the DPCs are in the process of being shifted or closed. We do not appreciate any such move and no such centres should be shifted for any political reasons. In fact, we have made such observations in an earlier order,” observed the judges.Hence, the judges directed the collector to ensure that no such disputes occur within the district with regard to DPCs. If this centre at the village was opened in March 2020, it should be permitted to continue in the same place, unless and until there is a serious problem where the public are put to inconvenience.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/no-dpc-should-be-shifted-for-political-reasons-says-hc/articleshow/83653017.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||HC poser on doctors in Telangana, extends stay on elections||HYDERABAD: Wondering if the state government is helping those who want to remote control the Telangana State Medical Council (TSMC), the high court has asked the government to explain why its counter has serious discrepancies on the number of doctors currently practising in the state after registering themselves with the TSMC. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a batch of pleas filed by the Health Care Reforms Doctors Association and a few doctors who challenged the government’s decision to change the composition of the governing council of the TSMC. Appearing for the government, additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao said the number of practising doctors in Telangana had come down after the bifurcation of the state and hence they brought down the number of elected members in the TSMC council in tune with the changed circumstances. The petitioners were questioning as to why the number of nominated members too was not down proportionately if what the government was saying is right. Stating that the counter filed by the authorities lacked the basic details, the bench sought particulars of the strength of the council in united AP and now. The state counsel said the combined number of doctors registered was 97,000 and now the number of doctors who remained in Telangana is 47,000. The bench reminded him that he had earlier put the current strength of doctors at only 16,000. The bench sought a fresh affidavit from the government and extended the stay on elections till August. According to the petitioners, the governing council, which presides over the administrative affairs of the doctors, has 13 posts of members to be elected by the doctors and six posts for nomination through the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-poser-on-doctors-in-t-extends-stay-on-elections/articleshow/83650788.cms||---
---||Delhi||Markets in Delhi hope for better footfall on first weekend of reopening||NEW DELHI: While the number of customers has been slowly rising at markets, the overall footfall is yet to reach anywhere near the pre-lockdown period. Traders hope that the situation will start improving from Saturday, their first weekend in Unlock 2. Ashok Randhawa of the traders’ association at Sarojini Nagar market, which has been witnessing relatively good footfall than other retail markets, said around 35% of the footfall had been recovered and traders were hoping for further improvement over the weekend. “High temperature during the day has been the main deterrent,” he said. At a joint meeting of police and all market associations in Sarojini Nagar on Thursday, it has been decided that one volunteer would be deputed for a group of 10 shops to maintain social distancing. “Thirty-two volunteers have been shortlisted from staff of various shops. The number of guards has also been doubled,” he added. Brijesh Goyal, who heads Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI), said local customers at Kashmere Gate had started coming out, but those from outside Delhi hadn’t returned. “In comparison to last year’s unlocking, more people are visiting markets. There was a pent-up demand for the last two months. More customers are expected to come on weekends,” he added. CTI has demanded extension of the 8pm closure time. “We have also demanded that the Metro frequency be increased and at least 50% of the station gates be opened to avoid crowding. All major markets like Connaught Place, Kashmere Gate, Chawri Bazar, Chandni Chowk get a significant footfall through Metro connectivity,” Goyal added. In south Delhi, Rajender Sharda, who heads the traders’ association in M Block market at GK-I, said customer confidence had been rising. “The curfew timing needs to be relaxed; shops need to close even earlier to adhere to the 8pm deadline,” he said. “We are witnessing more hustle and bustle around restaurants and hoping for more trade during the weekend.” Nageshwar Singh of the Anupam complex market near Saket said the situation was gradually getting back to normal. “We are seeing a good footfall. It will further rise as confidence of consumers increases regarding safety,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/markets-hope-for-better-numbers-on-first-weekend-of-reopening/articleshow/83650799.cms||---
---||Goa||Will scrap all destructive projects once Cong forms govt in 2022: Rao||MARGAO: All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of Goa desk Dinesh Gundu Rao on Friday said the party will ensure that all those projects that are causing harm to Goa’s environment will be scrapped “once the Congress government is formed in Goa next year”. The term of the current BJP-led government comes to an end in March 2022 and the assembly elections are likely to be held in February or early March next year. Rao said, “We will ensure that the vision and dreams of the freedom fighters are secured. Development of Goa in a manner which appeals to the Goan people, which preserves Goa’s heritage and culture, is of paramount importance to us. All those decisions, those projects, those plans, that will cause destruction to Goa’s environment – all of them – will be scrapped when Congress government is formed.” Rao paid homage to Ram Manohar Lohia at Lohia Maidan, Margao, on Goa Revolution Day. The state witnessed widespread protests earlier this year over the three Centre-sponsored linear projects— railways double-tracking, national highway expansion and laying of power transmission lines—all passing through the biodiversity hotspot of Mollem. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat castigated the state government for its “mismanagement” of the Covid situation leading to “people dying in hospitals for want of oxygen, beds and ventilators”. “The plight of the poor is miserable. Rickshawallas, taxiwallas and motorcycle pilots are suffering. The government is paying no attention to the common man. I have demanded several times that a Rs 100 crore package be given to them,” Kamat told reporters, and called on the people to “bring about a revolution” in the upcoming elections. Earlier, at the state-organised Revolution Day celebration, deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar led the dignitaries in paying homage to Lohia at the martyrs’ memorial. Kavlekar urged people to stay united in the battle against the Covid pandemic. “Everybody should support the government by keeping aside politics,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-scrap-all-destructive-projects-once-cong-forms-govt-in-2022-rao/articleshow/83653122.cms||---

The seasonal total for June is inching towards normal mark. On Friday, while the rain activity had shown a slight decline, the total so far had touched 645.2mm, as against the normal of 476.1mm. The average rainfall for this month is 899.2mm. India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji, has largely forecast moderate rainfall for next four days. Heavy precipitation is expected only in isolated places for a couple of days on Saturday and Sunday. “Reduction in rainfall activity is likely from June 21. But normal monsoon activity may continue over Goa in subsequent days.” IMD said on Friday. The next few days are unlikely to witness intense spells as seen between June 14 and 17 that yielded over 300mm of rainfall. June 15 saw the wettest spell, as the rainfall recorded in 24 hours was a daily average of 120.8mm. During the last 24 hours till Friday morning, Pernem recorded 90mm, Sakhali 91.8, Valpoi 83, Quepem 60.2 and Mapusa 34.4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rain-activity-likely-to-ease-from-monday-met-office/articleshow/83653035.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCP minister says needle of suspicion points to Param Bir Singh||MUMBAI: A day after the National Investigating Agency arrested former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma for his alleged role in the case involving planting of explosives outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani and the murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran, NCP leader and rural development minister Hasan Mushriff said the needle of suspicion points to controversial former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh. “The entire IPS circle knows that both Sachin Waze and Pradeep Sharma are trusted men of Param Bir Singh. They can’t plant explosives outside the residence of Ambani unless they have the backing of a high-ranking official. In fact, Param Bir Singh was instrumental in the reinstatement of Waze, that too on a prime post. The then joint commissioner had opposed his posting in the crime branch. The people of Maharashtra expect the NIA to catch the mastermind as early as possible,” Mushriff said at a presser in his hometown Kolhapur. Mushriff confirmed to TOI the statement he made in Kolhapur. “I have reasons to believe the needle of suspicion points to Param Bir Singh. Since he wrote a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray, following which the then home minister Anil Deshmukh had to go, we feel he has the backing of the BJP. That is why law-enforcing agencies are not taking action against him. We feel it is high time NIA steps in and takes the probe to its logical conclusion,” Mushriff said. Mushriff, who has consistently taken a stand against the Central agencies, said the NIA probe was slow. “NIA arrested Sachin Waze more than two months ago, and now it has arrested Sharma. It should make all-out efforts to book the mastermind,” he said.  TOI sent a detailed message to Param Bir Singh on the statement made by Hasan Mushriff, but there was no response till the time of going to press.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncp-minister-says-needle-of-suspicion-points-to-param-bir/articleshow/83653144.cms||---
---||Kochi||Detailed study of seabed needed, say experts||KOCHI: While the presence of a new underwater ‘kidney bean’ shaped structure seen in Google’s satellite map off Kochi coast has baffled experts and locals, the recent decadal changes in the Arabian Sea calls for more detailed mapping of the inner continental shelf, say experts. Scientists said that it is a shoal and not an island as it is not visible above the waters. Shoals are mounds formed by accumulation of sediments underwater. “As the need of the hour is a proper coastal protection strategy, research institutions will have to look at doing a mapping of the inner continental shelf along the west coast. One such study was done about 40 years ago and during that study, this region was completely mapped up to 40-50 depth. No such islands or formations were reported then,” said M Baba, renowned scientist and former director of Centre for Earth science studies (CESS). He said that it was important to do bathymetry study of the seabed and run models. “There have been several changes in the coastal waters in the last couple of decades alone. There is always a movement of sediment from north to south across the shipping channel. The recent cyclones and rainfall activity must have increased the discharge of sediments leading to large shoaling,” said A N Balchand, former professor of physical oceanography, Cochin University. However, he said that the present image could be an oversight or default of Google images. “Sometimes, image processing makes them look larger than they are. These kinds of images have been reported before across the world. Since the region marked is part of the Cochin Port’s shipping channel, any hindrance would have been felt immediately. While no new studies of the region have been done in the last couple of years, institutions like the hydrographic department, ONGC, Indian mines- Dhanbad and defence agencies are regularly doing studies in the region. However, they don’t share the data in the public domain for security regions,” he said. There will be small changes in the waters caused by the cyclonic activity. “But usually, a cyclonic activity does not impact beyond 100 to 120m because it is a wind system. A severe cyclone impacts about 150m depth. However, when waves take away sediment, they deposit it back. The changes will be more biological because of the churning of waters, which will bring the underwater nutrients to the surface which serve as food for the organisms, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/detailed-study-of-seabed-needed-say-experts/articleshow/83648647.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Goa||Covid situation will be brought under control soon: Goa CM||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Friday that the Covid situation in the state would come under control in a few days, and that the positivity rate has already dropped to 8%, the recovery rate over 95%, and mortality rate down to 6%. He also claimed the state is “fully prepared for the third wave”. On Goa Revolution Day, governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Union Ayush minister Shripad Naik and Sawant paid floral tributes to martyrs at Azad Maidan, Panaji. Speaking to reporters, Sawant said that a lot of parties want to bring in a political revolution in Goa. “We should not have political selfishness, and a revolution should be brought about in the interest of the state and not a political revolution,” he said He said the state government can bring in a revolution in education and industries. “I urge the people’s support... to bring a new revolution in the state. My cabinet colleagues, MLAs and political parties will try to bring revolution in the interest of the state,” he said. Sawant said that due to the pandemic, the state government had low-key celebrations of Revolution Day. “If not, it being 75 years since 1946, the government would have had bigger programmes,” Sawant said that the state government has brought in a revolution in healthcare in view of the pandemic, and provided the necessary infrastructure to healthcare centres across the state. He also said that for the third Covid wave, an expert committee has been constituted, and under the guidance of experts, the state has decided to purchase equipment. He added that a programme for Covid warriors will soon begin in Goa, and it will be under the aegis of Pradhan Mantri kaushal vikas yojana. Meanwhile, the CM said that Ayush hospitals would soon be opened in Ribandar and Pernem. He also said that the state government plans to plant 5 lakh trees in the state to achieve sustainable development goals, and next year, the state aims to be one of the top two in this field. On education, Sawant said that the state government has introduced coding and robotics from this academic year. Addressing the people virtually, Sawant said that the scheme would be run by the director of education and director of technical education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-covid-situation-will-be-brought-under-control-soon/articleshow/83653046.cms||---
---||Meerut||34 years on, UP starts demarcating boundary for Hastinapur sanctuary, 353 villages excluded||BIJNOR: The government in Uttar Pradesh has started demarcating the boundary of Hastinapur forest area before issuing a final notification declaring the range a protected sanctuary as directed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The first notification had come almost 34 years ago, and in between, a large portion of the forest area was occupied by humans. In October last year, the National Board of Wildlife (NBWL) had recommended rationalisation of the proposed sanctuary, a crucial step towards the final notification. During a primary survey, it came to the fore that the size of the proposed sanctuary will now be reduced to half as compared to what it was 34 years ago. And, as the exercise began, the authorities said that at least 353 villages will be excluded from the sanctuary. Of them maximum 208 fall in Bijnor district. The announcement was made during a meeting between Meerut Commissioner -- nodal officer entrusted with the task by the NGT-- and DMs of Bijnor and Muzaffarnagar. The forest area is spread across 2,073 square-km area along the Ganga River and comprises five districts-- Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar, Amroha, Meerut and Hapur. It will now be reduced to 1,094 square-km. In all, there are 745 villages which are currently inside the sanctuary and spread across the five districts. Out of these, 353 have been proposed to be outside and the remaining 392 will remain inside the sanctuary. Out of these 353, maximum 208 belong to Bijnor district. According to M Semmaran, divisional forest officer (DFO) of Bijnor, “Now the villagers have been given time to raise objections to this proposal after which final rationalisation process will be completed.” Former senior scientist at WII, Bivash Pandey, told TOI, “In the current scenario, there are many spots as big as towns, like Chandpur in Bijnor and large parts of Amroha etc., which are in the sanctuary. Other areas have also witnessed intense human activity, including agricultural fields. All such areas have been excluded in the proposal and we have recommended the inclusion of 187.62 square-km near the northern boundaries of the sanctuary which is frequented by swamp deer, for which the sanctuary was made in the first place.” Pandey was part of the team which had proposed rationalisation of the boundaries of the sanctuary. In 1986, the government had issued a primary notification declaring Hastinapur forest area a sanctuary. However, no final government order notifying the 2,073 square-km area as a protected zone came from the government since then. Irked over it, the NGT had in May 2019 asked the forest department to explain to it the reason behind over 30 years of delay in proclaiming Hastinapur wildlife area as a protected sanctuary. Due to lack of proper government notification on it, the area does not enjoy the protection needed to check poaching and various other threats to the wildlife. Human habitation and construction activities are not allowed in the protected area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/34-years-on-up-starts-demarcating-boundary-for-hastinapur-sanctuary-353-villages-excluded/articleshow/83648641.cms||Sandeep Rai

At the UN principles for responsible management education (UN-PRME) global forum held this week virtually from New York, GIM was recognised for its “social impact and sustainability achievements”. Only four of the 46 business schools from 21 countries that participated in the positive impact ranking (PIR) report achieved the top ranking. Incidentally, three of these are based in India, the other two being SP Jain Institute of Management and Research, and XLRI - Xavier School of Management. These three, and the University of Business and Technology, Kosovo, all got the highest ‘pioneering schools’ rank. The report saw GIM receive a level-5 rating. “We at GIM are honoured and delighted to be named among the top four B-schools globally in leading pioneering change in the prestigious PIR report, 2021, which is looked up to by management institutes globally. Ethics, values and corporate governance has been at the core of our pedagogy,” said GIM director Ajit Parulekar. Innovative community-based actions, environmental and socially-responsible culture and governance, and a strong teaching focus on responsible leadership were listed among the strengths of GIM, along with the three other schools, as the announcement was made by Prof Thomas Dyllick of the positive impact rating association and Sophie Charrois, president of Oikos International. The PIR is a rating conducted by students and for students. This is the second edition of the PIR report, where students worldwide assessed their business schools on how they perceive their positive impact in the world. “PIR is the voice of students around the globe, and what is most satisfying for us is that our main stakeholders — our students — have acknowledged institute commitment towards sustainability, responsibility and impact,” said Parulekar. Students assessed how GIM addresses societal and sustainable challenges and prepares its students to be responsible business leaders. The data collection in GIM was organised and led by students, who distributed the PIR survey across campus to their fellow students. This is the first time GIM participated and, this year, 151students from GIM responded to the survey. A student team composed of Ashima Mathur, Ameya Ambike, Jessica Roy, Shivani Bhatia at GIM coordinated with PIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gim-bags-top-un-ranking-for-sustainability-concepts/articleshow/83654796.cms||---
---||Madurai||Give compassionate posting to deceased staffer’s daughter: HC||Madurai: Taking into account that the application sent by the wife of a deceased government employee seeking compassionate appointment for her daughter was rejected by the authorities on the ground that she alone can seek such appointment, the Madras high court observed that a GO passed last year places children in a higher pedestal than the widow for seeking such job.The appellant T Vasuki’s husband R Thangam was working as an assistant in the office of the Theni district collector. After his death in 2006, Vasuki had submitted an application the same year seeking compassionate appointment for herself. However, the same was kept pending for more than six years.Due to health problems, the appellant in 2010 had submitted an application to grant the compassionate appointment to her daughter Padmapriya. The application was kept pending for three years and was rejected in 2013.Challenging the rejection order, the appellant had filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench in 2013, and the same was dismissed by a single judge in 2019. The petitioner had filed this present appeal by challenging the order of the single judge.A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the only reason given by the authorities in the rejection order is that the appellant alone can seek appointment and not for her daughter.“This conclusion is erroneous and contrary to the scheme framed by the state government for grant of appointment on compassionate grounds,” observed the judges.The judges observed that in any event, what is required to be seen as per the scheme for compassionate appointment is whether the family has been driven to indigent circumstances on account of the untimely demise of the employee and whether the application was submitted within the prescribed time. This is the procedure which has been followed in the government for several decades and this has also been very emphatically reiterated in the recent GO.Holding that the reason assigned in the rejection order is erroneous, the judges set aside the order of the single judge and directed the authorities to provide compassionate appointment to Padmapriya within three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/give-compassionate-posting-to-deceased-staffers-daughter-hc/articleshow/83653050.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Hence, the judges dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-against-road-expansion-dismissed/articleshow/83653060.cms||---

The four-year-old big cat had moved in last year, in March. Forsaken for 22 years, what used to be the Synthetic and Chemical Ltd, with its welcoming foliage and forest-like overgrowth, witnesses this “hunt” for big cats with surprising regularity — a tiger in 2018, a leopard in 2019 and, now, a tigress. But Wednesday’s sighting led nowhere, like every single one over the past year. But it did yield a clue — she had crept into a tank. After a two-day search, on Friday, the elusive tigress was finally rescued. “The tank was her hideout,” divisional forest officer Bharat Lal told TOI. But while the camera trap image pointed to a tank, there were four within the premises. They didn’t know which one she had chosen as shelter. So, they went looking. “When we managed to find the tank she was in, we locked it up to confine her and informed the rescue team at Pilibhit,” said Lal. The tigress had migrated from the Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary of the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur Kheri, a 160-km journey. “She is young. She must have started moving in search of territory,” Dr Daksh Gangwar, who tranquilised her, explained. “It is possible she moved to the Haripur range in Pilibhit, crossed Barahi and Mahof range, and then crossed the Devha river before reaching Bareilly through farmlands. She had learnt how to adapt to humans and no sighting was reported by anyone until she started living at the rubber factory.” She will now be released into the forests she had come from. Over the past year, she had been spotted on camera traps several times. But actually finding her had been difficult. By the time forest personnel would reach the site she had been spotted, she would have left. And on the rare occasion that she was spotted in the flesh, she would escape before they could react. They had one more thing to consider. In 2019, a leopard rescue at the rubber factory ended tragically when the big cat sprinted out and was crushed in a road accident. This time, with the tigress safely ensconced in a tank, they were relieved. And at 11.25am on Friday, Gangwar found his mark. The tigress was tranquilised. “Fortunately, she was darted on the first attempt. Within a few minutes, we moved her into a cage and started reviving her,” Gangwar told TOI. The National Tiger Conservation Authority had consented to moving her to a safer area. “No human casualty was reported in the time she was here,” DFO Lal said. Gangwar added, “The only time she injured two men was when they set the area where she had killed a blackbuck on fire. That was last month. Both the men had minor injuries. The attack was in self-defence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/rubber-factory-tigress-rescued-in-up-after-15-months-of-evading-foresters/articleshow/83648669.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Chandigarh||Reports of my meet with Punjab CM Amarinder Singh incorrect, says Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa||CHANDIGARH: Amid reports of chief minister Amarinder Singh reaching out to him, Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa on Friday denied it but claimed that the former needs to fix irritants in the bureaucracy. However, the party circles remained abuzz about Amarinder meeting with Bajwa, facilitated by some party MPs. The CM has been holding meetings with party MLAs and MPs over the past few days amid the upheaval in the state unit. “There has been no meeting at all. But if he wants to come, he is most welcome at my place. I have nothing personal against him, there has only been difference of opinion – including that on the functioning of the government. It is not me alone, there are MPs, ministers and the party cadre who feel that the promises made before the elections need to be fulfilled,” he said, adding that his 45-day ultimatum to fulfil promises on sacrilege stands. Asked about Navjot Singh Sidhu, Bajwa said, “When Sidhu was about to join the Congress, some senior party leaders were resisting it. I had intervened and recommended his induction. I had said he would be an asset. MLA Pargat Singh is aware of this. He should get a key role in Punjab. At the same time, I wish to say that reaching top positions takes time and one should accept whatever role the party decides for a leader. No colonel can become a general overnight. He should be given a role and the interests of the traditional Congress families should also not be ignored.” He added that there is a need for promotional representation to various communities. It is for the party leadership to decide whether they plan to make changes in the cabinet or the party organisation. “There are some officers in the bureaucracy, police and the office of the advocate general, who should consider sidestepping. It would have been much better had the AG resigned instead of his wife. If there are some irritants in the government and the ministers have a problem, such people should understand it,” he said. “Two of our key demands include justice in sacrilege and firing cases, and making public the names of influential people mentioned in sealed cover reports lying with courts,” said Bajwa. Asked if Amarinder would be the face of the party in 2022, Bajwa said it is a decision to be taken by the party high command. “The three member Kharge panel has taken feedback from everyone,” he said. “I am not a candidate for the chief minister’s post or PPCC chief and will honour whatever decision is taken by the party high command,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/reports-of-my-meet-with-cm-incorrect/articleshow/83650777.cms||---

The public works department (PWD) is yet to restore these roads back to normal, which in turn may delay the reopening of these destinations for tourism. While the restoration works have started at Shangumugham, the maintenance works at Ponmudi hills are still in the tendering stage. The entire beach had disappeared and the roads were critically damaged at Shangumugham a month ago owing to sea erosion during heavy rains. The high range road to Ponmudi suffered partial damages during the monsoon rains a week ago, forcing the administration to close the road. The road between the hairpin curves 11 and 12 suffered damages at several spots after the earth under it eroded in the heavy rains. Rain water continues to drain through these gaps, which if not rectified on time, may cause the road to cave in. Already, depressions have formed at several spots along this stretch. Crash barriers at hairpin curve 18 had also collapsed in the rain. Speaking to TOI, Jyothy R, executive engineer, roads division (Thiruvananthapuram), PWD, said that the works at both the locations were delayed owing to different reasons. “At Shangumugham, we were progressing with the work even during the triple lockdown, after securing special travel permits for workers. But the weather that turned adverse again hampered the progress of the work. The work of the diaphragm wall was stalled after it started raining again,” Jyothi said. Though the works resumed a few days ago, they were still facing difficulties such as lack of availability of sufficient quarry materials . The works of the eight-meter deep diaphragm wall along the coast of Shangumugham commenced over eight months ago. Regarding Ponmudi, the PWD executive engineer said that the spots where soil eroded under the road had to be filled again. “We are right now in the process of inviting tender for awarding contract for this work,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/monsoon-affects-road-repair-works/articleshow/83648701.cms||---

Both of them died on spot on Friday afternoon. Deepak Kashyap, a businessman whose welding shop was shut for quite some time, killed himself just hours before he was to be discharged after completing treatment for liquor de-addiction. A probe is currently on, police said. Deepak’s wife Kanchan had left the house three months ago after a fight. He was living with his mother and son Divyansh in Sanjay Nagar area. He was admitted at the hospital in Prem Nagar area on June 15 and was supposed to be discharged on Friday. His mother, Chandravati, said, “I had told my son that I am arranging money for the hospital bill. I had gone to pawn my jewellery, but he jumped off the terrace along with my grandson. I don’t know how I would live now.” A doctor at the private hospital said, “We were completing the formalities of discharge when our staff said that Deepak jumped off after throwing his son. We all were shocked and rushed to help them, but they both died.” Bareilly’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, “Financial crisis, alcohol addiction and disputes with wife seem to be the reason behind Deepak’s extreme step. We are investigating if the hospital staff had exerted pressure on them. We have sent the bodies for post-mortem examination. So far no complaint has been lodged by the family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/biz-gone-bust-man-35-kills-his-only-son-then-jumps-to-death-from-hospital-in-bareilly/articleshow/83648704.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Patna||Speculations rife about Paras, JD(U) MPs getting berths in Modi cabinet||PATNA: With PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah holding a series of meetings with senior BJP leaders during the last seven days in Delhi, speculations are rife about possible Union cabinet expansion in the next few days. And, there is a strong buzz in Bihar’s political circles about the likely inclusion of JD(U) members as well as rebel LJP MP Pashupati Kumar Paras in the Union cabinet. Paras himself gave air to the speculations on Thursday by categorically saying he would give up the post of the LJP’s parliamentary party chairman if he becomes a cabinet minister. The way Paras made his statement indicated that he had been assured of cabinet berth in place of his elder brother late Ram Vilas Paswan, who was a minister in the Modi government till his death. Sources said, Paras made an overnight coup in the party only after getting a firm assurance from the NDA’s top brass about a cabinet berth. “Since Paras has already been notified as the LJP parliamentary party leader in the Lok Sabha by the Speaker, his entry in the Modi cabinet as the LJP representative is confirmed,” a senior LJP leader told TOI on Friday. “Paras and three other LJP MPs -- Choudhary Mehboob Ali Kaiser, Veena Devi and Chandan Singh — returned to Delhi on Friday in the wake of likely political developments,” LJP spokesperson Shravan Kumar Agrawal told TOI over phone from Delhi. As per the Constitutional provisions, the cap on the Union council of ministers is 15% of the strength of the Lok Sabha, or 81. At present, the Union cabinet has 54 ministers, including PM Modi. Thus, 27 more people can be ministers in the Modi cabinet. Currently, there are five ministers from Bihar, all are from BJP. Ravi Shankar Prasad and Giriraj Singh are cabinet ministers while Raj Kumar Singh is minister of state with independent charge and Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Nityanand Rai are the ministers of state. Four of them are from upper castes and Rai is from OBC community. BJP sources said the party leadership now wants to induct ministers from other castes, especially from Baniyas (trading community) and the scheduled castes, who have so far remained unrepresented from the state BJP quota. Names of Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi and BJP state president Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal are doing the rounds as the frontrunner for the cabinet berth at the Centre. Sources in the JD(U) said party president RCP Singh and Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh would be the party’s first choice, if BJP offers only two cabinet berths to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar’s party. But JD(U) also wants one member from the extremely backward castes (EBCs), which are its core voters, in the Union cabinet. Hence, it wants at least three berths. “In that case, Rajya Sabha member Ram Nath Thakur (son of former CM late Karpoori Thakur) and Jehanabad MP Chandeshwar Prasad may be considered,” a senior JD(U) leader said, adding the party would join the Modi cabinet only when it gets a “respectable representation”. When contacted, JD(U) national spokesperson K C Tyagi told TOI that any decision regarding the inclusion of JD(U) members in the Union cabinet would be taken by CM Nitish. “We will let you know, if the party takes any decision in this regard,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/speculations-rife-about-paras-jdu-mps-getting-berths-in-modi-cabinet/articleshow/83648712.cms||Madan Kumar

In the last two days, the district reported 10% TPR, which is much less when compared to the two previous weeks in June. The TPR had gone up to 16.8% on June 2 when the total cases reported in the day was 2,380. On June 4, the TPR was 16.6% and on June 10, the TPR was 16.4%. If above 2,000 cases were reported in the first two weeks of this month now, the caseload has come down to 1,000 per day. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the district was showing an improving trend in the reporting of new cases this week and hence, it has to be continued for reducing the TPR further. He said people should comply with the Covid protocols and restrictions will have to be followed. However, he expressed concern over the way people have started coming out in large numbers when the lockdown restrictions were eased. He said people should be aware that if the TPR goes high, then more restrictions will come into place. Hence, it is up to the people to bring down the TPR here. At present, only six local bodies in the district are having TPR above 30%. Apart from this, 38 local bodies are having TPR ranging between 20% and 30%. The city corporation and 31 local bodies are in the 8% to 20% category and three local bodies are having below 8% test positivity. On Friday, the district reported 1,550 more positive cases taking the total number of cases reported till date to 2,83,631. As many as 1,581 people got recovered from the virus.

Their team studied the impact of the tragedy on the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay area along the five coastal districts of the state from Ramanathapuram to Nagapattinam, covering nearly 500 kms. There were fears that the spillage of several tonnes of nitric acid, diesel and plastics and other waste could affect the fish in Indian waters. The scientist added that fisherfolk and the Indian Coast Guard at Mandapam and the Indian Naval base Parundu in Ramanathapuram district were engaged in surveillance by sea and air. “Our scientific team has been testing water samples every day and fish samples on alternative days. But there is no trace of impact of the incident,” he added. Scientific teams of CMFRI have been analysing six to seven water samples and 60 to 70 fish samples a day to check for toxic materials. Samples from fish caught on country crafts and fibre boats as well as trawler boats were found to be healthy.The scientists said the lack of any impact was because the southwest monsoon and water current took the spillage south of the Indian Ocean. “We are in touch with Space Applications Centre scientists at Ahmedabad to check for satellite images of floating materials in Indian waters,” Jeyakumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/no-impact-of-ship-fire-off-sl-coast-on-fish-in-indian-waters-cmfri/articleshow/83653099.cms||M K Ananth

They said the livelihood of over 1,000 people, predominantly women, depended on the revival of the sector in Sellur alone. Private Handloom Manufacturers Association president G Subash Chandrabose said Sellur was once the handloom hub of Madurai city, with over 40 to 50 units employing thousands. Though the 1993 floods led to closure of a majority of the units, 10 to 12 of them still continued to provide jobs, especially women, who earn not less than Rs 100 daily. In 2010, late chief minister M Karunanidhi announced 100 units of free power for handloom units and 200 units for powerloom units. J Jayalalithaa enhanced this quota to 200 units for handlooms and 500 units for powerlooms. However, this was stopped for the past three years and the AIADMK government did not give free power to handloom units though power looms continued to enjoy the benefit. ‘Sitta’ thread, the yarn used for handloom, was also being produced in lesser quantities while cone yarn production of powerlooms was high. The price of yarn had also increased from Rs 1,100 for a 5-kilogram bundle three months ago to Rs 1,400 now. Chandrabose said the government should also take steps to control yarn price. Stocks also stagnated in the shops as they had been closed during this period like last year due to the lockdown. They had bank loans and other expenses to manage. The government should give the production of certain items like handloom towels only to them, as power looms had also started making them, he said. Tamil Maanila Congress president G K Vasan has urged the government to give a relief of Rs 3,000 to weavers affected by the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/pvt-handloom-weavers-seek-free-power-stopped-3-yrs-ago/articleshow/83653108.cms||---

The minister said the government was working towards bringing down Covid-19 cases in the state. “The temples will reopen as soon as the disease is brought under control and the state reports no Covid death,” he said.The minister said the kumbabishekam of the Meenakshi temple will be performed after the renovation of the Veera Vasantharayar mandapam, which is expected to be completed in two years. The mandapam was ravaged in a fire in 2018. He said that the mandapam is being be renovated at a cost of Rs 18.10 crore and the stones required for the renovation would be brought from the quarry in Namakkal, as soon as the lockdown is eased.“The previous AIADMK government worked at a snail’s pace in renovating the mandapam but the DMK government would act with the speed of a rabbit and renovate it,” he said.On being asked about making the details of temple jewellery public online, the minister said this was not possible as it would pose safety issues. Strong rooms would be built at temples for the safekeeping of jewellery, he said. As many as 108 strong rooms are to be constructed, Babu added.The minister was briefed about the health of the temple elephant Parvathy, which is suffering from cataract in both eyes. He said the best medical attention would be given to the elephant even if it meant bringing experts from other states or abroad. Dr Ramany, veterinary doctor who had been transferred to Theni would be brought back to Madurai to give the elephant better treatment, he said.The DMK government was committed to the welfare of the 30 temple elephants in the state, he said. Temple land which was encroached upon would be retrieved and if needed stringent action would be taken against those who usurped temple property, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/temples-will-open-if-cases-are-reined-in-deaths-nil-min/articleshow/83653136.cms||---

---||Mumbai||30 Sainiks assault MMRDA officials over action against illegal buildings||BHIWANDI: Narpoli police on Friday booked 30 Shiv Sena workers, including local leader Devanand Thale, for allegedly assaulting MMRDA officials over action against illegal constructions in Bhiwandi. On June 1, MMRDA started razing unauthorised construct-ions in Kalher and Kasheli gr-am panchayat areas in Bhiwandi following a high court order. Times ViewThe Shiv Sena leadership must send a message to its activists that such brazen violence will not be tolerated. The party’s leader is now the CM, and hence it becomes even more imperative that such behavior be not condoned. The new generation of Sena leaders, some of them articulate, must introspect and decide the direction in which they want to take the party.The incident occurred on Thursday afternoon when people living in these illegal buildings complained to local Sena MLA Shantaram More and Thale, vice-president of the party’s Thane district. While discussion was on with MMRDA officers, an angry mob of over two dozen party workers, who were with Thale, suddenly started assaulting MMRDA law officer Milind Pradhan and other officials in the presence of the police. The mob also damaged equipment of a cameraman who was recording the attack. A police officer said acting on the complaint of Pradhan, 30 people including Thale, were booked under 11 sections of the IPC. Defending the attack, Thale told mediapersons that MMRDA officials were helping builders from the region sell their flats by acting against developers selling flats at a cheaper price. Of the 60 gram panchayats under Bhiwandi taluka in MMRDA’s jurisdiction, a large number of residential buildings have been constructed in Kalher and Kasheli panchayat areas. Most of these buildings are unauthorised and a dispute is pending in the court. Notices have been issued to more than 200 buildings in the area. The HC recently ordered the demolition of some of these buildings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-30-sainiks-assault-mmrda-officials-over-action-against-illegal-buildings/articleshow/83653206.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Pune||Pune: Dine-in service at restaurants, visit to malls not allowed this weekend||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) issued an order on Friday telling restaurants, malls and establishments like salons and spas to remain closed on weekends, dealing a blow to the possibility of recovering some of the losses. Restaurants can, however, execute parcel orders on Saturday and Sunday, but dining at establishments on weekends has been disallowed. The PMC order, which came into force on Friday, stated that non-essential shops like malls, beauty parlours, salons, spas, wellness centers, etc, will remain closed on Saturday and Sunday. As per the order, restaurants, bars, and food courts can only execute parcel services/home deliveries till 11 pm on Saturday and Sunday. The order will be applicable in PMC limits until further notice. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol told TOI, “Although the positivity rate in PMC limits is below 5%, we have decided to let the weekend curbs remain for now. If restrictions are lifted suddenly during weekends, there is a likelihood of increased rush. We will review the situation before next weekend.” Vikram Shetty, vice-president of Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA), said that weekends account for five weekdays’ worth of business, with close to 50% revenues. “Weekend curbs will add to losses suffered by the industry during the second wave. The industry deals with perishables and is labour-intensive. Instead of shutting dine-ins completely on weekends, restricted operational timings would have been a better option to curb the rush. Restaurants have bought perishables like onions and other veggies in bulk and they would not be able to finish them through just parcel orders, causing a huge wastage,” he said. Ganesh Shetty, president of PRAHA, said, “We have to pay the staff on monthly basis and while paying salaries, we cannot deduct the weekend quantum of wages. Nearly 40-50% restaurants have still not opened for dine-ins. Those who have not begun dine-ins are unlikely to start the facility until weekend curbs are lifted.” Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, chief operating officer of Amanora Mall and member of Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI) said, “Business mainly happens on weekends in malls. If there is no permission to operate on Saturdays and Sundays, then keeping the malls open on weekdays also does not make much sense. We hardly have any footfall between Monday and Friday. Operational costs are very high and a weekend closure disrupts the momentum. In many other cities in the country, malls have been allowed to operate on weekends after the cases started dropping.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dine-in-service-at-restaurants-visit-to-malls-not-allowed-this-weekend/articleshow/83650899.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Nagpur||Will ban all those who assault medics, vandalize hospitals: Indian medical association Nagpur||NAGPUR: To condemn assaults on doctors, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Nagpur branch, took part in a pan India protest titled ‘Save the Saviours’ on Friday. The fraternity has decided to boycott patients, their relatives and all those who indulge in violence against doctors and vandalization of hospitals. Doctors kept their OPDs closed from 8am to 2pm. Later, they worked wearing black badges. At the IMA Hall, nearly 90 doctors slammed the government for its inaction against miscreants. President of Nagpur IMA Dr Sanjay Deotale said doctors cannot work in an atmosphere of fear. “We want a centralized act to stop violence against doctors and vandalization of hospitals. Unfortunately, government agencies, including the police, are unaware of the law meant to protect doctors against violence,” he said. Doctors at government and charity hospitals also took part in the protest and worked wearing black badges. Later in the day, a delegation met district collector Ravindra Thakre and handed over a memorandum of demands. “Resident doctors and juniors are victims of mob violence. Whenever any young doctor is assaulted, the others stop taking the risk of saving a patient’s life,” said Dr Ashutosh Jadhav. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, attacks on doctors and hospitals have risen,” said Dr Sanjay Deshpande. “Political parties must ensure that party workers do not assault doctors or heath care workers or even vandalize hospital property,” he said, adding, doctors’ wings of political parties should demand expulsion of those guilty of any act of violence against doctors. DOCTORS’ DEMANDS * Central Hospital and Health Care Professional Protections Act with IPC & CrPC * Standardization and augmentation of security in hospitals *Declare hospitals as protected zones *Punish culprits in fast-track mode||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/will-ban-all-those-who-assault-medics-vandalize-hosps-ima/articleshow/83648726.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Retd Army man recounts police torture, says can’t sit or walk, two SIs suspended||PILIBHIT: Resham Singh, 41, served in the Army for 18 years, retired as a Naik with an “exemplary” record and was felicitated for his role in a 2004 Poonch operation that took down six militants. On May 3, while he was on his way to Lakhimpur Kheri for a funeral, he was stopped at a checkpost in Pilibhit by cops and asked for papers. An altercation ensued, the escalation of which ended with Singh being tortured for hours. A month on, Singh faces an FIR along with his 82-year-old mother, who was also allegedly hit with batons that day. Eight cops against whom action has been taken could also face attempt to murder charges if the charges were proven, a senior police officer told TOI. Two sub inspectors among them have already been suspended. “They thrashed me, slapped my sisters for intervening and charged at my elderly mother with batons,” Singh told TOI. “My turban fell on the road. We weren’t allowed to pick it up. They took me away. Sub inspector (SI) Ram Naresh was inebriated. He tortured me inside the police station, inserted an oil-stained baton in my rectum and thrashed me for over three hours with belts and batons.” It has been a month, but he can barely sit, sleep or move around. The checkpost where he was stopped that day was near a panchayat poll counting centre. Two bystanders who shot a video had their phones snatched and were later named in the FIR along with Singh. “There were 50-odd people who witnessed what happened. Police were thrashing him mercilessly. I started shooting a video but police detained me. They held another man from my village,” one of them, Satinder Singh, 24, told TOI. “They tried to delete the video but couldn’t access it.” The FIR against the cops took five days to register, Singh said. Eventually, eight cops — six constables and two SIs — were booked for voluntarily causing hurt, wrongful confinement, rioting and intentional insult. The two SIs, Ram Naresh and Raees Amad, have been suspended. A probe against Lallan Singh, the circle officer (CO) of Puranpur, under whose jurisdiction this happened, is pending. The CO, who had said Singh was never tortured, has been charged with providing “wrong information” to SP Kirit Kumar Rathod. An independent probe by Rathod found “facts had been twisted”. Circle officer Virendra Vikram is now overseeing the case. “In this case, the allegations are grave. If found true, the policemen could be charged under Section 377 (unnatural offences) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC because the nature of the injuries could have been life-threatening,” a senior IPS officer told TOI. While the medical report from the district hospital did not go into the gravity of Singh’s injuries, another report following an examination at the Military Hospital in Bareilly mentions “blunt trauma” over gluteal region, left foot and right ring finger, and that he was “beaten by wooden stick/leather belt with fb (foreign body) introduction into rectum”. Support for Singh, meanwhile, has gained ground. Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa has written to the National Human Rights Commission. Prominent Sikh leader Jasbir Singh Virk said, “Farmers, ex-army men and the Sikh community are in support of Resham Singh and we all will ensure that his fight will continue until justice is served.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/retd-army-man-recounts-police-torture-says-cant-sit-or-walk-8-cops-booked/articleshow/83648718.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Pune||Pune: Doctors start offering newest Covid drug to select patients||PUNE: Six mild to moderately ill Covid patients with multiple comorbid conditions showed faster recovery after taking the newest Covid medicine — a single dose cocktail of monoclonal antibodies at four different hospitals in the city in the last two weeks. All the six patients did not progress to severe Covid illness post-therapy, the treating doctors said. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system to fight the virus and help patients make a quick recovery. It is meant only for patients with mild to moderate symptoms. The single-dose therapy costs Rs60,000, which puts it out of reach for many. “We treated two patients with monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy. Both have quite a few comorbid conditions. But they responded well to the treatment and didn’t develop any complications,” said infectious diseases expert Mahesh Lakhe of Columbia Asia hospital in Kharadi. One of the two patients was an 83-year-old man having diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension and a lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Another was a 70-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease, diabetes and who underwent various surgeries in the past. She had moderate Covid. “Both the patients were given the therapy within three days of Covid positive report and less than a week of symptoms. They had mild to moderate infections and did not require oxygenation. But both had a high-risk profile to develop severe Covid,” Lakhe said. Noble Hospital’s senior physician and medical director Dilip Mane treated two patients with the antibody cocktail. “Both were treated within seven days of the onset of Covid symptoms and diagnosis. Both had moderate Covid. One of them, a 55-year-old man, recovered within five days. The other 65-year-old woman took seven days. Both are doing good post-discharge,” Mane said. A severely obese woman with lung and cardiac conditions was also treated with therapy 10 days ago at Jehangir hospital. The woman’s Covid resolved within two days, but she needed hospitalisation for her other underlying chronic conditions. “The Covid recovery was good. She was at high risk of slipping into the stormy course of illness because of her pre-existing medical conditions but that did not happen. So, we can say the therapy helped her,” said a doctor from Jehangir hospital who refused to be named. Doctors are divided over its overall usefulness as a therapy. “With the results we are seeing in India, single-dose cocktails of monoclonal antibodies seem to be a highly effective way to stop disease progression in people who may develop severe Covid infection, and thereby reduce chances of ICU admission as well as death,” Lakhe said. “The cocktail therapy is not a miracle drug. Studies have shown that it can reduce hospitalisation or repeat emergency visits by about 70%. Currently, evidence is not robust for its usage,” said Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital’s infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag. The therapy is not meant for every Covid patient. “Only those who are not on oxygen therapy, have multiple comorbidities and hence, are at risk of severe progression are considered for the therapy. It needs to be given within three days of diagnosis of Covid and within a week of the onset of symptoms,” Prayag said. “Studies have shown that it works against variants like B1.617. But efficacy may reduce as new variants emerge. Polyclonal antibodies (which are being studied) offer more hope,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/docs-start-offering-newest-covid-drug-to-select-patients/articleshow/83650866.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Week’s positivity rate in PMC limits 4.8%, PCMC areas 5.01%||PUNE: The Covid-19 weekly positivity rate in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation limits as well as in Pune rural areas registered a slight dip this week compared to the previous seven-day period, giving a glimmer of hope of some more relaxations in the pandemic-induced curbs. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar would conduct a Covid situation review meeting on Saturday. A senior district official said some more relaxations in restrictions were expected following the drop in the weekly positivity rate (WPR), but the final decision would be taken in the meeting. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limit’s WPR came down to 4.85% from the last week’s 5%. In areas under the jurisdiction of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, it was 5.01% against 5.2% in the June 4-10 period. The WPR in the rural belt in the June 11-17 period was around 8.5% against the last week’s 9.7%. The state government’s five-level plan to unlock the state is based on the weekly positivity rate and the occupancy of oxygenated beds in districts and corporation limits. At present, the PMC is at level 2, PCMC is at level 3 and Pune rural at level 4. A senior health official said, “We have to be careful while opening up. It will be risky to open up completely unless Covid protocols are followed.” Earlier this week, the state task force warned of an impending third wave. The state’s technical advisor and member of the state, district and national task force, Dr Subhash Salunkhe, told TOI that a cautious approach should be adopted because violation of Covid protocols was observed in different places this week. He said, “Models suggested decreasing of cases by June 20 and the projected numbers were around 30,000, but we are still above 67,000. The focus should on vaccine coverage ahead of the third wave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/weeks-positivity-rate-in-pmc-limits-4-8-pcmc-areas-5-01/articleshow/83650891.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Experts call for ramping up data mgmt in states||Pune: Health experts across the country have called for a proper data management system, stressing on transparency in the second year of the pandemic. Epidemiologists and health activists have been writing to the Union government about creating a system that will enable daily uploading and help trained personnel to provide real time alerts. Public health expert and a member of the task force Dr Giridhara Babu said that the most important lesson from the 1918 influenza was to tell the truth regarding data. He said that whenever true figures are suppressed during a pandemic the data get skewed. “As a result, modelers make unreliable projections, so wrong policies and programmes are formulated. Hence, transparent and free data for experts should be made available by all states,” he shared. He explained that systematic collection, compilation and analysis of clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data is paramount to decision making. According to experts, a core expert group, comprising clinicians, epidemiologists and laboratory personnel, should be constituted at the district-, state- and national-level and entrusted with suggesting appropriate interventions to the concerned authorities. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientists have stressed on effective data output from states. Task force members have said that states should work on data management, which will enable them to make decisions. Senior epidemiologist Dr Samiran Panda said that states should have their own mechanism to collate proper data. “They can either assign their own people or outsource it but there should be dedicated staff to ensure that data is correctly made available,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-call-for-ramping-up-data-mgmt-in-states/articleshow/83650924.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The move aims at avoiding duplication. However, the corporators have pressed for the reinstatement of the hospitals, stating that the PMC must provide healthcare to needy citizens.A proposal regarding the demand has been given to the health department. “The removal of the hospitals is going to cause problems for the urban poor. They will not be able to avail treatment at cheaper rates so the hospitals should be added to the list again,” said corporator Yuvraj Beldare.Other elected members said that the scheme should not be discontinued, specially during the pandemic. “The civic administration has taken a call to reduce the number of hospitals for better management of funds to be utilised. The spending of public money can be reduced after decreasing the number of hospitals,” said a senior PMC official.He said citizens can use other schemes available at the ten hospitals that were removed from the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/corporators-take-on-civic-decision-on-health-scheme/articleshow/83650935.cms||---

On the instructions of district collector Antar Singh Nehra, additional district collector Iqbal Khan on Friday gave time till June 30 to the officers concerned to complete this work after conducting a survey. “Even as this land was allotted to Rajasthan university, this was not registered in the name of the university in the revenue record. Now, this land will be registered in the name of the university through mutation,” said Khan. He also gave instructions to the officials of forest department, Jaipur Development Authority (JDA), tehsildars (Sanganer and Jaipur) and SDM Sanganer to conduct a survey and take action to register all undisputed land through mutation in the name of the university - which is currently registered in the name of forest department or JDA (Jaipur Development Authority) - but has been allotted to the university or belongs to the university. At present, the total land under the possession of Rajasthan University and affiliated colleges is 204.33 hectares. Its measurement in bigha is about 817 bigha. Out of this land, 323 bigha land has been renamed in the name of Rajasthan University. This part of the land belongs to the main campus of the university. But even after many years, till now 494 Bigha, i.e. 123.5 hectares of land, has not been registered in the name of Rajasthan University. This land is presently located in revenue villages Mahadevpura (Chakbhavani Shankarpura Tehsil) Jhalana Dungri (Tehsil Sanganer). It also includes 153 bigha land of Rajasthan College and Commerce college and 83 bigha land of Maharaja College and Maharani College.

According to health department officials, over 400 hospitals in the district have demanded 26 lakh doses of Covishield and 7.5 lakh doses of Covaxin. The supply to these hospitals will be facilitated by the Union government and beneficiaries will have to pay for it. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), told TOI, “Around 471 hospitals from the district have demanded a combined 26 lakh doses of Covishield and 7.5 lakh doses of Covaxin. We will convey these figures to the Union government. If all these hospitals purchase the vaccines and start the vaccination drive, it will provide a major boost to the ongoing vaccination drive. We have to see when and how the vaccines will be made available and how many of these hospitals will make the actual purchase.” Deshmukh said the vaccination drive from June 21 was likely to get streamlined with better availability of doses. Officials of the Pune chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said vaccine allocation to the small- and medium-sized hospitals would decentralise and accelerate the vaccination process further. Sanjay Patil, chairman, IMA’s hospital board of India, told TOI, “With the addition of small- and medium-sized hospitals, the vaccination will reach the nearest hospitals across all parts of the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. It will surely help in achieving speedy vaccination drive and make sure the maximum number of citizens are vaccinated before the third wave strikes.” Earlier this month, the central directive on the vaccination stated, “States would aggregate the demand of private hospitals keeping in view equitable distribution between large and small private hospitals and regional balance...” On Saturday, the PMC will conduct vaccination drive for 30-44 age group at its 15 centres for the first dose.The civic body will also hold drive for second Covishield dose at 170 centres for 45-plus age group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/punes-small-medium-pvt-hosps-seek-33-5l-vaccines/articleshow/83650950.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Sensors will be fitted around the site for this purpose. Locations around the crematorium are being finalized and the process to install the sensors is under way. The air quality will be compared with that in other areas in the city, to see if locations around the crematorium are more polluted. After the Vaikuntha crematorium, monitoring will also be undertaken at other crematoriums. The assessment has been proposed after residents from the area claimed that the pollution is leading to health issues. The civic body will also extend the project to other areas. According to PMC officials, the work to install the sensors have started and locations, such as residential and commercial properties, have been selected near crematoriums. “The demand for the study was made by the residents. So, we have done this installation. The civic body will collect the data using the sensors,” said Shrinivas Kandul, a senior PMC official. He said that the presence of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur particles will be checked in this initiative. PMC may also set up the sensors in other locations since many crematoriums are located in densely populated areas. There are 24 cremation facilities, including electric- and gas-operated, across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-to-check-air-quality-near-crematoriums/articleshow/83653216.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Siby Mathews gets anticipatory bail||Thiruvananthapuram: A local court here has granted anticipatory bail for former IPS officer Siby Mathews, who has been made an accused in the FIR filed by the CBI in the Isro espionage case. Mathews, who is the fourth accused in the case as per the FIR, has been granted anticipatory bail by the district court, Thiruvananthapuram. Mathews was the DIG (crimes) when the ISro espionage case occurred. Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had cited offences including conspiracy, physical torture and forging false documents to trap central government officials. As many as 18 former police officials, including those who served in the Kerala Police and Intelligence Bureau during the Isro espionage case, have been named as accused in the FIR submitted by CBI in the chief judicial magistrate court here, in connection with the case. The original case was registered by the state police on October 20, 1994, at Vanchiyoor police station in the capital against a Maldivian national under Foreigner’s Act on the allegations of over staying in the country after expiry of her visa. Subsequently, another case registered at the same police station on November 13, 1994, under sections 3 & 4 of the Official Secrets Act, 1923, against two accused Maldivian nationals, on the allegations that they, in collusion with some others, had taken part in activities against the sovereignty and integrity of the country and had indulged in other activities which would harm India’s cordial relations with its neighbours. Later, the investigation of the cases were entrusted to a special investigation team of the state police. Four more persons, including scientist Nambi Narayanan working at Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) of Isro, were arrested on charges of espionage activities. Later, the investigation of these cases was transferred to CBI. In the espionage case, the CBI submitted a final report before the chief judicial magistrate, Ernakulam, which was accepted by the court, in which it was said that the allegations pertaining to espionage were found to be false. The Supreme Court had on April 15 this year ordered CBI to look into the justice D K Jain committee report on the role of some senior state police officials, who had framed Narayanan, in the espionage case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/siby-mathews-gets-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/83851201.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat students await USA, Canada visa slots||AHMEDABAD: Kavisha (name changed), 22, has already secured admission in a masters’ course in engineering in a prestigious American university. All set to go, she’s facing a hurdle in securing her interview at the visa centre. “Due to the pandemic, I had deferred the admission by a year. This year, it’s no online classes and campus presence is compulsory. The college would start from end of July, but I have still not got the slot for interview. It’s my long-cherished dream and I am praying that I would get the chance. I have also applied for the emergency quota,” she says. She’s not alone in the quest – thousands of students from Gujarat aspiring to go to the US and Canada for further studies are facing hurdles in getting the appointments. The students and their parents are fervently contacting the authorities in India, the US, and Canada alike. Sameer Yadav, a city-based student visa and immigration consultant, said that the US has opened slots for the interviews from June 14, thus the rush is natural. “However, it’s not advisable to try too many times – several of the students reported their accounts getting blocked for a few hours due to too many attempts. As the date of opening of the universities is very close, many students are worried that they might not make it before stipulated time,” he said. Anuj Parikh, owner of an immigration firm in Ahmedabad, said that comparatively, the process for Canada is smoother. “Like other countries, Canada is also cautious. But they are also aware of the importance of the foreign students from countries like India. The intake for many Canadian universities is from September. Thus, the students are hopeful of meeting the deadline by August,” he said. “There was no activity for long for the anxious students – we lost two months, and thus we are witnessing the sudden rush,” said Kavita Parikh, a visa consultant. “Majority of the students faced some technical error. We are hopeful of easing the rush in a few days.” The experts also raised the issue of vaccination and coordination between various countries for the Covid protocols. An expert said on condition of anonymity that several students were given the shots of vaccine not recognized abroad. “Such steps could have been prevented with better coordination,” said the expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/students-await-usa-canada-visa-slots/articleshow/83650967.cms||---

While TRS senior leaders and mandal incharges are touring the constituency by holding daily meetings with party workers and caste and community leaders in various mandals, Eatala along with his close aides is undertaking roadshows in a huge convoy of vehicles. After joining the BJP, Eatala along with wife Jamuna, party leader G Vivek and Dubbak MLA M Raghunandan Rao began campaigning in the constituency. They toured Kamalapur and Kathalapur mandals.

In Huzurabad’s Ambedkar Chowrasta, which is the main centre in the town, four hoardings on Rythu Bandhu and Rythu Bima schemes are a big attraction to crowds. Sources said TRS is planning a publicity blitzkrieg on various welfare schemes soon to counter Eatala, who has not been beaten in the constituency since 2009 elections. TRS mandal incharges like Palla Rajasekhar Reddy have been camping in the constituency and holding meetings with party workers. By taking function halls on rent, party leaders are regularly meeting to work out strategies to win the by-election. Minister Gangula Kamalakar held a meeting on Thursday with ration dealers, assuring them of solving their problems. The TRS leadership is taking representations and proposals from councillors, MPTC, ZPTC members and chairpersons on the works to be taken up, while officials have started sanctioning developmental works in the constituency. Party leaders said chief minister and TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao will undertake a visit to Huzurabad soon. “Since the government is planning to lift the lockdown, there will be some clarity on the CM’s tour,” a senior TRS leader said. He said the party machinery is gearing up to meet every voter in the constituency in the next two months. Meanwhile, sources said: “The ECI will have to conduct the elections within six months of vacancy of a seat. It will take a decision on the bypolls soon and conduct the elections in August.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/huzurabad-trs-banking-on-schemes-eatala-on-canvassing/articleshow/83651006.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Pune||Now, merge 2 ‘first dose’ vaccination certificates to get final one||PUNE: The Union government on Friday introduced a new feature on CoWin to merge two first dose certificates to get a final certificate, bringing relief to scores of beneficiaries who had got two first doses using different cellphone numbers. R S Sharma, chairman of the Empowered Group on Covid Vaccine Administration, told TOI that the two first dose certificates can be merged based on the ID credentials of those who had got the doses using different phone numbers. Users can log in on CoWin with their registered cellphone number, click on “Raise an issue” option, select “Merge multiple first dose provisional certificates” and follow the listed steps to get the final vaccination certificate. Merge 2 ‘first shot’ certs to get final oneSharma told TOI, “CoWin has an easy system of entry where users have to register using their cellphone numbers to create an account. Many people, for whatever reasons, got their two doses using different phone numbers. Technically, they should have got both doses with one account.” Sharma said CoWin does not work on duplicate entries and hence would not automatically prevent new sign-ins if the same person registers using another cellphone number. In its issue dated June 16, TOI had highlighted over a lakh duplicate CoWin entries of beneficiaries who had got two vaccine doses but were still being shown as due for the second dose. On the other hand, Mumbai resident Viraj Mehta has an issue with getting his mother’s vaccination certificate even after she has taken both doses. “My mother, a senior citizen, got two first dose certificates after taking both shots. Appointments for both doses were done using the same phone number. The second dose was scheduled through the Aarogya Setu app for April 15 at a paid centre. However, the certificate issued after the second dose says ‘dose 1’. I cannot get a helpful response from the hospital concerned either,” he said. Working professional Prabhakar Jagdale said, “My parents are facing an issue with getting the final certificate after the second dose. Seems like the second dose was logged as first dose in the system by mistake. Not sure if it happened due to an error at the centre in uploading information or an error in CoWin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cowin-to-allow-merging-of-2-first-dose-certs/articleshow/83650997.cms||Neha Madaan

In his letter to Pawar, Mandhare has also asked him to issue notices to departments concerned if the registration of deaths was being delayed. “We were initially made to believe that the death toll at private hospitals were yet to be updated because of various issues, including lack of manpower and time during the peak period of infection.

Amit Chavda, the Gujarat Congress president, said: “Due to the BJP government’s ignorance during India’s worst pandemic, the people of Gujarat have suffered.” He added: “As a Congress party initiative, we have requested people to fill online forms with the details of the family members they have lost to Covid.” Chavda went on to say: “So far, we have received the details of over 25,000 families which have lost one or more members due to Covid owing to the non-availability of medical resources.” Chavda said his party has segregated the details according to cities and districts. “We have directed our leaders and workers to personally meet the affected families, console them, and render all possible help,” he said. “Our workers are running a counselling helpline. They will try to analyze the common problems faced by the Covid-affected families and make a representation to the government to help such people.” Chavda said that his party has repeatedly raised concerns that the Gujarat government is trying to consider Covid deaths as fatalities of comorbid conditions. “That is making it difficult for families to get insurance and other benefits,” he said. “We have already demanded compensation for all the families which have lost their members to the pandemic.” Chavda said the Congress also demands that the government grant at least Rs 4 lakh assistance to each Covid-affected family in the state. “The majority of those who died were poor or from middle-class families,” he said. “Many were the sole earners in their families.” Aid for small businesses, vendors’: Amit Chavda, the Gujarat Congress president, said: “Due to the lockdown and various restrictions, street vendors, small businesses, and MSMEs have suffered.” They need to be given compensation for the major employment loss, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/will-reach-out-to-25k-pandemic-hit-families-guj-cong/articleshow/83651018.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Missing man found dead in Khanapur water body near Khadakwasla dam||PUNE: The body of the missing 38-year-old private insurance firm manager, suspected of having killed his wife (35) and son (7) on June 14, was found in a water body at Khanapur near Khadakwasla dam on Friday. “Sandip Musale, one of the local villagers fishing in the Khadakwasla dam backwaters, first spotted the body afloat. The villagers alerted police patil Ganesh Sapkal, who informed us about the body around 8.30am,” inspector Sadashiv Shelar of the Haveli police told TOI. “W suspect it to be a death by suicide. Postmortem will provide a more specific cause of death. The body had an injury mark on the neck. We suspect it is a self-inflicted injury,” he said. The police were searching for the man ever since the double murders came to light on the evening of June 15, when the woman and her son’s bodies were found 35km apart at village Khalad near Veer dam in Saswad and at Jambhulwadi off the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass, respectively. The Saswad police in rural Pune and the Bharati Vidyapeeth police have registered separate cases of murder. The family of the three had left their home in Lohegaon on June 14 for an outing in a self-driven hired SUV. The car was later found abandoned at Market Yard off the Pune-Satara road. CCTV footage collected by the investigators showed the man parking the SUV around 1.10am on June 15 and walking towards Swargate, following which he went untraceable. On Friday, the Haveli police found the deceased woman’s Aadhaar card, besides the blood stained clothes of the two murder victims and of the man himself in a backpack recovered from the spot at Khanapur. An umbrella and footwear were found nearby, Shelar said. The police have also found the man’s Aadhaar card in the pocket of the pants he was wearing. Senior inspector Jagannath Kalaskar from the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said, “The death is suspected to have occurred 12 hours before the body was found afloat. One of our teams and another from the Saswad police in rural Pune reached the spot on learning about the woman’s Aadhaar card. They identified the body as that of the missing man. The body was sent to Sassoon hospital for postmortem.” The water body is located at a secluded spot, around half-a-kilometer off the Khanapur road that goes towards Panshet dam. The police and the PMRDA’s fire-brigade personnel had to walk through a muddy pathway to reach the spot. The fire brigade personnel were continuing with their search for a weapon that may have been used by the suspect to inflict self-injury. Some villagers at the spot said a local woman had seen the man sitting alongside the main road with his backpack. The woman had no idea about what the matter could be, a villager said. Senior inspector Kalaskar said, “We were trying to track the route the man had taken from Market Yard. We spotted him last in the CCTV footage from the Nal Stop area on Karve Road. As we continued to track his route, the news about the body being found came.” Kalaskar said, “The man’s brother and father-in-law, both from Madhya Pradesh, came to Pune on learning about the incident. Both of them sad they had no idea about any strain in the couple’s relationship.” The couple had moved to Pune in 2007. The man was from the family of a retired district planning officer in Vidisha and his wife’s maternal home is in Bhopal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/missing-man-found-dead-in-khanapur-water-body-near-khadakwasla-dam/articleshow/83651033.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The committee had circulated an e-mail id (neetimpact2021@gmail.com) to seek opinion which has been widely shared by both sections.It is a false narrative that NEET will improve the quality of medical education and the deserving will get seat, says Su Moorthy, member of Kalvi Mempattu Kootamaippu, an education rights organisation. He said only the elite can become a doctor as they can clear NEET by getting expensive coaching. The policy to increase the financial burden of parents by way of NEET coaching cannot be justified. Since Tamil Nadu has more medical colleges to offer more seats, other states are not opposing as their children too are getting an opportunity in Tamil Nadu, he said. “We are not against students from other states becoming doctors. But we have a large rural population,” said M A Aleem, senior neurologist. “They will be treated effectively for ailments if one among them becomes doctor. For treating people in his village by becoming a doctor, why should he compete with students from across the country,” he said. Aleem said the state has the highest gross enrolment ratio in the country as we could give opportunity to them to pursue higher education. But opportunity must be given to prove themselves instead of denying seats to potential candidates through NEET.Social activist N Veerasekaran said a screening test is essential for professional courses like MBBS. While questions are asked from classes VII-XII syllabus, state board syllabus too has been upgraded. Last year most of the questions were asked from state board text books, he said. If rural students aren’t able to compete will urban students, then we need to improve the curriculum and enhance the capabilities of the teachers. There is no difference in the salary of government school teachers in urban and rural areas, he said. However, S Jawahar, a parent of an MBBS student who cleared NEET, said earlier it was possible for the rich to get their children admitted to medical colleges even if they scored average marks in class XII. That is not possible now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/pro-anti-neet-groups-busy-mobilising-opinion/articleshow/83651028.cms||Sampath Kumar

As such, the facility was frequented by many people in the recent past. We are now collecting information about the visitors to his clinic, apart from questioning some criminals on record and persons known to be involved in past robberies,” Deshmukh told TOI.He said, “The dacoity suspects chose a specific target without striking anywhere else in the locality. They went about in a precise manner as if they had done a strong recce of the premises. Normally, the criminals in such a case would have attempted to rob other houses in the same locality. But that wasn’t the case here.”The CCTV footage collected from 25 to 30 locations and examined by the investigators showed that there were a total 11 men. Of them, six proceeded to the first-floor bedroom to rob Rs50 lakh and valuables worth Rs16 lakh. The remaining five stayed behind, the police said. From the footage, the police also suspect that the gang came in a four-wheeler tempo.The police have, so far, recorded the statements of the three caretakers hired by the doctor for maintaining the clinic. They were sleeping when the crime occurred.

Born on March 14, 1953, Deshmukh had an illustrious career of over four decades as a lawyer. He was also instrumental in advocating the setting up of a bench of Bombay high court at Aurangabad. He filed some important public interest litigations (PILs) that benefited the region. Deshmukh also waged a legal battle in the Supreme Court for equitable distribution of water for Marathwada. Deshmukh, who also lead advocacy group Marathwada Janta Vikas Parishad, was always vocal about the demand for separate statehood for Marathwada. Advocate Satish Talekar, in his condolence message, said Deshmukh carried the legacy of late freedom fighter Govindbhai Shroff further. “Deshmukh left his imprint not only in the legal field, but also on social and cultural movements in Marathwada,” he said. Water rights activist Abhijeet Dhanorkar said Deshmukh selflessly fought several legal battles in the interest of Marathwada. “Besides ensuring Marathwada its just share in water distribution, Deshmukh waged legal battles at his own expense for improving education sector in Marathwada. His untimely demise is a huge loss to the region,” he said. He is survived by his mother, wife, daughter, son and grandchildren. Last rites were performed him in presence of relatives and eminent personalities at Mukundwadi crematorium on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/marathwadas-legal-eagle-deshmukh-passes-away/articleshow/83646939.cms||---

According to the new system launched earlier this week, those with Aadhaar cards could appear for an online test from home instead of visiting the regional transport offices (RTO). A Pune RTO official said that the number of people visiting for the test had reduced by 20%. “The system has been able to attract many people and we feel the daily appointment quota for a permanent licence might have to be increased in the coming months,” a Pune RTO official said. A senior official of the transport department said around 6,000 licences including 400 in Pune were being issued daily in the state after the online tests were launched. “The facility has been started to help licence seekers and reduce the number of people waiting at RTOs to appear for the exam during the pandemic”, the official said. A total of 300 appointments per day were given to those appearing for the learners’ licence exam at the Pune RTO. “However, the quota is only for those that are willing to come to the office for the tests. There is no limit for those giving the test from home. Hence, we are anticipating that there would be a rise in the number of people visiting to appear for the permanent licence test. We can increase the quota only after the number of those visiting the RTO for learners’ licence exam dips,” the Pune’s deputy RTO Sanjiv Bhor, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1400-learners-licences-issued-via-online-tests/articleshow/83651086.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Hyderabad||Spurious seeds worth Rs 6cr seized, CA among 13 held||Hyderabad: Spurious seeds worth Rs 6 crore have been seized and 13 members of an inter-state gang, including a chartered accountant (CA), have been arrested by Nalgonda police. Three more gang members are absconding. Officials said had farmers bought and used the spurious seeds, it could have resulted in loss of crop in 40,000 acres. Police said the main accused is Enobothula Srinivas Reddy, who runs Nairuthi Seeds and sells spurious seeds. A CA, Srinivas hails from Gundlapochampally in Medchal. West zone IG Stephen Ravindra, Hyderabad range IG Shivshankar Reddy, Nalgonda DIG and SP AV Ranganath and district agriculture officer Sridhar Reddy said on Friday that 20 tonnes of cotton seed worth Rs 4 crore and 200 tonnes of paddy, maize and vegetables seeds worth Rs 2 crore were seized. The gang, which has a criminal history, was operating from Nandyal and Alagadda in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh, Gundlapochampally and Devaryamjal in Medchal and Yellampet in Warangal districts. Two cars and 13 mobile phones, which were being used by the gang members were seized. Managing director of Nairuthi Seeds and owner of MG Agritech were among those arrested for the illegal trade in spurious seeds. The investigation by police began when some farmers from Devarakonda provided the Task Force with information about the spurious seeds trade. Police said they thoroughly investigated the matter for 15 days and were successful in busting the racket and nabbing the culprits. Police said Karnati Madhusudhan Reddy of Nandyal, who was among those arrested, has criminal history. He was arrested in various districts in the past few years in both AP and Telangana. Nalgonda police had sent him to jail under the PD Act earlier. After his release from jail, Madhusudhan continued with the illegal trade, police said. During the investigation, police conducted raids in Gajwel, Mahbubnagar, Jadcherla, Hyderabad and Medchal areas and seized the spurious seeds. The gang would convince farmers that the seeds they were selling were genuine. If farmers complained that they suffered losses after buying seeds from them, the gang members would lay the blame on the soil, lack of rains or not using proper fertilisers, police added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spurious-seeds-worth-rs-6cr-seized-ca-among-13-held/articleshow/83651079.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The minister readily agreed to it and directed the collector to take necessary steps and also assured to implement it across the state. All the six MLAs of Pudukottai were invited for the government event in which Ma Subramanian took stock of the Covid-preventive measures in the district. Speaking on the occasion, Vijayabaskar urged the minister to take steps to reduce the death rate in the state. Since recovered patients are facing health issues, he asked the minister to start post-Covid rehabilitation centres in every district to ensure early diagnosis. While thanking Vijayabaskar for his suggestions, the health minister later told reporters that a positive atmosphere was necessary to work for people’s welfare. During the AIADMK rule, DMK MLAs were denied entry into government events despite protocol allowing it. However, on Thursday, local ministers S Reghupathy (law) and Siva V Meyyanathan (environment, youth welfare and sports development) shared the stage with Vijayabasakar. There had been many instances in the past when both of them were arrested for attempting to take part in government events in which Vijayabaskar was the chief guest. “It is indeed a good sign that DMK is not engaging in the customary revenge politics. We hope that such positive gestures will continue in future,” said an AIADMK functionary from Pudukottai. Back in Chennai on Friday, Ma Subramanian recalled how AIADMK leaders P Thangamani, S P Velumani, C Vijayabaskar and BJP leader Vanathi Srinivasan joined ministers during their visit. “We visited at least 28 districts. We visited villages and streets that were containment zone. Several opposition leaders joined us during these visits and inspections,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rare-bonhomie-among-dmk-aiadmk-at-events/articleshow/83651064.cms||Sampath Kumar

The civic standing committee recently approved a proposal for selling these residential flats to tenants. The opposition parties claimed that the decision has been taken to favour developers. “Once these properties are sold, their ownership will be transferred from the civic body to private persons. The developers will shift these tenants to other areas and use these properties for redevelopment. Rules should be made in such a way that the land ownership remains with the civic administration,” said Aba Bagul, leader of the Congress in PMC. Prashant Jagtap, the NCP city unit chief, opposed the move, saying it would cause financial loss to the civic body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/objection-to-municipal-flats-sale-to-tenants/articleshow/83651109.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Sachin Pilot is Congress's asset, Priyanka Gandhi in touch with him: Ajay Maken||JAIPUR: AICC general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan Ajay Maken told reporters in New Delhi on Friday that the Congress central leadership was in regular touch with former deputy chief Sachin Pilot. Maken described Pilot as Congress's asset and star campaigner. Maken said it was impossible that Pilot would seek an appointment with any of the top leaders and he won't get it. The AICC in-charge of the state was attempting to downplay reports that the Congress central leadership ignored Pilot during the latter’s five-day stay in Delhi amid his differences with chief minister Ashok Gehlot resurfacing. “Priyanka Gandhi is not even in Delhi for the past 10 days, so she could not have met Pilot, but is in communication with him. KC Venugopal and I have regularly spoken to him,” Maken said. On cabinet expansion and reshuffle, Maken said, “There are nine vacancies (in the council of ministers) in Rajasthan, besides several political appointments (in boards and corporations). Work is in progress on filling these. I am in touch with Gehlot, Pilot, CP Joshi, many cabinet ministers and leaders. We will appoint good people.” Will the expansion be soon? Maken replied, “We are in talks with all. You all know there was a political crisis in Rajasthan last year. Our efforts will be to include all sections, considering caste and regional equations as well as seniority and Congress future.” He had a word of caution for legislators issuing statements bringing out differences between Pilot and Gehlot. Maken said, “All MLAs should understand that Congress was born out of renouncement and sacrifice. Whenever cabinet expansion or political appointments are made, the Congress president will bear in mind who has been a disciplined soldier of the party. So, I request all not to raise issues in public but to speak to me or to the party state president.” Minutes after Maken’s statement, however, MLA Ved Prakash Solanki once again told media in Jaipur that the Gehlot-government was ignoring the SC/ST. Solanki repeated his charges that phones of some legislators were being tapped. Other states’ SC/ST women married in Rajasthan present at Solanki’s residence told reporters that they were unable to join jobs despite being selected because their caste certificates were not being issued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pilot-is-cong-asset-priyanka-in-touch-with-him-ajay-maken/articleshow/83651105.cms||---

---||Trichy||Convert underutilised Kallikudi market to transit hub: Exporters||Trichy: With the Rs 77-crore Kallikudi integrated vegetable and fruits market remaining underutilised for the past three years, international cargo operators have demanded that a section of the market be converted into an international cargo hub. They point out that despite the pandemic Trichy international airport has been supplying vegetables and fruits to a number of countries. The exporters sought space in the Kallikudi market and access to its cold storage facility so as to augment international export and import.Since May 2018, several attempts made by the district administration to utilise the market on the city’s outskirts didn’t bear fruit. Since it is situated on Trichy-Madurai NH and linked to Dindigul, Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Karur and Chennai NHs by semi-ring road, exporters at Trichy airport feel it will be ideal as a transit hub. Amid travel restrictions and limited air connectivity during the last many months, at least 12MT of vegetables and fruits were constantly shipped from the airport daily to the middle east and southeast Asian countries. “We can establish satellite offices for export development authorities such as APEDA and MPEDA in Kallikudi to avail of approvals and certifications mandatory for exports. Besides vegetables, even meat and marine commodities can be exported as a cold storage facility is available,” K Harimoorthy, consultant, international cargo, said.Farmers producers organisations in Trichy, Perambalur and Dindigul can tie up with the exporters to utilise the market for sending country vegetables and fruits to Kuwait, Malaysia and Singapore, the exporters said. The vast space in the market can also help in carrying out imports such as of lifesaving drugs. “The proposal to link farmers with exporters through the integrated market is promising and viable. We will move forward and consult both the parties to use the market,” an official with the agriculture business department said. As there is a demand for vegetables and fruits grown in Tamil Nadu in international markets comprising the Tamil diaspora, the utilisation of the market will encourage even farmers to export vegetables. “Since we are not getting bananas and lime from Tamil Nadu, we had to go for alternatives. Lakhs of Tamils in Kuwait will prefer homegrown vegetables if they are made available,” Khaleel Ahmed Baaqavee, general secretary, Kuwait Tamil Islamic committee, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/convert-underutilised-kallikudi-market-to-transit-hub-exporters/articleshow/83651108.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Ahmedabad||Most people still reluctant to visit restaurants, malls: Survey||Ahmedabad: The sinister second wave of Covid-19 infections has left many apprehensive of stepping out to have a meal at their favourite restaurants or even visit the mall for some retail therapy. A survey conducted by an online community, Local Circles, reveals that 49% people in Gujarat are apprehensive of going to restaurants after the second wave. However, the study also revealed that 33% people are willing to go to restaurants at least once, whereas 34% people in Gujarat are willing to go to malls as well. Citing other studies, the survey predicts, “With more people willing to step out, the third wave may be here sooner as Covid spreads easily in an indoor restaurant with people dining due to indoor air and no outside air ventilation. Air-conditioned restaurants in most parts of India do not have the infrastructure currently to recirculate indoor air several times an hour making them vulnerable spaces for Covid spread.” In fact, even pan-India survey results reveal similar findings with 31% people planning to visit a restaurant for a meal in the next 60 days and 29% planning a mall visit. Citing an advisory by the department of science and technology, government of India, the survey states, “SARS-COV2 virus is airborne and aerosols can travel up to 30 feet. In addition, it also highlighted surface transmission as a way of spread. The higher risk of unventilated spaces was also highlighted along with the need for air ventilation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/most-people-still-reluctant-to-visit-restaurants-malls-survey/articleshow/83651175.cms||---

TNAU said it could have been hung on the wall by an oversight.Saffron robe on Thiruvalluvar became a political issue in Tamil Nadu two years ago, inviting criticism from pro-Tamil groups and DMK that said Hindutva groups were trying to distort the image of the icon.Thiruvalluvar was always portrayed in white in Tamil Nadu. Back then, Thiruvalluvar image on a school textbook was found in saffron robe. BJP and Hindutva groups, however denied that there was any concerted attempt to saffronise Thiruvalluvar and that there were images of the saint–poet in saffron in some of the older paintings.Politicians from dravidian outfits raised objections and state agriculture minister M R K Panneerselvam tweeted the image, demanding immediate removal. Panneerselvam also spoke to university authorities and was told that the portrait was placed when the library was renovated four years ago.TNAU authorities hurriedly replaced it with the one approved by the state government. “When the painting was done, it was not saffron but of a darker hue. Over the years, the colour faded and it looked like saffron,” said a university representative. “Immediately after the instructions of the minister, we removed it,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/portrait-of-saffron-robed-thiruvalluvar-replaced-at-agricultural-university/articleshow/83651119.cms||---

They also conducted protests across the district.IMA had instructed members not to discontinue their service, honorary state secretary A K Ravikumar said. “Doctors continued their service and patients were not inconvenienced because of the protest. We want the Union government to enact the central hospital and health care professional protection Act,” he said.“Tamil Nadu is one of the few states that already has such an act – Tamil Nadu Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property) Act, 2008 – to check violence against health professionals and damage to health infrastructure. Even though the Act is helpful, it should be made stringent. We have also urged the police department to create awareness about the Act among the personnel,” Ravikumar said. “Presently, there is no stipulated time or designated official to file chargesheet. As a result, even though the accused is arrested, over a period of time, the case gets diluted. To prevent dilution and to ensure safety of doctors, a central Act is necessary.” The members urged the government to declare hospitals as protected zones and prohibit public gatherings there. Security in hospitals should be augmented and standardized, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/doctors-slam-attack-on-health-workers/articleshow/83651140.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Following this, we will start the construction of our depot,” state transport minister Anil Parab said on Friday, while on a visit to Pune. Maha Metro, which is constructing an underground Metro station at Shivajinagar, is planning on constructing a multi-modal transport hub — including an MSRTC bus depot at the spot. MahaMetro had taken land from the MSTRC for this venture. The MahaMetro was to build the whole structure, including the station, and hand it over to the MSRTC. The MSRTC depot at Shivajinagar was earlier shifted to Wakdewadi, around 1.5km from Shivajinagar. However, early this year, the MSRTC withdrew from the project. “It has been decided that the MahaMetro will pay the MSRTC for a plot admeasuring 4,000sqm, on which only the Metro station will be built. The remaining land (belonging to the MSRTC) will be handed back to the MSRTC. The MSRTC will then start construction of a bus depot on the plot. Once the new depot is ready, the Wakdewadi depot will be shut down,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shivajinagar-to-get-msrtc-depot-by-end-of-next-year/articleshow/83651142.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Anaemia not linked to only iron deficiency, many factors behind spread, says NIN director||HYDERABAD: Anaemia can no longer be attributed to only iron deficiency as there are many factors behind its spread in Hyderabad and elsewhere in the country, said a top health expert. “We lack a balanced dietary regimen such as Iron-rich fruits and micronutrient supplements, which are very useful. Vitamin C in the fruits retains iron. The government policy of Testing & treating is very helpful but not only iron supplements. Anaemia level should not be based on Body Mass Index (BMI),” said Dr R Hemalatha, director, National Institute of Nutrition, ICMR. NIN is now collaborating with the Telangana government on the anaemia eradication programme. “Besides iron supplementation, we have added micronutrients, Vitamin C and other nutrients such as Vitamin B-1, 6, 12. This has been supplied to 10 lakh children in the state and the incidence of anaemia has decreased,” said Dr Hemalatha at HEAL-Thy Samvaad national conference on ‘‘Strengthening Anaemia Detection and Diagnosis’ organised by HEAL Health, a national health awareness group. With 51% of anaemic women, India tops the list of nations with the most anaemic women and children. To tackle anaemia, the government started Anaemia Mukt Bharat in 2018, which aims to foster fresh strategies to eradicate anaemia. “What is interesting to note that in rural areas iron deficiency is low but the rate of anaemia is high and in urban areas, iron deficiency is high and anaemia is low,” added Dr Hemlatha. During the e-summit, experts highlighted how all stakeholders need to come together to fight against anaemia in the country. “Keeping in view the dire need to discuss the issue of detection and diagnosis of anaemia to rejuvenate the expedition, we organised this summit. The role of technology and accurate point of care diagnosis and data can be pivotal in achieving targets,” added Dr Swadeep Srivastava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/anaemia-not-linked-to-only-iron-deficiency-many-factors-behind-spread-nin-director/articleshow/83651214.cms||---

Santosh Kadam of regional disaster management cell (Thane) said they were alerted around 5am by residents, who heard a loud sound after part of the first floor slab collapsed at Shivbhavan building. The five-storey building, in D’Souzawadi, was vacated last year after it was classified in C1 category by an expert panel. “Buildings here are close to each other, without mandatory open spaces, which makes it more risky during such incidents,” said a rescue official. Majority of the families shifted to a nearby school said they were wary of going back to their homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-170-thane-families-evacuated-after-part-of-old-vacant-bldg-crashes/articleshow/83653456.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Pune||From today, free Maharashtra jabs for 30-44 age group||MUMBAI: The state will start vaccinating people between the ages of 30-44 from Saturday over a month after free immunisation for the younger groups were put on hold. In Mumbai, vaccination for this age group will take place at 10 centres through online appointments, the BMC said. Till now, those between 18-44 years could only get vaccinated at the private vaccination centres after the government suspended immunisation for them on May 12 to prioritise those due for their second dose and for people above 45 years. Dr Archana Patil, director of state health services, confirmed the state has about 15 lakh doses to sustain the drive. The state has been vaccinating an average of 2.9 lakh people in the past one week. In Mumbai, vaccination for the 18-44 category crossed the one million mark on Friday—a milestone since the drive opened for them on May 1. Mumbai has nearly 59 lakh people in the age bracket of 18-44 years, of whom around 31 lakh are aged between 30-44 years. Of the 10.1 lakh doses administered in the 18-44 category, though, more than 9.1 lakh has been in the private sector. The vaccine inequity became pronounced in June when most vaccinations happened in private centres with the cost of a dose ranging from Rs 780 to Rs 1,400. Age groups under 30 years can continue to get vaccinated at private centres. In Mumbai, vaccination for those between 30-44 years will take place at Priyadarshani Park (Walkeshwar), BMC Murli Deora Eye Hospital (Kamathipura), Acworth Leprosy (Wadala), Seth Ayurvedic (Sion), Bandra Bhabha (Bandra), M W Desai (Malad), Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule (Borivli), Jolly Gymkhana (Ghatkopar), Deonar Maternity Home (Govandi) and V D Savarkar (Mulund). Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer said vaccination will be only through online appointments on Saturday. On Friday, 61,710 people got vaccinated, taking the count of Mumbaikars vaccinated with one dose to almost 43.9 lakh. Health minister Rajesh Tope said vaccination of citizens above 45 years of age will continue as well. The public health department had submitted a proposal in May asking for sequential vaccination for 18-44 so that those at higher risk of severe Covid and death could get fully vaccinated first. Dr Patil said changes will be made in the Co-Win app so that the default minimum age is changed to 30 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/from-today-free-maha-jabs-for-30-44-age-grp/articleshow/83660904.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Hyderabad||Violence against women down in Telangana: NFHS survey||HYDERABAD: Violence against women have come down considerably compared to what it was five years ago, the latest National Family Health Survey NFHS—5) data has found. The per cent of the married women, (aged 18- 49) experiencing any spousal violence during pregnancy has come down by 1. 9 per cent as compared to NHFS-4 done in 2014-2015. Gender violence stands at 4 per cent compared to 5.9 per cent during the previous survey report. The incidence of sexual violence has also come down by 0.5 per cent. The per cent of women aged 18-29 who experienced sexual violence by age 18 is 0.8 per cent this time around as against 1. 3 per cent during the previous report. The per cent of married women aged 18- 49, who never experienced violence at the hands of their spouse, was down to 36.9 per cent from a high of 42.9 per cent, indicating more domestic violence. However, chairperson of Telangana state women’s commission Vakiti Sunitha Laxma Reddy said that the increase in numbers may not depict the true picture. “Earlier, women used to never complain or be open about violence against them. Now we have provided many forums like Sakhi centres, several call centres and She Teams. All these are giving them confidence to come out in open. In fact, this leads to more safety for women in their homes,” she said. A recent NITI Aayog report mentioned that Telangana’s journey towards gender equality is yet to pick pace. There is also some good news for women as per the survey report. The survey found that women are being given more importance in families. As against 81 per cent of married women participating in three household decisions during the last report, the percentage has gone up by 6.1 per cent to 87. 1 per cent. Activist A Suneetha said that one of the main reasons for increasing domestic violence is also the drastic fall in women participating in new employment opportunities. “For the past few years, most of the employment has happened in service sectors like delivery and transport, where women cannot participate, and that kind of disrupts the balance in the family,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/violence-against-women-down-in-t-nfhs-survey/articleshow/83651232.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Delhi||Court denies bail to riot accused on grounds of parity||New Delhi: A court has denied bail to a man accused in a northeast Delhi riot case, noting that earlier too his plea was rejected on the ground that “an automatic pistol with two live cartridges” had been seized from his possession that was used during the violence. “I am also not inclined to admit the applicant on bail at this stage as the prima facie role assigned to him appears to be totally different/distinct from the rest of the accused persons, who have already been granted bail in the matter,” additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said. The counsel appearing for Mohd Ansar contended that he was entitled to bail on the ground of parity with the co-accused and the role assigned to him in the matter was on a much better footing as compared to another. The special prosecutor, however, pointed out that his plea was dismissed by the court on March 4, 2021 and, at that time, too, the court didn’t find any merit in the claim of parity raised by his counsel. The court had earlier noted that the applicant had been “clearly seen/captured in the CCTV footage firing towards Shiv Vihar Tiraha on the crowd of opposite side”. It had stated, “It is also a matter of record that an automatic pistol with two live cartridges have been recovered from the possession of applicant and the said pistol was used by the applicant during riots. Furthermore, the applicant has been categorically identified by witness Roop Singh (guard of DRP School).” In the recent order, the court said, “This court did not find any substance in the claim of parity raised by the learned counsel for the applicant during the course of hearing arguments on the last bail application of the applicant. The same position stands today also.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-denies-bail-to-riot-accused-on-grounds-of-parity/articleshow/83653487.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Slow progress in Najafgarh Jheel restoration irks NGT||New Delhi: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday directed the chief secretaries of both Delhi and Haryana governments to take remedial measures for restoration of Najafgarh Jheel and asked them to appear before the tribunal on the next date of hearing. NGT expressed displeasure over the Haryana government not filing its environment management plan (EMP), despite orders to do so. “We have considered the matter and find that the issue of restoration of the waterbody in question is significant for the environment, but has not received the attention it requires from the authorities,” said a bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel. Haryana has “neither prepared an environment management plan nor given any explanation for not doing so. None appears for the state of Haryana”, the bench said. Delhi government has prepared the draft EMP, but its execution has to be ensured after completing the EMP, it added. The tribunal has further asked both chief secretaries to take a report from the police concerned on whether any action has been taken against the violators under Section 277 IPC (fouling water of public spring or reservoir), a cognizable offence, the tribunal said. NGT will hear the matter next on October 4. The green body had earlier directed both Haryana and Delhi to prepare an EMP, which will list steps and actions to protect the lake, including ensuring prevention of encroachments around it. The order came on a plea by NGO Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) seeking execution of NGT’s 2017 order to expeditiously decide the issue. The counsel for the applicant, Akash Vashishtha, submitted that Najafgarh Jheel was a natural hazard zone falling in the seismic zone-IV and is also in the highest zone of soil liquefaction. “The two factors, if combined, would be catastrophic to people’s lives and property. Despite that, the Haryana government and its agencies were allowing highrise constructions around Najafgarh Jheel,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/slow-progress-in-najafgarh-jheel-restoration-irks-ngt/articleshow/83653447.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

We must work to fulfill their dreams of Model Goa.” With a view to understanding the views and aspirations of the younger generation about Goa’s future, the party had organised an essay competition with topics related to past, present and future of Goa to commemorate 75 years of Goa Revolution Day. The winners were awarded prizes at the function. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat urged people to stay behind the Congress party ‘for protecting Goa’s identity’. “Time has come for Goa to start a new revolution to send home the insensitive, irresponsible and failed BJP government,” Kamat ssaid. Former Union minister Eduardo Faleiro appealed to people to live up to the aspirations of the freedom fighters. AICC observer for Goa Prakash Rathod, GPCC president Girish Chodankar, former minister Alexio Sequiera were also present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-seek-ideas-on-governance-from-youth/articleshow/83653567.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Low-cost walls inside Shahdara Drain to aid in Yamuna clean-up||NEW DELHI: Low-cost weirs are being constructed inside Shahdara Drain to reduce pollution in the Yamuna, water minister Satyendar Jain said while visiting the Shahdara Drain and Kalyanpuri sewage pumping station projects on Friday. “I visited the outfall of Shahdara Drain and reviewed the progress of a low-cost weir being constructed inside the drain. Ponds will be created to augment groundwater recharge using 70 million gallons per day (MGD) treated water from the Kondli sewage treatment plant (STP) and only clean water will be allowed to flow into the Yamuna,” said Jain, who is also the chairman of Delhi Jal Board. Both projects, being undertaken by Delhi government, will be the key in reducing dumping of untreated sewage into the Yamuna. Treated water from the Kondli plant will be utilised to develop a 4km-long groundwater recharge zone inside the drain, said Jain. He also instructed officials to lay pipelines to carry treated effluent from the Kondli STP to rejuvenate Sanjay Lake and Smriti Van Lake. “Visited 35MGD Kalyanpuri SPS at Shahdara Drain. It’s now ready to divert complete waste water from Shahdara Drain into Kondli STP,” Jain tweeted after the visit. The treated water from the Kondli STP will be used to rejuvenate lakes and waterbodies, the minister added. According to estimates of DJB, the present water supply in the capital is 935MGD, equivalent to 4,086 million liters per day (MLD). It is estimated that 80% of this becomes waste water, with the city as a whole generating 720MGD or 3,268MLD of waste water. Untreated sewage and industrial effluent discharge carried by Delhi’s drainage system ends up in the river causing pollution. Between Okhla and Badarpur, the Yamuna receives waste water from four drains — Abu Fazal, Jaitpur, Tuglaqabad and Shahdara. Shahdara Drain, flowing across the eastern part of Delhi, meets the river downstream of the Okhla barrage on the right bank. DJB has planned several projects to reduce the pollution load from three main drains that carry untreated sewage into the Yamuna — Najafgarh, Shahdara and supplementary drains. In the run-up to the 2020 assembly elections, Aam Aadmi Party has promised to clean the Yamuna. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had promised that if re-elected in the elections, his government would make the Yamuna river so clean that residents of the national capital would be able to take a dip in it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/low-cost-walls-inside-shahdara-drain-to-aid-in-yamuna-clean-up/articleshow/83653582.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Vax drive for hawkers proceeding at a snail’s pace||HYDERABAD: The Covid-19 vaccination drive for hawkers in the city is proceeding at a snail’s pace. These hawkers generally sell mobile accessories, leather goods, apparel, footwear, cutlery and crockery, and other inexpensive goods, and have a hand-to-mouth existence. Improper planning in issuing of tokens/coupons to the hawkers, lack of awareness on Covid vaccine, as most hawkers are hesitant in taking vaccine, and hawkers not having Aadhaar cards, are some of the reasons for the drive not picking up pace. The National Hawkers Federation (NHF), Hyderabad president, Dugyala Venu criticised the vaccine drive. “Out of one lakh hawkers — including street vendors, people selling products on pushcarts and those plying their trade in front of commercial units — only 25,000 hawkers have been vaccinated. Initially, when the vaccine drive began, the GHMC showed interest and issued tokens to the hawkers, later on, they withdrew without reason,” Dugyala Venu, president, NHF, Hyderabad told TOI. Officials have to organise special vaccine camps either at state-owned urban health centres on the lines of drives for super spreaders, or in areas where hawkers are conducting business. According to the feedback received from the various affiliated workers unions in the city, vaccination figure stands at only 30% so far, said Venu. “We have approached the GHMC officials several times, and urged them to organise vaccine drives in a planned manner by issuing tokens to those having ID cards, which were issued by GHMC during surveys being done on street vendors about four years ago,” Venu said. The drive must also extend to the hawkers who don’t have ID cards, he said. The NHF representative said: “Apart from neighbouring districts, hawkers have also migrated from Rajasthan, Odisha, Jharkhand, and Bihar. Over 70% hawkers used to do business at Sultan Bazar, Koti, Abids, Charminar, and Secunderabad. As the city grew rapidly, they started hawking at Dilsukhnagar, LB Nagar, Goshamahal, Falaknuma, Mehdipatnam, Ameerpet, Kukatpally, KPHB and areas of Cyberabad.” The NHF president also admitted that hawkers belonging to the 18 years+ age group are not coming forward due to misinformation about vaccines. The civic body and the medical and health department have to conduct counselling about the merits of Covid vaccine to these young hawkers and ensure they are vaccinated. However, GHMC officials denied allegations made by the NHF wing about vaccine drive. GHMC deputy commissioner of Mehdipatnam Circle, MK Ali, said: “Our staff is going to areas where hawkers are doing business and assisting to upload details such as name, mobile number and Aadhaar card details in GHMC mobile app to administer the vaccine.” Another deputy commissioner, Kapra circle (LB Nagar Zone), N Shankar said that over 60% hawkers have been covered in his limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vax-drive-for-hawkers-proceeding-at-a-snails-pace/articleshow/83651319.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Mumbai||Private hospitals in Mumbai seek 20 lakh doses. Maharashtra govt to hand over list to Centre||MUMBAI: The city’s private hospitals have submitted a demand for nearly 20 lakh doses of Covid vaccine to Brihanmumbai municipal corporation (BMC). The civic body will be handing over the list to the state that is supposed to aggregate demand from hospitals across Maharashtra before turning it over to the Centre. Officials said the list is a preliminary one to gauge requirement in the private sector for the coming month. “More details about procurement will evolve along the way, so it’s more like a preparation. For now, it’s a wish list which we will be sharing with the state,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. Under the new vaccine procurement policy effective from June 21, the central government will purchase 75% of Covid doses manufactured in the country. The private sector will purchase the remaining 25% stock under Centre’s supervision so that doses are not cornered by wealthier hospital chains. Sources said hospitals have asked for doses in 5,000-1.75lakh range. Some mid-level hospitals have asked for up to 1lakh doses while a few major ones have put a conservative demand of 10,000-30,000. Wockhardt, Nanavati, Surana Group, Wellspring Healthcare, Oscar Hospital have sought 1lakh-2 lakh doses. Bombay Hospital, Saifee, Kohinoor, Sushrut, Prince Aly Khan, Masina have requested 10,000- 75,000 doses. Demand is more for Covishield, roughly 16-17lakh doses. Nearly 50 of the 88 private registered centres have submitted their requirements till now. The head of a private hospital said many are simply testing the waters and may have given inflated numbers. “We don’t think we will get the full quota that we have asked for, so everyone has put extra figures,” he said. A CEO of another hospital said inquiries for corporate camps and tie-ups have dropped in the past one week. “Once vaccination gains momentum in the public again, we don’t know if there will be much demand for private doses,” he said, adding his hospital has sought less than 25,000 doses. A Saifee Hospital official said they have submitted demand based on vaccination average for the past 26 days. adding that they anticipate renewed demand in August when those from 18-44 become eligible for second doses. There is also a dilemma among mid-level hospitals about how much to invest in vaccines. Dr Sunil Agarwal of Malad-based Sanjeevani Hospital said, “My worry is most who can afford have taken the vaccine already, hence demand will shift to free vaccination again,” he said, adding he has sought 50,000 doses. Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, said preliminary demand stands at 20lakh doses but it could increase as more hospitals add to the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pvt-hosps-in-city-seek-20-lakh-doses-state-govt-to-hand-over-list-to-centre/articleshow/83651350.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NIA court notice to hostile witness for ‘false deposition’||MUMBAI: In a detailed 229-page judgment copy convicting three men and sentencing them to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment for plotting terror attacks on leaders, politicians and journalists across the country at the behest of terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a special NIA court issued a notice to one of the hostile witnesses for allegedly deposing falsely. The prosecution had charged the witness, who was to depose on a conspiracy meeting between the accused, of perjury. The witness had not supported the prosecution’s case. “Issue notice to prosecution witness (PW)-53 calling upon him to show cause as to why he should not be punished for the offence of giving false evidence... He shall remain present before this court on July 22 at 11am, failing which it will be presumed that he does not want to show such cause,” special NIA judge DE Kothalikar said. Perjury is the wilful giving of false testimony under oath and in India attracts up to seven years’ imprisonment. On Tuesday, the court found Mohammed Muzammil Gani (37), Mohammed Akram (30) and Mohammed Sadiq (35) guilty under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act relating to criminal conspiracy and being members and committing offences as part of a terror organisation. Additionally, Gani was convicted under the Arms Act. Two others, Mohammed Irfan Gaus (33) and Mohammed Ilyas Akbar (36), were acquitted. In September 2012, ATS had arrested the accused in connection with an arms haul in Nanded and recovered two revolvers and 14 rounds of ammunition. The NIA took over the investigations in 2013. Seventy-three witnesses deposed during the trial with a few turning hostile. The court’s notice has been issued to a man who knew key accused Akram from Nanded. The prosecution had submitted that when his statement was recorded by the investigators and the magistrate, the witness had claimed that he heard Akram asking other accused to exact revenge against the persons who carried out blasts at Purna, Parbhani and Jalna. During trial, the witness denied saying this. He also denied saying that Akram used to tell him that he wanted to do some extraordinary work in Hyderabad and Nanded and that he will get the help from LeT. The court said that it was not revealed that his statement was recorded either under pressure or after receiving threats. “I reach to the conclusion that on the part of PW-53 there has been a deliberate and conscious effort to misguide the court and interfere in the administration of justice...” the court said. It was also pointed out that in the past, Akram had extended financial help to the witness. “The material available on record establishes that PW-53 was under the thumb of Akram and therefore, he has turned hostile. It is worthy to be noted that the charges levelled against the accused are serious in nature,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nia-court-notice-to-hostile-witness-for-false-deposition/articleshow/83653594.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kolkata||Roads submerged, commuters left high and dry||Kolkata: The transport woes for employees of private sector firms increased on Friday with a large number of contract carriages, which were ferrying them in the absence of public transport, refusing to hit the road due to waterlogged streets. Most commuters fell victims of fly-by-night operators and taxis that fleeced them. Even bike taxi fares were as high as Rs 400 for a ride from Tollygunge to Sector V. App taxis were scarce, while metered cabs demanded three to four times the fare. “We earn a meagre sum at the end of the month. My company will be the last one to organise transport for us. I simply walked to my workplace at Garia for the last three days. But today I spent a fortune to take a bike taxi. I hope Didi will throw open buses to alleviate our pain,” said Bikash Kar, a resident of Karunamoyee, Tollygunge. “25% employees in private sector is not a small number. In absence of public transport, the long-starved vehicular fleet will try to fleece. The government must think seriously to run a skeletal service at least during the peak hours,” said Atanu Ghosh, a transport economist. “After such a long gap, we found our vehicles in a very poor condition. Because of the restrictions, we could not carry out the regular maintenance. Thus we felt that the vehicles may break down if they have to wade through waterlogged roads. We informed the customers well in advance,” said Dilip Mitra, a contract carriage operator at Purba Putiary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/roads-submerged-commuters-left-high-and-dry/articleshow/83649224.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Amonkar, a vice president of the state party unit, said that he remains loyal to the party and will do all he can to ensure that Congress forms the government in 2022. Amonkar said that the aim of his “emotional outburst” was to express the “emotions and feelings” of the young Congress workers. “I have been a committed worker of the party since my student days and I will never take any decision which will dent the image of the Congress or bring in indiscipline. It was my emotional outburst,” Amonkar said and blamed “a section of the media” for misquoting him. On Thursday Amonkar said that if Chodankar was dropped from the helm of affairs and if the Congress central leadership did not listen to his views, the young party workers would “decide whether to stay in the party or to leave the party”. According to sources, Congress Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao was upset with Amonkar’s public ultimatum. Rao is on a four-day visit to Goa to help the party prepare for the 2022 assembly polls. Congress insiders said that Amonkar has been asked to issue a clarification regarding his statement. Amonkar said that he has already met Rao to explain the intent behind the “statement” and has also assured Rao that he will continue to work for the party. Amonkar, who is eyeing the Mormugao assembly seat, said that he hoped that the Congress high command takes all the necessary steps to ensure that the party wins the next elections. “I have also promised him (Rao) that I will do my best to ensure that Congress wins the trust of the people and continue with my work to expose the misdeeds of the BJP government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/amonkar-changes-track-says-it-was-emotional-outburst/articleshow/83653641.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Showing unusual openness to admonish the judicial system for causing the tragedy by going strictly according to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act without considering the avoidable situation the toddler was subjected to, a bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian said, "Generally, a child is orphaned by natural events (when both parents die). But in this case, the girl was orphaned by order of the court." It allowed the adoptive parents, Kripal Amrik Singh and his wife Balwinder Kaur, to take the child from the Mumbai childcare home by entrusting them interim custody, an order that was supported by the girl's biological mother, who had given two versions of her pregnancy - because of rape by her employer and relationship with a friend. The girl was born on January 8, 2019. Eight days later, an NGO 'Childline' informed the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) under Maharashtra government that the mother was not taking care of the child. The NGO also informed that the biological mother was willing to give up the child for adoption or keep her in some ashram. The NGO apprehended that there was a possibility of the mother selling the girl child. The CWC directed the mother to appear before it with the child once every month. But on January 22, 2019, the mother gave up her child for adoption through a notarised adoption deed in favour of Kripal Amrik Singh and his wife, who took the child to Punjab. When the NGO learnt that the child was given away for Rs 40,000 to Singh, it informed the CWC and an FIR was registered against Singh and the biological mother on June 18, 2019. The CWC directed the girl child to be handed over to Vatsalya Trust, a special adoptive agency. For the last one-and-a-half years, the Singhs have moved the CWC and the Bombay High Court repeatedly seeking custody of the child. But the HC remained firm that under the circumstances, the CWC did the right thing. The Singhs appealed against the final order of the HC in the SC. Appearing for the adoptive parents, senior advocate Raja Thakare told the bench of Justices Gupta and Ramasubramanian that it was very difficult for the childless couple to stay without their adopted daughter and that it would have been even more traumatic for the girl to stay in the childcare centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/judicially-orphaned-at-5-months-2-year-old-finally-gets-a-home/articleshow/83655824.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Mumbai||KDMC has been upgraded from level 3 to level 2||MUMBAI: The Level 3 restrictions “which have been in force as per orders issued last week will continue in Mumbai till further orders,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health) on Friday. BMC chief Iqbal Chahal had last week said Mumbai will remain under Level 3 restrictions till Covid cases come down to around 100-200 per day. Thane district, which is also eligible for a Level 1 unlock, will continue to be on Level 3. Thane collector Rajesh Narvekar said the high positivity rate and low testing rates in select areas, including rural stretches during the last one week, has impacted the overall grading. Meanwhile, in MMR, Thane city and Navi Mumbai will continue at Level 2, while Kalyan Dombivli goes to level 2 from Level 3 and due to increase in positivity rate, and Palghar district, including Vasai-Virar corporation, has also gone from Level 2 to Level 3 just in one week. Even Mira Bhayandar corporation, which was at Level 2 last week, has been downgraded to Level 3 in line with the other corporations in Thane district. These changes will come into effect from Monday, June 21. Raigad district, including Panvel civic corporation, will continue at Level 4. Pune city will continue to be in Level 2, while Nashik city is likely to be upgraded to Level 2, and Aurangabad city and district will open up from Monday. In Palghar district, including Vasai-Virar, positivity rate crossed 5.18% and oxygenated bed capacity was 18.24%, said district collector Dr Manek Gursal. Officials said 282 deaths were reported in the district between June 6 and 17. Of these, 146 were in Palghar taluka. District officials said overcrowding was found in several public places. People were not adhering to protocols, including wearing masks. Despite coming under the Level 1 category, KDMC has placed itself in Level 2 and has issued a notification allowing shops and malls to open from Monday, while cinema halls and wedding halls can operate with 50% capacity. Mira Bhayander municipal corporation, which was upgraded to Level 2 last week, returns to Level 3. “We have a positivity rate of 1.5% and bed occupancy is 8%. But with neighbouring areas being or going for Level 3, we have decided to follow suit as a precaution,” said Dilip Dhole, MBMC commissioner. At the state level, the weekly positivity rate has dropped to 5.24% and oxygen bed occupancy is 13.5% Also, the total bed occupancy in absolute numbers now is 16,570, down from 20,167 last week. Currently, only three districts--Raigad, Ratnagiri and Kolhapur--have a positivity rate of over 10%, but that too is on the decline. Kolhapur has the highest positivity rate of 13.7%.

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Crucial meet on HSC marks tabulation policy today||NAGPUR: A crucial online meet regarding HSC marks tabulation policy is scheduled for Saturday noon, during which school education minister will interact with academics. With CBSE making its Std XII marks policy public, it was expected that state government will push forward with its own pending policy. A senior academic, who has been invited for the Saturday webinar, said the department seems to be in the final stages of finalizing policy on HSC. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the academic said, “I have received the link for Saturday’s meet and I believe we will be going ahead with a plan similar to that of CBSE.” He said the government must follow the CBSE formula so that there is no confusion. “CBSE said it shall include marks scored in X, XI and the internal assessments in XII. Now the Std X part is the most crucial one if we are to have a very fair and balanced results,” said the academic. “In tomorrow’s meeting, I will be pitching for SSC marks to be included because that was the only transparent evaluation done for this batch,” he said. Considering that the current XII batch did not have any break in-between, they would have appeared for their SSC in summer of 2019. “They could have appeared even earlier and then taken a break which means that their evaluation was done during non-Covid times and as per the set pattern which has been followed for years,” said the academic. “I discussed this with some of my counterparts who will be joining the meeting tomorrow, and everyone agreed that it is indeed important for SSC marks to be included,” said the academic. Some students, however, felt it was “unfair” to include SSC marks now. TOI tried to speak with a few such students, who are currently enrolled with various coaching institutes, but they declined to be identified. One such student said, “Why should my performance of 2019 have bearing on my score this year? I may not have done well back then, so it should not be a benchmark for HSC.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/crucial-meet-on-hsc-marks-tabulation-policy-today/articleshow/83651436.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The construction work has not been hampered due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the press release stated, adding that the first phase of the project is expected to be completed by August 2022. The international airport, spread over 1,025 hectares, is being built on the Rajkot-Ahmedabad highway. The foundation stone for the project was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2017. The construction cost of the first phase is estimated to be around Rs 670 crore, informed Loknath Padhe, general manager of the project. “The work of the first phase is expected to be completed by August 2022. The construction of the terminal building work will be taken in the second phase, which is expected to be completed by December 2022. We are planning to complete the entire project by March 2023,”Padhe said, adding that the total project cost is around Rs 1,400 crore. According to AAI officials, almost 46% work of the 3,040 meter-long runway, which is 45m wide, has been completed so far. The construction of the airport apron area, from where the passengers board the plane, is over. The construction of a parallel taxi track (PTT), which is connected to three links, is almost 90% over. PTT is the area from where the aircraft vacates the runway after landing. The construction work of a 27 kms long boundary wall, internal roads and watch tower are underway. The airport will also have a dedicated fire station. A work force of 1,300, including 250 engineers, is working round the clock at the project site, informed Rajkot prant officer Charansinh Gohil, who is coordinating with airport authority on behalf of the district administration. “This project will generate employment for the local people and this project will benefit the entire Saurashtra,” said Rajkot district collector Remya Mohan. The present airport is too small to cater the increasing demand of air connectivity of Rajkot, the commercial capital of Saurashtra. Rajkot is the hub of many manufacturing industries including engineering parts, auto parts, imitation jewellery and agro parts. The ceramic industry of Morbi and other industries of Jamnagar also depend on Rajkot for air connectivity. Currently, 4 lakh domestic travellers fly out from Rajkot airport every year. By 2023, this number is expected to reach six lakh travellers per year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/hirasar-international-airport-construction-work-to-end-by-2023/articleshow/83648814.cms||---

The farmers were included in the scheme on different dates since its launch in the state in 2018. Under the PM Kisan scheme, every year an income support of Rs 6,000 is provided to small and marginal farmers in three instalments. The state government identifies the farmers for the scheme and accordingly, money is transferred to their bank accounts. Around 55,000 farmers in the district have received financial assistance so far, out of which 451 have been found ineligible. Among the ineligible farmers are some retired government employees who have taken up farming. The administration has directed the authorities to recover Rs 32.04 lakh given to the 451 ineligible farmers in 1602 instalments. Bokaro additional collector Sahdat Anwar said, “We have directed all the circle officers to recover money from these farmers. We have also asked the state government under which head the recovered amount should be deposited.” The ineligible farmers’ data was provided by the district agriculture department. Of the eight blocks in the district, the highest 83 ineligible farmers belong to Chas block, while Bermo has five, the lowest. These apart, Kasmar block (74), Chandankyari (65), Chandrapura (36), Nawadih (45), Gomia (55), Jaridih (44) and Petarwar (44) make up the numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bokaro-admin-to-recover-rs-32-04l-in-pm-kisan-aid-from-451-ineligible-farmers/articleshow/83651701.cms||Divy Khare

Bhim Mahto (49), a resident of Chandrapura, is a teacher at the government middle school in Junori village under Paplo Panchayat of Chandrapur block. With the Covid-19 pandemic keeping children away from his school, Mahto was on the hunt for an innovative measure to keep the classes going. “I noticed that the Shiva Temple in the village has a loudspeaker and is located in the centre of the village and can be heard from every corner. So, I hung up tables containing English and Hindi alphabets at every nook and corner of the hamlet so that children can hear my voice and also see and write,” Mahto said. Giridhari Mahto, a local, said, “I cannot afford smartphones and internet. My children were suffering academically as they were not being able to attend classes. The schoolmaster, with his new idea, came to our rescue.” Mahto said he has been teaching in this way for several months now. “Students also sit outside the temple premises with their books and study,” he said. Mahto is not the only teacher in Jharkhand who is trying out of the box techniques to run offline classrooms amid the lockdown. In September last year, Sapan Kumar Patralekh, the headmaster of a government updated middle school in Dumarthar village of Jarmundi block of Dumka district shot to fame nationally after he turned the walls of the village’s mud huts into blackboards for the children to study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/teacher-uses-loudspeaker-to-teach-as-school-remains-shut/articleshow/83651902.cms||Divy Khare
---||Ranchi||‘Defunct’ Jharkhand state electricity regulatory commission waits for Jharkhand government to fill up vacancies||RANCHI: The Jharkhand State Electricity Regulatory Commission (JSERC) has been lying defunct for the past six months as the state government is yet to appoint its chairman and members. The JSERC is responsible for determining tariff for generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, regulating intra-state power transmission and power purchase, issuing licenses to companies seeking to generate, transmit and distribute power and promoting generation of electricity from renewable sources. Notably, chief minister Hemant Soren holds the power portfolio in the state cabinet. The JSERC has been without a chairman after Arbind Prasad resigned on June 12, 2020. Since then, the commission was functioning with only two of its members — Rabindra Narayan Singh and Pravas Kumar Singh. However, Rabindra Narayan retired on January 9 this year and Pravas retired on February 19, leaving the JSERC rudderless. A public notice put out by the JSERC on its website points out that since the posts of chairperson and members of the commission are vacant, hearing of all cases listed before the Commission stand ‘adjourned till further orders’. This is the second time that JSERC has been forced to lie idle for want of a requisite quorum. Earlier, JSERC went into hibernation from December 16, 2012 to January 10, 2014 after its then chairman, Mukhtiyar Singh, superannuated on December 15, 2012 leaving behind a lone member, T Munikrishnaiah, for more than a year. Meanwhile, companies engaged in generation, transmission and distribution of power in the state, which have already filed their power tariff proposals along with annual revenue requirements with JSERC, have been put on an endless wait for their annual power tariff to be revised. As per the JSERC Act, a quorum of two members is required to hear cases, determine power tariff and carry out normal functioning. Since all posts of chairman and members of JSERC are lying vacant, hearing of tariff petitions will not be possible till the state government makes the requisite appointments. In normal times, power tariffs are announced by JSERC in February or March with new tariffs made effective from April 1. This year, tariff announcements are set to be delayed indefinitely. “We have received tariff-related petitions from all the companies concerned. Further action on these petitions would resume, once vacancies are filled up,” Rajendra Prasad Nayak, the secretary-cum-law officer of JSERC, told TOI. “Once JSERC has the requisite quorum, determining power tariff and holding hearings of pending cases will be resumed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/defunct-jserc-waits-for-jharkhand-govt-to-fill-up-vacancies/articleshow/83651769.cms||Tapas Biswas
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: IMA protests ‘growing violence’ against doctors||RANCHI: Doctors in Ranchi and across Jharkhand responded to the nationwide call of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and sat on dharnas and wore black badges at work to protest the growing violence on medicos nationwide. Symbolic protests were held at the sadar hospital in Ranchi, Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) and the IMA’s state headquarters. Senior office bearers of Jharkhand IMA and veteran doctors took part in the protests. Jharkhand IMA, which has been demanding Medical Protection Act for years before successive state governments, claimed that the violence against doctors in Jharkhand is on the rise. “Since the last year, there has been various incidents of attacks on doctors in the primary health centres and community health centres in rural areas and in hospitals of Ranchi. Medical institutions must be declared as safe zones and the assailants must be tried in fast-track courts,” Dr Pradeep Kumar Singh, secretary of IMA Jharkhand, told TOI. IMA, however, claimed that medical services were not hindered in the hospitals as Jharkhand is currently in the middle of a pandemic. The IMA claimed that at least eight incidents have been reported across Jharkhand in recent months where doctors have been assaulted by the kin of Covid-19 patients. Such incidents have occurred in Godda, Deoghar, Dhanbad, Chas (Bokaro) and a private hospital in Ranchi and the CCL’s Central Hospital in Kanke. As many as 56 doctors in the state have succumbed to Covid-19 infection which they contracted while dispensing their duties. Of them, 33 died in the second wave of the infection which struck Jharkhand in April this year. So far, the family of only one of the deceased doctors has been compensated by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, the IMA said. Jharkhand government has not announced any ex-gratia payments to the doctors and frontline workers who died during the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ima-protests-growing-violence-against-doctors/articleshow/83651837.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||India||SC judge recuses from Bengal post-poll violence case||NEW DELHI: Supreme Court judge, Justice Indira Banerjee, on Friday recused herself from hearing a plea pertaining to alleged post-poll violence in West Bengal. At the outset when a petition filed by Biswajit Sarkar, brother of a deceased Bengal BJP worker, was called before a bench of Justices Banerjee and M R Shah, she said she could not hear the case, without specifying the reason. The court thereafter passed the order for listing of the case before an appropriate bench of “which Her Ladyship (Hon’ble Mrs. Justice Indira Banerjee) is not a member”. Sarker in his petition sought a CBI probe into murder of his brother Abhijit. He alleged that a TMC mob had entered Abhijit’s house, dragged him out and killed him in front of his mother, who was molested, and other family members. Second petitioner Swarnalata is the widow of another booth-level BJP worker Haran Adhikari. Her husband was allegedly attacked with bricks, sticks, spades and shovels at his home and killed in the presence of his 80-year-old father, who was also kicked, and minor son. The petitioners sought a CBI investigation into the cases and also provided the Supreme Court with a list of 16 other BJP workers who were allegedly killed during the “orchestrated” post-poll violence that gripped several parts of the state after TMC won the elections and formed the government for the third consecutive time in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-judge-recuses-from-bengal-post-poll-violence-case/articleshow/83655867.cms||---

---||India||53% of jabs during May-June were in rural India, says govt||NEW DELHI: Around 71% of Covid vaccination centres in the public sector are in rural areas which accounted for 53% of jabs given during the six-week period in May-June, the government said seeking to counter reports that rural and remote areas were being neglected in the vaccination drive. “Some of our tribal districts have demonstrated vaccine coverage higher than the national average. So this spread has come and will increase further. With the new guidelines, system will streamline and we are hopeful that the vaccination drive will pick up pace with participation from states, Centre and private sector,” Niti Aayog member V K Paul said. The Centre also highlighted the role of private sector in ramping up the vaccination drive as well as ensuring Covid-19 treatment facilities and services are available and accessible across the country. Emphasising that private sector participation is crucial to strengthening the vaccination drive, Paul said states have been asked to mobilise both small and big private health facilities and aggregate the demand for vaccines. This information will be shared with the Centre to ensure equitable supply of vaccines across the country, he said. “Greater participation by this sector will ensure that we are able to cover a large population quickly,” Paul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/53-of-jabs-during-may-june-were-in-rural-india-says-govt/articleshow/83655889.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Nagpur||Despite SC order, work on laying overhead power lines ‘continues’ in GIB habitats||Nagpur: Despite an order from the Supreme Court, work on laying of overhead power lines has reportedly continued in the habitats of Great Indian Bustard (GIB) in Rajasthan and Gujarat without complying with conditions laid down by the apex court. None of the existing power lines has been fitted with bird diverters. This amounts to contempt of court, say sources in the know. The Supreme Court on April 19, 2021, issued direction to lay underground power lines in GIB habitats. The GIB is a critically endangered bird with its last viable breeding population in India. About 100 of these magnificent grassland birds remain in the world. Though habitat loss and degradation have been responsible for this bird’s decline in the past few decades, their deaths due to collision with overhead power lines are today the biggest direct threat. GIB needs grasslands and semi-arid areas to survive. The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) and The Corbett Foundation (TCF) in a release said most of these areas are unfortunately categorized as ‘revenue wastelands’ in governmental records, and therefore given away for solar and wind energy projects in India. Large renewable energy projects across GIB habitats, mainly in Rajasthan and Gujarat, have put these already threatened species at the grave risk of extinction. BNHS and TCF have been working for GIB conservation for decades, including monitoring, habitat improvement, community engagement, and conservation planning with state forest departments and villagers. The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) estimates that 18 GIBs die each year due to collision with power lines. In light of this, conservation is the need of the hour for this critically endangered species. The SC direction in MK Ranjitsinh petition is significant as it gives specific binding directions that have to be mandatorily followed in GIB habitat. It makes it mandatory for all power lines lines in both the ‘potential’ and ‘priority’ habitat of the GIB to be laid underground in future. The SC has directed that lines be taken underground immediately, stressing that irrespective of the cost factor the priority shall be to save the near-extinct birds. Until the lines are made underground, bird-diverters are to be installed on all lines immediately. Only for those high voltage power lines where technical feasibility issues are found in laying them underground, the SC has constituted a three-member expert committee to examine the feasibility. The SC has also given specific directions to protect the nesting sites of the GIB. For the underground power lines, the court has given one year from the date of the order within which the work is supposed to be completed. It is important to note that renewable energy units already existing in the area have not been asked to move from sites or stop work in Rajasthan or Gujarat. “Despite the SC order, none of the existing power lines has been fitted with bird diverters. This disobedience amounts to contempt of court. New renewable energy parks have been planned in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and other states. We hope that the companies involved have taken appropriate measures in their planning stages to create infrastructure as mandated,” said Kedar Gore, director, The Corbett Foundation. Today, the GIB’s regular breeding sites are only in the Thar desert landscape (Rajasthan) and Kutch landscape. Despite having good habitat, the bird is locally extinct in Madhya Pradesh. A few birds are found in Pakistan, moving between the two countries. For this reason, India recently proposed a concerted action plan (CAP) for the GIB under the aegis of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). In order to fulfillits commitments towards the GIB, India has pioneered a conservation breeding programme in Rajasthan. This has been successfully implemented by the WII in collaboration with the Rajasthan forest department, and several chicks are currently being raised at this centre. “These chicks eventually have to be released in GIB habitat not only in Rajasthan but in all its former range. But for this to happen, it is essential that large swathes of safe and secured habitat are made available to GIB in the future,” says Dr Bivash Pandav, director, Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). Pandav said, “One of the most charismatic bird species of India, the GIB is undoubtedly standing at the doorstep of extinction. With a population of less than 100, the Thar desert is the one and only intensive critical care unit (ICCU) of GIB in the world. BNHS applauds the SC judgment and firmly believes in leaving no stone unturned in safeguarding the remaining bustard habitats.” GIB habitat areas are also important for endangered birds like the lesser florican and MacQueen’s bustard, which are smaller bustard species requiring grasslands to survive. Several other birds also die in collision with powerlines. The WII also estimates that over one lakh birds are killed annually in Thar due to electric lines. “TCF’s unpublished data reveals that nearly 30,000 birds of three different species die due to collision with power lines annually just in Abdasa taluka of Kutch district, Gujarat. The GIB habitat in Abdasa also provides refuge to about 25 other globally threatened birds. Several lesser-known but threatened species of mammals such as caracal, desert fox, desert cat, hedgehog, hyena, Indian wolf, etc,” said Gore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-sc-order-work-on-laying-overhead-power-lines-continues-in-gib-habitats/articleshow/83669497.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Visakhapatnam||33% area under Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority to be urbanised by 2041||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) draft master plan-2041 has proposed 1,627 square kilometre area or approximately 33% of the VMRDA area for urban development. The population is projected to increase to 6.72 million by 2041. The state government has recently brought 13 more mandals in Visakhapatnam district and Merakamudidam Mandal in Vizianagaram into VMRDA limits, increasing the extent to 7,328 square kilometres. However, the master plan is yet to be prepared for the recently merged mandals, spanning about 2,455 square kilometres. The existing land use in the core urban areas will undergo urban regeneration and transformation, whereas the peripheral areas of growth are delineated based on demand and future projections for the horizon year 2041. The total developed area as of 2019 in the VMRDA is 963 sq. km, which is around 15% of the total area of the VMR. Considering the environmentally sensitive areas, optimum population density, protection of agricultural land, physiological features, transit corridors and growth trends, the new growth areas have been judiciously delineated, which may add a new growth area of 980 sq.km to the existing development. So that the total proposed developed areas in VMR would become approximately 33% of total area of the VMR. Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram are proposed as the major growth centres where adequate land has been allocated for the urban activities as per the projected population and employment. The master plan envisages locating the majority of large industries south of dolphin hills in the existing industrial zone. The cleaner and resource-based white industries can be distributed in other parts of the region. As a whole, 177 square kilometres industrial areas are proposed to be developed in the plan. In principle, white industries are proposed in Vizianagaram. The smaller pockets proposed under industrial use at Kothavalasa and Yelamachili will house MSME industries to create employment at the local level. Kothavalasa falls in the expansion zone of Visakhapatnam, owing to its proximity to Vizag and sources. Only the cleaner MSME industries will be located in these industrial nodes. An industrial pocket of 10 square kilometre is proposed in the north of Kothavalasa town. As per the master plan, mixed use is more advantageous as the area can be developed for multiple compatible purposes with economic importance. The master plan envisages approximately 77 sq. km of mixed-use development, which is approximately 1.2% area of the VMR and approximately 4% of the developed areas in VMR. In Vizianagaram, an inner ring road is proposed in the master plan. The inner ring will help decongest the core and improve access in current perimeter of the city core.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/33-area-under-vmrda-to-be-urbanised-by-2041/articleshow/83645487.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

It was only in the last week, four members from the nominated quota, including council chairman, M A Shariff, retired. With these retirements, the ruling YSR Congress secured majority in the Legislative Council, which had become a major hurdle for the Jagan Mohan Reddy government for the past one year. The ruling YSR Congress heaved a sigh of relief with TDP’s strength coming down to 11 members in the 58-member House. Meanwhile, Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan appointed Progressive Democratic Alliance member, Vitapu Balasubrahmanyam, as pro-tem chairman of the Legislative Council, as both chairman and vice-chairman posts fell vacant. Balasubrahmanyam would perform the duties of the chairman till a new chairman is elected. It was two years ago, the YSR Congress started its governance in the state by winning 151 MLAs out of 175. The TDP, whose strength in the Assembly was reduced to 23, was able to keep a check on the YSR Congress in the Council, where it had 28-members in the 58-member House. In the last two years, the ruling YSR Congress could get 15 MLCs elected from the party, filling the vacancies caused by the resignations and retirement of TDP members. Finally, with the retirement of seven TDP and one YSR Congress members on Friday, TDP’s strength had come down to 11, while the YSR Congress strength had gone up to 21, including three independents elected from the teachers’ constituencies. Among those retired on Friday included TDP’s firebrand members, Buddha Venkateswara Rao, Y V B Rajenra Prasad, Dwarapureddy Jagadeeswara Rao and BN Jagadeeswara Rao. Meanwhile, three seats fell vacant in May, in the assembly quota. However, the Election Commissioner had postponed the election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ysrc-gets-majority-in-upper-house/articleshow/83645581.cms||Gopi Dara

Both public and private sector facilities will participate and ensure required facilities and services are in place,” Niti Aayog member V K Paul said. However, he maintained that chances were that only isolated cases of severe infection would happen among children. “The information shows that children were infected but it was very mild. Only isolated cases of infection may occur in children,” he added. “Studies have also shown that children have equal susceptibility as adults, so we have to be ready to ensure that we are in a position to cater to them in case numbers rise again,” Dr Paul said, referring to the seropositivity survey conducted by WHO-AIIMS which showed that the prevalent Covid-19 variant was unlikely to disproportionately affect children. Findings of the study, conducted among children of 2-17 years age from March 15 to June 10, showed sero-prevalence was 55.7% in the less than 18 years group and 63.5% among adults of 18 years and above. “In urban areas, it is 78% in those below 18 and 79% in above 18,” Dr Paul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kids-may-be-severely-infected-in-rare-cases/articleshow/83655927.cms||Sushmi Dey

Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has selected RV Ramesh Yadav, a political novice, to enter the legislative council. The last BC leader to enter the council was K Ramaiah, in 1962. Ramesh will be the first from the Yadav community to become an MLC, which has a sizeable population in the district. Since the formation of the AP legislative council in 1958, there have been 30 MLCs from Kadapa, but this will be the first for a BC member to enter the council from the district. YSRC gave the lion’s share of MLC berths to BC, SC and minorities — 11 out of 15 seats — since the party came to power in 2019, which is nearly 75% of the total seats. “The CM has proved that he is a man of deeds, not words. He has been working for the political empowerment of downtrodden communities. He nominated two BCs to the Rajya Sabha, which we did not even anticipate,” said MLC Janga Krishna Murthy, who is also the YSRC’s BC committee chairman.

The strain, which has largely been responsible for surge in cases in humans, was declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organisation on May 11. “We are treating all four lions symptomatically in the best possible way,” zoo authorities said on Friday. A few big cats at Hyderabad and Jaipur zoos have already tested positive for the variant. The zoological park had sent the samples lifted from 11 captive lions to ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal. The institute, which is one of the four approved facilities in the country to test captive animals, confirmed that nine lions tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on June 3. City zoo virus variant highly transmissibleVandalur zoo authorities had requested NIHSAD, which also undertakes research on exotic and emerging pathogens in animals, to share the results of genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that infected the lions. The director of NIHSAD informed the zoo that genome sequencing of four samples showed that the sequence belong to Pangolin lineage B.1.617.2 and are Delta variants as per WHO nomenclature. WHO had said the variant showed evidence of higher transmissibility and reduced neutralisation, a zoo release said on Friday. Meanwhile, the state government on Friday constituted a state-level task force to provide support and guidance to authorities on prevention and mitigation of Covid-19 infection in wild and captive animals in tiger reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and reserve forests. This six-member team headed by TN environment secretary Supriya Sahu will have a close watch on disease surveillance, mapping and monitoring system, vaccination and publish reports, a release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-four-vandalur-zoo-lions-positive-for-delta-variant/articleshow/83655912.cms||Ram Sundaram

As the state government is yet to take a call on possible extension of the trust board’s two-year tenure, the meeting is likely to take some key decisions in what could possibly be its last meeting. TTD chairman YV Subba Reddy said the temple body will also examine the possibilities of increasing pilgrim footfall to the hill town in view of the decline in Covid-19 cases in the state and across the country over the last few weeks. “We could not execute many resolutions due to the pandemic. The relaunch of Kalyanamastu mass marriages programme could not be held. We also passed a resolution to construct over 500 temples across the state but could not start the initiative due to Covid-19,” he said. He, however, expressed happiness that the temple body engaged itself by reaching out to the poor and needy by taking up food distribution programmes at various places during the lockdown period. “The temple body plans to pass a resolution to extend Garuda Varadhi elevated expressway up to Alipiri arch for the convenience of visiting devotees. We will also take a final call on increasing pilgrim footfall to Tirumala during Saturday’s meeting,” Subba Reddy added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ttd-board-to-hold-its-final-meeting-today/articleshow/83645769.cms||---
---||Surat||Gujarat: Hafoos gets a worthy successor in Sonpari||SURAT: Herald the new queen, Sonpari, who will soon rule mango lovers’ taste buds. With South Gujarat’s signature, the Hafoos variety, slowly losing its tag and kingdom to Kesar owing to changing weather patterns, this new variety that smells and tastes exactly like Alphonso, but only bigger in and better, is emerging as the the worthy successor. What’s more, it lasts longer too, claims agriculturists in the region. Named ‘Sonpari’ after the ripened fruit’s golden hue, the mango was developed at Pariya research centre of Navsari Agriculture University. Scientists developed the new breed through cross grafting of Valsadi Hafoos and south India’s popular Banganapalli. Initial research work started 20 years ago and farmers are now literally enjoying the fruits of the hard labour. In the last eight years, 14,000 saplings of Sonpari were distributed among farmers. Considering 50% rate of survival, at least 4,000 to 5,000 trees have started bearing fruits. Alphonso and Kesar mango trees, which are a decade old, bear 100 to 150 kilograms of mangoes. But Sonpari trees managed to produce more than these two varieties! “Alphonso has few problems — one is of white spongy tissues in the fruit, and then, its extreme sensitivity to weather inclemencies, besides bearing fruits in alternate years. However, this breed overcomes all these problems and yet looks and tastes like Alphonso and in fact, some of its fruits are sweeter than Alphonso and Kesar,” said Dr C K Timbadiya, senior scientist at NAU. Sonpari’s advantages are not just limited to size and sweetness, but its longevity is even more than Kesar and Alphonso. Agriculturists see a huge potential of exports of Sonpari in coming years. “The fruits lasts longer than Kesar and Alphonso as even after 14 days it does not rot,” said Dr Chirag Patel, associate research scientist (Horticulture) at Pariya research centre. “Right now, the production is low because the trees are still young, but customers like its taste so much that they I have already started getting inquiry for next season,” said Girish Patel, a farmer from Jalalpore taluka of Navsari. He added that due to its high demand, farmers are selling it for as high as Rs 3,500 for 20 kilograms, more than double the market price of Alphonso and Kesar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/hafoos-gets-a-worthy-successor-in-sonpari/articleshow/83648655.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Heavy rainfall threw life out of gear in Anand district which was pounded by 175mm rainfall in just four hours beginning 6am. The maximum rainfall was between 6am and 8 am when it recorded 120 mm.  A majority of low-lying areas and main roads got flooded with rainwater while citizens had to wade through waist-deep waterlogged areas in the milk town and adjoining education hub Vallabh Vidyanagar. Some roads resembled rivers as two-wheelers parked outside houses got submerged.  Shastri Maidan, Laxmi cinema road, residential societies near Bhalej overbridge, Vyayam Shala Road, Tulsi underpass, Radha Krishna statue area and the stretch connecting new bus stand area to Yogi petrol pump and Baithak mandir were heavily waterlogged.  For nearly two hours, two-wheelers and smaller vehicles could not cross the stretch between the new bus stand area and Baithak Mandir. Vehicular movement also got adversely affected for some time on Amul Dairy Road where a tree fell down.  By late afternoon, water started receding from major areas of the town but citizens did express their anger against lethargy of Anand Nagarpalika which they said have not resolved long pending issues of storm water drains especially in areas like Lotiya Bhagol.  Like in the past, rainwater even entered the residential quarter and office of Anand district superintendent of police which gets waterlogged during heavy rains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/anand-pounded-by-175mm-in-4-hours/articleshow/83649048.cms||---

The jewellery was stolen from his car parked in the busy Chhani jakatnaka area on Friday. An offence registered regarding the incident states that the jeweller Vipul Rasiklal Dhakan had arrived in Vadodara on Wednesday afternoon along with his salesman Jalpesh Lathigara and driver Praful Dangar. They had brought jewellery weighing approximately 5.75kg with them in two bags. They then went to a shop in Alkapuri and sold ornaments weighing approximately 800 gm to 850 gm there and checked into a hotel in the same area later. On Thursday, they went to different shops in Alkapuri and sold gold jewellery weighing 61grams there. They were left with ornaments weighing around five kg and returned to their hotel. On Friday morning, they left the hotel and were to leave for Rajkot. According to Dhakan, the driver suggested that they eat ‘ganthia’ at an eatery at Chhani jakatnaka and they decided to snack before leaving for Rajkot. They kept the bags in the boot of their car. After snacks, they went to a shop near-by to eat ‘pan masala’. Here, they were told that their boot was open. When they reached the car, they found the bags missing. Others in the area told them that two persons had taken away the bags. It came to light that the accused had broken the glass of the car and opened the boot with the lever near the driver’s seat. Reports suggest that the accused had come to the place on a motorcycle and sped away after taking the bags. While the incident took place at around 11.30am, the complainant did not approach the police immediately. Dhakan discussed the matter with his brothers first and one of them informed the police. Dhakan has a firm by the name of V Rasiklal in Rajkot. He procures jewellery manufactured by artisans and then sells to various ornaments stores. His brothers Hitesh and Hiren are also in the same business and operate a firm by the name of H Rasiklal.  Fatehgunj police gathered details of the incident and asked the complainant to narrate whatever had happened after his arrival to the city on Wednesday. All this was verified and an offence was registered on Friday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/5kg-gold-jewellery-looted-from-parked-car/articleshow/83648710.cms||---

The required funds for the construction of the convention centres would be tapped through various sources including CSR funds,” district in-charge minister K Kanna Babu said. GVMC commissioner G Srijana said required land for the centres would be identified on the outskirts of the city such as Anakapalli, Bheemili, Pendurthi and Madhurawada areas. “It would be difficult to find sites measuring two acres in the centre of the city. We are taking the help of the revenue department to identify government land,” Srijana said. As per initial estimations, each convention centre of 1,000 seating capacity and parking space for at least 50 cars would cost around Rs 5-6 crore. The city has around 40 kalyanamandapams, but barring two, the rest are small community centres. Once the land is identified, contruction work would be completed within two years. “Vizag is set to become the executive capital soon. It needs more amenities for public and more space for public gatherings and functions. Over 1,000 open spaces have been identified which would be developed as parks. Cleaning and beautification of water bodies would also be taken up,” Rajya Sabha member V Vijaya Sai Reddy said. Kanna Babu said works worth over Rs 3,000 crore have been planned to develop the city. “Most of the works are targeted to be completed by March next year. Vizag would be developed as a green and ecofriendly city. To ease traffic congestion, flyovers at all busy junctions have been planned,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-civic-body-to-build-eight-convention-centres/articleshow/83645938.cms||Siva G

Lokesh visited the families of the victims on Friday. Speaking to the media, Lokesh accused chief minister and YSRC MLAs of resorting to faction killings to cover up their inefficiencies and failures to do any good for Rayalaseema people. He alleged the Voddu brothers were eliminated because they were earning goodwill among public. He said that police did not arrest even one of the 15 accused in the case. He alleged that some police officials were becoming indirect accomplices in the murder of TDP leaders. He said that Voddu Nageswara Reddy’s revolver was taken over by the police during the local body elections and it was not returned even after the polls. “Two innocent lives would have been saved had the police did their duty,” said Lokesh. He warned that TDP was not a party to run away from the battlefield and would pay back once it returned to power. He said that over 27 TDP leaders were killed in the last two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/lokesh-demands-cbi-probe-into-kurnool-murders/articleshow/83645978.cms||Samdani MN
---||India||Petitioned by Bengal, SC asks HC to defer Narada case hearing||NEW DELHI: Agreeing to hear the West Bengal government and its law minister Moloy Ghatak’s plea against the Calcutta HC order refusing to take their affidavits on record in CBI’s transfer petition in the Narada case, the Supreme Court on Friday requested the HC to adjourn the hearing scheduled for June 21. Indicating that the HC could resume day-to-day hearing only after the controversy on the affidavits is settled, a bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian posted the hearing of the plea against HC order on June 22 and hoped that HC would not take up the case till then. The HC on June 9 did not accept affidavits by the CM and law minister related to their role on May 17, the day of the arrest of four TMC functionaries, that became a ground for CBI moving a petition to transfer the case from the special court in Kolkata. Hitting out at the HC for allegedly applying different standards for parties, the law minister in his appeal said while CBI was allowed to file affidavits without leave of the court to remove lacuna in its pleading, the affidavits from him and the CM were not allowed on the ground of delay. “The HC has lost sight of the fact that what is good for the goose is good for the gander, and if CBI was permitted to fill lacunae in its pleadings and improve its case by filing two additional affidavits without the leave of the HC, it is surprising that CBI is today opposing the affidavit by the petitioner, and HC is perpetuating the illegality by imposing different standards for parties ...in an arbitrary manner, and in utter disregard to the principles of equity and natural justice,” Ghatak said. He said notice was issued to him on May 27 and the affidavit was filed on June 9. He said the 12 days included two weekends and two court holidays and there was a mere delay of 7 days which “is neither excessive nor perverse so as to render it non-condonable”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/petitioned-by-bengal-sc-asks-hc-to-defer-narada-case-hearing/articleshow/83655970.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

This is because UPHCs have started attending to pregnancies and other non-Covid cases. The civic body has also asked zonal offices to shut non-functional Covid care centres. This does not mean the Greater Chennai Corporation is lowering its guard. The 21 Covid screening centres, 42 swab collection centres will continue, said a civic official. The civic body will maintain the number of swabs collected daily at 25,000-30,000. It will use mobile units to collect samples from market places, shops, offices, industries. “We will not reduce the number of samples collected as this is the most important aspect of surveillance,” said a health department official. The number of screening centres will, however, be reduced, said a zonal official. “We are planning to make it one per zone but await commissioner’s orders on this. We will keep the entire civil infrastructure intact in case of a third wave. However, until then, we can reduce maintenance costs,” said an official. For example, the Covid care centre at the Chennai Trade Centre at Nandambakkam, the biggest in the city, will be shut next week as there are no patients. “I have asked the zones to send details of Covid care centres that can be closed,” said Gagandeep Singh Bedi, Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner. However, residents in some area are upset, saying they have to travel longer distances to get themselves tested or vaccinated. Rajni M, a resident of Aminjikarai, was asked to go to either Nesapakkam or Ayanavaram for giving her swab sample. “Both the locations are very far from my residence,” she said. Residents of Nanganallur and Alandur are upset that the special vaccination camps have been wound up. V Rama Rao, a resident of Nanganallur, said senior citizens will be the most affected. “Post lockdown, vaccination will be the only tool to curb cases. So, they should continue more camps,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/phcs-to-cut-swab-collection-but-greater-chennai-corporation-to-maintain-test-numbers/articleshow/83655940.cms||---

A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka made the observation while stating that the report on CM BS Yediyurappa’s son BY Vijayendra’s recent visit to Nanjundeshwara temple at Nanjanagud during lockdown “should be an eyeopener for everyone”. “The persons concerned who have violated the orders passed by the state under the Disaster Management Act 2005 of keeping the temples closed are not before the court. However, what is stated in the report should be (an) eyeopener for everyone, which will include temple authorities and political leaders...,” the court said. If the orders passed from time to time by the state-level executive committee under the Disaster Management Act that the temple shall be kept closed for the members of the public, the said order should be scrupulously followed without any exception. The current order is in force till June 21, 2021,” the bench has noted in its order. The bench said that it is necessary for the state government to issue instructions through the muzrai department as far as temples under the control of government are concerned to ensure that the ban on entry into the temple is not violated by anyone and the state government should immediately issue the said directions. As regards the temple-visit incident, the bench pointed out that even the Mysuru deputy commissioner’s report had accepted that Vijayendra had entered the temple and the contention of the executive officer of the temple that no special darshan was arranged for him was also recorded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/report-on-cm-bs-yediyurappas-sons-temple-visit-must-be-eyeopener-for-all-says-karnataka-high-court/articleshow/83655991.cms||---

---||Delhi||Comply with National Food Security Act by June 30, Centre tells Delhi govt||NEW DELHI: The Centre has directed the Delhi government to comply with the norms of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) by June 30, which include installation and operation of e-PoS machines, setting up vigilance committees at the ration shop level and also conducting social audit on their functioning.  Officials haven’t specified what actions can be taken for failure to comply with the “directive”. The city receives about 36,000 tonnes of rice and wheat every month under the NFSA for distribution among the identified beneficiaries. Sources said the main non-compliance is the delay in making the e-PoS system operational across fair price shops (FPS). “This defeats the basic purpose of transparency in distribution of the subsidised foodgrains to the right beneficiary. They have not complied with several provisions of the Act since October 2013,” said a source. Distribution of grain in city in violation of NFSA: CentreThis comes amid a row between the Centre and the Delhi government over PDS grain supply in the national capital. The Arvind Kejriwal government has blamed the Centre for blocking its ration at doorstep plan. In a communication to the food secretary-cum-commissioner of Delhi government, the food ministry wrote on Thursday that the Centre has been pursuing the distribution of foodgrains from all FPSs using e-PoS machines for the last three years. “More than 12 letters/ DOs have been written to GNCTD from all levels in this department. However, the distribution of foodgrains in Delhi is still being done using old/ manual register-based mechanisms,” it said. The Delhi government in April 2018 temporarily suspended distribution of ration through the e-PoS system. The Centre wants the Delhi government to implement e-PoS distribution of foodgrains from all ration shops for rightful targeting of the beneficiaries. The ministry said it is in violation of the NFSA. The letter said the use of e-PoS machines is necessary for implementation of ‘One Nation-One Ration Card, which will benefit migrant beneficiaries. It has flagged that the city government has not put in place any machinery for social audits at the ration shop level and no vigilance committee has been set up for monitoring implementation of NFSA. The ministry said the Delhi government is also not maintaining data on NFSA beneficiaries under the SC and ST categories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/comply-with-national-food-security-act-by-june-30-centre-tells-delhi-govt/articleshow/83656042.cms||---
---||India||CoWIN new feature to eliminate duplication||PUNE: The Centre on Friday introduced a new feature to eliminate duplication in certificates on CoWIN, offering relief to several beneficiaries who failed to get the final certificate despite obtaining both the doses because they used different cellphone numbers to register on the portal. So far, such beneficiaries were getting two first dose certificates showing different mobile numbers. The feature comes two days after TOI had reported that there are at least one lakh cases in Maharashtra alone of people who are fully vaccinated but their names are being shown as due for the second shot. Users can log onto CoWIN, click on “raise an issue” and select the “merge multiple first dose provisional certificates” option. Elaborating on the new feature, RS Sharma, chairman of the empowered group on Covid vaccine administration, told TOI: “CoWIN has an easy system of entry where users have to register using their cellphone numbers to create an account. Many people, due to whatever reasons, got their first dose by registering from one cellphone number and second dose by registration from another phone number. They should have got both doses with one account so that the system has their vaccination records.” He said the CoWIN system does not work on de-duplication of entries and hence would not automatically prevent new sign-ins if the same person registers using another number. However, some users are facing trouble despite using the same phone number. Prabhakar Jagdale said, “My parents are facing an issue with getting the final certificate after the second dose. Seems like the second dose was logged as first dose in the system by mistake. Not sure if it happened due to an error at the centre in uploading information or error on CoWin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cowin-new-feature-to-eliminate-duplication/articleshow/83656064.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Business||Mitra accuses BJP govt of shifting PSU HQs from Kolkata||Kolkata: West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra in a fresh letter to minister for steel Dharmendra Pradhan on Friday has alleged that ever since the BJP-led government came to office in New Delhi there has been an ominous pattern of removing headquarters of the Central PSUs from Kolkata, which have been operational here for half a century and some even a hundred years. The state finance minister also expressed surprise over Pradhan’s reply to his earlier letter as it “fell short of clearing the air about possible dismantling of the Kolkata-based raw material division (RMD) of SAIL”. TOI was the first to report on the possible dismantling of the RMD. On the Union minister’s reply, he wrote, “I am surprised that you choose not to address the major question of dismantling of the raw material division (RMD) of SAIL. This matter featured in the very first paragraph of my letter indicating job loss of scores of contractual workers in the middle of the pandemic and uncertainty thrust on permanent workers.” Mitra has again urged Pradhan not to dismantle RMD and keep its headquarters in Kolkata. “Your confirmation that RMD will not be dismantled and its headquarters will remain in Kolkata will reassure many anxious workers and their families in the midst of pandemic,” he wrote in the letter. Terming the shift of Central PSU offices from Kolkata as a ‘dangerous pattern’, Mitra mentioned that SBI has shifted its Central accounts hub from Kolkata to Mumbai, the UBI headquarters has been shifted from Kolkata after merger, the corporate office of Hindustan Steel Works Construction has also been shifted from Kolkata to Delhi, Coal India shifted some of its subsidiary offices from Bengal. Besides, Mitra pointed out that there is apprehension that shifting the headquarters of DVC, shifting the head office of National Insurance Company (NIC), shifting the headquarters of the Tea Board of India is also being planned. “Therefore, to allay the apprehension, I seek your government’s assurance that the headquarters of this iconic institutions mentioned here will not be removed from Kolkata,” he wrote. Pradhan has earlier refuted accusations of undermining steel plants of SAIL in West Bengal in his reply to a letter of the state finance minister earlier this week. Mitra had earlier written to the Union steel minister to reverse the RMD decision. Mitra had written that this would have an adverse impact on two steel plants at Durgapur and Burnpur as far as iron ore supply is concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mitra-accuses-bjp-govt-of-shifting-psu-hqs-from-kolkata/articleshow/83651192.cms||---

It’s said to outline a formula to resolve infighting in the party’ state unit. “The high command will take corrective measures based on his report. He may recommend reining in some dissidents MLAs,’’ said a senior party functionary. Singh chaired the state BJP core committee meeting where he reportedly dismissed talk about leadership change and asked chief minister BS Yediyurappa to take all MLAs into confidence to avoid confusion and mistrust. “Leadership change has not come up for discussion at the high command. Nobody should talk about it," he told core committee members. Singh met ministers, MLAs and senior party functionaries to elicit their opinion about on Yediyurappa's administration. Revenue minister R Ashoka, who attended the meeting, said there is no question of leadership change. “Singh clarified at the meeting and told me to communicate it to the media,’’ he added. The CM said about 60 legislators met Singh, but one or two people making statements against him were not allowed. Later, MLA Aravind Bellad, who is in the forefront seeking leadership change, met Singh briefly. Another MLA Basangouda Patil announced on Facebook that he hadn’t sought an appointment with Singh. Meanwhile, Akhil Bharat Veerashaiva Mahasabha national president Shamanur Shivashankarappa, a Congress MLA, extended support to Yediyurappa, saying he should continue as CM. MLC alleges irregularities: On Friday, disgruntled MLC AH Vishwanath alleged the state government had rushed through the tender process for the Rs 21,473 crore Upper Bhadra project by flouting rules and without seeking approval from the finance department. He alleged this was due to interference by Yediyurappa's son BY Vijayendra. Yediyurappa said: “I don't want to say anything about Vishwanath. Our high command will deal with him.” The water resources department later said no procedures or norms were violated in floating of tenders. “The approval for the revised DPR from the finance department was taken on December 12, 2021. The technical advisory “committee of the Union Jala Shakti ministry approved the project on December 24, 2020. The approval of the state cabinet was also taken. The entire process is very transparent,” Lakshman Rao Peshwe, secretary, water resources ministry, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/after-3-day-meet-karnataka-bjp-in-charge-arun-singh-readies-report-on-dissidence/articleshow/83656073.cms||---
---||Business||Eveready makes full provision of group debt||Kolkata: With the second wave of Covid 19 and subsequent delay in promoter-level restructuring, Williamson Magor Group company Eveready Industries has embarked on a balance sheet-cleaning exercise. The Burman family being the single largest shareholder with around 20% holding in the company now, EIL has made complete provision of group-level debt in the fourth quarter of this fiscal. It has made provision for Rs 629 crore debt (principal and interest) given to group firms as inter corporate deposits (ICD) as exceptional items, which has led to a loss of Rs 441 crore for the fourth quarter despite an operating profit of Rs 41 crore, a jump of 43%. For the whole year, it was Rs 224 crore. Sources also said that the company has not undertaken any fresh exposure at group level in the last two years. Industry experts feel that high group-level debt was one of the reasons that has led to fall in promoters holding in the dry cell battery major as financial institutions revoked its shares for unpaid debt though the company continues to make profits. The managing director of EIL, Amritanshu Khaitan, told TOI that he is hopeful that in the next two years, it will be a zero-debt company as far as bank debt is concerned. Eveready has already provisioned the entire group level debt in the fourth quarter of 2020-21. Khaitan pointed out that the company has posted the highest ever operating profit in the history of the company despite the fact that it was a challenging year. “After not so good April and May, we are seeing signs of recovery in June already. We should post a strong performance this year. With the kind of cash generation we shall also become a debt-free company in two years,” he added. The company has pointed out in the accounts statement that exceptional items consist of provision for outstanding amounts of inter-corporate deposits and recoverables, write-off for interest accrued on such deposits and recoverables and write-off for outstanding capital advance as on March 31, 2021. “The company has given inter-corporate deposits to certain companies (part of the promoter group) and has also paid for certain guarantees to banks/other parties who had provided loans to these companies. From time to time, in earlier years, as well as in the current year under review, a portion of these deposits were repaid by the borrowing entities to the company on demand. The company had given time till February 28, 2021, to the borrower companies for repayment of the outstanding,” EIL has added in the accounting statement. Elaborating on its performance, EIL has said that the turnover for the quarter registered a growth of 22% from a subdued March turnover last year as all the segments registered growth. “Volumes also grew across all the segments during the quarter. Despite the robust growth during the quarter, turnover grew only marginally for the full year due to a sluggish first quarter of the year arising out of economic impacts of lockdown restrictions. While the core categories of batteries and flashlights grew robustly during the year, the segments of lighting and appliances could not recover from the adverse impacts of the first quarter,” the company has added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/eveready-makes-full-provision-of-group-debt/articleshow/83651242.cms||---

Earlier, the company had received an expression of interest (EoI) from Makara Capital for a capital infusion in it. Also, it had received an EoI from US-based Arena Investors. SEFL’s Strategic Coordination Committee (SCC), chaired by an independent director, will evaluate the Makara Capital’s offer and make the recommendation to the board of the company, according to a stock exchange filing.

---||India||Officers, engineers to face penalties for repeat failures in monitoring NH projects||NEW DELHI: Now officers and engineers of NHAI, road ministry and other agencies involved in NH construction will be held responsible for failures in quality works and of structures. They will face major or minor penalties for repeat failures to comply with the norms for supervision or in case of failure of any structure during construction and operation. Till now the authorities have been only penalizing the contractors and consultants supervising works or independent engineers for any failure. According to a circular issued this week, the road transport ministry has specified the responsibility of the officers in-charge at site such as project directors, regional officers and executive directors to inspect the project to ensure proven construction methodology of the work is being followed. The ministry said despite the provision in contracts for enforcing quality assurance and quality control there have been instances of “lapses” on the part of construction companies or contractors and supervision consultants, which have resulted in failures during construction. The circular said to ensure no compromise with quality, the officers concerned will mandatorily inspect the project to ensure that approved quality assurance plan is being diligently followed by contractors and consultants. They will have to carry out sample laboratory and onsite tests on important quality characteristics of materials, mixes, process and final products. The officers will have to carry out monthly inspection of all projects and in the case of works costing more than Rs 300 crore and projects involving a bridge of more than 60 meters, they have to carry out bi-monthly inspection. For projects worth Rs 100 crore to 300 crore, quarterly inspection is mandatory. The circular said there will be graded action for failure of officers in their duty. For example, they will be advised and warned for the first two instances of failures and in the third instance the warning will be recorded. “Instances of failures exceeding three times or failure of structure during construction or operation will attract major or minor penalties,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/officers-engineers-to-face-penalties-for-repeat-failures-in-monitoring-nh-projects/articleshow/83656100.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Bengaluru||Petrol hits a century in Bengaluru, diesel on brink of Rs 93 per litre||BENGALURU: After Mumbai and Hyderabad, Bengaluru became the third metropolitan city in the country where the price of petrol has shot past the 100-rupee mark. A litre of petrol in Bengaluru was selling at Rs 100.25 and diesel at Rs 92.97 on Friday. A litre of petrol cost Rs 103.08 in Mumbai, Rs 100.74 in Hyderabad, Rs 98.14 in Chennai, Rs 96.84 in Kolkata and Rs 96.93 in New Delhi on Friday. Records show that petrol rate was Rs 71.97 in Bengaluru between March 16 and 27 in 2020, and it has an increase of Rs 28.20 in 15 months. Similarly, diesel prices went up from Rs 64.41 per litre during March 16-27, 2020 to Rs 92.97 now, a hike of Rs 28.56 in the same period. In Karnataka, at least six districts — Bidar, Ballari, Koppal, Davanagere, Shivamogga and Chikkamagaluru — have crossed the Rs 100 mark. In Ballari, petrol was sold at Rs 102.05 per litre and the diesel price was Rs 94.7 a litre on Friday. Oil-marketing companies increased fuel rates for the 26th time in the past 46 days, pushing the petrol and diesel prices in the city to a life high. OMCs revise fuel prices daily based on the global refined products prices and dollar exchange rate. However, fuel prices were static from February 28, 2021 to May 3, 2021 due to elections in five states. The rise comes at a time when daily fuel sales have declined due to Covid-19 restrictions. “Fuel sales have reduced by 40-50% due to travel restrictions and work-fromhome arrangement. Motorists will feel the pitch once the normalcy returns in afew months,” said A Tharanath, vice-president of Akhila Karnataka Federation of Petroleum Traders. “The price variation between Bengaluru and other districts is mainly due to transportation costs from terminals. For instance, Ballari is getting supplies from Hassan, Mangaluru and Devanagundi instead of bordering Andhra Pradesh. If the Centre comes up with One India, One Tax, it will be possible for Ballari to get fuel from Andhra Pradesh,” he said. Asked if there was an issue in displaying and billing fuel in three digits, he said all fuel outlets are already upgraded with an automated centralised system. In addition to the base price of petrol, other components like dealer commission, excise duty and sales tax are increasing the price of petrol. However, the Centre is yet to bring fuel under the GST regime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/petrol-hits-a-century-in-bengaluru-diesel-on-brink-of-rs-93-per-litre/articleshow/83656106.cms||---

The deceased, Malla Reddy, may have had had issues with the rehabilitation and resettlement (R&R) package extended to Mallannasagar reservoir oustees. Malla Reddy was one of the people ousted from their homes in the village, which is among those that will be submerged by the reservoir. What drove Malla Reddy to suicide is not clear as his family has informed the local revenue authorities that they have no issues with the R&R package. Malla Reddy had returned to Vemulaghat on Thursday night from a village in Gajwel mandal where he had been staying with his brother-in-law. His body was found burning by members of a few families who still reside in the village. They alerted the police who initiated an investigation and sent the charred body for a postmortem examination in government hospital. Reddy and grandson got relief in 2019 itself: OfficialSeveral houses in the village have been acquired and demolished for the Mallannasagar project and the villagers shifted to a different place. BJP Dubbak MLA M Raghunandan Rao alleged that Malla Reddy took the extreme step as he had not received the R&R package and urged chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to look into the issue. Thoguta tahsildar G Bal Reddy told TOI that there was no issue pertaining to Malla Reddy’s R&R package. He said the family had received what was due to them in 2019 itself. Reddy was given ₹7.5 lakh and allotted a two-bedroom house. His grandson was also given ₹5 lakh and a 250-square-yard plot. Reddy, however, did not live in house allotted to him. Officials said family issues may have forced Reddy to end his life. Reddy’s wife had passed away a few months ago. His two daughters and their husbands have also passed away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-reservoir-oustee-makes-own-pyre-sets-himself-on-fire-in-siddipet-district/articleshow/83656077.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Kolkata||Reassign Nandigram poll case, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s lawyers write to Calcutta HC||KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s lawyers have written to the Calcutta high court, pleading that her Nandigram poll petition be “reassigned” as they fear the “likelihood of a bias” in the court asked to hear the case. The move, initiated on Wednesday, became public on Friday after the court decided to hear her petition next week when she would appear in court in person. Banerjee has sought that the Nandigram poll result be declared “null and void”; she lost the cliffhanger by 1,956 votes. The CM’s lawyers, in their letter to the Calcutta HC acting Chief Justice’s secretary on June 16, stated that they feared the “likelihood of a bias” during adjudication; Banerjee had objected to Justice Kausik Chanda’s elevation as a permanent HC judge this April, the letter explained. “My client has been made aware that Hon’ble Justice Chanda was an active member of the BJP,” the letter said, adding that the adjudication of this case was likely to have “political ramifications”. All this would lead to “a reasonable apprehension of bias” in their client’s mind if Justice Chanda took up the petition, the letter explained. Banerjee’s lawyers stated in the letter that her apprehension stemmed from the fact that the judge was aware that she had “objections” to his confirmation as a permanent judge. It was not enough that “justice be done; it must also be seen to be done”, the letter said. Reassigning the case was necessary to “avoid prejudice” or “even presumption of prejudice” against the CM, it added. The CM’s legal team, comprising SN Mookherjee and Sanjay Basu, sought adjournment of the hearing when Justice Chanda took up the petition for hearing at 11am on Friday. The court then pointed out that the petitioner, CM Banerjee, had to appear before it. Senior counsel Mookherjee told the court that she would appear before the HC on the next day of hearing, when the court said it would hear the matter again next Thursday. The court also directed the registrar-general to file a report on whether all legal aspects were completed before filing the petition. A group of lawyers protested outside the HC, urging the judiciary to remain insulated from political interference, after Friday’s hearing. “The majesty of the court has to be upheld at all costs,” Achinta Banerjee, one of the protesting lawyers, said. The state Bar Council had already conveyed its views to the HC, member Prasun Dutta said. Trinamool Congress MPs Derek O’Brien and Mahua Moitra spoke on the issue on Friday, a day after BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya took a jibe at the Bengal CM for filing the petition. The HC heard four other election petitions on Friday, asking the EC to “preserve” all election-related documents and devices in the petition moved by state minister Shantiram Mahato; he lost a Purulia assembly seat by 463 votes. Justice Subhasis Dasgupta mentioned the petition did not suffer from any filing defect, according to an HC registrar-general report. TMC candidates Alo Rani Sarkar, Sangram Dolui and Manas Majumdar, too, moved the HC against their poll losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/reassign-nandi-poll-case-cms-lawyers-write-to-hc/articleshow/83653628.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 300 BJP supporters return to TMC after Gangajal ‘purification of minds’||BIRBHUM: As many as 300 BJP supporters, who were on hunger strike in front of a Trinamool Congress office in Birbhum demanding to be taken back into the party fold, were finally reinducted on Friday after they were sprinkled with ‘Gangajal’ “to cleanse their polluted minds”. Friday morning’s incident in Banagram, part of Sainthia assembly constituency, was the latest in a series of such protests by defectors now keen to return to Trinamool. Read Also15,000 BJP supporters have joined us, claims Trinamool's Tripura unit headAs many as 15,000 supporters from ruling BJP of Tripura have joined Trinamool in the past one-and-half months, overwhelmed with the success of Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal, claimed Trinamool Congress state president Ashis Lal Singh on Friday.Asoke Mondal, one of the protesters, said: “We want TMC to take us back. By joining BJP, we have stalled development in our villages. The constant protests (by BJP) have done more harm than good. We want to return of our own free will. We will continue with the strike till we are taken back.” The strike started at 8am and ended at 11am when the protesters were sprinkled with Ganga water. Banagram’s Trinamool panchayat pradhan Tushar Kanti Mondal, who handed the party flag to new entrants, said: “These people had been requesting for the last couple of days to join our party. Today, they sat in dharna in front of the party office and appealed to be taken back. I had talked to our leaders and included them again in our party.” Regarding sprinkling of Gangajal, Mondal said: “BJP is a communal party. They have injected their poisonous thoughts into their minds and spoiled their mental peace. So shantir jal (holy water) was sprinkled on them to rid them of all ashanti (evils). It was not meant for their purification, rather purification of their minds that were polluted by BJP.” Trinamool’s Sainthia MLA Nilabati Saha said: ”I have heard that some people have joined our party in that village. But the event was organised by our local leaders.” A district BJP leader, refusing to be named, said: “All these are drama. Everywhere, our party workers and supporters are forced to join TMC. Such drama is arranged to show there is no post-poll violence. In some areas, the situation is so dangerous that BJP workers have no option but to join TMC.” In a similar incident in Illambazar, villagers sat on dharna at the TMC office with appeals to be taken back. Earlier, in places such as Nanoor, Bolpur and Sainthia, some people who claimed to be BJP workers were found using a microphone mounted on a vehicle to seek “apology” and plead to rejoin TMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/300-bjp-supporters-return-to-tmc-after-gangajal-purification-of-minds/articleshow/83652222.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cooch Behar ex-SP quizzed in Sitalkuchi case||Kolkata: The CID’s Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the Sitalkuchi firing questioned suspended IPS officer and former Cooch Behar SP Debasish Dhar for over five hours at Bhawani Bhavan on Friday. He has been summoned again on June 22. The alleged CISF firing left four dead on election day on April 10. Dhar was reportedly asked specific questions on who gave the firing order by CISF, his actions before (in reading the gravity of the situation) and after the firing (steps he took to ascertain facts and mitigate tension) and the investigation he undertook after the incident. Dhar came to Bhawani Bhavan around 11.30 am and left after 4.30 pm. “We might need clarity on a few other issues. We are studying his statement,” said a source. “Dhar’s role on that day as the police head of the district is under our radar,” an officer said. Five officers from Bengal police have already been questioned in the case. They include Mathabhanga SDPO Surojit Mondal and IC Biswasroy Sarkar. CID sources said “specific questions” based on the statements of Sarkar and two ASIs were put before Dhar. All these officers had insisted that senior officers were kept in the loop about the developments. Dhar was also asked about the “exact time” he was informed about the firing. The CID has reports that the firing took place “towards the polling booth” and a bullet was found lodged on a blackboard. A forensic team has also collected evidence. “The case is now stronger. We will take a call on the CISF personnel soon,” said a source. The CID said it was preparing a report for Calcutta High Court, which is hearing several PILs seeking a court-monitored probe into the circumstances that led to the deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cooch-behar-ex-sp-quizzed-in-sitalkuchi-case/articleshow/83651991.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: HS marks to factor in four best scores in Madhyamik||KOLKATA: The computation of Higher Secondary result will take into account a student’s best four subject scores out of seven at the Madhyamik examination two years ago along with Class XI annual theory exam and Class XII practical/project marks. Madhyamik result will be decided on the basis of a student’s score in Class IX term exam and internal formative assessment in Class X, with equal weightage to both. The formulae to compute the marks for the two board examinations that have been cancelled this year due to the pandemic were announced by the HS council and Madhyamik board on Friday. Students dissatisfied with the result can opt to sit for a pen-paper exam at a later date when the situation is conducive; they will be issued fresh mark sheets.  The results for HS and Madhyamik will be declared next month. Announcing the formula for HS 2021, WB Council Of Higher Secondary Education president Mahua Das said, “We will give 40% weightage to Madhyamik marks, 60% weightage to the Class XI annual theory exam scores and add the marks scored in practicals for science subjects or projects for non-lab subjects to arrive at the final result.” The WB Board Of Secondary Examination president Kalyanmoy Ganguly announced a simpler mechanism for computing the Madhyamik result. “Equal weightage will be given to the subject score in Class X terminal test in 2019 and the 2020 internal formative assessment,” he said. Schools will have to send the internal test marks to the HS council and Madhyamik board at the earliest to prevent the results being delayed. “I am requesting all schools to submit their class XI marks by June 23 so that we are able to compute the rest of the marks and declare the results in July,” Das said. The initial reaction from students and teachers to the formulae was positive. According to Jadavpur Vidyapith headmaster Parimal Bhattacharya, the formula adopted for Madhyamik is “scientific” and this is the best that could have been done in the current situation. “We have already submitted our Class XI marks to the council. However. I feel that in a situation like this, no merit list should be drawn up,” Bhattacharya added. “In a year like this, when health issues are of primary concern, holding public exams like Madhyamik and HS would have been impossible. So this is the best that could have been done,” said Sunita Sen, principal of Ballygunj Shiksha Sadan. Sanjana Gupta, a student of outgoing Class XII of the school said, “I would have personally liked to write the HS because that would have been a proper evaluation. A student’s Class XII performance is often better than Class XI. But given the pandemic situation, exams are not possible. So we will now have to do with the formula and wait for the mark sheet.” The state government had taken the opinion of a six-member expert committee comprising educationists, doctors and a child rights advocate on both cancellation of the board exams and ways to evaluate 8.5 lakh HS candidates and 12.5 lakh Madhyamik examinees. The CM had also sought the opinion of students, guardians and common public before asking the HS Council and Madhyamik Board to work out a fair formula that would not penalise students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hs-marks-to-factor-in-four-best-scores-in-madhyamik/articleshow/83653832.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Ranchi||Daily wagers, farmers forced to pay extra for travel as buses stay off road in Jharkhand||RANCHI: Even though the state government has begun the unlocking process to reboot business and trade, farmers, labourers and commoners are being forced to spend extra money on travel in search of livelihood or other essential work because of the continued ban on inter- and intra-state bus movement. While the number of Covid-19 cases is on the decline, the state government hasn’t allowed bus services to resume in order to prevent a spike in infection but scenes of overcrowded autos and trekkers have become a common sight at major transit points with the gradual unlocking of other sectors. Many who commute to Ranchi from the outskirts or neighbouring districts daily to sell their farm and dairy produce complained that autos and other vehicles were overcharging them. Forty-five-year old Ganjhu Ram, a labourer from Tamar, rued that he is forced to spend at least Rs 200 a day to come to Ranchi in search of work. Ram, along with scores of other labourers, reaches Lalpur Chowk as early as 6am hoping to get picked by mahajans (clients) who employ them on per-day wage basis. Talking to TOI on Wednesday, Ram said that he hasn’t got work since the last couple of days. “Earlier, I was never out of work but now I hardly manage to get four days of work,” said Ram, who last week worked at a construction site but hasn’t got work since Monday. Ram added, “With no buses, I have to either cycle or hitch rides in autos or trekkers. Earlier, I used to spend Rs 70-80 for a two-way journey from Tamar but with no buses on roads I am forced to shell out anywhere between Rs 150-200 a day. This means, more than 50% of my daily earning is consumed in travelling.” Last week, the government allowed reopening of salon and beauty parlours after over a month of lockdown but Raju Gope, a salon worker, continues to remain unemployed. It is because he is stranded in Chatra due to non-availability of buses and is yet to join duty at a prominent parlour in Ranchi. “The parlour owner has been asking me to take private vehicle to come for work, but I have run out of my savings and can’t afford to spend Rs 4,000-5,000 to come to Ranchi. He is now threatening to fire me if I don’t report by this week,” he said. Jharkhand has about 8,000 buses for public transport and about 3,500 is used for school duty. Owing to successive lockdowns since March last year, bus owners on the other hand are equally reeling under massive financial stress. Kishore Mantri, the secretary of Ranchi Bus Owners Association and vicepresident of Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI), has pegged their current losses to about Rs 5 crore per day. “The situation of the bus sector has only turned from bad to worse during the pandemic. We have demanded that the state government allow resumption of buses with 50% capacity at least. When trains, commercial taxis, autos, flights can operate, why are buses not allowed? By banning buses, the government is indirectly posing problems to the poor who avail buses for their daily work,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/daily-wagers-farmers-forced-to-pay-extra-for-travel-as-buses-stay-off-road-in-jkhand/articleshow/83649099.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Kolkata||TMC slams BJP on north Bengal ‘unrest’, post-poll violence||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress on Friday lashed at BJP for trying to create unrest in north Bengal again and supporting separatist forces. Former Cooch Behar MP Partha Pratim Roy and Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray said soon after BJP demanded a separate entity for north Bengal, KLO chief Jibon Roy also sought separate statehood. “KLO chief Jibon Roy had released a video from his hidden den and this happened soon after BJP MPs and MLAs asked for a separate state or UT status for north Bengal. So, the KLO chief’s move is well-coordinated with BJP,” they said. Blaming BJP for trying to gain political mileage, Partha said: “The chief minister has made it clear that no attempt to separate Bengal will be tolerated. The trust on Trinamool is back in north Bengal as much of the lost ground had been regained,” he said, adding that the people of north Bengal were with Mamata Banerjee. Sukhendu demanded the immediate removal of Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar. Saying how the governor’s post was to act as a bridge between the Centre and the state and work as a facilitator, he added: “But unfortunately, the governor is working as a BJP mouthpiece from day one.” He feared that the governor might be hatching a plot while he was in Delhi. “In a federal structure, the governor’s role is devoid of any administrative power.” He also lashed out at the Centre for working in an autocratic manner and not hearing farmers’ demands. “Farmers will hold a nationwide agitation on June 26 and Trinamool would support them,” Sukhendu added. The MP also criticised the Centre for imposing cess and surcharge for garnering revenue which was not shared with the states. He said during the introduction of GST, the Centre had promised to share the losses of the states and Bengal was the worst sufferer. “The Governor and BJP are harping on post-poll violence. But there had been much pre-poll violence when the administration was under EC. Find out how many people were killed and injured in the pre-poll phase and how many deaths happened after Mamata Banerjee took over for the third time,” he said. “There is no law and order problem in Bengal. We condemn any kind of violence,” he added. Sukhendu said a complaint had been lodged against BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari for his involvement in the theft of tarpaulins and the matter was being probed by Contai police. Reacting to Adikari’s letter for cancellation of Mukul Roy’s membership under defection laws, he said the Speaker will take the final call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-slams-bjp-on-north-bengal-unrest-post-poll-violence/articleshow/83652684.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Probe each violence claim: Calcutta high court to NHRC||KOLKATA: The Calcutta High Court on Friday requested the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to set up a committee to examine all allegations of post-poll violence in Bengal, observing that the state hadn’t taken “concrete steps” to address the 3,243 complaints lodged till June 3. A five-judge bench, led by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal, put it on record that the state, from the very beginning, had been denying everything. “But the facts placed on record by the member secretary of the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority on June 3, are different,” the bench remarked. “In a case where the allegation is life and property in danger on account of post-poll violence, the state can’t be allowed to proceed in the manner it likes,” the court observed, taking note of the nature of the complaints. “It is the duty of the state to inspire confidence among residents.” The bench also directed the state government to provide logistics support to the NHRC committee and issued a stern warning: any obstructions might entail action under contempt of court, among other provisions. “The state shall ensure that there is no obstruction of any kind in this process,” the court held. The court also took exception to the procedure members of the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority (WBSLSA) followed to address the complaints. The bench, referring to the video conference the members held with the alleged victims, observed: “In our view that was not the idea. It was not a normal meeting. Rather, the officers were to see the ground realities and report to the court.” The bench said it wanted one representative each from the West Bengal State Human Rights Commission and the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority in the NHRC committee. The next date of hearing has been fixed on June 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/probe-each-violence-claim-hc-to-nhrc/articleshow/83653775.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: BJP holds dharnas at farms against ‘non-payment’ of minimum support price for paddy||RANCHI: The leaders, functionaries and office bearers of the Jharkhand unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday sat on dharnas in farms across the state to protest against the state government’s alleged delay in disbursing the payments of paddy procured from the farmers through the minimum support price (MSP) scheme. BJP’s state president Deepak Prakash, who is also a Rajya Sabha MP from the state, led the statewide from Sukurhuttu village in Kanke block on the outskirts of the state capital. Former chief minister Babulal Marandi, former education minister Neera Yadav, former sports minister Amar Kumar Bauri, sitting MLAs Navin Jaiswal, Raj Sinha, Kishun Kumar Das and others also sat in dharnas at their respective assembly constituencies. “The Hemant Soren government is doing injustice to the poor farmers of the state by withholding their payments. The farmers produced record paddy last year but the government refused to purchase it claiming that their paddy was soggy. Now, the farmers are being forced to sell their yield to middlemen,” Prakash said, demanding that the outstanding dues of the farmers be cleared at once. BJP’s claims were rubbished by Congress, whose minister Badal Patralekh currently holds the agriculture portfolio. “BJP’s dharna was a gimmick. In FY 2020-21, the state purchased 62.41 lakh tonne paddy from farmers, which is a record. Also Rs 568.50 crore has already been disbursed to the farmers while Rs 375 crore is yet to be released. For the remaining disbursements, the government has initiated the process for taking a loan of Rs 290 crore,” Jharkhand Congress spokesperson Alok Dubey said. Congress said Jharkhand government has waived off loans of 2.62 lakh farmers so far, which was promised in their 2019 assembly election manifesto. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha also came out all guns blazing against the BJP. “It is such an irony that on one hand BJP is ignoring the movement of the farmers against the new agrarian laws for over nine months and lending solidarity to farmers of Jharkhand by sitting on a dharna in their farms,” JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said. “In FY 2018-19, the BJP government had only purchased 53% of the 40 lakh tonne paddy it had targeted. There was anarchy in the system which was put in place by the erstwhile Raghubar Das government. Saryu Rai, then a minister in the cabinet, had flagged how tonnes of paddy were dumped in the open as farmers did not get their money,” Bhattacharya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-holds-dharnas-at-farms-against-non-payment-of-msp-for-paddy/articleshow/83649166.cms||Dhritiman Ray

He was later shifted to Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital. The CB-CID team probing the case also arrested Kelambakkam resident Sushmitha, an alumnus of the school who turned a devotee of Siva Sankar Baba, after inquiries revealed she had convinced some students into going to his bungalow. “Sushmitha was a college student when she brainwashed the school students into getting the Baba’s blessings,” said an officer. Sushmitha was later sent to jail. CB-CID superintendent of police C Vijayakumar and his team on Friday visited the bungalow where the alleged sexual offences were committed and seized computers, hard disks, a pen drive along with some CCTV camera footage. All of it was sent to the cybercrime wing for study. The Mamallapuram all women police, based on three complaints, on June 12 booked Siva Sankar Baba and the case was transferred to the CB-CID on June13. After it was found that the accused was in Dehradun, Uttarakhand on a pilgrimage, a team went there, but he managed to slip away from the hospital where he underwent an angioplasty. On Wednesday, he was nabbed at a lodge in Delhi’s Chittaranjan Park in Delhi and flown to Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-siva-sankar-baba-accused-of-sexual-abuse-hospitalised/articleshow/83656071.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Pandemic & petrol price rise deal double blow to poor, middle class||BENGALURU: With petrol price touching Rs 100/litre, poor and middle-class Bengalureans who are dependent on two-wheelers for commuting are likely to bear the brunt. The city is home to 1 crore vehicles, of which 66.7 lakh are two-wheelers (around 67%). Bengaluru has the second highest number of two-wheelers in India after New Delhi. Experts attribute the twowheeler count mainly to the poor and unreliable public transport system, which is also one of the costliest in India. Other reasons include Bengaluru’s notorious traffic, inadequate parking facilities, price and fuel efficiency (better than cars) and availability of vehicle loans. Two-wheelers are easily manoeuvrable in dense traffic. Oil industry sources say two-wheelers are the biggest consumers of petrol in the city, followed by cars. Bengaluru has over 20.8 lakh cars; no break-up of diesel and petrol variants is available. Apart from the poor and middle class, increase in petrol rates is likely to affect delivery boys as well, who are not in a financial position to shift to electric scooters because of the high initial investment. The state government has allowed industries to function with 50% staff and street vendors to do business from 6am to 2pm. However, it has not restarted BMTC and Metro services, forcing most workers to rely on private vehicles. BMTC carried around 25 lakh passengers a day and Namma Metro about 2 lakh before the lockdown was clamped on April 27. Traffic expert MN Srihari said: “Two-wheelers are the preferred mode of transport for the poor and middle class since they are cheaper, faster and fuel-efficient. These people are already facing hardships due to pandemic-induced job losses and salary cuts. The government should at least reduce taxes to provide them some relie. It should also complete the Metro project so that commuters can make the switch, provided it’s affordable.” Firms like Zomato, Swiggy, Dunzo, Rapido, Porter, Lynk, Pindrop, Amazon, Flipkart, Grofers, Jiomart, Licious and Big Basket employ thousands of delivery boys in the city. Vinay Sarathy, president, United Food Delivery Partners’ Union, said, “Soaring petrol prices will have a major impact on our livelihood. Food delivery companies have already reduced incentives so agents have to do more trips to earn a decent amount. If one earns Rs 500-Rs 600 on average for a 10-12 hour duty, Rs 200-Rs 250 will go towards petrol expenses. We also have to spend on food and won’t have anything left...” He said they cannot afford to buy an electric scooter, which is priced above Rs1lakh. Some agents are now using bicycles and rental e-scooters for short-distance deliveries. Harish S, marketing executive in a real-estate firm, said: “There has been no business after Covid. It’s difficult to meet our monthly targets. Earlier, I used to spend Rs 300 to tank up my scooter, but now I need more than Rs 400. The constant increase in fuel prices is affecting poor and middle-class people like us,” he rued. Shaik Salauddin, national general secretary, Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers, said: “The government has acknowledged delivery boys as essential workers during the lockdown. But skyrocketing fuel prices have upped operational costs though business has remained dull due to low demand.” Ravi Gadepalli, public transport expert, said: “The additional revenue collected from petrol sales should be invested in strengthening public transport, mainly buses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-pandemic-petrol-price-rise-deal-double-blow-to-poor-middle-class/articleshow/83656130.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Hyderabad||At 43%, Telangana men way ahead in tipple chase in India, finds NFHS survey||HYDERABAD: The hot and dry Deccan climate is no deterrent for tipplers in Telangana, as the latest National Family Health Survey–5 states that men in India’s youngest state drink more alcohol than their counterparts anywhere else in the country. Busting a popular myth that one can drink a lot in cooler climes, 43.3 per cent men above 15 years in Telangana drink alcohol compared to northeastern Sikkim, that stands at second place with 41.1 per cent drinkers. Contrary to another popular perception, the NFHS survey revealed that rural men of Telangana consume more liquor (49 per cent) than urban men (33.9 per cent). Also, compared to men, only a very limited 6.7 per cent women, aged above 15 years, consume liquor in the state. Socio-political analyst, Prof. K Nageswar, pointed out that traditionally liquor consumption is not a taboo in the state. Meat consumption in state highestThe socio, cultural, economic conditions in the state are such that liquor consumption across the sections is accepted,” he said. Interestingly, despite the high liquor consumption, gender violence is not very high in the state, in fact, it has reduced over the past years, shows the data. Industry experts say that there is also a link between liquor consumption and meat consumption “Meat consumption in Telangana is highest in the country. So both go hand in hand, and it’s not surprising that liquor consumption in the state is very high” said Kishan Peddapalli, founder of Asav Wines. However, there is a word of caution from doctors as Telangana too has its high share of liver and kidney diseases. “Moderation for men is 21 units of liquor per week. One unit of alcohol is half of pint of beer containing 3 to 4 per cent of alcohol by volume. A glass of wine is equivalent to one and half units per week. It’s always better to refrain from alcohol,” said Dr Apoorva Munigela, consultant internal medicine specialist with AIG Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/at-43-telangana-men-way-ahead-in-tipple-chase-in-india-finds-nfhs-survey/articleshow/83656133.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

But Kumar’s relief was short-lived. Although the state government credited the promised Rs 2,000 aid into his bank account, the bank promptly debited the sum towards a pending loan instalment. Kumar, 38 and a resident of Srirangapatna in Mandya district, had been provided a loan of Rs 10,000 by the Centre during the first wave, which he is still repaying. Kumar is among at least 95,000 vendors who continue to remain in distress despite the state government’s relief package announced during the lockdown recently. The one-time aid provided by the Karnataka government has been debited by banks towards various loans, including central government aid schemes. Kumar, who ran a fastfood shop in Srirangapatna, said that during last year’s lockdown, his earnings were nil and under the Prime Minister Street Vendors Atma Nirbhar Nidhi scheme, he was provided a loan of Rs 10,000. “Post the lockdown, I restarted my business and repaid six monthly instalments of Rs 1,000 each to the bank,” he said. But the second wave of Covid-19 infections and subsequent restrictions hit Kumar, who has been in the business for eight years, really hard. “I earned about Rs 15,000 every month before the pandemic struck and about Rs 10,000 went to house rent, groceries and other expenses. Whatever little savings I had was also exhausted to make ends meet during the lockdowns. I don’t know what the fate of my family will be even after 10 days,” he said. Kumar’s wife is a homemaker and 14-year-old son is a class 9 student. Same-day deduction:Kumar said he received an SMS alert when the state government credited Rs 2,000 into his bank account. But when he went to withdraw the money, he realised that it had been debited. “I checked with the bank and they told me that it has been debited towards the loan I had availed under PM SVANidhi Scheme,” Kumar said. Anzar Pasha, 52, a resident of Padarayanapura in Bengaluru, sold clothes on pavements in Gandhinagar and had not availed any loan under any Central scheme during the lockdown last year. But he had borrowed Rs 50,000 from the bank and was repaying Rs 1,500 every month until the lockdown was imposed. “I received the state government’s aid, but it was deducted the same day towards the loan I had availed. I am surviving on ration kits provided by volunteers and donors,” Pasha said. The Federation of Karnataka Street Vendors Association said there are more than five lakh street vendors in the state but only 2.2 lakh are registered with the association. The government has released the one-time payment of Rs 2,000 to about 1.9 lakh vendors. At least 95,000 have availed loans under central government schemes or from banks during the nationwide lockdown. ES Rangaswamy, president of the association, said the state government disbursed the relief under the department of skill development, entrepreneurship and livelihood. “After several beneficiaries said banks had deducted the cash towards repayment of various loans, we approached the chief minister and apprised him of the problem. He too asked banks not to deduct the money as vendors are in great financial distress. However, it was of no use as banks say that the deduction towards loans happens automatically once money is credited into the accounts,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-government-grants-aid-banks-deduct-it-for-loans-taken/articleshow/83656162.cms||Kiran Parashar

The state government has alerted district magistrates, asking them to take precautionary measures. In East Burdwan, the administration has sounded an alarm in Ausgram block II. The Sitkari barrage has released 60,000 cusecs of water and that may inundate areas along Ajay river. Plans are afoot to evacuate people in some areas under Ramnagar gram panchayat. Several areas in Asansol and Durgapur are already underwater since the recent downpour raised the level of Garui river. A 22-year-old engineering student, Iftiqar Alam, was swept away in Railpar around Friday noon. He is yet to be traced. A family of nine was rescued by a civil defence team from the same area. Several other families have been provided shelter in three schools. In Chittaranjan, local residents demonstrated against waterlogging and potholed roads. In Jamuria’s Chichuria, several agricultural fields have been flooded. Parts of Raniganj and Durgapur are waterlogged too. ADM (General), West Burdwan, Abhijit Shevale said two children and a family were rescued from flooded areas by civil defence personnel. DVC’s chief engineer Satyabrata Banerjee said Maithon dam had started releasing 8,500 cusecs of water, which was “its normal output”, while Panchet had released 14,000 cusecs since Thursday night, which is also “normal”. Officials in East Burdwan said the Durgapur barrage released 39,000 cusecs. Following heavy rain, Ghatal in West Mindapore is flooded. Two wooden bridges were damaged as the water level of Jhumi river rose, said Ghatal SDO Souvik Chatterjee. On the other hand, the level of Subernarekha may increase as Galuri barrage has released 18,000 cusecs of water. People living on riverbanks in Gopiballavpur, Sankrial and Nayagram have been alerted. The Hooghly district administration, meanwhile, is using drones to survey Arambagh. Khanakul and Goghat are also under threat. The Darakeswar river has already inundated some areas in Khankul and Bankura town. Bankura DM Radhika Aiyar said people of Joypur and Kotalpur had been alerted. Lightning kills 50-yr-old in Salboni A 50-year-old man, Tuklal Deb Singha, was killed when lightning struck Madhupur in Salboni on Friday afternoon. He was returning home from the field with cattle.

East zone (251) and Mahadevapura (244) together accounted for more than half of such deaths, while Bommanahalli had the least number at 8. Dasarahalli (38), Yelahanka (70), South zone (73), West zone (107) and RR Nagar 119 were all bunched in between. A member of the state’s Covid-19 task force said home isolation deaths are not limited to Bengaluru alone, and have been a matter of concern in other places too. A task force member said of the deaths: “They are the real victims, whose lives perhaps could have been saved if there was early medical intervention. Initial lack of symptoms or mild symptoms may have misled these patients. When their symptoms worsened, they may not have been able to get a hospital bed.” Lack of selfmonitoring through pulse oximeter readings, which helps detect low oxygen saturation levels, could also be one reason, experts say. One such case was of a 35-year-old man from Jayanagar, who died on April 20 after an extensive search – in vain – for a bed in a private hospital. The man developed acute breathing problems and had even visited a nearby BBMP primary health centre seeking care. He went back home back as no help was available and died later. Deaths in home isolation came to light when BBMP health staff called families to check on patients in home isolation. “BBMP has proactively called patients in home isolation even after Day 10 to check if there were any cases of home isolation deaths,” an official said. “That’s how several such cases came to the notice of authorities. We are not sure if other districts and metros have followed the same system. This finding has helped families claim insurance benefits for Covid-19-related deaths.” However, the official admitted there were lakhs of cases in late April and May, and the health of many infected people deteriorated due to lack of hospital beds. Incidentally, Covidpositive people in rural areas are not allowed home isolation. The rule was imposed to prevent both mortality and further spread of infection among family members of patients. In Bengaluru too, several infected people were in home isolation without even being seen by a doctor, a BBMP official admitted. “Much later during the second wave, we began triaging all Covid infected people soon after they tested positive. Some were allowed to stay in home isolation, while others were sent to Covid Care Centres or taken directly to hospitals based on clinical examinations,” the BBMP official said. But many patients claimed they were under supervision of their family doctors in home isolation and managed to evade BBMP monitoring, he said, adding the civic body did indeed provide medical kits to thousands of patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/second-wave-910-died-in-home-isolation-in-bengaluru-in-107-days/articleshow/83656183.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Managements claim the state government is not allowing manufacturers to supply oxygen to industries despite a sharp decline in demand for liquid medical oxygen (LMO) in the wake of a receding second wave. The state says it is continuing with curbs as it wants to ensure supply of LMO for Covid care. “We requested the government to increase the quota of industrial oxygen supply from 18% of production to at least 35%. The government is yet to respond,” said Satish Chandra Kesaeri, executive director, Bhuruka Gases Limited. In May, all eight manufacturers (two units of Linde Bellary shown separately in table) in Karnataka were ordered to produce only LMO to meet requirements of Covid care. With the wave abating, the Centre eased curbs on June 8 and the state allowed manufacturers to partially supply to industries. However, this came with the rider that they dedicate 50% of storage capacity to LMO supply. For instance, Bhuruka which produces 65 tonnes daily — 95% of which normally goes for industrial use — was allowed to supply only 18% to industries as it had to maintain stock of more than 50% of its storage capacity of 160 tonnes for LMO. Similarly, Universal Air Products, which produces 45 tonnes and Inox Bellary, with a production capacity of 50 tonnes, were allowed 22% and 16% respectively. No other manufacturers including JSW Gases Ltd (130 tonnes) were allowed to supply oxygen to industries as they could not ensure mandated stock of LMO. This has resulted in industries gasping for oxygen given that they are getting only 15% of their daily requirement of 200 tonnes. “We don’t understand why the government is stopping supply to industries when there is no demand for LMO. It should look for judicious use that helps both pandemic management and industry revival,” said Prakash C, president, Peenya Industrial Area Association. He pointed out that LMO consumption has fallen from 1,700 tonnes in mid-May to 473 tonnes on June 17 and only 16,726 of 49,100 oxygenated beds are occupied across Karnataka. In Bengaluru, 657 out of 4,913 HDU beds are occupied. The state government, however, says it is only being cautious. “As demand for LMO reduces, many industrialists have requested a substantial amount of oxygen be dedicated for industrial purposes. However, the govern ment is of the view that it is too early to lift restrictions given the high positivity rate in some districts.” health minister K Sudhakar said. A fallout of this is a thriving black market for the scarce resource. Vinod Nowal, deputy managing director, JSW Industrial Gases, points out: “We know some people are selling LMO at Rs 45 per kg after buying it from us at Rs 10. On record, they buy for Covid purposes but sell it to industries,” he said. He said his company, with a storage capacity of 1,000 tonnes, could not maintain the minimum stock of LMO since two oxygen plants, which had broken down, have just been operational. He said it takes at least a month to attain the required stock level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/industries-gasp-for-oxygen-as-karnataka-government-limits-production/articleshow/83656195.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
