Interestingly, Arun has been contracted by the Prime Minister's office (PMO) to complete the statue. Arun says, “It’s rare opportunity to be able to sculpt someone as revered as Adi Shankaracharya. Before I was selected By the PMO to make the statue, sculptors from across the country were asked to send models. I was selected me in September last year and have been working on the final version since then, with Chlorite Schist stone, the kind that has been used in the Belur and Halebidu temples and are known to withstand the vagaries of rain and sunshine."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mysurus-arun-yogiraj-is-working-on-an-adi-shankaracharya-statue/articleshow/83279405.cms||Vinay Lokesh

The initial lot of IBGs, each with around 5,000 soldiers and a varying mix of infantry, tanks, artillery, air defence, signals, engineers and other units permanently deployed together, should be carved out of existing formations by early-2022, say officers. Army chief General M M Naravane, in turn, told TOI: “Creation of IBGs is a logical step towards our operational thought process on how to conduct future operations in an integrated all-arms paradigm.” Read AlsoArmy chief expresses hope military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh will be resolved through negotiationsArmy chief General M M Naravane on Monday expressed hope that India and China will “settle” the continuing military confrontation in eastern Ladakh through negotiations. "Legacy issues, differences need to be resolved through mutual consent..not by unilateral actions,” he said speaking at an online“The process of `IBG-isation’ is well underway and in-house deliberations are being carried out to evolve force structures proficient in fighting and winning future wars,” he added. The creation of IBGs and theatre commands as well as the ongoing organizational restructuring of the 13-lakh Army are all geared towards acquiring a greater offensive punch and addressing the two-front challenge posed by China and Pakistan. “The changing character of warfare, RMA (revolution in military affairs) and the extant/future threats to our active borders emphasize the requirement for faster application of forces. Technological advancements also necessitate a change in the concept of war-fighting and organizational structures,” said Gen Naravane. The continuing stand-off with China in eastern Ladakh, which first erupted in April-May last year, has already led the Army to rebalance forces and firepower towards the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) as the primary front from the decades-long focus on Pakistan.

Gen Naravane, who arrived in Dhaka on Thursday morning, held extensive discussions with top officers of theThis recalibration includes the change in the operational role of the 1 Corps towards the northern sector with China, including Ladakh, from the earlier focus on Pakistan. The truncated 17 Corps, in turn, will have a strike role in the eastern sector, including the Chumbi Valley opposite Sikkim, as was earlier reported by TOI. “But the 1 Corps will also retain operational flexibility to deploy against Pakistan at short-notice. So, with an adequate number of acclimatized troops, the corps will be available for both China and Pakistan. This will be in addition to the Leh-based 14 Corps,” said an officer. Overall, the Army has 14 corps (40,000 to 70,000 troops in each), with four of them being `strike’ or offensive formations. Apart from 1 Corps (headquarters in Mathura) and 17 Corps (Panagarh), the two Pakistan-specific ones are 2 Corps (Ambala) and 21 Corps (Bhopal). As for the composite IBGs, already war-gamed in exercises, the Army plans to first carve out 8-10 of them from the 9 Corps (Yol), 17 Corps (Panagarh) and 33 Corps (Sukna). To be commanded by Major-Generals, IBGs will be larger than brigades (3,000 soldiers each) but smaller than divisions (12,000 soldiers each). “After the initial 8-10 IBGs have settled down, more will be created over the years. Different IBGs will be configured differently as per the threat, the type of terrain involved and the task to be achieved,” said another officer. So, IBGs meant for Pakistan will be focused more on tanks and heavy artillery due to the plains involved, while the ones for China will revolve more around infantry and light artillery for mountain warfare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-to-set-up-new-battle-groups-for-offensive-punch-by-next-year/articleshow/83290857.cms||Rajat Pandit

The RERA enacted five years back covered both new projects and all others that were under construction, also known as “ongoing” projects. President of Forum for People’s Collective Efforts (FPCE) Abhay Upadhyay said, “Not even 10% of the ongoing projects which were covered under the law have been completed even after five years of the law being implemented. The RERA aimed at bringing relief to those whose money was stuck in ongoing projects.” FPCE, an umbrella body of homebuyers recently won a case against the West Bengal government which had notified its real estate law, HIRA, in contravention of the Central Act. The Supreme Court had termed the West Bengal law unconstitutional. “The government should also bring out a whitepaper on how many projects launched after the RERA came into existence have been completed within the given timeline. What is the average time of delay in the completion of such projects? Getting extension for completion of the project is not the birthright of builders,” Upadhyay said while addressing a virtual conference on the five years of RERA. He also raised questions about the RERA authorities toying with new ideas, which are out of the legal framework of the law, rather than focus on bringing relief to homebuyers. Upadhyay said, “It’s good progress so far as registration of 65,000 projects and disposal of 64,000 cases are concerned. But now there is a need to do more to bring relief to homebuyers, which is enshrined in the law,” Upadhyay said. He alleged that the government authorities get “out of box ideas” when it comes to providing relief or comfort to the builders. The organisation said they had opposed the housing ministry’s move last year to extend timelines for ongoing projects due to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rera-has-not-helped-customers-in-stuck-projects-even-after-5-years-homebuyers-organisation/articleshow/83290971.cms||Dipak K Dash

The Centre has sanctioned the construction of 14,460 individual and community bunkers for the border residents in the five districts of Jammu, Kathua and Samba covering the villages located along the IB and Poonch and Rajouri villages on the LoC. Later, the government sanctioned over 4,000 additional bunkers to cover a more vulnerable population. “A total of 7,923 bunkers, including 6,964 individual and 959 community bunkers, have been completed so far in (Jammu) division,” an official spokesman said, as Jammu divisional commissioner Raghav Langer reviewed the progress on the construction of the safety structures at a meeting here. He was informed that the construction of 9,905 other pending bunkers are also under execution and are at different stages of completion. Taking strong note of the delay in tendering for the pending bunkers, Langer directed concerned executive engineers to complete the process fast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/8000-bunkers-built-along-border/articleshow/83291772.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The vehicles can use the road from 10am to 4pm only. The Kishtwar-Sinthan road, connecting Kishtwar in Jammu region with Kashmir’s Anantnag, goes through Sinthan pass (3,800 mts above sea-level) and reduces distance for people who otherwise have to go via Jammu to reach Kashmir. Kishtwar ADC will issue permits for travelling on the road only on the recommendation of the district CMO. The official order read: “SSP Kishtwar shall establish proper checkpoints for inspection of the travel movement through the said route at appropriate points and SDM Chatroo to deploy a magistrate for a compulsory sampling of travelers.” The Sinthan Top and adjoining areas attract heavy snowfall during winter as a result of which the road annually remains closed for five to six months from December.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kishtwar-sinthan-road-in-jk-opened-for-medical-emergencies/articleshow/83291801.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The Indian high commission said it was "extremely concerned and distressed" by what happened and vowed it would take action against those who desecrated the Tricolour. Midway through the rally that converged on Trafalgar Square, a man in black with a scarf covering his face threw a large Tricolour on the ground and nonchalantly set it alight with a lighter. He then used a spray so that the flames ran high. Once it was reduced to ashes, he got another flag burnt it as some of the bystanders shouted "Khalistan Zindabad". Two police officers came over once both flags were gutted, and the culprit poured some water from a bottle over whatever remained of them. One of the cops picked up the remnants of the flags and left. A spokesman for Metropolitan Police said he wasn't "specifically aware of any flag being burnt" and that nobody had been arrested. The officer pointed out that setting flags alight was, in any case, not a criminal offence in Britain. Five Khalsa Sikhs dressed in traditional attire, and with their swords drawn, had led the march of hundreds from Wellington Arch to Trafalgar Square. Khalistan T shirts and sweaters were on sale for £10 (Rs 1,000) and £20 (Rs 2,000) each at the venue. Large banners celebrated Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the central figure of the armed Khalistan movement that had led to the June 1984 Army operation at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. "It is important the next generation knows about this," said a Sikh woman selling sweaters. Some of those marching carried yellow Khalistan flags and a few wore "Punjab Referendum 2020" T-shirts. Those that TOI spoke to said they were not just protesting Operation Blue Star, but also the continued detention of Scottish Sikh Jagtar Singh Johal in India, as well as the extradition request for three other British Sikh men in connection with conspiracy-to-murder charges. A spokesperson for the Indian high commission told TOI: "We have taken note of the people who were there trying to desecrate the flag and we will take action. We were also surprised to see that the LTTE (Tamil Tigers) were present. The numbers who turned up were far less than in previous years, which demonstrates that they are failing to muster enough support for Khalistan, besides the continual failure of the whole movement." Jay Singh, a 39-year-old from London at the rally, said, "Burning a flag is a minor thing compared to the people who have died at the farmers’ protests...We all have family and land back in India and they don’t have equal rights. Everyone here has family who has been picked up or gone missing in Punjab. We just want equal rights. Burning the flag is people’s emotions coming out against the establishment." Dawinderpal Singh of the Sikh Press Association, dressed in Nihang attire, said, "1984 was about the oppression of Sikhs and Sikhs continue to be treated as second class citizens and so 37 years later we still have an uphill battle against the Indian government. If you look at Bhindranwale’s speeches it was all about being able to speak Punjabi in Punjab and grow the crops we want and what he said is still relevant today."

As the number of cases dipped and restrictions eased, people started venturing out again. However, the unchecked ‘revenge socialising’ after months of caution resulted in a deadly second wave. Starting in the second half of March, the surge in COVID cases and deaths caught the country off-guard. Now, after several weeks of restrictions, the number of cases are slowly going down in NCR, but the battle against COVID is far from over. Despite that, many people are repeating the same mistake that led to the second wave. Even though NCR is still in under lockdown, many people are organising secret farmhouse gatherings, house parties etc. Recently, one such gathering was raided in Noida and 15 people were arrested for violating COVID norms. <p>15 people detained from Noida house party</p><p><br></p>Whether you’re fully vaccinated, tired of staying at home or missing friends – no reason is valid for organising or participating in a get-together, say experts. As per current rules, it is also illegal. Even when restrictions are eased, public gatherings are not advisable: DoctorsDoctors say even after lockdown and restrictions ease, it is not the time to party. Dr Vikas Maurya, Director and Head of Department, Pulmonology, Fortis Hospital Shalimar Bagh, says, “We need to continue staying vigilant and not plan gatherings. We should only go out if completely unavoidable, and when doing so, wear a mask, shield, and carry a sanitiser. We should continue to follow all COVID appropriate behaviour. We cannot let our guard down. We need to stay cautious for the next two to three months, and get vaccinated as soon as the opportunity presents itself.” Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, says, “Everyone needs to understand that COVID-19 will not just disappear once the number of cases start dropping. Even when the government eases lockdown, stepping out is not advisable. Wearing a mask in public, avoiding gatherings and adapting to COVID appropriate behaviour, should be the new normal for at least another year, till the majority of our population is vaccinated. This also applies to people who have been vaccinated, because even if they are less likely to get the virus they can still be potential carriers, and consequently spreaders, of the virus. The severe second wave should be taken as a lesson of what can happen if we do not take this virus seriously.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dont-indulge-in-parties-yet-take-deadly-second-wave-as-lesson/articleshow/83285660.cms||Niharika Lal
---||India||Covid cases falling twice as fast in north India than in south India and Maharashtra||NEW DELHI: As the second wave of Covid-19 continues to recede in all states of the country, a curious north-south divide has emerged in the falling trends. In most states of northern India, cases have been declining in double quick time, literally, as compared with Maharashtra and the southern states. Since hitting its peak on May 9, the seven-day rolling average of daily cases in Haryana has declined at an average rate of 8.9% each day (till June 3), the sharpest among 18 major states that TOI looked at. The decline has been almost as dramatic in Rajasthan (8.5%), Delhi (8.2%), Bihar (8.1%), Uttar Pradesh (7.8%) and Uttarakhand (7.6%). In Maharashtra and across the south, the fall has been much more gradual, ranging from 2.7% in Tamil Nadu to 4.2% in Andhra Pradesh. This means that in most states of north India, cases have been falling at more than twice the rate of decline seen in the south and Maharashtra. For each state, the rate of fall was calculated from the time the seven-day average of daily cases hit its peak. Nationally, cases have fallen at a daily average of 3.7% since hitting a peak on May 8. The difference between the rates of decline in north and south India is too stark for it to be just a statistical quirk. Experts pointed to the leakier Covid reporting systems in the north as one possible reason for the divide. “One needs to ask, how good are the reporting systems in the states showing a sharp fall in cases,” virologist Gagandeep Kang told TOI when asked for possible factors behind the north-south divergence. “Certainly, the states that have a relatively better healthcare system, like those in the south, are expected to have good reporting,” she added. Kang also pointed to two other factors, some or all of which could have a role in explaining the difference. “It is possible that different variants of the virus could be in circulation in different regions. Also, prior exposure to the virus that would determine the seropositivity among different populations needs to be looked at,” the expert said. The difference in the rates of decline in cases can be understood better by looking at two states with comparable sizes and dates of reaching the peak — Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. The second wave ravaged both states with Maharashtra touching a high of 65,447 cases (seven-day average) on April 24. UP reached its peak around the same time, 35,010, on April 27. Yet, Maharashtra reported an average of just over 17,000 cases on June 3 while the corresponding number in UP had dropped to 1,742. The daily rate of fall in the northern state, at -7.8%, was twice as sharp as the rate seen in Maharashtra (-3.3%). As a result of this general trend, the relative share of Maharashtra and the southern states put together in the daily national count has risen to over 70%, from less than 50% at the peak of the second wave in the country. States in east India have shown a relatively low rate of decline. Daily cases have been falling at 3.4% in Bengal and by 4.1% in Odisha.

---||India||Government still seeking middle path on vaccine indemnity demand||NEW DELHI: The indemnity demand put forward by multinational vaccine makers has seen them call for disputes being resolved overseas, prompting the government to tread cautiously on the issue as the two sides try and reach a middle ground. The Centre is engaging with multinational pharma majors such as Pfizer and Moderna for sourcing Covid-19 vaccines but is also weighing the commitments it undertakes as part of the deal since it may have longer-term implications. The view in government is that while vaccines are needed in the near term, India's domestic supplies will be comfortable from August. The indemnity will not just impact domestic rules but also set a precedent for the future with other drug-makers also expected to seek similar facility for life-saving medicines. In addition, this could be demanded for other purchases too. The demand for an overseas jurisdiction for resolving disputes in particular has seen the Centre consider the consequences. Sources told TOI the government will have to offer the same benefits to domestic manufacturers such as Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech with the former having already stated its demand publicly. “The government is engaging with the companies with an open mind and is keen to resolve it at the earliest,” a source said, emphasising that the government is hopeful of negotiating its way past the insistence of Pfizer and Moderna for indemnity for action for their Covid-19 vaccines and exemption from possible local trials. The delicate tightrope walk, where the government is seeking to source the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna while, at the same time, fending off their tough demands, is part of the elaborate effort to boost supplies. The government has relaxed several norms in its bid to boost vaccine availability. The result is already evident as improved production by Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech goes on stream. The impact of higher production will not be felt immediately as the entire process takes time. For instance, it takes 45 days for a company such as Bharat Biotech to produce the vaccine from the time the process starts. After that, each batch of vaccine is tested at a facility at Central Drug Laboratory, Kasauli in Himachal Pradesh, before going into the distribution network comprising dispatches to states and then to hospitals and dispensaries. Ramping up production capacity at their own facilities as well as in tie-ups entails tying up almost 200 inputs and raw material: an arduous enterprise made even tougher because of the scramble for vaccines. The government has helped, with PM Narendra Modi and the foreign minister making a strong persuasive pitch to the Biden administration for lifting the curbs on raw material and components which go into the manufacture of vaccines. A big breakthrough was achieved on Saturday when the Biden administration took the components out of the purview of the Defence Procurement Act that prohibited American manufacturers from exporting without approval of the authorities there. The relaxation of curbs will especially help Serum Institute, which is more dependent on US supplies than Bharat Biotech, which sources its needs from Europe and some Asian countries. In addition, some of the states where production facilities are located had their own issues to be resolved, which has resulted in the process getting longer. But with the critical problems having been largely resolved, the government expects supply to improve considerably in the coming months. The supply of Moderna, Pfizer and Sputnik V will supplement the efforts, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-still-seeking-middle-path-on-vaccine-indemnity-demand/articleshow/83293261.cms||Sidhartha

Interestingly, the Oxford vaccine Covishield could generate antibodies in more individuals compared to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, a pre-print of the first such Indian study has stated. Most vaccine efficacy studies so far have been lab-based. The pan-India study of 515 vaccinated healthcare workers — 425 with Covishield and 90 with Covaxin — from 13 states and 22 cities found the vaccines could generate an immune response in 95% recipients 21-36 days after the second dose.  Seropositivity was observed in 98% of those immunised with Covishield as opposed to 80% Covaxin recipients, a finding the researchers called “surprising”.  Even the anti-spike antibody titre was found to be significantly higher in Covishield recipients (115 AU/ml) compared to Covaxin (51 AU/ml). While factors such as gender, BMI and other comorbidities didn’t seem to play much of a role, the seropositivity rate or antibodies in people above 60 years or those with type 2 diabetes was found to be significantly lower. Read Also‘High immune response in 95% health workers who took the jab’A ‘real-world’ study of vaccinated healthcare workers has found Covishield and Covaxin could produce a high immune response in up to 95% recipients and prevent serious disease in those infected after immunisation. Seropositivity rate was significantly more in participants with age less than 60 years (96.3% seropositivity) as against 87.2% in the 60-plus bracket. Infection post vaccination was seen in 5% of the study group, but none suffered from severe Covid-19. Lead author and endocrinologist Dr Awadhesh Kumar Singh of G D Hospital & Diabetes Institute, Kolkata, said the study was not to comment on which one is a better vaccine, but to look at the real-world effectiveness of vaccination.

Results of the Cross-sectional Coronavirus Vaccine-induced Antibody Titre (COVAT) study were published in pre-print server MedRxiv on June 4. “In individuals who have had Covid infection, both vaccines are equally good and could produce high antibodies even after a single shot. But for those who haven’t got Covid, Covishield could provide an edge,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/good-immune-response-from-covishield-covaxin-study/articleshow/83293611.cms||Sumitra Debroy

We should not be stuck in past misunderstandings but move forward looking at the future. We have to pursue a positive relationship,” he said in an interview to BBC. He was been quoted in the interview as saying that Nepal and India enjoyed a unique relationship. “Neighbours share both love and problems. Don’t people in Chile or Argentina have a problem?” he was quoted as saying by the local media. “I would like to make a request to PM Modi. In view of these times and our friendly relations, India should extend full cooperation to Nepal. That doesn’t mean I haven’t got help from India. At this time, Nepal needs vaccinations, for which Nepal is urging both its neighbours and all countries,” Oli was quoted as saying. “Whoever provides us vaccines, be it India, China, the United States or the UK, it is fine to receive vaccines. It is not necessary to politicise it and we thank both our neighbours very much. On one hand, China has given us 1.8 million vaccines and on the other, India has given 2.1 million vaccines. We have the help of both. We are also getting medical equipment from both. So thank you both,” he added. In a surprise move, Oli reshuffled his cabinet over the weekend and dropped deputy prime minister Ishwar Pokharel and foreign minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali. He now has three deputy prime ministers — Rajendra Mahato of JSP-N, Raghuvir Mahaseth and Bishnu Prasad Paudel from CPN-UML. Mahaseth is the new foreign minister. Oli inducted eight ministers and two state ministers from the Mahanta Thakur-Rajendra Mahato faction of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal, which has supported him.

The probe has been ordered under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966, after objections were raised over the inclusion of a sub-divisional officer (Dapoli), Sharad Pawar, in the first inquiry committee; the two-member panel was headed by Ratnagiri’s zilla parishad CEO. Records in possession with TOI show that Parab sold a little over an acre of the sea-facing Sai Resort at Murud village, Dapoli taluka, to Kandivli resident Sadanad Kadam for Rs 1.1 crore. The three-acre resort is allegedly illegal. Parab told TOI, “I have sold my property in Murud village.” He declined to comment on allegations, levelled by, among others, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya. “It’s between them (the complainants and the plot’s owner),” said Parab. The Ratnagiri collector ordered the fresh inquiry on Friday under section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code on a complaint from Prasad Karve, an aide of late Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray. The collector had formed the previous committee on May 25 to inquire into allegations of illegalities and violations that included those pertaining to land transaction, non-agricultural land permission, construction of a road to the resort, violation of CRZ rules, and house tax. Of the property in question, Parab sold 4,250 sq m (1.05 acres) out of about 12,600 sq m to Kadam on December 29, 2020. “Parab had purchased the land from Vibhas Sathe on May 2, 2017. Sathe had illegally obtained the non-agricultural land with permission for a ground-plus-one building from the SDO, Dapoli. But, Parab constructed three buildings, of which two are ground-plus-two,” alleged Somaiya. “Parab violated land transaction rules, non-agricultural (NA) land permission, construction of buildings and road rules, CRZ rules, house tax rules, and resorted to forgery for the resort in collusion with the SDO, revenue staffers and others. I had objected to SDO Dapoli Sharad Pawar’s inclusion in the inquiry committee as he had passed the non agricultural (NA) order with ground-plus-one permission and had complained about it to Dapoli police,” added Somaiya. “I have demanded cancellation of the NA permission and demolition of the illegal structures in Aaple Sarkar portal,” said Karve. The two-member committee comprising the zilla parishad CEO and SDO Dapoli was looking into Somaiya’s complaint. Karve’s complaint will be probed under the new inquiry. This has been learnt from separate letters (in TOI’s possession) written to the complainants by Sanjay Shinde, additional collector, Ratnagiri. Shinde did not respond to calls and text for comment. “The zilla parishad has jurisdiction over the assessment of all properties. SDO is the (land) permission granting authority. A report has been sought on the allegations,” said Dr Indurani Jakhar, CEO, Ratnagiri zilla parishad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uddhav-government-orders-fresh-probe-into-mantris-coastal-resort-deals/articleshow/83294793.cms||Umesh K Parida

His elder brother Bacchha Pandey is an RJD legislator from Barharia in Siwan,” Yadav said. The MLA’s statement came soon after he met Shahabuddin’s son Oshama Sahab and wife Heena Sahab at Pratappur, the ancestral village of the former MP. On Thursday, Pandey had also called on Shahabuddin’s family members at Pratappur. “It was just a courtesy call. I have been closely associated with late Shahabuddin’s family for long. I had not met them ever since they returned from Delhi after the death of the former MP due to Covid,” Pandey told this newspaper on Sunday. On his suspension from BJP, he said, “I will explain the reasons for my statement against the CM to the senior leaders of the party as well as the members of the party’s disciplinary committee at an appropriate time. I am still stick to my comments.” Though Pandey had turned down the possibility of him switching sides in near future, sources close to the lawmaker said he would join the RJD soon. His term in the state legislative council is scheduled to expire on July 16. BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said, “The disciplinary committee of the party has already initiated action against the MLC. Now, the issue should not be blown out of proportion.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-to-welcome-suspended-bjp-mlc-if-he-wishes-to-join-party/articleshow/83289399.cms||Ramashankar

They carried out extensive checking drive in several areas after receiving reports that the owners of a few grocery stores and other shops had partially opened the shutters of their shops and were operating against the weekend lockdown norms. The areas where the checking drive was carried out included Alopibagh, Cantt, Ashok Nagar, Chowk, Mumfordganj, Shivkuti, Rajapur, Sulemsarai, Ghantaghar, Mutthiganj, Kydganj and adjoining areas. Meanwhile, most of the streets in the city wore a deserted look on Sunday owing to the weekend lockdown clamped to contain the spread of Covid-19.

---||Allahabad||744 samples collected during 3-day sero survey||Prayagraj: Under the three-day Covid-19 sero prevalence survey conducted in 31 spots, including 30 villages and an urban site of Prayagraj district, teams of health department on Sunday claimed to have collected 744 samples. The sero prevalence survey began on Friday. In this survey, blood samples are collected and then lab tests are conducted on them to find the presence of antibodies against coronavirus in humans. The survey was termed crucial in finding out whether and to what extent immunity against the deadly virus is developing in the population. Nodal officer (sero survey) and additional chief medical offer Dr A K Tiwari told TOI that the medical teams collected a total of 744 samples during the three-day campaign. He added that samples of 42 people who tested Covid positive either in the first or second wave would be collected on Monday for testing. Names of these 42 persons have been sent by the state health authorities to the districts concerned for sample collection. Dr Tiwari, meanwhile, said that a total of 24 samples were collected from each village and cantonment area for testing. Samples of six persons, including two men and two women (aged above 45 years) and two children (from five to 18 years of age), were collected under random sampling process, he added. Health teams have collected four sets from each village (samples of six members from each of the four families) for testing. Samples were collected from villages falling under Shankargarh, Dhanupur, Handia, Koraon, Manda, Meja, Urwa, Bahadurpur, Pratappur, Phulpur, Kaurihar, Mauaima, Soraon, Bara and Cantt (Prayagraj urban). Officials said that a similar survey was carried out in 11 districts of the state in September last year, and the districts covered included Kanpur, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Agra, Prayagraj, Kaushambi, Baghpat, Moradabad, Ghaziabad, Lucknow and Meerut. The exercise conducted by KGMU (Lucknow) found out that one in five persons in the state had developed antibodies against coronavirus. In sero surveys, scientists and health experts will look for IGG against Covid to find out percentage of the population that has developed immunity against the deadly virus. Public health specialists also pointed out that since most of the cases are asymptomatic and hence liable to be missed by RT-PCR testing, seroprevalence surveys could play a significant role in the ongoing battle against the pandemic. The findings will help the state plan for the anticipated third wave as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/744-samples-collected-during-3-day-sero-survey/articleshow/83289831.cms||---

The department also vaccinated 90 people at a home for intellectual disability and an old-age home at Jamdoli on Saturday.“On Saturday, we vaccinated 40 women at an old-age home (run by Apna Ghar Ashram) and 24 people (45+) at a government intellectual disability home in Jamdoli. Apart from them, we also vaccinated around 25 caretakers of the intellectual disability home,” said Amitabh Kaushik, advisor (disability), Rajasthan government. “On Monday, we are planning to vaccinate around 100 persons affected with leprosy, residing in four leprosy homes, in Jaipur. We have also vaccinated 51 people at city colony mental hospital,” he added.Earlier, the social justice department had issued an order to all the district collectors to carry out vaccination, by setting up camps, of mentally challenged persons and those above 18 years, staying at various children homes across the state.Earlier, after state’s human rights commission took cognizance of the matter, the state’s health department had issued an order to vaccinate persons with disabilities (PwDs) above 18 years at the centres run by NGOs/private organisations, on registration of 100 or more disabled persons, by organising special vaccination camps. It also stated that the rest - an NGO/private organisation where less than 100 PwDs are registered - will be vaccinated at the nearest Covid vaccination centres by giving them special priority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/camps-set-up-to-vaccinate-inmates-at-beggar-homes/articleshow/83292010.cms||---
---||Business||Resolutions gather pace, but recoveries take time||MUMBAI: The insolvency process has resulted in the resolution of 363 cases where financial creditors have outstanding claims of Rs 5.3 lakh crore. However, for banks, the resolution is not the end of the road since orders of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) continue to be challenged by other creditors and debtors as the bankruptcy code gets tested in higher courts. According to data released by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), the top 25 of the 363 resolved cases account for over 70% of the financial claims by value (Rs 3.8 lakh crore). Against this Rs 3.8 lakh crore, financial creditors stand to recover around Rs 2 lakh crore, which is almost twice the liquidation value of Rs 1.1 lakh crore. While this is a very good performance, the journey for banks has not ended here. They are yet to get their money in 30% of the cases as the process does not conclude with the NCLT approval. According to the IBBI newsletter, till March 2021, realisation by financial creditors under resolution plans in comparison to liquidation value is 180%, while the realisation by them in comparison to their claims is 39%. “It is important to note that out of the 348 corporate debtors rescued under the processes under the code, 120 were in either BIFR (Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction) or defunct,” the report said. Among the top cases which are resolved but lenders are yet to realise their money is Reliance Infratel where lenders have claims of Rs 41,055 crore. Reliance Jio has moved the bankruptcy courts seeking details of an earlier forensic audit report that caused some lenders to declare the account as fraud. Jio’s resolution plan was cleared by the tribunal in December. In the case of Aircel, where financial creditors have claims of Rs 19,831 crore, the resolution process was stymied after the RBI said that an asset reconstruction company cannot convert debt into equity. UV ARC’s resolution plan was the one that found favour among creditors last year. Amtek Auto, another one of the big 12 cases recommended by the RBI, saw an approved resolution plan flop after the winning bidder reneged from its commitment. Other cases like Castex Technologies and Jyoti Structures are still embroiled in litigation. According to IBBI chairman M S Sahoo, some of the convenience metrics to judge the performance of the bankruptcy code can be misleading as there are companies that come into the bankruptcy process without any assets resulting in low recovery for lenders. “A single metric or a composite metric often does not capture softer aspects such as humanitarian approach while dealing with insolvency, or invisible outcomes in terms of behavioural changes of stakeholders. They generally do not capture the systemic gains such as induced resolutions outside the Code, liberation of entrepreneurs from failure, rescue of companies in deep distress, release of idle resources for productive uses, and meritocratic lending and improved availability of credit. It is because a metric tends to capture what can be measured and it ignores the matters that cannot be measured even if they matter,” said Sahoo in the newsletter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/resolutions-gather-pace-but-recoveries-take-time/articleshow/83290973.cms||Mayur Shetty

Though free ration is being distributed, many who used to send money to their families are feeling helpless. Early vaccination is their only hope and KMC officials have now identified an urban primary health centre nearby to start the drive for sex workers in the 18-45 age bracket. KMC will set up a team of doctors and has roped in local coordinator Sunanda Sarkar and counsellors to motivate sex workers to take the jab. Dancer Avirup Sengupta’s NGO Prayas, supported by actor Rituparna Sengupta, distributed groceries, sanitary napkins and other daily essentials to 100 sex workers in the Kalighat red-light area on Sunday as part of their initiative Punnya Patra. These women have been out of work since the Covid-19 restrictions were implemented. The team also gave out milk, bread and biscuits to 40 kids in the area. The initiative was supported by Ballygunge Siksha Sadan principal Sunita Sen, designer Papri Jain and several other social volunteers.Bishakha Laskar, president of Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee’s central committee, said she was keeping in touch with the civic health team. “Initially, a section of sex workers was reluctant to take the shot. But now a majority have been convinced,” she said.Protim Ray, senior medical officer of DMSC, said, “We have sent names of over 3,500 girls to the department of Women and Child Development and Social Welfare.” According to DMSC secretary Kajol Bose, this year has seen no Covid case in Sonagachhi. Shashi Panja, minister for Women and Child Development and Social Welfare, told TOI, “Sex workers have been included on the superspreaders’ list. We have collected the data and vaccination will start once KMC is ready.” An estimated 6,000-7,000 girls from Sonagachhi have gone home and business is down with few clients dropping by.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-to-set-up-vax-team-engage-counsellors-for-sonagachhi-drive/articleshow/83290729.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Liquor is banned in Bihar. Bhagalpur SSP Natasha Gudia said an FIR had been registered against them at Jogsar police station. ASP (City) Puran Jha raided the DTO office on getting information about the liquor party inside the office and caught them there, she said. Breathalyser tests of the seven accused confirmed liquor consumption. Liquor and glasses etc were seized from the office. The arrested data entry operators have been identified as Deepak Kumar, Rohit Kumar, Lallan Kumar, Sanjiv Kumar Singh, Rajiv Kumar, Pawan Kumar and Ajit Kumar. Booze parties by the data entry operators and other office staff have been a regular feature inside the office after working hours or on holidays, said sources, adding that some insiders had informed the police about it. Jogsar SHO PS Ajay Kumar Ajnaby said an FIR had been lodged under different sections of Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act of 2016. Covid-19 tests were also conducted before producing the accused in the court, the SHO added. The arrest of data entry operators, who were enjoying alcohol party inside the state government office in Bhagalpur, has come as shock and major embarrassment for the district officials. The arrested data entry operators were stated to be appointed by a state government's agency in Patna. Meanwhile, the district administration is stated to have sent a report to the state government and the transport department about the illegal boozing activities inside the office and arrests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/7-held-for-drinking-liquor-in-bhagalpur-dto-office/articleshow/83289242.cms||Kumar Rajesh

This follows a meeting of the chiefs of insurance companies with the finance minister on Saturday to discuss claim settlements under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY). The PMJJBY and PMSBY were provided by life insurers and non-life insurers respectively covering death and accidental death. The two covers were launched in 2015 and were distributed as an add-on to bank accounts. The covers were issued based on the customer’s consent. The PMJJBY provided a Rs 2-lakh life cover for Rs 330 annually, while PMSBY provided a Rs 2-lakh accidental death cover for Rs 12. “We are working on improving the processing time and turnaround time by simplifying the format to ensure that claimants get the money immediately,” said LIC chairman M R Kumar. LIC is the biggest underwriter of social welfare schemes in the country. According to sources, the government has asked insurers to put in place a straight-through processing system where the bank branch, upon receiving death claims from family members, send the details to their hub, which in turn connects to the insurance companies’ system and claims are settled without delay. One of the issues resulting in a delay in the underprivileged segment was the non-availability of the death certificate and insurance companies have been asked to look for a solution. In addition to the two schemes, the finance minister also took up the performance of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) package that covered government frontline healthcare workers. The policy was issued by New India Assurance — the largest state-owned non-life company. The finance minister appreciated the settlement of a claim in Ladakh where New India made the payment in hours of receiving the documents. Speaking to TOI, New India Assurance chairman Atul Sahai said that the company could settle a claim within hours as an official in the district could travel and meet the local authorities. The company had received around 1,100 claims of which 420 claims were already paid and 140 rejected and the balance was awaiting details like account information and documents from district officials. In the case of PMGKY too, the claim process has been simplified to have a check-box approach where the insurer would settle the claim based on a certification by the district magistrate that all documents have been received.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/social-welfare-insurance-claims-to-be-quicker/articleshow/83290812.cms||---

RJD shared a TOI clipping on its Facebook page published on the accused DSP after an FIR for allegedly raping a minor girl was registered against him in 2017 with Women’s police station in Gaya after his wife Anant Tanuja had spilled the beans against him before the CID, which probed the case. The DSP is posted as the officer on special duty in the central selection board of constable where Dwivedi is the board chairman. “Prasad’s wife has herself alleged that these officers have amassed massive wealth by committing irregularities in the recruitment of police personnel,” the RJD wrote. RJD spokesperson Chittaranjan Gagan said the government was patronising these persons. “Due to the patronage to such persons, the law and order situation has reached such a pitiable condition. Nothing more is expected from this government. The entire system is corrupt,” he alleged, adding that RJD will hit the road after the pandemic situation eases. Reacting to the allegations, JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar said the government has a track record of not protecting anyone and rule of law prevails in the state since Nitish Kumar came to power in 2005. “We have even got disproportionate property of a former DGP confiscated,” he said. “The woman should approach the economic offences unit (EOU) of state police with the evidence and videos she has in support of her allegations of corruption,” he added. JD(U) spokesperson Dr Suheli Mehta said the government is keeping an eye on the matter related to the DSP. “The home department is with our CM due to which no slackness in any such matter is acceptable.

It’s an important stress buster, as she strikes a balance between work from home, taking care of kids and household chores. But more recently, what’s got the 39-year-old hooked is ‘animal flow’, a unique bodyweight-based strength training workout that needs no equipment and comes with psychological benefits too.Animal flow workout, a movement programme designed to improve the function and communication of the ‘human animal’, was founded by American fitness expert and trainer Mike Fitch. It is defined by the fluidity of shifting from one move to the next without the knees or elbows touching the ground, and is considered an integration of animal patterns with yoga, gymnastics, and even breakdancing."I have been taking part in the rookie-level online training. If not for the lockdown, I would not have learned of this," says the Chetpet-based freelance writer.The workout is becoming popular among Chennai’s fitness enthusiasts during the lockdown, as it can be done in any space. It is aimed at developing endurance, mobility, balance, flexibility, coordination and strength, and has also been gaining traction due to the endless creative options based on a basic set of rules. Movements can include varieties such as travelling bear, scorpion switch, and crab reach. "I never get bored, as I can switch between movements of my choice. Deciding on what might be the next best position engages both my mind and body," says Joseph.According to Ashwin Ramdas, co-founder of Simple Strong India, an outdoor training community, the number of takers for animal flow has increased in the past month. "We began with 12 students in 2019 during our first session. Today I have trained more 400 students in the city," says Ramdas, who got 80 new students in the past few weeks. "As animal flow is an art form more than a workout, it attracts those who aim for fluidity, strength and movement. At a time when most places are shut, animal flow helps one engage with themselves without any restrictions," he said. What also makes animal flow a hit is that during lockdown, when there was a lack of bodily movement, is incorporating fun-filled routines with a natural flow to stay agile and fit. "All animal flow requires is only some floor space. It can boost energy levels and also tap into the primal bodily movements," says the 25-year-old, who has been trained by Mike Fitch.He says animal flow should be viewed as a form of art, which could come with benefits such as weight loss or gain. "It is a routine of elegant movements where the transitioning from one motion to the other has to be precise and free-flowing. It could be seen as a blend between a dance routine and workout and that is why there is more to this than just weight loss." Animal flow has helped fitness enthusiast and athlete Mallika Fernandes improve her poise and stability. "I feel more coordinated as it uses core muscles," says the 25-year-old from Kilpauk who also trains beginners. "While any workout releases ‘happy hormones’ or endorphins, animal flow has the ability to channel the animal in you. Psychologically it could help unleash the negative energy that might have been builtup over time," says psychologist Mini Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/try-channelling-the-animal-in-you/articleshow/83290736.cms||Harshitha Kumayaa

---||Patna||Bihar BJP chief questions style of police functioning||PATNA: BJP state president Sanjay Jaiswal on Sunday questioned the style of functioning of the state police and said, “Instead of taking action against the guilty persons in the cases of communal conflict between the minorities and the scheduled castes, police always send members of both warring communities to jail.” In a Facebook post, which created ripples in the state’s political circles because BJP is the biggest ally in the four-party coalition government led by JD(U)’s Nitish Kumar, Jaiswal also raised concern over the recent spurt in the cases of attacks on Dalits by the minority community members in different parts of Bihar. Jaiswal, a three-time BJP’s Lok Sabha member from Pashchim Champaran, in his post said, “Yesterday (on June 5), I received an information from Dhangarhwa village (near Ramgarhwa) that some members of the minority community have closed the pathway of Dalit community by raising a brick wall. I spoke to the Palanwa SHO, who along with the circle officer resolved the dispute.” But, he said there was a remarkable rise in such incidents in the last few days. “It all began from Dhaka (East Champaran) where members of marriage processions of first Sahni community, then Nonia and Paswans, were not only thrashed but booked and sent to jail when they went to the police to seek help. More than six such incidents were reported in Dhaka in the recent days. In all cases, instead of taking action against the guilty, the police sent members from both the communities to jail,” Jaiswal wrote. “Such incidents have increased also in Purnia and Kishanganj districts. Whatever incident of atrocities was committed on the Dalits at Baisi in Purnia, the state government took cognizance and ensured justice to the Dalits,” he said. Jaiswal stressed the need for the administration to remain alert everywhere. The situation does not go beyond the control whenever the peoples’ representatives resolve such issues by immediately taking cognizance of such disputes. But when the district administration takes a one-sided stand and starts punishing even the innocent, such an act sends a very wrong message in the society, he said. Reacting over Jaiswal’s post, RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari told TOI, “This time, the BJP state president has questioned the so-called good governance of CM Nitish Kumar. Will the JD((U) leaders now chop off the arms of the BJP state president?” Tiwari was referring to a recent statement of JD(U) spokesperson Sanjay Singh that he would chop off the fingers of all those people who dare question the integrity, honesty and good governance of Nitish. “The way Jaiswal has exposed the police functioning as well as the claim of good governance, the JDU) leader should now chop off his arms,” Tiwari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-bjp-chief-questions-style-of-police-functioning/articleshow/83289328.cms||---

On Sunday, Reliance Infra’s board approved issuance of 8.8 crore equity shares or convertible warrants at Rs 62 per share or warrant to promoters and Varde. The issue price of Rs 62 is at a discount of nearly 11% to Reliance Infra’s Friday closing price of Rs 70. Once the issuance is completed, the promoters’ stake in Reliance Infra will increase to 23% from the current 5%. On the other hand, Varde will check into Reliance Infra, which operates the Mumbai Metro and handles power distribution in Delhi, by acquiring over 5% stake in the publicly listed company. Reliance Infra will raise Rs 551 crore from the preferential allotment, it informed the stock exchanges. Of this, Rs 401 crore will come from the promoters. The money raised will be utilised to fund future growth and to lower debt, the company added. Reliance Infra’s standalone debt had stood at Rs 3,808 crore in fiscal 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rel-infra-to-issue-fresh-equity-raise-rs-551-crore/articleshow/83290867.cms||---

Mohd Javed (42) and his wife Nasreen Bano were attacked by dhaba owner Mohd Adil and others when they were sitting inside their house. According to police, Adil was peeved with the couple for supporting a rival candidate in the recent panchayat polls and had been threatening them of dire consequences. The miscreants first attacked Javed and injured his wife when she made an abortive bid to save her husband. Hearing their shrieks, the villagers rushed to the spot but the attackers managed to flee. On being alerted, a team of Kunda police arrived at the spot and reportedly took the couple to a community health centre for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/dhaba-owner-attacks-couple-for-supporting-another-candidate-in-rural-polls/articleshow/83289897.cms||---
---||Business||Demand spikes for ‘clean-label’ snacks||MUMBAI: Consumer behaviour may have shifted towards more snacking occasions during the day, and even night. However, there is a growing consciousness about reducing the guilt of snacking. ‘No additives or preservatives’ is a top claim connected with clean label in the Indian snacking space, which has grown from 11% of total snack launches in the 12 months to January 2017, to 19% between February 2020 and January 2021, according to a Mintel study shared exclusively with TOI. The study on snacking attitudes of Indian consumers said that, as products with ‘free-from’ claims on packs raise consumer awareness about specific ingredients to avoid, the demand for such formulations will rise. Mintel’s associate director (food & drink - India & Thailand) Rushikesh Aravkar said, “Consumers are looking at snacking more often and are also replacing meal occasions with snacking occasions. While 42% look for nutrition on packs while purchasing, taste remains an important factor. But consumers are increasingly looking at what’s there in the pack — whether it’s healthy or not. The concept of clean eating is evolving.” Aravkar said if hunger and energy were the key drivers for snacking pre-pandemic, today it’s a search for comfort and stress-busting benefits that consumers look for. That’s a clear behavioural shift. With most staying at home, four in 10 Indian consumers say their snack consumption has increased. While 7 in 10 consumers say taste is more important than how healthy the snack is, 85% of consumers also feel the need for healthy snack options. The study, conducted among 3,000 Indian adults aged 18 and above, highlights how brands can emphasise naturalness and no ‘nasties’ as a means to justify snacking and remove guilt as these claims are being increasingly sought by health-conscious consumers. Parle Products category head Mayank Shah said, “The trend of clean labels is catching up in India. While snack consumers are getting more health-conscious, taste still remains numero uno consideration. But a good development over last few years is that consumers are increasingly looking at labels and are avoiding nasties like preservatives and additives. This is a welcome change from earlier times, when taste used to be the only consideration and consumers were oblivious to what went into the making of product.” Balancing the taste and health conundrum can be challenging for new product development. Gits Food Products director (sales & marketing) Sahil Gilani said, “We will not sell what we don’t relish ourselves. Being a family business, we take this very seriously and we have been an all-natural brand since our inception in 1963. Claims such as ‘no preservatives’ and ‘no artificial colours or flavours’ have been part of our labelling for decades. However, not all consumers trust on-pack claims. Hence, it is also important to educate them on the food technology being used to achieve naturalness. Our ready meals packs mention ‘advanced retort technology — preserving without preservatives’. Mentioning key ingredients on the front of the pack is also a good way to educate customers.” The growing prevalence of lifestyle diseases in India and the accelerated momentum of health consciousness caused by Covid has opened up opportunities for snacks that are both healthy and indulgent. Mintel has predicted that in 12 months, as consumers transition into the next normal, foods that support their emotional wellbeing will continue to be in demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/demand-spikes-for-clean-label-snacks/articleshow/83291047.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Vijayawada||Krishna, third district in Andhra Pradesh to cross 1,000 Covid deaths||VIJAYAWADA: Covid-19 deaths in Krishna district crossed the 1,000-mark on Sunday. The Covid-19 toll in the district since April 2020 stands at 1,005. The district is the third in the state to cross the grim milestone of 1,000 Covid-19 deaths. Altogether, Krishna district has registered 92,880 Covid-19 cases till date, of which 82,418 patients have recovered and 9,457 active cases are under treatment. The district also registered a large number of Covid-19 cases in the first wave when Vijayawada was a major hotspot and the city declared a containment zone. With strict containment measures and enforcement of the compulsory mask rule, the number of cases came down, but mortality rate remained very high till September 2020. The toll started to rise again in the second wave from March 2021. The positivity rate touched 19 per cent by end-April and around seven patients died of Covid-19 on average each day in the past month. After reports of patients dying on the way to hospitals in Vijayawada emerged, the health wing swung into action and developed infrastructure in area hospitals. All major area hospitals are equipped with oxygen beds and voluntary organisations have supplied oxygen concentrators to patients in home isolation. The positivity rate and number of new Covid-19 cases have fallen over the past 10 days. “The Covid-19 situation is stable and under control as of now. Our efforts gave results and positivity rate came down to 5.3 per cent. We will continue the same pace in testing and focus on improving infrastructure. Timely treatment and availability of ventilator beds is key to reducing the toll and we have focused on these elements,” district collector A Md Imtiaz said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/krishna-third-district-in-state-to-cross-1000-covid-deaths/articleshow/83290251.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: As rains arrive, kharif sowing may start early in Krishna||VIJAYAWADA: As the southwest monsoon starts to spread across the state, the Krishna district administration is making arrangements to start the kharif season a little early this year. Officials have started distribution of seeds from the wide network of Rythu Bharosa Kendras in the district and estimate a 15 per cent increase in crop area this year. The kharif crop is a crucial one for the district and one in which around 2.8 lakh farmers cultivate around 3.5 lakh acres. While a majority of farmers prefer paddy cultivation, some in the upland areas opt for cotton and 15 varieties of commercial crops. With rainfall across the district on Friday, farmers started preparations for the kharif season. Agriculture authorities intensified soil testing in villages and suggested that farmers choose the right variety of seeds. Farmers who are dependent on water from the three irrigation canals in the Krishna delta said they are eagerly waiting for the release of water from Prakasam Barrage. Meanwhile, a delay in paddy procurement of the rabi season has cropped up as a source of worry. Farmers have requested authorities to complete the procurement process early as there is a chance of crop damage with the rains. Joint collector Madhavi Latha said the government will ensure all grain is procured from farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/as-rains-arrive-kharif-sowing-may-start-early/articleshow/83290292.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: High transport cost pushes up onion price across retail markets||KOLKATA: Onion prices are again on the upswing after a brief respite, partly because of higher carrying costs from Nashik, Bellary or Akula, and partly because of the complete exhaustion of Bengal’s own production, Sukhsagar. On Sunday, onions were sold at Rs 40 a kg across retail markets in the city while, on May 15, the price had been Rs 22-Rs 25 a kg. Bengal’s annual onion consumption is 8.5 lakh tonnes if weather conditions are favourable. This year, the state had a very good crop, which had so far stabilized prices. But diesel prices have risen by Rs 5.12 a litre since April 6. “There has not been any shortage in supply as onion production has been good. But the transportation cost has gone up enough to make onion dearer in Kolkata,” said Kamal Dey, member of the market task force. The prices had been under check because of steady supply of Bengal’s own onion. Traders sent some to other states due to the absence of cold-storages and the rest was used for domestic consumption. The wholesale price of onion that was hovering around Rs 1,000-Rs 1,050 per 40kg bag on May 15 has risen to Rs 1,150-Rs 1,200 a bag, said Abhijit Saha, a wholesale trader at Tollygunge. The retail price, thus, rose automatically. Amit Saha, an onion retailer at Maniktala market, said, “We are buying onions at Rs 33-Rs 35 a kg. If we sell below Rs 40 a kg, we will incur a loss.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-transport-cost-pushes-up-onion-price-across-retail-mkts/articleshow/83290689.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Mind you, this is not white fungus||VADODARA: After black, white and aspergillosis infections, cases of candida fungal infections have now started surfacing among Covid-19 recovered patients in Gujarat. At least 18 cases of candidiasis, the fungal infection caused by a yeast (a type of fungus) called candida, have been reported at the state-run SSG Hospital in Vadodara. The fungal infections were co-incidental findings in patients who were admitted for treatment of mucormycosis (black fungus) at the hospital after recovery from Covid-19. “Nasal biopsies of patients revealed the presence of candida. These patients were also suffering from mucormycosis or aspergillosis. So, it was a combination of fungal infections in 18 patients,” said Dr Sheetal Mistry, advisor for Covid-19 to city and district administration. “These three are the most common opportunistic fungal infections that hit a person when the immunity goes down,” he said, adding that candidiasis is a benign fungal infection, and it is usually not invasive. Candida normally lives on the skin and inside the body in organs such as mouth, throat, gut and vagina without causing any problems. “But when the immunity goes down because of higher antibiotic therapy, long term usage of steroids or uncontrolled blood sugar levels, candida causes oral thrush or vaginitis,” he said. White patches (lesions) are seen on tongues, inner cheeks and palates of such patients with oral thrush. Vaginitis that happens due to inflammation of the vagina, results in itching or white discharge from the vagina. Candidiasis is not life-threatening. If diagnosed early it can be treated through oral medicines. “But candida bloodstream infection also known as candidemia is invasive candidiasis. If it crosses the blood barrier, it can spread to heart, kidney, liver, brain as well. If not diagnosed and treated in time it can prove fatal,” Mistry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mind-you-this-is-not-white-fungus/articleshow/83289383.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: 33 hospitals lose permission to treat Covid in Vijayawada||VIJAYAWADA: The Krishna district administration has cancelled permissions given to 33 hospitals in the city for Covid-19 treatment. The measures come after it was found the hospitals were not providing cashless treatment to Covid-19 patients under the YSR Aarogyasri scheme. The district administration and health wing had granted permission to 82 private hospitals for Covid-19 treatment. Dental, orthopaedic and paediatric hospitals were also given permission to handle Covid-19 cases on the condition they allocated 50 per cent of beds to beneficiaries under YSR Aarogyasri. After a number of hospitals in Vijayawada failed to meet the terms and guidelines set by the health wing, the district administration as a first warning, imposed penalties. However, despite penalties, many hospitals failed to allocate beds for Covid-19 patients under the Aarogyasri scheme. Taking note, L Siva Shankar, joint collector and district nodal officer for Covid-19, passed orders cancelling permissions issued to 33 corporate hospitals. “We are receiving a number of complaints from the public that hospitals are ill-treating Covid-19 patients who are admitted under Aarogyasri. Many hospitals have not even allocated beds for them. We have already initiated action against them. Patients can contact the 104 helpline and raise their complaints,” Siva Shankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/33-hosps-lose-permission-to-treat-covid/articleshow/83290257.cms||---

The state ranked third from the bottom with 52 points, as per the index report. CPI-ML (Liberation) secretary Kunal said the state has been ruled by the NDA for the last 16 years, barring some period when RJD was part of the government, but failed to deliver the desired results so far as development is concerned. Reacting to JD(U)’s oft-repeated demand for according special status to Bihar, he said it was nothing but a political gimmick. “We are of the view that land reforms are the only way to set things right,” Kunal said. He criticised the CM for shelving the Bandopadhyay Commission report on land reforms. At the same time, Kunal said his party has been raising the issue of special status for a long time. On the other hand, former CM and HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi backed the JD(U)’s demand for special status. Manjhi said the central government should give priority to the long-pending demand of the people of Bihar. On Saturday, JD(U) parliamentary board chairperson Upendra Kushwaha had urged the Centre to accord special status to Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ml-attacks-state-govt-for-poor-performance/articleshow/83289069.cms||Ramashankar
---||Kolkata||Adults with spl needs get jab at autism centre||Kolkata: Suparna Chakraborty had been worried about getting her 28-year-old daughter Anwesha vaccinated at a regular jab centre since the latter is autistic. But on Sunday, the Bangur Avenue resident was among several others who got the shot at a special camp. More than 80 young adults with developmental disability were inoculated free of cost at Pradip Autism Centre in Beliaghta in an initiative by Devi Shetty’s Narayana Health and Give Indian Foundation. “With the kind of special attention my daughter needs, it would have been difficult if she got infected and needed hospital care. But getting her vaccinated was another challenge since it would not have been possible to take her to just any vaccination centre,” said Chakraborty. “At 20, my son Rohit is eligible for the vaccine but it would have been difficult to take him to any other vaccination centre. On Sunday, with known faces around, including his teachers, he took the jab readily,” said Ritu Khanna. Doctors said these young adults, too, could get infected even though they do not mingle much with adults in outdoor activities. But a family member could carry infection home. “If they get infected and need hospital care, it would be challenging for both doctors and the parents. So, they need to be protected against the virus,” said a doctor in a government hospital. TOI had recently reported how doctors at Fortis Hosp-ital had to allow the parents of a 12-year-old autistic boy so that he would cooperate with the treatment. “These young adults need a familiar environment where the inoculation can be done,” said school teacher in charge Rina Patra. “It is a privilege to be a part of this noble programme. It is the objective of Narayana Health to make vaccination available to all and specially those who may find its accessibility a challenge. Vaccinating this part of the society is equally important,” said R Venkatesh, regional director, Narayana Health (east). While RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences chose a vaccination team that would have the kind of patience and empathy required for the drive, the school had deputed its teachers as volunteers. Another special camp under the same initiative, this time for underprivileged people, was inaugurated by Frihad Hakim in Mominpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/adults-with-spl-needs-get-jab-at-autism-centre/articleshow/83290848.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Pune||Maha move one level up in education performance index||done Pune: From level IV to level III, Maharashtra has progressed in the performance grading index for 2019-20 academic year as against the previous year, riding on improvements in the governance processes and equality in education. The state’s progress in three other parameters such as learning outcome and quality, access to education and infrastructure remained unchanged when compared with 2018-19. The report was released by the Union ministry of education on Sunday. The assessment of the states was conducted based on five indicators — learning outcomes and quality, access, infrastructure and facilities, equity and governance processes. The aim of the performance grading index was to pinpoint the gaps, and accordingly prioritize areas for intervention to ensure that the school education system is robust at every level. At the same time, it is expected to act as a good source of information for best practices followed by states and UTs which can be shared. Former director of education, Vasant Kalpande, said, “Marginal changes in parameters in the sectors like health, achievements always happen when reviewed periodically. This is a natural phenomenon and such statistically insignificant differences don’t need to have any specific reason or explanation.” The survey said the governance process parameters had many states score fewer points. This parameter was an important indicator as it would lead to critical structural reforms in areas ranging from monitoring the attendance of teachers to ensuring a transparent recruitment of teachers and principals. Headmistress of a civic school in the city, Hema Mane, said, “It is common knowledge that shortage of teachers and principals and administrative staff, lack of regular supervision and inspection, inadequate training of the teachers, timely availability of finances are some of the factors plaguing the education system. Through the PGI, the shortfalls can be measured objectively and regularly. This is crucial for taking necessary steps to eliminate the gaps.” The survey report said in the case of learning outcomes, it has been observed that, in general, the scores obtained in the higher standards are less than those in the lower standards. It is therefore imperative to ensure better interventions at the lower standards as it will have a positive cascading effect at the higher levels. Indicators like availability of ICT facilities and timely availability of textbooks and uniforms, which are critical inputs for better performance of students and mentioned in the RTE Act, are measured in the infrastructure & facilities domain. Significant shortfalls in these areas have also been captured by the infrastructure Index.

In a communication to state energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli and APSPDCL CMD H Haranatha Rao, Chakradhar Babu said that the uninterrupted power supply enabled the district administration to run labs extensively and conduct 7,500 to 8,000 Covid-19 tests every day. “For me, increasing the testing capacities, running the RT-PCR and Truenat labs in three shifts, and declaring test results within 24 hours are the most important steps to ensure early treatment,” said the collector. According to Chakradhar Babu, the district administration has laid special emphasis on setting up Covid care centres with facilities such as haematology analysers, X-ray machines, triaging equipment and timely start of supplemental oxygen with the help of oxygen concentrators. The collector said that they are using around 355 concentrators in the district. “All the 11 Covid care centres set up in the district are making extensive use of these equipment besides conventional oxygen cylinders. For monitoring of liquid oxygen movement, a separate war room has been created in the district Covid-19 control room. This is over and above the 104 control room and the hospital CCTV monitoring teams. As the novel coronavirus is said to have gained more virulence this time, the oxygen dependency has increased manifold,” said Chakradhar Babu. The district administration has made serious efforts to set up an additional 13KL tank at the government general hospital and another 13KL tank at the Narayana Medical College. The officials also identified a sick industry at Bhudanam village in Chillakur mandal to generate oxygen through an air separation unit. “Energy minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy, who is also the district in-charge minister and the industries minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy have supported us in getting all necessary clearances and at very short notice,” said Chakradhar Babu. Meanwhile, more than 7.58 lakh (26 per cent of the total population) in the district have received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose. Nellore collector Chakradhar Babu said uninterrupted power supply enabled the district administration to run labs extensively and conduct 7,500 to 8,000 Covid-19 tests every day||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/24x7-power-supply-key-in-tackling-covid/articleshow/83290244.cms||---

The BHRC notice dated May 2 has sought report from additional chief secretary (home) till August 26. The commission has fixed September 2 for hearing the matter again. The BHRC took the action on the complaint by Muzaffarpur lawyer Dr SK Jha working for human rights. Jha mentioned that the woman’s one-year period of imprisonment pronounced by a Nalanda court along with seven days’ additional imprisonment for unable to pay Rs500 fine ended on January 22 this year, but she is still languishing in jail, which is violation of human rights. Jha also mentioned that the court had also directed the Nalanda SP to take action for sending her back to Bangladesh after her jail term. Rupa, in her late 20s, was found roaming at Ahiyapur under Noorsarai police station area in Nalanda on December 5, 2019. In her statement to the police, Rupa had said she needed money for the operation of her ailing child and a tout trafficked her to India in the name of providing a job, but abandoned her in Kolkata. From there, she strayed to Nalanda. When contacted, Biharsharif district jail superintendent Prabhat Kumar on Sunday said he had taken an update on Rupa’s case from Nalanda SP office ten days back. “I have to know that letters have been written to the Union ministry of home affairs for contacting the Bangladesh high commission, but they are yet to authenticate that Rupa is their citizen for initiating the process to send her back home,” he said. He said she is still inside the jail due to that. "She lives with other inmates in the female ward of the jail," he said. The superintendent said he has also written a letter to Nalanda DM for making some alternative arrangements for the woman as per law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhrc-why-bangladesh-woman-is-in-jail-despite-serving-sentence/articleshow/83289378.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The educational institutions had remained closed for about seven months in 2020 before higher educational institutions resumed face-to-face academic instruction in November last year. Primary schools started offline teaching only this February. But the ongoing severe second wave has again led to the abrupt ending of the 2020-21 academic year with the majority of the institutions switching over to online education. The state government has promoted all students of classes I to IX in the state without examinations. But the final exams are yet to be conducted for all higher classes—classes X, XII, graduation, engineering, and post-graduation courses. In fact, several universities have not held even first semester exams for the freshers. The students of various professional courses, who have been selected in campus interviews, are waiting for the conduct of final exams to join their first jobs. Education minister A Suresh said that the education department would conduct the exams for classes X and XII once the Covid-19 conditions improve in the state. “Intermediate marks have 25 per cent weightage in EAMCET exams, while class X marks are the basis for admission into four IIITs in the state. Considering the students’ health, we have postponed the exams,” said Suresh. Amid the reports that the presumed third wave may affect children the most, there has been an ongoing uncertainty over the commencement of the new academic year in the offline mode. Several courses have got a syllabus cut to compensate for the lost days during the first wave. Now, the new academic year has to be planned according to the prevailing situation. The AP school education department recently extended the summer vacation until June 30. However, the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) has been asked to prepare a detailed academic calendar and activities to be taken up through means such as radio, television, YouTube, personal contact through WhatsApp groups etc., as part of online education for all classes from June 12 onwards. The headmasters concerned have been asked to extend necessary academic support to class X students. State convener of the Child Rights Protection Forum (CRPF) Dr Gondu Sitaram said that several research institutes and paediatricians are suggesting that children may contract the disease more in the third wave. “We urge the government to set up special Covid-19 wards similar to school classes for children across the state,” said Sitaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-upends-edu-sector-for-second-straight-year/articleshow/83290237.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

According to police, Narayana Jonnalagadda (80), had been living in Nandigama with his family after retirement. Afraid of contracting Covid-19, he had avoided stepping out of his house since April 2020. After falling sick last Tuesday, he tested positive for the virus and went into a depression. His family tried to counsel him but he was unable to overcome his fear and attempted suicide by slitting his throat. He was rushed to Nandigama area hospital, from where he was shifted to Vijayawada Government General Hospital. Doctors said Narayana, who has lost a lot of blood, is critical. Taking note of the incident, Nandigama legislator Mondithoka Jagan Mohan Rao, has asked public not to panic about Covid-19. He asked patients to make use of psychiatric services at the 104 helpline if required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/depressed-after-contracting-covid-patient-attempts-suicide/articleshow/83290264.cms||Venu Lanka

Manu Melwin Joy, a cancer survivor himself and assistant professor, School of Management Studies at Cusat, has developed the prototype of the app named ‘I CAN’ after his proposal was selected by the varsity. Gamification is the application of typical elements of game playing like point scoring, competition with others, rules of play, etc, to another activity. I CAN app features game elements like points, badges, leaderboards, storytelling, etc, to motivate cancer patients. The app was created during the project study conducted by Joy to identify an appropriate gamified solution to enhance the overall healthcare experience of patients undergoing cancer treatment. I CAN app features game elements like points, badges, leaderboards, storytelling, etc. to motivate cancer patients“It was my experience as a cancer patient and my passion for gamification that motivated me to come up with the project. The project received Rs 2 lakh funding under the ‘Seed Money for New Research Initiatives’, instituted for newly-recruited faculty members to encourage research activities,” said Joy. He said that every year, Kerala has roughly 35,000 new cancer cases and the main problem faced by medical professionals is to track a patient’s progress on a regular basis and motivate them to adopt positive behaviour to ensure speedy and efficient recovery. “The biggest motivation for a cancer patient is to meet and interact with cancer survivors. So, this was kept as an important point in I CAN App. Many cancer survivors were interviewed and their short motivational stories were filmed for the app. The main objective of the app is to help cancer patients maintain a positive mindset while undergoing treatment,” Joy said. Through the app, they have to do positive things like reading articles of cancer survivors, interacting with people who have won over cancer, watching motivational videos, etc. As it will be gamified, if the patients read a success story, they will get 10 points. If they read one success story a day for one week, they will get a special success story badge. After a week, they will move from one level to another where their involvement will be higher. For example, in the first week, they have to just read stories, but in the second week they have to write their success story and share, etc. “A mascot named I CAN Man, who will be a non-playing character in the app, will remind users about tasks and will urge them for the right behaviours. The completion of the app’s final version requires around Rs 30 lakh and I am now looking for sponsors,” Joy added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cusat-faculty-gamifies-solutions-to-motivate-cancer-patients/articleshow/83290762.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

The delay in getting the council’s clearance will affect the implementation of the projects. The corporation received Rs 45 crore as central allocation during 2021-22 fiscal. Reconstruction of a new building for housing the solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram at a cost of Rs 8.5 crore is one of the major projects that needs to be kicked off without any delay. The existing plant may collapse anytime and the rains have added to the concern in this regard. Another project which needs to be undertaken on a war footing is the drinking water scheme which has been estimated to cost Rs 7 crore. “We have given approval to the central government-funded projects designed by 97 local bodies,” said Ullas Thomas, district panchayat president and chairperson of the ad hoc committee of the district planning council (DPC). “Kochi Corporation authorities have informed us that they would submit the projects details within a couple of days. It is due to Covid related activities that they couldn’t submit them. Once they submit the list, we will give the approval for them soon,” Thomas said. The corporation hasn’t submitted the plan fund projects for the 2021-22 fiscal as well. “All the local bodies other than the corporation and Chellanam panchayat had submitted the plan fund projects to the DPC before the assembly elections,” Thomas said. The state government had given instructions to all the local bodies to complete the formalities for designing plan fund projects and submit them for DPC approval before the model code of conduct as part of assembly elections came into force in March. But the corporation authorities couldn’t submit the projects then. It was on May 31 that the corporation council gave its approval for the plan fund projects as well as the projects being implemented using central funds.  A total of 802 projects worth Rs 60 crore have been approved. But the authorities are yet to submit the projects for DPC approval. The plan includes housing schemes for the homeless, road works, works to address waterlogging and construction of a slaughterhouse in Mattancherry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-fails-to-submit-project-details-for-dpc-approval/articleshow/83290789.cms||---

In a circular issued on June 4, the BMC wrote to all its medical officers across the 24 wards in the city to collate data from their respective wards on the number of staff members at restaurants, hotels and similar businesses. The data is to be submitted to the health department before 2 pm on Monday. A BMC official said this comes in the wake of the BMC allowing the reopening of restaurants from Monday at 50% capacity till 4 pm. “This needs to be done on priority considering that the hotel staff is in touch with several people who come into the establishment to dine or in case they are going to deliver food parcels,” the official said. A meeting is to be held on Tuesday for the tabling of the information collated from the various wards. In March, at the beginning of the second wave, the BMC had tested staff from Radha Krishna restaurant in Andheri and found 10 of the 35 Covid-positive. In April, the BMC sealed Shobha Hotel on LJ Road in Mahim after 11 persons working in it tested positive, including the cook. Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR) vice-president Niranjan Shetty, who was present at a meeting with civic officials on Friday, said it would be best to get all staff vaccinated so that business can continue uninterrupted. “If the civic body opens up the 18-44 years vaccination slots as well, they could be vaccinated at the civic centres itself,” Shetty said. AHAR secretary Sukesh Shetty said they were willing to offer some of their banquet halls at different points in the city to vaccinate hotel staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-in-a-hurry-to-give-restaurant-staff-shots/articleshow/83292038.cms||Richa Pinto

Police sources said more complainants from across the state approached the investigating officers. Police plan to interrogate him based on the fresh complaints. The coach who worked as an assistant commissioner in the GST department in Chennai retired from service six months ago.Police arrested Nagarajan on May 28 on charges of sexually exploiting a 19-year-old college student when she had trained with him. The girl stated she was trained by him between 2013 and 2020. After the training session, the girl alleged, the coach would send the other girls away and ask her to stay back. He would pretend to give her physiotherapy and touch her inappropriately.When the girl protested, Nagarajan stopped training her and threatened her. As the coach would spoil her chances to get government posting and to attend competitions, she remained silent. On Friday, the case against martial arts trainer Kebi Raj was transferred to the CB-CID, as the investigation needs to evidence from other districts.A special court for cases under the Pocso Act declined to release on bail G Rajagopalan, commerce teacher of PSBB school, arrested on charges of sexually harassing his students. Special judge T H Mohammed Farooq dismissed the bail application moved by Rajagopal on Saturday. Ashok Nagar all-women police registered a case against Rajagopal under sections 354(A) (sexual harassment) and 509 (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the IPC, sections 67 and 67- A of the IT Act and sections 12 (sexual harassment) of the Pocso Act, read with 11(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). On May 25, police arrested Rajagopalan on charges of sexual harassment. The incident came to light during an online discussion on incidents of discrimination faced by the students. Soon, many students started to share their experience which was shared on Instagram.

---||Chennai||No service tax for take-away orders in hotels, rules Madras HC||CHENNAI: In a significant ruling, Madras high court has held that service tax would not be applicable on ‘take-away’ in restaurants and hotels. Justice Anita Sumanth passed the order while allowing a batch of pleas moved by popular chain of restaurants, including Anjappar, Thalappakatti and Sangeetha Hotels, challenging the notices issued by the commissioner of GST and central excise demanding service tax for ‘take-away’ orders. The bench held that such provision of food and drink ‘taken-away’ from restaurants would tantamount to only sale and not consumption at the restaurant attracting service tax. “In most restaurants, there is a separate counter for collection of the take-away food parcels. Orders are received either over telephone, by e-mail, online booking or through a food delivery service,” the judge said. Once processed and readied for delivery, the parcels are brought to a separate counter and are picked up either by the customer or a delivery service. More often than not, the take-away counters are positioned away from the main dining area that may or may not be air-conditioned. Earlier, opposing the pleas, the department relied on Section 66E(1) of the Finance Act which declares the activity of supply of food or any other article of human consumption or any drink as a taxable service. Thus, there is absolutely no infirmity in the impugned orders that have brought to tax the receipts from parcel sales/take away sales, authorities said. “The provision of take-away food and drinks involves the rendition of service and the mode of sale, that is, by parcels, has no bearing in the matter. The transaction in question should thus be bifurcated into one that involves both the components of sale and service and brought to tax accordingly,” the department argued. Refusing to concur, the court observed that not all services rendered by restaurants in the sale of food and drink are taxable and it is only certain specified situations that attract tax.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-service-tax-for-take-away-orders-in-hotels-rules-hc/articleshow/83290786.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Garbage dumping, burning becomes recurring issue in NIBM area||PUNE: Garbage dumping and burning has become a recurring issue in NIBM-Undri Road, Salunke Vihar Road, Kausar Baug and the surrounding areas in Kondhwa. The situation has gone down hill since the start of the year. Sanitary workers have refused to clear up claiming they have not been paid their salaries for months. Housing societies are burning dry waste and dumping wet waste in open slots as Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) does not collect and transport it to the processing units, the residents said. In March, a group began clean the garbage, planted saplings along the road and put up signboards to discourage people from littering. A few weeks later, it was back to square one. “The PMC lacks a schedule to collect garbage. What is picked up is dumped or burned nearby. The stench and the smoke is detrimental to our health, more so during a pandemic,” Shehnaz Chawla, co-founder of NIBM-Undri Residents’ Forum said. Disposal of Covid-19 waste is another issue. “There is just one vehicle on a weekly basis for collection of Covid waste. Private contractors are fleecing societies to pick up the waste and burning it in open spaces,” Rohan Gaikwad, MNS president of NIMB-Mohammedwadi ward, said. Local corporator Nanda Lonkar said she had helped clean the area before, but the residents from other localities keep dumping their garbage here. “Vendors and restaurants are dumping their waste irresponsibly, showing a lack of civic sense,” she said, adding that two sanitary workers were appointed to help clean up the area, but the initiative fizzled out. Citizens said the civic body to keep the locality clean. “We have paid from our pockets to hire labour to sweep and pile up the garbage so that the Adar Poonawalla Clean City Initiative vehicles can pick it up. We are pushing for a garbage disposal plant to resolve the issue,” Parveen Tambe, a resident, said. They were told there is a lack of manpower and vehicles for garbage collection. But, Mahesh Doiphode, deputy commissioner (Motor Vehicles department) in the PMC said they have not received any report or complaint from the ward officer. “We will make arrangements for additional vehicles when we get word from the ward office,” he said. Ajit Deshmukh, head of the solid waste department in PMC, said the garbage problem persisted because the area has just come under the civic body’s jurisdiction. A deputy sanitary inspector (DSI) has been told to draw up a plan to address the problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/garbage-dumping-burning-becomes-recurring-issue-in-nibm-area/articleshow/83292027.cms||---
---||Pune||Pandemic facilitates the return of the prodigal working professionals||Pune: Thirty-year-old Prabhakar Shankar had left his home in Kolkata around six years ago for work. Shankar, an IT professional, who has stayed in different cities, the last being Pune for two years, returned home around two months ago for good after his company approved of him shifting and continuing work from home. “It has been both weird and emotional for me to be back home again. While I visited home frequently during holidays and occasions, staying there for a long time never really happened in the past six years. It has been weird as I find that emotional connect between my parents and I to be amiss somehow. However, now that I am home and am expected to stay on for a long time, it is time to strengthen and renew relationships again with my immediate family and relatives,” he told TOI. With the raging pandemic having destroyed many lives, it was a chance for many others to return home and reconnect with their immediate family members and friends. Speaking to some among them, who had returned following a sudden sack or a massive pay cut, proved that staying at home after years of living in different cities was difficult but necessary and important. “It has been 10 years since I left my home in Patna and went to Delhi for work. From Delhi, work took me to different cities like Bengaluru, Cochin, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune. I was in Pune for the past two years but once the pandemic hit, I found myself to be suddenly jobless last year. I had no choice but to return home and have been in Patna with my parents and my younger brother since last year. Staying at home allowed me to reconnect with them, especially with my brother and his family. Though I visited them on holidays and festivals and talked to them on phone, I feel that I had alienated myself and forgotten the meaning of a true bond. I am getting to know my parents anew after years and also connecting with my other relatives living in the city. Family is extremely important and they stand by you in times of distress, is what I have learnt,” Rajan Anand, who used to work in Pune as a marketing executive, told TOI. Sachin Dhanawade, who returned to his home in Mumbai from Delhi after his company agreed to allow him to move and work from home, said that having home-cooked food was the best thing that had happened to him. “I had been in Delhi for eight years when my company slashed our salaries heavily and I reached a situation where I was finding it difficult to even pay my house rent. It is a relief that the company agreed to me moving home and continuing work from there. While I do miss my independence a bit, being at home allows me to have long conversations with my father and mother. I come to know about many family-related things which I had no clue about,” Sachin, a call centre employee, pointed out. Aarti Marar, who has been living with her parents and sister since the past six months in Chandigarh after she left Pune, said that reconnecting with her sister had been a different experience altogether. “I found her to be a changed person and she was nothing like what she was around six years ago when I had left home. However, we slowly started conversing more and now we are re-kindling our relationship all over again. I had to leave Pune as had lost my job but now after being at home, I think I will stay on and find something here once things improve,” Marar, who was an HR executive for a Pune-based company, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pandemic-facilitates-the-return-of-the-prodigal-working-professionals/articleshow/83292036.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Jaipur||Govt in favour of lifting curbs from 5 am to 5 pm, says Dotasra||Jaipur: Though the state government has not formally announced guidelines on modified lockdown, a member of the council of ministers has confirmed that consensus had been reached on lifting restrictions from 5am to 5pm. The council of ministers met at the CM’s residence on Sunday night to discuss the status of Covid cases and the state’s preparation to combat black fungus. Fresh guidelines will be announced on Monday. Education minister Govind Singh Dotasra told TOI that they had carefully studied the Union government’s guidelines to arrive at a conclusion. “In Level-1, cities and districts with 2.5% positivity will see re-opening of most of the activities. In Level-II, cities and districts with a 5% positivity rate will lift restrictions but not as much like Level-1,” said Dotasra. He added that the weekend curfew from Friday evening to 5am on Monday will continue in the state. Commenting on reopening of schools, Dotasra said institutions will be allowed to function with 50% strength. “Since cases are falling, academic work including online classes should start soon. It will set the tone for private schools to start re-opening under strict guidance without students,” said Dotasra. “Our government is committed to providing employment for youths. I have discussed at the meeting that the process of pending exams should be started,” said Dotasra. The council of ministers agreed that they have to look for a middle path keeping the livelihood of people and keeping them safe from the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-in-favour-of-lifting-curbs-from-5-am-to-5-pm-says-dotasra/articleshow/83292034.cms||---
---||Kochi||MDMA seizure: Drug stored in special cabin of truck||KOCHI: A special team of Ernakulam Rural police which seized nearly two kilograms of MDMA from Angamaly on Saturday night said that the accused had used a specially designed compartment in their pickup truck to transport the drug into the district. The special investigation team led by district police chief (Ernakulam Rural) SP K Karthick would probe further into the seizure. The accused were taken to the rented house at Kuzhuppilly where they used to stay for evidence collection, soon after the seizure late on Saturday. The duo was presented before a magistrate and was remanded in judicial custody. The seizure was made from a location at Karukutty. The accused, Sivaprasad alias Shyam, 29, of Cherthala and Abid, 33, of Thaliparambu were smuggling it from Chennai when they landed in police net. The vehicle was searched based on a confidential alert received by SP Karthick. Police said the accused had brought the contraband for distributing it into various locations in the state. “Abid is a history-sheeter and has served time for peddling ganja. We are widening the probe now and the connections and history of the accused would be thoroughly analyzed,” said a police officer. Police said that they would seek the accused in custody for further probe into the seizure. “They were arrested through a tactical operation. The drugs were specially packed and were stashed in a compartment in their truck,” said an officer. SP Karthick on Sunday congratulated the members of the District Anti Narcotic Special Action Task Force (Dansaf), K V Nizar, P M Shaji, T Shyamkumar, Jaabir, Ranjith, Manoj Kumar and officers of Angamaly police station M Subin, M P Mathew and Rony Augustine for their crucial involvement in making the seizure. In the case of MDMA, also known as molly or ecstasy, possession of a quantity above 10g is considered as a commercial quantity. As per NDPS Act, possession or transport of a commercial quantity of the substance can invite a punishment of rigorous imprisonment of 10 to 20 years and fine of Rs 1 to 2 Lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mdma-seizure-drug-stored-in-special-cabin-of-truck/articleshow/83290829.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Shops open till 5pm, restaurants till 10pm, religious places, education institutes to remain shut in Nagpur||NAGPUR: Though eligible for complete unlocking, guardian minister Nitin Raut, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and collector Ravindra Thakare have decided to play safe and resume activities in phased manner to prevent any rise in Covid-19 cases or deaths in the district. They have allowed essential and non-essential shops, malls, saloons, gyms, theatres to remain open till 5pm, and restaurants and bars till 10pm, while keeping religious places, educational institutions, political programmes etc closed. Similarly, four more districts of Vidarbha; Yavatmal, Chandrapur, Gondia and Washim, have avoided full unlock as suggested in the level-I order from state government. All five districts issued the unlock notifications on Sunday, mostly in line with relaxations for level-III districts. Radhakrishnan and Thakare took permission from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and chief secretary Sitaram Kunte in meetings for this strategy. Raut said, “Seating capacity on two-wheelers, three-wheelers and four-wheelers will be as per RTO registration. Restaurants, bars and theatres will have to operate at 50% capacity. Private and government offices are allowed 100% capacity till 5pm. We continued cap on attendance in marriage ceremonies, social, cultural and entertainment programmes, which is 50% of hall capacity or 100 persons, whichever is lower. Funerals can have up to 50 persons. All meetings and election programmes will continue online.” Raut said, “After the high number of cases and deaths in second wave, we don’t want to take any risk. We will watch till Thursday and take further decision on Friday. More relaxations may be given in case there is no rise in weekly test positivity rate (TPR) and percentage of oxygen bed occupancy.” Radhakrishnan said, “Around 200 people are testing positive daily. Active cases are around 3,500. Therefore, resumption of all activities in phased manner is inevitable.” Asked the reason for not allowing religious places, Raut said, “We are forced to resume commercial establishments and private offices to avoid financial crisis. Pandemic is not over yet and there are projections of third wave. Police will barricade two ends of all markets after 5pm. There will be restrictions on gatherings and movement of five or more people after 5pm.” Now, Raut said, “Stress will be on tracing, testing and treatment of contacts and comorbid. Vaccination of all eligible people will be completed as soon as possible, especially all mothers, for safety of children. All preparations will be completed for third wave. Stringent action will continue on those not wearing mask and violating guidelines.” The remaining seven districts in Vidarbha are already in level-III, so these districts also announced similar unlock rules. Common features of all districts in Vidarbha are – Shops including non-essentials will remain open till 4/5 pm, restaurants to function at 50% capacity. Most districts are keeping cinema halls closed while auditoriums will start with 50% occupancy. The biggest relief for Vidarbha is there will be no need to get e-pass for travelling anywhere within Vidarbha. Passes are required only for those coming from level-V districts to other regions. Maharashtra state has no level-V district so far. So, travelling throughout the state has become pass-free now. Even public transport has been allowed at full capacity. Amravati, and Akola are the districts where positivity rate is reducing, but bed occupancy was still high. Both districts reported a good number of recoveries on Sunday. Akola collector Jitendra Papalkar said orders will be reviewed on Thursday as per government directives and new relaxations or restrictions could be announced. “Akola’s oxygen bed occupancy is also reducing fast. We are hopeful for level improvement next week. For this, I appeal to people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour,” Papalkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/shops-till-5pm-restros-till-10pm-religious-places-edu-insts-to-remain-shut/articleshow/83292032.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Pune||Woman, paramour held for husband’s murder||Pune: The Loni Kalbhor police on Saturday arrested a resident (19) of Urali Kanchan and her paramour (19) on the charge of strangulating her husband (27) to death in her house in the early hours of May 24. Police said that the woman Ashwini Hande, a homemaker, had claimed that her husband had succumbed to Covid-19. “The woman’s paramour Gaurav Santosh Sutar, is unemployed and resides in Mantarwadi on Solapur highway. Ashwini and Sutar knew each other before she got married to Manohar Hande around a year ago. The two were in love and they wanted to get rid of Hande to get together,” senior inspector Rajendra Mokashi of the Loni Kalbhor police said. “Initially, we had registered a case of accidental death, but the postmortem report revealed that Manohar had died of strangulation,” he said. Assistant inspector Raju Mahanor and police constable Digambar Salunke became suspicious of the death and started investigating the case. “Some of the relatives too were suspicious of Manohar’s sudden death after recovery,” Mokashi said. “Soon, we realized that Hande had recovered from Covid and was fine. Investigation gained momentum after the postmortem report revaled that the deceased died because of strangulation. We probed call detail records and it was established that Ashwini and Sutar were together at Hande’s residence on the night of the incident,” Mokashi said. “The two first offered him milk with sleeping pills and strangulated him to death around 2am,” he said. “Ashwini claimed that her husband was isolating himself in another room because of Covid and she did not know how he had died,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-paramour-held-for-husbands-murder/articleshow/83292033.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Second Covid wave: 1,000 deaths in 1 month in Thiruvananthapuram||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The district took more than a year to breach the 1,000-death mark during the first wave of Covid-19 last year. However, it recorded the next 1,000 deaths in less than a month, indicating the severity of the second wave of infections. As on Sunday, total Covid deaths in the district stood at 2,071. A month ago the number of officially confirmed Covid deaths in the district was 989; as on April 30. A comparison of deaths in two waves of the pandemic in the district shows that mortality rates in two age groups — 60-69 and 70 plus — decreased after April 18 whereas mortality rates in the comparatively younger age groups — 10-39 and 40-59 — increased considerably in the last two months. If the death rate among the 10-39 age group was 4% before April, it increased to 5% in the next two months. The mortality rate among the 40-59 age group increased from 25% to 31% in the same period. The older age groups which faced the brunt of Covid-19 in the first wave saw the mortality rates dip from 39% to 38% in 70 plus age category and from 32% to 26% in 60-69 age category. The proportional share of cases in all age groups has remained the same in first and second wave. Since the fourth week of April, the weekly number of cases in 40-60 age group had peaked from 3,912 to 8,369 by the second week of May. While the number of cases has now come down to 5,987 by the fourth week of May, number of deaths in this age group for every week rose from 16 in the fifth week of April to 66 in the fourth week of May. The mortality rate in the age groups, 10-19, 30-39 and 40-49 have increased considerably since April 18. The mortality rates among other age groups — 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89 and 90 plus — dipped from the pre-vaccination days. As on Wednesday, 917 deaths happened across all age groups in Thiruvananthapuram and after April 18, 962 deaths were recorded. There has also been a change in number of deaths in males and females in the first and second wave of pandemic. The mortality rate among women, which was 35% in 2020, has now increased to 40% in the second wave whereas the male mortality rate decreased from 65% to 60%. Between April and June, the number of confirmed Covid positive cases increased from 1.45 lakh to 2.6 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/second-wave-1k-deaths-in-1-month/articleshow/83290866.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||India||Mizoram, Haryana & Uttarakhand among fast movers in SDG Index||NEW DELHI: Rated as one of the three “fast moving states” with the highest gains by 12 points in development scores from 56 in 2019, Mizoram’s journey towards delivering on sustainable goals as assessed by the SDG Index 2020-21 clearly reflects steps taken to achieve a more sustainable and energy efficient way of life. Haryana with a 10 point improvement from 57 to 67 and Uttarakhand that moved up 8 points from 64 to 72 have also been classified as fast moving states, based on initiatives to do better across goals. In both these states, steps towards sustainable cities have evidently contributed to their scores. Also all three states have been rated as “achievers” under “affordable and clean energy” with a 100% score for electrification of households and access to gas connections - LPG and PNG. The SDG Index released by Niti Aayog categorises performance based on indicators over a score that ranges from aspirants at the bottom with a score of 0-49 followed by performers (50-64), front runners (65-99) and achiever (100). In terms of “responsible consumption and production”, Mizoram’s score improved from a low 50 (performer) to an impressive 87 (front runner). The entire biomedical waste generated was being treated by the state. The usage of nitrogen fertiliser out of total (NPK -- Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Pottassium) was down to 54.2% when compared to 75.7% in 2019. Similarly, in case of targets linked to "climate action", the share of renewables in total energy mix (including allocated shares) was 65.5% in 2020 which was an increase over 65.5% in 2019. However, there are challenges too that need to be addressed to achieve the targets. It turns out that Mizoram’s forest cover is down from 86.27% to 85.41%. While door to door waste collection across wards increased from 80.5% to 100%, individual household toilets constructed against targets was just 18% and installed sewage treatment capacity to sewage generated was 9.8%. In the case of Haryana, wards with 100% door to door waste collection went up from 91.4% to 93.9% between 2019 to 2020. Also wards with 100% waste segregation increased from 50.2% to 65%. The installed sewage treatment capacity to sewage generated increased from 60% to 115.76%. Meanwhile, even as Haryana made gains and is trying to achieve "zero hunger", there is still much that needs to be done. In terms of gender equality the state still remains an aspirant with the score of 36 to 43 in 2020. When one looks at Uttarakhand’s performance chart, it comes through that the state has made significant improvement in good health and well-being. It turns out that the under 5 mortality rate (per 1000 live births) declined from 47 to 33 in 2020. It also comes through that 90% of children within 9-11 months were immunised in 2020 and institutional deliveries accounted for 88.80% (up from 52.5% in 2019). However, there are concerns, like the maternal mortality rate (per 1 lakh live births) increased from 89 to 99 in 2020. The performance chart also shows that all wards in the hill state have 100% door-to- door waste collection (up from 95.14% in 2019). However, individual household toilets constructed against the target declined from 90.27% to 75%. Also installed sewage treatment capacity to sewage generated declined from 31% to 26.88%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mizoram-haryana-uttarakhand-among-fast-movers-in-sdg-index/articleshow/83295264.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Kanpur||Kanpur Metro to work on energy conservation||Kanpur: Kanpur Metro trains and lifts will be equipped with Regenerative Braking Technology, which will help in energy conservation. Under this technique, the energy generated during application of brake (in metro train) will be conserved and used back in the metro system. Energy efficiency of Metro trains, which will run in Kanpur will be around 45 percent. It means out of every per thousand units used in running of train, almost 450 units will be generated through Regenerative Braking Technology, which would further be re-used in the system. In addition, escalators/elevators will be installed at stations. Depots will also be able to save energy with this technology. Energy efficiency of escalators/elevators would be 37 percent. The entire metro premises will have 100% LED lighting for energy saving. Apart from this, the plan is also being prepared to install solar panels at metro depots and stations. The polytechnic depot of Kanpur Metro will be equipped with a ‘Zero Discharge Facility’- the waste water will not be disposed or discharged but inclusively recycled and used for various purposes. There will be two water treatment plants to be installed at the depot. A sewage treatment plant (STP) of 10,000 liters per day capacity will be used to recycle gray water (water that comes from the kitchen, washroom, and floor cleaning etc). At the same time, an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) with a capacity of 70 thousand liters per day will be installed to recycle black water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-metro-to-work-on-energy-conservation/articleshow/83290008.cms||---

Many of these political parties like the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) are now planning to take up the revival of their state and district-level units soon. UP NCP will hold a state-level meeting to devise ways to strengthen the party organization in the state. State general secretary of the NCP Rampreet Sharma said, “We are yet to decide the meeting date. But we have been told by the headquarters to start working for assembly elections.” The party has appointed district presidents in at least 67 districts, Sharma said, admitting that the restricted movement due to the lockdown did halt the party’s plans in the state. Few of NCP office-bearers and their family members also got infected which further affected the party’s efforts in this direction, he added. NCP had held a state-level meeting in February to take stock of its situation in UP. The meeting was attended by national level office-bearers of the party. The state unit of the NCP had finalised a strategy to make inroads in rural UP. The meeting decided to rev up the organizational structure of the party in the state. Reaching out to farmers, mainly in the west UP, was highlighted as one of the main poll planks for the party. Unemployment was another issue that it had planned to harp on to attack the state government and reach out to the youth. The NCP had set up its office in the state in 2001. The upcoming state-level meeting will provide clarity on the party’s strategy for UP assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ncp-to-revive-statedist-level-units-in-up/articleshow/83292216.cms||Neha Shukla

He separately assured film and TV producers that shoots would be allowed as soon as Covid cases were controlled. He said to the industrialists that he wanted the state to suffer neither a lockdown by the state government nor a knockdown by the pandemic, but wanted to set an example before the country by keeping the industrial sector functioning despite Covid-19. Prominent industrialists, including Uday Kotak, Sanjiv Bajaj, B Thiagarajan, Naushad Forbes, Amit Kalyan, Ashok Hinduja, A N Subramanyam, Ajay Piramal, Harsh Goenka and Niranjan Hiranandani, were at the session, along with state Covid task force members Dr Sanjay Oak and Dr Shashank Joshi. Thackeray said the state was taking a “calculated risk” by easing curbs at various levels. He said the state had upgraded its infrastructure. “Industrial units should keep proper health-related records of their labourers and employees and their families as well those hailing from other states. They should not be responsible for spreading Covid infection while moving to their respective states or returning to Maharashtra,” he said. On the threat of a third wave, he said that if a lockdown was imposed again, manufacturing should not suffer. “They [industries] should plan to set up temporary accommodation for staff and labourers on premises and provisions should be made to tackle health issues,” he said. The industrialists suggested vaccination of construction and unorganised sector workers. They said IT workers could work from home for a month more. On the demand of film and TV serial producers that shooting should be allowed in Mumbai now, the CM said the local disaster management authority will decide on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cm-to-industry-dont-want-lockdown-by-state-or-knockdown-by-coronavirus/articleshow/83292057.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

---||Delhi||14 new pollution hotspots emerging in Delhi-NCR: Report||NEW DELHI: The National Capital Region is seeing the emergence of new pollution hotspots. An analysis for the winter season of 2020-2021 by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) found heavy deterioration in air quality in places not yet designated as hotspots. As many as 14 stations registered higher seasonal PM2.5 concentration than Delhi’s winter average. Experts say it points to the impact of local pollution sources. Central Pollution Control Board and Delhi Pollution Control Committee had earlier identified 13 hotspots in Delhi: these were Rohini, Dwarka, Okhla Phase-II, Punjabi Bagh, Anand Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Jahangirpuri, RK Puram, Bawana, Mundka, Narela and Mayapuri. Six pollution hotspots were identified last winter in other NCR towns — two in Faridabad, one each in Gurugram, Bahadurgarh, Bhiwandi and Sahibabad. These areas were found to have annual average levels higher than themean value of the city. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to the CSE analysis, the 14 locations that are emerging as the new hotspots have registered a higher seasonal average than the mean of the recognised hotspots, that is, 197 micrograms per cubic metre. These stations also recorded mean PM2.5 concentration higher than the Delhi winter average of 186 micrograms per cubic metre. The new areas of concern are: Alipur, DTU, ITO, Nehru Nagar, Patparganj, Sonia Vihar and Vivek Vihar in Delhi; Sector 1 and 116 in Noida, Loni, Sanjay Vihar and Indirapuram in Ghaziabad; and Knowledge Park V in Greater Noida and Bulandshahr. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director research and advocacy at CSE, said, “This essentially brings out that newer pollution hotspots are proliferating in the city. Both meteorological conditions as well as changing patterns of local pollution sources are contributing to this trend. This requires intense micro-planning and implementation as well as city and regionwide action at a scale and speed.” CSE stated that Nehru Nagar was the most polluted among these 14 locations, followed by DTU. Meanwhile, parts of Delhi are likely to receive rain on Monday, according to India Meteorological Department. Though the mercury is set to rise, the temperatures may again come down after a few days as the city is predicted to receive another spell of rain from June 12. On Sunday, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) was 134 in the ‘moderate’ category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/14-new-pollution-hotspots-emerging-in-ncr-report/articleshow/83290958.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Yadav was externed by Auraiya district administration in March 2021 for a period of six months. Subsequently, he was arrested under the Gangsters’ Act from the Umarsana area and sent to jail. He was elected as a zila panchayat member from Bhagyanagar block-4 in Auraiya in the recently concluded panchayat election. Yadav, who was released on bail from Etawah district jail on Friday evening, joined a procession on the Etawah-Auraiya highway allegedly with a large number of vehicles in violation of Covid-19 protocol, said senior superintendent of police Etawah Brijesh Kumar Singh. The video of the procession which was widely circulated on Social media platforms shows Yadav travelling in an Audi car with his supporters, who are raising slogans in his favour. Yadav, who is a native of Umarsana village of Dibiyapur in Auraiya, have been facing more than two dozen cases including those of attempt to murder. “After the registration of a case under various sections of the IPC, including 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) besides under section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act against the SP leader and his supporters at the Civil Lines police station, we formed eight police teams and seized Audi vehicle being used by Yadav and 23 other vehicles of his supporters. We also took 34 persons in custody from across Agra, Jalaun, Auraiya and Etawah district and are in the process of sending them to jail. Further investigations are underway in this regard, the SSP said. “The jail police out-post in-charge has been suspended over dereliction of duty with immediate effect. To investigate slackness of other police personnel, a probe is being conducted by additional superintendent of police Etawah, who will submit his report soon”, the SSP further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/34-booked-24-vehicles-including-an-audi-car-belonging-to-sp-leader-seized/articleshow/83290039.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Cabinet expansion prerogative of the CM, says Radha Mohan||LUCKNOW: BJP vice-president and UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh on Sunday scotched speculations that his meeting with UP governor Anandi Ben Patel had anything to do with cabinet expansion in UP. Singh, in fact, categorically maintained that cabinet expansion or its reshuffle was a "special prerogative" of the chief minister. His meeting with UP governor comes almost 10 days after CM Yogi Adityanath met Patel on May 27. Stressing that his meeting with the UP governor was purely a courtesy call, Singh reiterated that the Yogi government in UP and the BJP organisation in the state was working well and as per the expectations. His statement silenced the political buzz that started whirling about an immediate cabinet expansion, a day after senior BJP leaders including Singh and party national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh met party national president JP Nadda in Delhi. Incidentally Singh and Santhosh, who had camped in Lucknow for three days, to assess the functioning of the party and the state government had strongly backed Yogi’s decisions vis-a-vis Covid pandemic. This was seen as a key counter to the opposition driven narrative that sought to corner the ruling party over its alleged mismanagement in handling the lethal second wave of pandemic. While there are 53 ministers, including CM Yogi, there is scope for seven more persons to be inducted in the council of ministers. UP had, in fact, lost three UP ministers — Chetan Chauhan, Kamal Rani Varun and Vijay Kashyap -- to Covid since the outbreak of the pandemic last year. Their positions too remain vacant. Sources said that the ruling party may consider inducting key BJP leaders as ministers after assessing its requirement and given the political situation in the run up to UP assembly elections due next year. Speculations have, typically, been veering around ex-IAS officer-turned-BJP MLC, Arvind Kumar Sharma -- considered close to PM Narendra Modi -- being inducted in the state cabinet and being given a prominent portfolio. The speculations, however, have been losing steam as time passes. Not surprisingly, the political buzz left the UP BJP leadership flummoxed with party state president Swatantra Dev Singh dismissing them as mere rumors which did not hold much ground. "Nothing other than the rule of law works in the state. There is no scope for influential people getting favours," he said, while speaking to reporters. Singh, too, strongly backed Yogi as one of the most hardworking CMs the state has ever seen in recent times.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Help from NGO to make Covid-hit Sabars financially self-reliant||KOLKATA: Sabitri Sabar used to earn Rs 800 per week by making baskets, trays, table mats from Kashi grass and palm leaves but the pandemic has stopped her income and forced her to shift to another traditional work like making brooms out of bamboo and selling them in the local market. Around 12,000 Sabars live in Purulia’s 164 Sabar tolas. British law declared the Sabars a “criminal” tribe in 1872 while in 1952, they were delisted or denotified. But still, they are facing the stigma and are one of the most marginalized communities. Like Sabitri, there are hundreds of Sabars in the villages of Purulia, who are living a precarious life today. “The handicrafts, made with Kashi grass, date-palm leaves and bamboo, do not have takers any more. As there are no fairs and markets are closed, it has become difficult for us to sell the products,” said Sabitri of Akarbaid village. Nearly 400 Sabar families are engaged in making brooms out of bamboo. To make Sabars self-reliant, Paschim Banga Kheria Sabar Kalyan Samiti, an NGO, has come up with different initiatives during the pandemic. “We tried to focus on sustainable development so that Sabars become self-reliant. Providing relief cannot be a solution, so we encouraged them to make kitchen gardens, a traditional way of making brooms out of bamboo and preserving biodiversity and trees. We got immense help from district administration,” said Prasanta Rakshit, director of the organization. Bikram Mitra of Earth Craft, a social enterprise, has come forward to promote the Sabar handicrafts in the urban market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/help-from-ngo-to-make-cov-hit-sabars-financially-self-reliant/articleshow/83290873.cms||Dipawali Mitra
---||Lucknow||Release one-year pay to wife of missing BRO officer Subhan Ali: Delhi HC||LUCKNOW: A year after a Border Road Organisation (BRO) officer Subhan Ali, 27, went missing in Leh after his vehicle fell into the Drass river, the Delhi High Court has directed BRO to release one year’s pay to the officer’s wife, who is a native of Balrampur. Ali’s father Ramjan had moved the HC, seeking financial assistance in March this year. The court, in its order on Saturday, directed the BRO to make the payment on or before June 15, while hearing a petition filed by the officer’s family. The court also said that the amount, which will be released, “shall be adjustable from the total amount found due” to the officer’s family. The court has stated if the payment is not made on or before June 15, “the incumbent occupying the post of Director General, BRO shall be personally liable for non-compliance”. On June 22 last year, Ali, a native of Balrampur district, had gone missing after the vehicle in which he was travelling with a driver fell into the Drass river from the Zozila-Kargil-Leh road. During a hearing on Saturday, a bench of Justice Rajiv Sahai and Justice Amit Bansal came down heavily on BRO officers, saying they “appear to feel no pain whatsoever for families of the personnel employed”. The court also took note of the fact that even after one year of Ali being missing, no payment has been made to his family. On April 15, while hearing a petition filed by Ali’s father-Ramjan, the HC had directed the Central government and the BRO to pay “whatever amount it deems appropriate” to Ali’s family. Ali’s brother Sahban said that he hoped the BRO officers listened to the court this time. “My uncle died and we could not get him the kind of treatment we would have liked to due to financial issues. My sister is to be married and we need money for that too. These people were dependents on Subhan,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/release-one-yr-pay-to-wifeof-missing-bro-officer-hc/articleshow/83292254.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Sold for marriage at Rs 80,000, woman rescued from grip of eight Gujarat natives||LUCKNOW: A team from women’s police station in Barabanki arrested eight people from Gujarat on Saturday on charges of human trafficking. The arrested persons were identified as Sahil Pancha and his relatives Pappu Bhai Sharma, Apoorva Pancha, Geeta Ben, Neeta Ben, Shilpa Ben, Rakesh and Sahil’s father Ajay Bhai, all from Gujarat. “Sahil is acquainted with Ramu Gautam of Barabanki who used to work in Gujarat. Sahil was unmarried and asked Ramu to look for a girl for his marriage and offered him money. Ramu, who had returned to his native place during lockdown, talked to Chand Ram Verma about Sahil’s marriage proposal. Chand Ram’s son Prince had a love marriage with an Assamese woman. As Chand Ram was unhappy with his son’s marriage, he conspired to sell Prince’s wife to Sahil for Rs 80,000. He took Rs 40,000 in advance and transferred Rs 20,000 into Prince’s bank account on June 4,” superintendent of police, Barabanki, Yamuna Prasad said. “When Prince, who was in Ghaziabad, inquired about the money, his father refused to explain but asked him to send his wife to Barabanki as he was unwell. On June 4, Prince sent his wife to Barabanki to take care of his father,” the SP said. Sahil, his father and relatives reached Barabanki on June 5 and Ramu Gautam arranged a hotel room for them. The same evening, Chand Ram told his daughter-in-law that his health had improved and asked her to go with Ramu Gautam who would drop her to Ghaziabad. “In the meantime, Prince’s brother-in-law tipped him off about the illegal act. Prince reached Barabanki but did not find his wife and his father at home,” the SP said. He came to know that his father, wife and a few other persons had gone to Barabanki railway station. Prince reached the railway station and informed the police which reached the spot and arrested Sahil, his father and other relatives and rescued Prince’s wife. Prince’s father and his aides managed to flee the scene. Police said Prince fell in love with the girl in 2019 when he was working as a taxi driver in Ghaziabad and later married her in a temple in Barabanki.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/8-gujarat-natives-held-for-humantrafficking-for-forced-marriage/articleshow/83292172.cms||---

The arrested persons were identified as Shailendra Singh, his mother Nanhi Singh, and Ravi Singh, all of Madiaon. Police recovered Rs 5 lakh each from Shailendra and his mother and Rs 1.15 lakh from Ravi (total Rs 11.15 lakh). “Ravi and Shailendra are friends and had worked as ATM custodian for a government bank.

Husnafathima, a Class VI student and sister of Siddharth’s classmate and the school authorities had shelled out the money to buy him the phone. It means a lot to the boy who has been forced to shuttle between a single-room shed and relatives’ houses along with his parents, siblings, grandmother and great grandmother. He doesn’t even have a safe place to keep his books. The family has been struggling to find a safe shelter since their home was destroyed in rains in 2018. An uprooted tree had fallen over their house and damaged it completely. Siddharth’s grandmother, Deepa S, who is a worker of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, then approached the authorities with the request to provide a safe home to them.  “Along with the kids, we moved to a temporary shelter built using corrugated roofing sheets. But it was not safe to live in as there were many dangerous reptiles. Twice we narrowly escaped from snake bites. Many officials visited our house and took photos but no further action was taken. We find it really difficult to live in the shed,” said Deepa. Siddharth, along with his family, is now staying at his relative’s home where already five people are residing. Siddharth’s family does all the cooking and store their things in the dilapidated shed. Sidharth doesn’t even have enough space to keep his study materials. Mangalappuram panchayat president Suma said she was unaware of the reason why they were not enlisted in any of the housing schemes of the state government. She added that she was not sure whether the family had filed an application in the LIFE Mission scheme. “We are extremely happy and thankful to all who took the initiative to get a mobile phone for Siddhu. Even if we had tried we would not have been able to buy him a mobile phone,” Deepa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/siddhu-has-a-smartphone-but-no-place-to-call-home/articleshow/83290882.cms||---

Kumar was posted as the manager of the bank’s Asha Parari branch under Simri police station area of Buxar district. He was arrested from his Himgiri Palace flat near Panchamukhi Temple under S K Puri police station area in Patna. The Bhabhua regional manager of the bank, Vikash Kumar Bhagat, had lodged an FIR with Simri police station against Kumar, his father, wife, his brother and other unknown persons for embezzlement of Rs 1.09 crore from the customers’ bank accounts. The matter first surfaced on May 31. Kumar and four other bank staff have been suspended. The bank authorities had initially estimated the embezzlement of more than Rs2 crore. Sources said around 120 customers of Asha Parari branch were affected from the fraud. “Senior bank authorities are camping at the Asha Parari branch for detailed internal inquiry,” he said. Sources said Kumar not only made fraudulent transactions from the savings accounts of customers, but also diluted several fixed deposits and transferred the amount into the bank accounts of his family members and other associates. Buxar SP Neeraj Kumar Singh said Kumar was being interrogated. “Kumar’s father Umesh and other family members are evading arrest. Raids are being conducted to nab the other accused, whose bank accounts had been used for fraudulent transfer of money by Kumar,” he said. The SP said the embezzled amount may rise further as the internal inquiry of the bank authorities was still going on. Sources said the bank’s vigilance team is expected to probe another branch at Rajpur Kala near Simri where the arrested manager had been posted earlier. “A couple of complaints about money withdrawal from bank accounts of customers without their knowledge have been reported there also,” a source said. Sources said that the bank’s chairman, Dr SA Javed, held a virtual meeting with general managers and all regional managers on Saturday and rapped them for the lapses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bank-manager-held-for-rs1-09-crore-fraud/articleshow/83289346.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Nagpur||Nagpur City school’s 5-year-old policy offers free education to student if earning parent dies||NAGPUR: A CBSE school’s policy, implemented in 2015, has proved to be a godsend for five students who lost their earning parent to Covid-19. The Achievers School (TAS) provides free education right up to the board level, if any of its enrolled students loses the family breadwinner. Though this is the sixth year of the policy, it was during the Covid-19 pandemic that its charitable objective was truly achieved. ‘EduShield’ is a concept thought up by school director Sapna Katiyar, after a chance meeting with some corporate insurance representatives. “They were basically trying to sell us some insurance options, where a child’s fee is taken care of in certain circumstances. But then I decided that our school itself must offer such a policy for all our students,” said Katiyar. In the post-Covid era, five students have benefited from EduShield. “The numbers before Covid-19 were less than that,” said Katiyar. Apart from conceptualizing the policy, Katiyar had made up her mind that EduShield had to be offered free of cost. “We do not charge anything extra for this. There is an enrolment form which is given at admission, in which the name of the main earning family member has to be mentioned. This process is mandatory and we do not proceed with admission till the form is filled,” said Katiyar. Initially, parents were not to keen to register for this, even though it’s free. “Some parents felt uncomfortable about death being discussed, but soon everybody was on board,” said Katiyar. While many families who have witnessed death of the earning member struggle with fee payments, those at TAS find their kids’ educational future secure. “A child’s father died due to Covid-19 and the surviving members were scared that they were not enrolled in EduShield. But we told them that registration was mandatory, and the child’s fees is now the school’s responsibility,” said Katiyar. While other schools also consider partial or full fee waiver on a case-to-case basis, TAS stands out because of its ‘no questions asked’ mantra. “We don’t review the case and don’t call for multiple documents. Once we receive the death certificate for the person whose name is registered in EduShield, it’s done. From that day on, the student does not need to pay any fee,” said Katiyar, who was engaged in the IT sector before starting the school 13 years ago. The school clarified that this policy is applicable only for enrolled students. “Those seeking admissions now, after a death in the family, won’t be covered,” said Katiyar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-schools-5-yr-old-policy-offers-free-edu-to-student-if-earning-parent-dies/articleshow/83292048.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Allahabad||Now, ‘micro’ plan to overcome distance barrier for rural vax recipients||Prayagraj: Witnessing low turnout of recipients at rural-based vaccination centres i.e. community \ primary health centres (CHCs\ PHCs) at the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive, the officials of the health department are busy chalking out a micro plan to reach out to eligible recipients especially those whose villages are located far from community \ primary health centres. Officials claimed that many villages in the district are very far from community or community sub-health centres and primary health centres and that the eligible beneficiaries have to travel over a long distance for getting vaccinated. However, officials, after preparing a list of villages that are far from vaccination centres, are chalking out a plan to set up special camps at prominent village markets, gram sabha, primary schools, panchayat Bhawan and ANM centres to cover the maximum rural crowd of recipients. For that, two special vaccination teams would be deployed at each block and a team of primary health workers like ASHA, ANM and Anganwadi workers would be informing the eligible recipients about the details of the special vaccination drive in advance and appealing them to get inoculated. Additional chief medical officer and Nodal officer (National Health Mission) Dr Satyendra Rai told TOI that the department is preparing a micro plan to cover the maximum number of rural-based eligible recipients for vaccination and at least two special teams would be deployed at every block of the district. He added, "We are making sincere efforts to increase the turnout at the rural-based vaccination centres and after finding out that a section of recipients could not reach CHC\PHC concerned for vaccination because of the long-distance. We would be holding special camps at primary schools, panchayat bhawan, ANM centres, anganwadi centres, and gram sabha bhawans. Officials, meanwhile, claimed that in contrast to rural areas, there has been an increasingly better response in urban areas where people agree that vaccination is the only key to beat the virus. As a result, there has been an increase in the number of recipients at urban vaccination centres. As many as 6,21,948 shots were administered to recipients of all age groups, including those above 45 years and between the age group of 18-44 in the district till June 5. While 5,02,760 beneficiaries had taken the first dose of vaccine, a total of 1,19,587 recipients had also received the second dose of the vaccine. Figures of the health department revealed that on average, over 10,000 vaccine doses were administered to beneficiaries daily of all age groups, including 45 plus and recipients between the age group of 18-44 years in the district. For instance, a total of 10,106 vaccine shots were administered to recipients of all age groups in the past 24 hours which included 7,232 recipients of the first dose and 2,874 of the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/now-micro-plan-to-overcome-distance-barrier-for-rural-vax-recipients/articleshow/83289904.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Covaxin, Covishield give 95% protection, finds study||HYDERABAD: Covishield and Covaxin, the two vaccines currently widely available in the country, provide up to 95% protection from Covid-19 after two doses of vaccination, reveals a research study conducted on healthcare workers. None of the vaccinated people, who had Covid-19 following either vaccine, had severe Covid-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. The study spanned over 13 states and 22 cities including Hyderabad and Guntur in Andhra Pradesh. Results of the study published in preprint server MedRxiv on June 4 showed recipients of either vaccine had similar solicited mild to moderate adverse events and none had severe or unsolicited side effects. This cross-sectional study is perhaps the first-of-its-kind that involved healthcare workers, who had both doses of vaccination, from across India. Most studies on vaccine efficacy so far have been lab-based experiments. “Combined results of both vaccines showed 95% seropositivity to anti-spike antibodies 21 to 36 days after the second completed dose,” the study said.“In all 95% showed seropositivity after two doses of both vaccines. While no difference was observed in relation to sex, body mass index, blood group and any comorbidities, people with age over 60 years or those with type 2 diabetes had a significantly lower seropositivity rates,” the study said. Both vaccine recipients had similar solicited mild to moderate adverse events and none had severe or unsolicited side effects. Researchers from various hospitals and research centres across the country were part of the study. The corresponding author was AK Singh of GD Hospital and Diabetes Institute, Kolkata. Researchers from Hyderabad and Guntur were also part of the study. According to the researchers, both vaccines elicited good immune response after two doses. Seropositivity rate was significantly more in participants with age less than 60 years (96.3% seropositivity) as against 87.2% in those above 60 years. “Amongst the captured co-morbidities, people with type 2 diabetes mellitus had a significantly lower seropositivity rate (84.6%) compared to those without diabetes (96.1%) in overall study,” the research study said. Further delving into lifestyle diseases and vaccination, the researchers said people with type 2 diabetes of shorter duration (less than five years) had a higher seropositivity rate (100%) compared to those having longer duration (more than five years) at 89.5%. This was consistently observed in both Covishield and Covaxin recipients. The study said although no difference of seropositivity rate was observed in people with hypertension or high blood pressure, those having shorter (less than five years) duration had a significantly higher seropositivity (100%) as against 88% for those with longer duration (hypertension for more than five years). “Intriguingly, no significant difference in seropositivity rate was observed between Covid-19 naïve (people, who were not infected by Covid-19) as against people with past history of coronavirus infection, after the two complete doses of both vaccines. No differential antibody seropositivity rate was observed in relation to types of blood group, presence or absence of dyslipidemia (irregular lipid levels in blood), ischemic heart disease and treatment regime of diabetes mellitus and hypertension,” the study revealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-covishield-give-95-protection-finds-study/articleshow/83293578.cms||Syed Akbar

A helping hand has also been extended to several families in Amlamethi, Marhurakhanda and Satya Narayanpur in Gosaba block in the Sunderbans, which were affected by the cyclone Yaas. Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, chairman of IHA Foundation, who visited these places, said, “Last year, Amphan had caused a huge damage in these areas and before people could recover from its ravages, Yaas hit them again. There were less injuries this time but people have been facing acute poverty as many have lost their livelihood. The base of many houses got washed away and the remaining structure stands on just bamboo.” He added, “People here don’t fear coronavirus any more. But they fear that cyclone and hunger will kill them.” Along with the relief materials, a detailed survey is being conducted to assess the impact of Yaas in these areas to work out sustainable rehabilitation plans. “The ponds and farmlands inundated by saline water affect the livelihoods of the villagers with long-term effects,” Ahluwalia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/relief-for-250-cyclone-affected-families/articleshow/83290902.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow crosses 10 lakh jabs, but women’s participation remains low||LUCKNOW: As the city crossed the milestone of administering 10 lakh dosages of Covid-19 vaccines, a scrutiny of data reveals a gender gap among beneficiaries of all categories. The reasons, experts say, could be lack of eligibility as pregnant women are not being inoculated due to risk factors. Also, many lactating mothers are unaware that they have been allowed to take the vaccine. Other factors include hesitancy due to various reasons and patriarchal social set-up. Besides, as per 2011 census, the percentage of women is lesser (47.8%) in comparison to men in Lucknow’s about 46 lakh population. Further, the gap between the healthcare and frontline workers is lesser because women participation in the workforce is less. Vaccination figures since the start of the drive on January 16 till June 4 shows that the women’s share among beneficiaries (43%) is 4 percentage points lesser than their proportion in the population. The percentage of women who have been fully vaccinated after taking two doses is even lower (36%). According to health officers, second dose women beneficiaries are lesser in comparison to first dose recipients because their turnout increased gradually — post-second-wave in May third week. This rise led to more women getting first dose than earlier, although their number still remained lower than men, they added. The percentage of second dose women beneficiaries will rise in the coming months because those who took the first shot in May will be eligible for the second after 12-16 weeks - around August-September, health officials explained. Doctors say that one of the major reasons for lower number of women getting vaccinated is that pregnant women do not qualify for vaccination, while permission to inoculate lactating mothers was given on May 20. Earlier, both were advised not to take the vaccine due to certain risk factors. However, later scientists reviewed the effects and on their advice the government allowed lactating mothers to take vaccines. The decision to permit pregnant women is still under consideration. Prof Smirti Agrawal, faculty at gynaecology department, KGMU, said that after vaccination for lactating mothers was allowed, the participation of women has slightly increased from the third week of May. Besides, she added, due to some socio-religious beliefs and rumours that it affects fertility, some families are not allowing women in the house to get vaccinated. “Another factor is that in our society women are mostly dependent on male members to take them to hospital for stepping out of the house. In traditional families, women tend to prefer male members, who go out for work, getting vaccinated first. Long queues for vaccination and overcrowding can also be a deterrent for some,” said Prof Jamal Masood, head department of community medicine and public health, KGMU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-crosses-10l-jabs-but-womens-participation-remains-low/articleshow/83292194.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The audit will help LU get a better position in the National Institutional Ranking Framework and in the National Assessment and Accreditation Council. In a span of six months, a team of environmental experts from a Lucknow-based private company has analysed and documented the flora and fauna of the campus, level of cleanliness, monitoring of energy consumption, quality of water conservation and organic and solid waste generation and management. The report also suggests ways to make the campus green and eco-friendly. The green audit report highlights that LU is saving Rs 5 lakh per month on electricity bills due to the installation of 1000-kilowatt solar panels. It also reveals that the university is extremely rich in flora with over a hundred trees of around 40 varieties on the campus. These include sandalwood, Parijaat, white siris, chir, rubber, chinaberry, palm, Ashok, Palash and khirni. Besides, more than 65 species of birds were found on the campus in the green audit report. These include hornbill, tree pie, owl, barbet, sunbirds and robins. Adding to the vibrancy are around 25 species of butterflies on the campus. “The university is extremely rich in flora and fauna and now we have a proper record of it in the form of a green audit. The audit suggests that the varsity needs to conserve trees which are over 100 years old, install water metres to check water quality and adopt ways of waste management and water recycling,” said director of the Institute of Wildlife Sciences at LU Prof Amita Kanaujia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-campus-green-audit-finds-rich-flora-and-fauna-to-help-evaluation-scores/articleshow/83292195.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh records 1,165 fresh Covid-19 cases, positivity rate dips to 0.4%||LUCKNOW: To keep a close watch on the emergence of new cases of Covid-19, the state government has decided to maintain testing of samples in large numbers despite a dip in the number of fresh cases in the last few days. The government has also announced a special vaccination drive for women at ‘women special centres’ from Monday. According to figures issued by the government, the health department conducted 3.1 lakh tests even as the state recorded 1,165 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours. The figure was marginally up from Saturday’s 1,092 cases. While Jalaun and Kaushambi did not record any new case, Kanpur reported maximum 102 cases, followed by Gautam Budh Nagar (91). Meerut and Lucknow reported 55 and 42 cases, respectively. The state, however, recorded 101 deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the total death toll to 21,252. Additional chief secretary, health, Amit Mohan Prasad said more samples were being tested as part of the strategy to keep a check on new cases. As on Sunday, as many as 5.13 crore tests have been conducted in the state. Active cases have further come down to 17,900 from 18,438 on Saturday. Of these, 10,141 patients are in home isolation which indicates that the burden on health infrastructure has decreased. The positivity rate was registered at 0.4%, while recovery rate stood at 96.7%. In terms of vaccination, the state government has vaccinated more than 1.66 crore people with the first dose while 36.27 lakh have received both the doses. At least 31.24 lakh people in the age group of 18-44 years have been administered the first dose of vaccine. Prasad said the state government was conducting sero-surveillance study to ascertain the extent of the spread of virus in people of various age groups in urban as well as rural areas. The study, which started on June 4, entails collecting blood samples of around 62,000 people. “The infection has reduced but has not been wiped out completely,” he said, cautioning people to take adequate precautionary measures. Meanwhile, the state government said it has managed to meet the immediate crisis of oxygen and steps are being taken to make the state self-sufficient in medical oxygen production and there will be no need to source medical oxygen from other states in the long run. A state government spokesperson said on the instructions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, out of 416 oxygen plants to be set up in the state on a war footing, 72 have been established while work was on at 344 oxygen plants. As many as 25 oxygen plants are already functional in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-records-1165-fresh-covid-19cases-positivity-rate-dips-to-0-4/articleshow/83292188.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Corona curfew lifted in four districts, including Kashi after Covid tally dips below 600||LUCKNOW: The state government on Sunday announced lifting of partial Corona curfew in four more districts, including PM Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency of Varanasi, Noida, Ghaziabad and Muzzaffarnagar from Monday after the Covid count dipped below 600 in these districts. The decision was taken at a meeting presided by chief minister Yogi Adityanath. With this, curbs have been lifted in 71 districts, enabling economic activity between 7 am and 7 pm. However, night and weekend curfew from Friday evening till Monday morning will be in place across the state. Uttar Pradesh kicked off easing curfew in 67 districts from June 1 after the gradual flattening of the corona curve. Curfew, however, will continue in Lucknow which clocked 999 active cases, Gorakhpur 718 cases, Saharanpur 955 cases and Meerut 1,179 active cases. Any decision on lifting curfew in these districts would be taken on Tuesday, said additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal. He said, the state government was keeping vigil on these districts, which still have more than 600 active cases. The chief minister also pitched for raising number of vaccinations from the proposed 1crore in June to 3crore in July. An additional 3lakh vaccinators would be roped in, besides providing training to nursing students or seeking other options, he said. “The vaccination process needs to be expedited given the large population of UP,” Yogi said, underscoring the fact that the state had no shortage of vaccines amid Centre’s plans to provide more vaccine options. The CM also directed senior doctors, including CMOs, deputy CMOs and additional CMOs to open outpatient departments. He said, government hospitals, community and primary health centres should start OPD services on a rotational basis. He also pressed for deployment of doctors for medical service only, keeping them away from administrative and managerial duties. Yogi said, people should be encouraged to go in for tele-consultation and e-sanjeevani portal. Maintaining that rural areas have largely remained unaffected by the pandemic, Yogi directed officials to begin developmental activity by engaging MNREGS workers. The CM is also scheduled to flag off the programme of providing loans to local units from banks in the coming week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/corona-curfew-lifted-in-4-districts-including-kashi-after-covid-tally-dips-below-600/articleshow/83292232.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh civil society steps up to ensure dignity in death||VIJAYAWADA: Since the beginning of the pandemic, 51 civil society groups across Andhra Pradesh have helped in conducting the last rites of 4,187 unclaimed bodies, according to official police data. Felicitating the NGOs on Friday, director general of police D Gautam Sawang along with SPs of all police units recognised their efforts as ‘warriors of humanity’. Around 42% of these bodies are from Guntur Urban police limits with Amma Charitable Trust, Guntur Covid Fighters Team and Rudra Charitable Trust helping shift and cremate 1,800 dead bodies. In Rayalaseema region, Sadguru Datta Krupalayam aided in conducting last rites of 502 bodies across Kurnool town while Tirupati Muslim United Covid-19 Joint Action Committee cremated 550 bodies. Apart from organisations, individuals too have come forward in providing a dignified last journey for the deceased. In Rajahmundry Urban, M Bharat Raghava and his team helped cremate 330 bodies and, in the process, one of his friends’ Manikanta succumbed to Covid-19. In many instances, cops too took up the role of conducting the last rites, especially of Covid-19 patients who were abandoned by villagers and family members. Speaking on the occasion, Sawang said the second wave of the pandemic has challenged mankind and unleashed unrivalled human misery. “While the human misery we saw was unparalleled, we also saw kindness and humanity of the same magnitude,” Sawang said. All 51 groups, belonging to villages across the state, have together ensured a dignified last journey to a lot of unclaimed or orphaned bodies during both waves of the infection in the state. “This, while ensuring that the rituals prescribed by the belief of the person when he was alive are abided by,” Sawang said. For instance, the Pink Heart foundation, has cremated as many as 14 bodies in East Godavari district since the outbreak of Covid-19. The DGP and SPs felicitated these warriors and awarded them the label of ‘Manavathva Dheeras’ (warrior of humanity). “The help came during a phase when the systems were being burdened beyond belief, and a lot of bodies were being left unclaimed due to fear. As part of our duty, the police force has ensured a dignified last journey whenever we came across such incidents. Seeing citizens come out and do the same to support us is very heartwarming,” Sawang added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/civil-society-steps-up-to-ensure-dignity-in-death/articleshow/83266763.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Salons & gyms fear partial unlock will prove expensive||MUMBAI: With Monday’s reopening, gymnasia and beauty salons are only mildly hopeful of recovering lost clientele. They will have to close by 4pm and work by appointment and at 50% capacity. In fact, they fear the cost of full shop rent, electricity bills and staff salaries will outstrip the meagre income they earn from any partial reopening. Fitness consultant Irfan Rangrez, the owner of Gym Spirit, Andheri, said the Covid lockdown took effect just two months after his outfit opened in January 2020. “I have scarcely operated since then. Even now, I wish we were allowed to function for a few hours in the evening. I am biding my time before reopening since I will have to pay full rent, which is exorbitant, apart from staff salaries and bills and taxes. The government must consider granting some tax waivers and subsidies to our sector,” he said. Bandra beautician Hua-Shin Chen (Jenny) will reopen her salon after a two-month closure since April 5. She said, “We came to the parlour early Sunday morning and began deep cleaning the entire premises. I have recalled only one assistant because business has virtually been shut since 2020. Senior citizens are simply not stepping out of the house. I am strictly following all the norms of sanitisation, also because I myself am a senior citizen. I cannot risk my health either.” Like Jenny, Lee Mein Yang who runs a salon in Lokhandwala Complex, also does not plan to summon full staff to the family-run parlour just yet. “We may do so later once we see how business picks up. Meanwhile, we are making sure to follow all government guidelines,” she said. Meanwhile, a federation of salon and beauty parlour associations of Maharashtra has sought waiver on light and water bills, property tax, interest on loans and GST to mitigate losses. They also cite the extra cost incurred on disposable PPE kits and gloves, sanitiser and towels. “To adopt new hygiene standards, the government must encourage us with these waivers,” said coordinator Uday Takke, adding that they have 1.5 lakh members in the city. Advisor Bharat Jadhav said politicians and officers have been calling barbers home for a haircut during the lockdown. “If this is the importance we have, why are our demands not being considered?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-salons-gyms-fear-partial-unlock-will-prove-expensive/articleshow/83292165.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Nurse leaves behind unfilled dreams||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: ‘Without my son’s laughter and mischief, each day in my life has become a big zero’, were the words posted on Facebook by Aswathy Vijayan, who died in a road accident in Saudi Arabia on Friday, on her five-year-old son Dayal’s birthday last year. Vijayan, 31, was working as a nurse in King Khalid Hospital, Najran, for the last three years. After completing Bsc Nursing course from KIMS, Anayara, she worked at Credence hospital and Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital for some time. Since her family was financially weak, she took up the job in Saudi Arabia to pay off the family’s debts, including her educational loan which is yet to be repaid. She had completed her course after her marriage. Vijayan’s husband, Jijosh Mithra, who runs a bakery-cum-provision store, said that he was proud of his wife’s strong will. She had come home three months ago and had promised her son that she would be coming for his birthday in December this year, he said. “A few hours before the accident, Aswathy had called me and said that she along with her roommates were going out to purchase provisions and would call after the shopping. That was the last time I talked to her. After a while, I received a call from the hospital informing of her death,” said a tearful Jijosh. Aswathy’s children — Diksha and Dayal — who are staying with their father and grandparents are not aware of the untimely death of their mother, who often sent them surprise gifts. As Vijayan couldn’t bear to be away from her husband and children, they had decided to move to Saudi Arabia but it was postponed due to Covid-19. She used to make video calls at least two to three times daily to talk to her children. Meanwhile, efforts are on to repatriate the body that is kept at Thar General Hospital mortuary. The relatives expect the body to arrive within ten days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nurse-leaves-behind-unfilled-dreams/articleshow/83290909.cms||---

The presence of the B.1.617 variant, detected first in India earlier this year, was bare minimal in Punjab in the first three months. However, Delta recorded a growth of about 40% in just a month, worrying health experts as it is said to be up to 50% more transmissible than Alpha that is 50% more contagious than other common strains. If not contained, it will lead to faster spread of infection, resulting in increase in hospitalisation and fatality. From January to May, 2,213 samples have been sent to National Centre for Disease Control and CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology for whole genome sequencing. So far, a total of 1,164 (52.6%) have been processed, while results of 850 samples sent in May are awaited. The data reveals that out of 1,164 samples, variants of concern have been found in 1,022 samples (87.8%). In March, variants of concern were found in 672 samples – about 96% of the samples sent for genome sequencing – of which the Alpha variant was detected in about 95% samples, while the Delta variant was found only in 6% of samples. However, in April, out of 252 samples in which variants of concern were found, the number of Delta jumped to 117, over 46% of total samples, while in 132 the Alpha variant was found. Variant B.1 was found in three samples. After a sudden spike in the number of cases, Punjab was among the first few states in the country to start collecting samples for whole genome sequencing to know the reasons behind the rise. Combination of the two fast spreading variants of concern led to a surge of coronavirus cases during the second wave of the pandemic. Since January, as many as 4,11,475 cases, over 71% of total cases of 5,77,997, have been reported till date, while 9,668, over 64% of total deaths, have been registered during this period. Dr Rakesh Kumar Gupta, president, Strategic Institute for Public Health Education and Research (SIPHER), alerted that as the Delta variant is more transmissible than other lineages, the government and health authorities need to be proactive in planning containment and management measures. “The government and its public health experts need to stay ahead of the curve for better management of the situation ,” said Dr Gupta. Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer, maintained that the available data points at the Delta variant replacing Alpha. He further said the health department is taking steps for strict surveillance in the affected districts and has increased other containment and management measures including testing, contact tracing and timely treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/delta-variant-close-to-becoming-dominant-in-punjab/articleshow/83292128.cms||Vinod Kumar

The short video laced with stinging lyrics and titled “Dr Deivam” has garnered over 23,000 views in two days. According to the students, this is their way of registering a strong protest. “We were appalled at the manner in which a doctor was assaulted in Assam. Similar attacks on doctors are reported from our state as well. This has been happening for quite some time and sadly, people get away with it. This is our mode of protest,” says Anantha Krishna Prasad, final year MBBS student who wrote the song’s lyrics and performed in the music video. “We were preparing for our final MBBS exam, but we took a break from our studies and started working on it. It took us almost two days to complete the shoot and editing,” says Prasad who is also a vocalist with the medical college band. The one and a half minute long video, made by a few students of the 2016 and 2017 batches, was shot on the terrace of the college hostel. They are sharing it among their peer groups and they want the message to be conveyed and circulated to everyone. While Ambadi S Sastha and Kiran Ajith prepared the concept and made the video, Abdul Razique and Prasad crafted the sound design. Sunudev MP and Saran Santosh were also associated with the film. In the video, the students appeal to everyone to treat them like humans and not like God or a machine. Protest have been brewing among the medical community against the series of attacks on doctors while being on duty. The doctors said that no arrests have been recorded in assaults on medical professionals reported from Thrissur, Kozhikode, Palakkad, Alappuzha and Thiruvananthapuram in the past three months. “An FIR is filed and that’s the end of it. Nobody even takes it seriously and without exemplary punishments, medical community continues to be at risk and no one seems concerned which is at once frustrating and disappointing,” says a medical professional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/medicos-take-to-rap-to-protest-assault-on-docs/articleshow/83290955.cms||---

Residents claim that people coming in cars or on two-wheelers litter along the road in the area, which falls under Ward 63 of Dehradun municipal limits. The locals urged the civic body to take notice of the issue on priority.  They say that intervention of authorities is especially crucial as disposal of medical waste can lead to spread of Covid-19 in the area. Navin Rawat,who has been working to clean the green stretch along with six other residents since October last year, said, “The place has become the favourite spot for throwing all kinds of garbage.We have often raised the issue with the civic officials and the forest department but no concrete steps were taken to address the problem.” The residents even pooled money and got posters put up along the stretch, requesting people to not pollute the green belt, but there was no impact. Commuters started disposing of garbage on the stretch after mending their ways for some weeks. Vimal Singh, another local, said “We even took pictures of the vehicle registration numbers of the offenders and handed them over to the cops but no action was taken against them.” Meanwhile, officials of Dehradun Municipal Corporation when queried about the matter, said that they will deploy sanitation teams to clear the area regularly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/commuters-littering-along-sundarwala-ladpur-green-belt-area-locals-say-officials-not-taking-action-despite-several-requests/articleshow/83289387.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: 6,200 excess Covid deaths in April, highest-ever 8,745 in a month||NAGPUR: The city registered nearly 6,202 excess Covid deaths which were besides the normal count in April. Doctors and activists say the large number of excess deaths were either undetected Covid-19 fatalities or were indirectly due to the pandemic itself. The overall deaths were 8,745 in April which was the highest-ever in a month so far in the city’s history. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has compiled a data of cremations performed at 23 ghats, 10 kabrasthans and two Christian cemeteries in the city in April. Around 9,460 cremations were performed in the city in 30 days of April. The city had witnessed the peak of the highly-contagious and virulent second wave of the pandemic in April. Cases and deaths were highest-ever in April. The district had registered 2,290 Covid-19 deaths in April of which 1,232 were residents of the city, 857 from rural parts of the district and 201 from other districts who tested positive and succumbed while undergoing treatment in hospitals in the city. Around 60% (514) of the total deceased from rural parts of the district were cremated in the city. Similarly, 201 deceased from other districts were also cremated here. Thus, 8,745 cremated people were residents of the city. 1,311 cremations were done in the city in April last year which can be considered as routine number of deaths. Full lockdown was imposed in the city in April last year and the same was the case this year too. Thus, 2,543 were normal and Covid deaths. Accordingly, 6,202 deaths were excess which is five times that of Covid and also five times than normal fatalities. Thus, 7,434 deaths were directly or indirectly due to the pandemic in April. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “The number of excess deaths might be more than that estimated by the NMC. These deaths were directly or indirectly due to Covid-19. Among these deceased, few were RT-PCR negative Covid patients who are not taken into account by the authorities. Some might be post-Covid deaths who recovered and then died at home or during readmission. Many might be those who did not get tested. Some people died at home due to non access to medical care but might have had all symptoms of Covid-19. Some patients died due to other diseases like cancer, heart attack etc at home due to non access to medical care or irregular check up at hospitals due to Covid scare.” Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals’ Association Dr Anup Marar said, “The number of excess deaths is a stark reality. Excess deaths during April this year may point not only to the second surge victims but also to the others who lost their lives deu to non-Covid reasons. Both months had lockdown restrictions but this year, the public was miserably lax in following Covid-appropriate behavior and non-Covid emergency patients also faced hardships in getting beds. Lack of beds, either for needy Covid and non-Covid patients, insufficient drugs and negligence in Covid behavior compliance may be contemplated as causes for the alarming death statistics.” Dr Marar added, “It’s high time authorities planned a constructive methodology for the forthcoming third wave with enough facilitatory backup rather than only pointing fingers at others to hide their shortcomings.” With a firm belief that a survey is the need of the hour, activist Narayan Ahuja said, “All excess deaths were indirectly or directly due to the pandemic and were not counted in official numbers. Traffic movement was shut and lockdown was prevailing in April so no chances of a rise in unnatural deaths. In fact, unnatural deaths reduced. Therefore, the NMC should survey all excess deaths, right from March 2020 to April 2021, and add them to the Covid toll.” Talking about the issue, an NMC official said, “The highest deaths were 4,096 in September last year of which a majority were due to the pandemic. 8,745 fatalities in April were the highest-ever in a month in the city’s history.” The number of excess deaths increased to 9,488 in the 13 months of the pandemic and more than double compared to the fatalities of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/6200-excess-deaths-in-april-highest-ever-8745-in-a-month/articleshow/83292124.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Patna||Bihar: IITian develops animal scare device||BHAGALPUR: An IITian has developed a device to protect the standing crops from animals, birds and thieves. IIT-Kharagpur alumnus Ajit Kumar has named it Farm Surveillance cum Animal Scare Device (FSASD). Based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), the FSASD is a computerized electronic sensor device, which monitors the farms and agricultural field using day-and-night camera and AI-based algorithms running on the device continuously, Ajit told this newspaper on Sunday. The prototype of FSASD has been used in the agricultural fields and farms extensively at Khirighat, Antichak and several other villages under Kahalgaon subdivision in Bhagalpur district, he said, adding that the trials and testing to check its efficacy gave 100% results. The FSASD has a loud siren attached to it to scare the animals, birds and thieves in case they enter the agriculture farm. It also sends an alert notification message to the farmer on his/her mobile phone number, Ajit said. It is a visual image-catching device, which is powered by battery and kept in a field or mounted on a pole along with installed solar panels to charge the battery. “We were able to scare animals, birds and human suspects entering the farm and damaging the standing crops during our mock drills,” the IITian said, adding that it can be customized as per the farmer’s needs and demand. The cost of basic FSASD, including camera, solar panel, battery and other devices is Rs15,000 only, he said and added: "We are planning to attach other monitoring sensors with this device to monitor other aspects of the farm and farming activities along with surveillance to serve the farmers and to stop their losses." Ajit, a resident of Kahalgaon subdivision in Bhagalpur district, is a mechanical engineer. He left his plum job in a private sector at Mumbai and established a ‘startup' christened as ‘StepUpify Labs’ at Lalpur-Bhader village in Kahalgaon to serve the society to which he belongs to. He also imparts training to local youths in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) to make them employable, Ajit added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/iitian-develops-animal-scare-device/articleshow/83289392.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM to discuss Maratha quota with PM today||MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray will meet PM Narendra Modi in Delhi on Tuesday to discuss several issues, including the Maratha and OBC quota, cyclone Tauktae relief aid and the state’s pending GST dues. This is the first time since the MVA government came into power in Maharashtra in November 2019 that the former allies, Thackeray and Modi, will meet in person. On Monday, NCP president Sharad Pawar and deputy CM Ajit Pawar had a brief meeting with Thackeray. Ajit Pawar, cabinet minister and chairman of the Maratha reservation committee Ashok Chavan and chief secretary Sitaram Kunte will be part of the CM’s delegation. “Apparently, Thackeray was briefed on our stand on the Maratha reservation to be presented before the PM,” a senior NCP leader told TOI on the meeting between the CM and the Pawars. Last month, Thackeray had written to Modi requesting him to take steps to declare the Maratha community in Maharashtra as Socially and Educationally Backward (SEBC) through the National Commission of Backward Classes to enable them to claim reservation in education and government jobs. The issue has become a challenge for the state government after the Supreme Court in May struck down quota for the Maratha community in public sector and educational institutions as it exceeded the 50% cap imposed earlier. “The Maratha community has been getting restless post the scrapping of the reservation. Agitations have been announced in the state from this month. With this meeting, the state wants to put the ball in the Centre’s court,” said a senior official. Also, a demand to restore the 27% political reservation for Other Backward Class (OBC) will be taken up in Tuesday’s CM-PM meeting. The SC had recently rejected the state government’s review petition concerning reservation to OBCs. It had ruled that the reservation in favour of the OBC in local bodies should not result in exceeding the 50% cap in reservation quota. State cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal on Monday said that the Centre must restore 27% political reservation for OBCs in the local self-governments. At Tuesday’s meeting with Modi, Thackeray will iterate the request seeking over Rs 24,000 crore pending dues under the GST and compensation towards the losses due to cyclone Tauktae. Maharashtra government has already announced compensation of Rs 252 crore as relief to the cyclone-affected in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cm-to-discuss-maratha-quota-with-pm-today/articleshow/83324712.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Delhi||‘They are not gangsters’: No handcuffs for Khalid, Saifi||New Delhi: A court turned down a plea of Delhi Police to produce former JNU student Umar Khalid and activist Khalid Saifi in handcuffs before trial courts, noting that “they are not gangsters”. The plea application, which came up for hearing before additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav, sought to produce the 2020 Delhi riots accused in “handcuffs in both hands from back side”, contending that they are “high-risk prisoners”. The judge dismissed the plea observing that it is devoid of merits and filed in a mechanical manner and without application of mind by the high echelons of Delhi Police and prison authority. “The accused persons, who are sought to be produced in fetters and handcuffs, are admittedly not previous convicts. They are not even gangsters,” the judge stated in an order dated May 5, 2021. He further said that the plea is not required at this stage as the accused are not being produced in the court physically due to the pandemic. The judge also noted the replies submitted by the superintendents of Mandoli and Tihar jails, additional DCP (Special Cell) and DCP of third battalion of Delhi Police, on the plea. The DCP told the court that in the aftermath of an attempt made by armed assailants to free an undertrial prisoner at GTB Hospital, police had decided to request the court for permission to handcuff high-risk prisoners who are prone to escape.

---||Dehradun||Volunteers across Uttarakhand generating awareness on menstrual hygiene, distributing sanitary pads during pandemic||DEHRADUN: Amid curfew restrictions in Uttarakhand to contain the spread of Covid-19, several volunteers and social organisations are carrying out drives to spread awareness regarding menstrual hygiene in rural areas. They say that such campaigns are more crucial during the pandemic as the Covid-induced lockdown has made it difficult for women to go to stores and purchase sanitary pads. Anurag Chauhan, a Dehradun resident, runs a campaign — online and offline — to teach women how to make sanitary napkins out of cotton cloth and eco-friendly products like bamboo and banana pulp. “We have been working to generate awareness regarding menstrual hygiene for a few years now. Our volunteers realised that if we sit back during the pandemic, our initial success in generating awareness among women would go in vain. Even during the pandemic, they are going to remote areas and making online sessions accessible for women there.” Seema Rawat, an assistant teacher at a government school in Dhaulagiri where these workshops take place, told TOI, “About 50 women come to the school to attend the workshop on menstrual hygiene. Those women, who miss the session, come later to ask what was taught.” Another NGO, Wings of Hope is making a similar effort. Vishakha Dhodi Negi, the founder of the NGO, has been conducting online workshops to educate women on menstrual hygiene health since the outbreak of the pandemic. Social organisation ‘The Million Daughters Foundation’ is also working in the same direction since May last year. Founded by Jasleen Sethi and Kunjika Rawat, both Dehradun residents, the organisation is active in rural areas of Dehradun and Pauri districts. “Menstruation doesn’t stop for a pandemic and thus, we decided to reach out to women in rural areas with sanitary napkins during this time,” said Rawat. Jasleen Sethi added, “Our volunteers also encourage the girls and motivate them to follow their dreams and not let the pandemic impact their education.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/volunteers-across-uttarakhand-generating-awareness-on-menstrual-hygiene-distributing-sanitary-pads-during-pandemic/articleshow/83289397.cms||---

The farmers approached the high court seeking directions to government on procurement, and a PIL has been filed alleging inaction of the government for not procuring jowar (sorghum) at minimum support price despite the pleas, protests and representations from thousands of farmers in the Adilabad district. The Kisan Mitra Helpline, which was instituted by the district administration in Adilabad to serve as grievance redressal for farmers in distress, has received 62 distress calls in the month of April and May from farmers. The distress calls may be read as a signal about the precarious condition of the farmers who have cultivated jowar and are looking for support from the government. The harvest is lying in huge piles at every village corner and in many cases, they are lying in the fields itself. This, at a time when the first rains have already started in Adilabad. Farmers harvested jowar to an extent of 4.50 lakh quintals, they say. The PIL also states that in 2018-19 and 2019-20, the state procured jowar at MSP, and added that this year was a bad kharif season of cotton due to Pink BollWorm effect. He added, “The farmers are shocked as the government has made no move to procure the jowar cultivated by them during the rabi season. The MSP fixed by the government this time has been Rs 2,660 whereas the market rate is about Rs 1100 to Rs 1400 per quintal. On an average a farmer spends Rs 18,840 per acre for jowar cultivation. If the farmer sells at the market rate, they will be paid Rs 12,000 and will thereby suffer a loss of Rs 6,640 per acre. If the state were to procure the jowar, the farmer would make a profit of Rs 7,360 per acre.” Sree Harsha, an activist working on farmer distress, said: “There have been farmers’ protests in Adilabad from the beginning of April 2021 pleading with the government to procure their produce as otherwise it will lead to severe destitution among the jowar growing farmers.” Adilabad has witnessed 335 farmers die by suicide in the last 6 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/adilabad-dist-jowar-farmers-in-distress-seek-govt-intervention/articleshow/83294611.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The decision follows a report submitted on allegations related to attacking JMC-G commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh Deo on Friday. According to the DLB order, the department's preliminary investigation found that the councillors - in the presence and in agreement with mayor Somya Gurjar - fought and verbally abused the commissioner after he was called into the mayor's chamber on Friday. The department has ordered a judicial inquiry against all the four. Since they hold powerful positions, there are chances that they could influence the investigation, and, hence, have been suspended. Both sides were asked to make their representations regarding the incident. While the commissioner and other officials made their submissions, the councillors had asked for some extension on Saturday. They were given a day, but on Sunday, the DLB completed the report without their versions and refused to further extend time. Replying to the suspension order, Somya Gurjar issued a statement late night saying that all the allegations made by the commissioner are purely fictitious and made to fulfill his political ambitions. “We asked for a time extension to file our replies, but immediate action was taken by only listening to the complainant. It seems there is some sort of administrative or political pressure being made on the investigator. While following the principles of natural justice, we must get enough time to send our replies regarding the issue,” said the statement issued by the mayor. Gurjar is mayor and councillor from Ward 87, Paras Jain from 72, Ajay Chauhan 39, and Shankar from Ward 103. They have all been suspended from their posts. Commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh had alleged that he was attacked by BJP councillors inside the mayor's office when he went to discuss the issue of paying dues to the garbage collecting company which was on strike. He alleged that he was pressured by 10 BJP councillors inside the mayor's office to give an order for alternative arrangements. The meeting was held in the inner room of the mayor's office on her invitation. Since the Rajasthan High Court had already given an order not to take any action against the garbage company for eight weeks, the commissioner suggested that the mayor and councillors convince the company workers by paying them an amount for fuel. Singh said that the councillors started verbally abusing him and allegedly manhandled him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/assault-on-jmc-official-mayor-3-bjp-councillors-suspended/articleshow/83292196.cms||---

The state’s fatalities, accounting for 29% of confirmed coronavirus deaths in India, are over three times higher than the next state regarding this metric, Karnataka (31,580). The state’s Covid toll for 2021 (50,609) has also exceeded last year’s 49,521. May by far has been the deadliest since Covid reached the state about 15 months ago.  Of the 1,00,130 total deaths, more than a quarter (26,531) were reported last month. The last 20,000 Covid deaths came up in a span of merely 23 days. The biggest urban hubs of Maharashtra, Mumbai, Pune and Thane, have remained the highest contributors with 14,971, 13,348 and 8,257 deaths. In the second wave though, several smaller districts saw as many as if not a higher number of deaths than the bigger cities. In a silver lining, the state on Sunday recorded 12,557 new cases, the lowest in the last 89 days. Daily cases in Mumbai too dropped to 786, hitting a 103-day low, taking the overall case tally to 7,10,643. Maharashtra’s total caseload has reached 58.31 lakh. The city recorded 20 deaths on Sunday, a 65-day low. Active cases saw a further dip in the state, 1,85,527, including the city’s 18,041. The CM, who held a virtual meeting with all district, civic and police administrations, cautioned authorities about the anticipated third wave and asked them to remain more alert since many districts have started to unlock. Former KEM dean Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death audit committee, said that despite seeing double the incidence compared to the last wave, the mortality rate was lower this time. “But there is no denying that with better logistics, infrastructure and training, we could have saved more lives. A crucial lesson from the second wave would be to strengthen the primary and secondary health infrastructure to fight the future waves better,” he said. Maharashtra had recorded 19.32l akh cases and 49,521 deaths last year, while this year, there have been nearly 39 lakh cases and 50,609 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtras-covid-deaths-cross-1-lakh-25-of-the-fatalities-were-in-may/articleshow/83296365.cms||Sumitra Debroy

On Saturday, police arrested the accused, 28-year-old Bora Jagadish. Three-year-old Sindhu Sri was the daughter of B Ramesh and Varalakshmi. Some time ago, the couple separated over differences. Varalakshmi got custody of her daughter. Following separation, Varalakshmi found a house at Marikavalasa under PM Palem police station limits, where she lived with her daughter. Over time, Varalakshmi developed a relationship with Jagadeesh, a married man with children. On June 1, it was said that Sindhu Sri had reportedly suffered fever and had been taken to a private hospital where she was declared dead. While Jagadeesh buried Sindhu Sri’s body, Varalakshmi informed her estranged husband, Ramesh, about their daughter’s demise. A suspicious Ramesh lodged a police complaint accusing Varalakshmi and Jagadeesh of his daughter’s murder. Police registered a complaint under Section 174 of CrPC (suspicious death) and then exhumed the girl’s body and sent it for post mortem. Investigation revealed that Varalakshmi and Jagadeesh were having money problems. On June 1, Varalakshmi stepped out of the house to find some money, but all her efforts proved futile. When she returned without money, Jagadeesh got agitated and started assaulting three-year-old Sindhu Sri. The child fainted and subsequently died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/three-year-old-girl-murdered-by-mothers-paramour/articleshow/83266819.cms||---

National Highways Authority of India officials said technical and financial evaluation would take a month’s time after which a firm would be finalised to take up the preparation of DPR, including alignment, in consultation with the Telangana government. In the first phase, the northern half of the project which extends up to 180 km would be developed at a cost of Rs 9,500 crore. It will pass through the urban clusters of Choutuppal, Bhuvanagiri, Pragnapur, temple town of Yadadri, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s assembly constituency of Gajwel, Toopran, Narsapur and Sangareddy. NHAI general manager (technical) Navin Kumar Chaurasia confirmed to TOI that 20 firms have submitted their bids to prepare the DPR for the northern half of the 340 km access-controlled expressway. This semi-greenfield expressway will be developed into a four-lane project and later will be expanded to six lanes in tune with the projected growth of the vehicular traffic. It is expected to be the country’s largest ring road that will connect a large number of districts in Telangana. The NHAI is taking up the project in two parts under the central government’s Bharatmala Pariyojana. The state government is bearing 50% of land acquisition cost and has already allocated Rs 750 crore for it. The southern part of the RRR will be 160-km long and would be developed at a cost of Rs 6,480 crore. It will traverse through the urban clusters of Sangareddy, Shankarpally, Chevella, Amangal, Kandukur, Ibrahimpatnam and Choutuppal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/20-agencies-in-race-for-1st-phase-of-rrr/articleshow/83294628.cms||Roushan Ali

While the virus spread has slowed down considerably, some 271 persons died of Covid in the six days of June. The occupancy for oxygen beds, reserved for Covid patients, has gone down to 15.4%. This was nearly 100% during the peak of the second wave. Also, only 5.5% of the reserved general beds are currently occupied. But the occupancy of ICU beds is still 30.1%. Besides, over half of the reserved ventilator beds are occupied by Covid patients with severe symptoms. The occupancy of beds with ventilator support is 55% in the state. It is 54% in Jaipur, 82% in Jodhpur, 62% in Udaipur, 58% in Kota. In Alwar, 54 beds with ventilator support are still occupied. At the biggest Covid-dedicated RUHS Hospital in Jaipur, all the 128 ICU beds with ventilator support are fully occupied. The hospital does not have a single bed available with ventilator support. “We have 1,200 beds and, out of those, 268 are occupied. Out of the 268, the number of patients on ventilator support are 128. Our beds with ventilator support are fully occupied. This is happening because many patients have shifted from private hospitals whenever our beds are vacated,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, RUHS Hospital. Some of the patients on ventilator support have been undergoing treatment for a long time. “They have been on ventilator support for more than a month. They are now on non-invasive ventilation (NIV). They have fibrosis in the lungs and when we start weaning them away from NIV, they find it difficult to remain stable,” said Dr Singh. In private hospitals, the number of daily admissions of Covid patients has declined drastically over the past two-three weeks. “Most of the patients undergoing treatment are in ICUs or on ventilator support. They have a prolonged stay due to their disease and complications. Also, sporadic cases with severe symptoms are also there at the hospital," said a private hospital official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/only-15-oxygen-beds-in-raj-occupied-as-active-cases-fall/articleshow/83292213.cms||---

Last week, some guest workers in Sulur asked him to bring liquor from Bengaluru and offered to pay him handsomely. So, he bought liquor from shops at Bengaluru city. He managed to cross the Athipalli check post in Karnataka, passed through Hosur, Krishnagiri, Salem and Erode and entered Coimbatore with the contraband. He sold some bottles in Sulur before we arrested him,” Murugesan said. “Gandhi is a history-sheeter. He was booked for sand smuggling and was also detained under the Goondas Act,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-arrested-for-smuggling-liquor/articleshow/83291000.cms||---

Since no funds were coming from the owner to sustain operations, it was decided to suspend operations till further notice, Hyatt Hotels India head Sunjae Sharma said. Future reservations for the luxury property through Hyatt’s booking channels will be temporarily unavailable, he added. The closure is the first visible sign of stress among prominent chains in the hospitality sector in India’s financial capital. US-based Hyatt follows a franchise and management contract model in India where it lends its brands to hotel owners and manages their properties for them in return for a fee. Hyatt maintained that the rest of the 30 properties in its India portfolio remain operational. “While many hotels shut down during the first Covid wave, it was a decision based on low occupancy. They opened back up. This situation is not as much about the (Hyatt Regency Mumbai) hotel shutting down as it appears to be about the owner not paying salaries when keeping the hotel open for the recent past few weeks,” said a hospitality consultant. Hyatt Regency Mumbai general manager Hardip Marwah informed the hotel’s ‘on-roll’ employees, via a memo, that it could not pay salaries or support operations as the owner has stopped putting money. Staff strength at the 401-key Hyatt Regency could not be ascertained as it had laid off employees following the impact on business from the pandemic. Typically, full-service hotels like Hyatt Regency Mumbai have a staff-to-room ratio of 1.2:1. Sharma said the chain is working with Asian Hotels (West) to resolve the situation. In February, Asian Hotels (West) chairman and MD Sushil Kumar Gupta had resigned from the company, which reported a loss of Rs 109 crore for the nine months of fiscal 2021. Ten days ago, Asian Hotels (West) informed stock exchanges that it had defaulted on loan and interest payments to Yes Bank. Total outstanding borrowings stood at Rs 263 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hyatt-regency-near-t2-shuts-temporarily/articleshow/83324785.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The centres would have been a boon for Covid patients in the Annur taluk, from where 150 cases are reported a day. As many as 60 people had succumbed to the viral disease. Residents are now forced to seek treatment in faraway Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, Mettupalayam Government Hospital, Covid care centres at Saravanampatti, Mathampalayam or Karamadai. When caseload began to rise again in the taluk, the health department set up a 250-bed Covid care centre at Sri Ranganathar Institute of Engineering and Technology at Athipalayam and a 150-bed facility at Nava Bharath National School at Allikulam. The health minister inaugurated the facilities on Monday. The centres have fans, water heaters and water purifiers, but no doctors and nurses.

The Avinashi police have arrested four of the accused, while the remaining one is on the run. A police source said the incident occurred when 32-year-old L Thiruvengadam, a grade-II police constable with the Tirupur district armed reserve police, along with special police sub-inspector Sarveswaran, was on probation raids at Moolakattu Thottam at Sengalipalayam village near Thekkalur. “Thiruvengadam, who is working with the Avinashi unit of Prohibition Enforcement Wing (PEW), was in plain clothes. He was sent as a decoy. When the duo saw the people involved in illicit liquor sale, Thiruvengadam approached them for a bottle. When they gave him the liquor bottle, he attempted to catch them. Five of them then assaulted the cop using wooden logs, injuring him,” the source said. Meanwhile, the special police sub-inspector managed to nab four of them, who were handed over to the Avinashi police.

The cleric accused the government of double standards over its claims of being minority welfare-oriented. He said the party has hurt the sentiments of Muslim community. “The government first changed the name of an agricultural university, gave MLC to a family member and now renamed a road in Hyderabad. The government has been indulging in such acts that are hurting the sentiments of Muslims. The recent decision to change the logo of Osmania University is among one,” Jafar Pasha said. The cleric claimed he had quit from Muslim United Forum and abstained from appealing to Muslims to vote in favour of TRS in elections.

Falaknuma inspector R Devender said the victim, Abdul Shahrukh, an accused in a POCSO Act case registered last year, bled to death within a few minutes. Police are yet to establish the identity of the assailant. The entire incident has been captured by a nearby closed circuit television (CCTV) camera in the lane. Shahrukh was travelling on the bike along with another person riding pillion in a lane at Jahanuma. Suddenly, the pillion rider pulled out a knife and slashed his throat. Shahrukh stopped the bike and pushed it on the road before he started to flee. The accused, who fell down, immediately got up and tried to chase him. The victim walked up to 50 feet before he fell on the road and breathed his last. The accused, who followed the victim, escaped from the spot. Based on an identity card and mobile phone of the victim, police identified him as Shahrukh, a resident of Mustafa Nagar. Later, police came to know that he was facing sexual abuse charge after he reportedly eloped with a 17-year-old girl last year. As the girl is a minor, based on the complaint lodged by her family, a case was registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) Act. Police suspect the role of the girl’s family behind the murder. The girl’s family, which resides in Mailardevpally, called the victim to their place. The murder took place when the accused and the victim were travelling at Jahanuma.

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra up one step in national school education ranking.||NAGPUR: There is something to cheer for the pandemic hit education sector in Maharashtra, as schools’ performance rose one step this year to ‘Level III’ in the central government’s latest Performance Grading Index (PGI). Going by the points scored by all states and UTs, Maharashtra ranks eighth with 869 (out of 1,000) points. Released on Sunday by Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, the PGI 2019-20 report grades school education performance in states/UTs into levels (I-X) based on the points they score. These points are given based on 70 different indicators While no state has been able to reach the highest Level I, there were new entrants in Level II. Maharashtra shares its Level III status with six other states/UTs. The need to grade states/UTs, according to the government, was needed to monitor the effects of various schemes being run for school education. A note in the PGI report says, “the schemes initiated by the Department of School Education and Literacy (DoSEL) along with the implementation of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, have resulted in significant improvement in accessibility. As a logical next step, the focus has now shifted from access to quality of education.” To measure the quality of education, a comprehensive set of criteria was decided with over 70 major indicators. The data used to measure performance of states/UTs is already part of the education governance ecosystem. Data from Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+), National Achievement Survey (NAS) of National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), Mid-Day Meal (MDM) website, Public Fund Management System (PFMS) and the Shagun portal were collated. Ashnarayan Tiwari, executive member of School Headmasters Charitable Association and principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh), said, “It is heartening to know that even the central government is recognizing the collective efforts of schools in implementing various schemes of the government along with raising the quality of education. The credit has to go to teachers and principals because apart from academics, we are ensuring that every benefit like midday meals reaches the child.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-up-one-step-in-national-school-education-ranking/articleshow/83292222.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Housing societies bring flu jab to doorstep for kids||MUMBAI: Amid concerns about a third Covid-19 wave likely to affect children, housing societies in the city have stepped up to organise flu vaccine camps for those in the 4-18 years age group. In India, the Covid vaccine is currently being administered only to those above 18 years of age. Considering this, the state Covid task force had recently recommended flu shots be given to kids as symptoms of the seasonal flu mimic those of Covid-19. Experts say the flu vaccine is a time-tested one and can at least prevent a respiratory ailment, especially in children with a chronic condition or comorbidities. Atmosphere Society, one of the largest housing complexes in Mulund with more than 2,000 residents, held a flu vaccine camp for 70 children at the clubhouse on Saturday. “If more societies conduct such drives then the chances of flu can be minimised for the little ones. This will help avoid unnecessary panic visits to clinics or hospitals in the coming days,” Sanjay Nair, a resident, said. “The need of the hour is proactive measures especially when the third wave is expected to impact children. After vaccinating all our residents against Covid a few weeks ago, we decided to ensure that children got flu shots too. There were children from 4-18 years who took the shot,” he said, adding they got the vaccines at a discounted rate of Rs1,300 per dose. Residents said bringing the vaccine to the society doorstep also spared parents an anxious trip to the doctor’s clinic. Nair said other housing societies are keen to hold the drive too. In Powai, too, a vaccination camp for children was held at Jalvayu Vihar, Sector B, on Sunday. Sanjay Sinvhal, a resident, who organised the camp, said 23 children had registered for the influenza shot. “We were accepting walk-ins also for the drive. Some adults also took the pneumonia vaccine,” he said. Later this week, the locality has scheduled a Covid vaccination drive where 303 members will get their first Covishield shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hsg-socs-bring-flu-jab-to-doorstep-for-kids/articleshow/83292225.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Nagpur||NEER study on plasma recipients stalled by ‘missing’ RT-PCR samples||NAGPUR: Despite two reminders from divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar to GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta, the medical college’s microbiology department is yet to provide RT-PCR samples of convalescent plasma recipients to the three-member expert panel set up to conduct a retro study on the therapy. The study on plasma therapy shall entail genome sequencing samples of Covid patients who received the experimental therapy under project ‘Platina’ at Government Medical College and Nagpur (GMCH). The panel would be looking for possible mutations in the novel coronavirus positive samples of plasma recipients collected on 1st, 7th and 14th day. An official from the divisional commissioner office told TOI that the study may not even take off unless the court intervenes. “There are two issues. First, at the time of admission, the patients were not shortlisted for the study but at a later date. So, it is unlikely the medical college may have the 1st, 7th or 14th day sample. Some samples may be available of post-plasma therapy days of patients who required ICU. GMCH has performed over a lakh Covid tests. It would be a tedious task to search for those samples,” the official said. GMCH officials said they are trying to trace the samples for over a week now but to no avail. On the other hand, one of the panel members said the situation changed completely since the day Nagpur bench of Bombay high court ordered the study and now. “Soon after the court order, ICMR dropped plasma therapy from its treatment protocol. Now, the study may not have the same significance,” the member said. Another member said the study is still relevant as part of investigations into the second wave and the appearance of new mutants. The medical college had led the state-level project in which nearly 500 patients received convalescent plasma, to assess its efficacy in treating critically-ill Covid patients, last year. However, the project was abandoned after it was found that the therapy doesn’t have any mortality benefit. Following Nagpur bench of Bombay high court’s order on May 12, an expert panel was formed to study the impact of plasma therapy, to ascertain if it led to acceleration of Covid-19 cases in the city. The panel comprises Dr Krishna Khairnar, head of environmental virology at CSIR-NEER; virologist Major (retd) Dr Milind Bhursundi, and pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/neeri-study-on-plasma-recipients-stalled-by-missing-rtpcr-samples/articleshow/83291067.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Ooty, Kundha and Kotagiri blocks received more rain than the remaining three blocks. And the rain is still drenching parts of the hills. Ooty recorded 38mm and 38.8mm rainfall on June 1 and 2, respectively, while other areas in the district experienced dry weather. The Indian Meteorological Department in Chennai has, meanwhile, alerted the district administration about moderate to heavy rain for the next four days. The district administration has subsequently taken extra measures to handle the situation. Pointing out that the district used to record an average of 70mm rainfall during the summer showers in May, a weather expert said the hill retreat had received three times more rain this time. Ooty, he said, had registered 100% more rain, compared to last year. The rain had also damaged standing crops and hindered harvesting activities. M Murugan, a farmer from Ooty, said the summer showers hadn’t brought so much rainfall to the hills in the recent past. “It’s in May that we harvest vegetables such as cabbage, carrot and beetroot. The rain damaged the standing crops in some areas and in other areas it hindered the harvesting activities.” Horticulture officials confirmed that a few acres of standing crops were damaged in the rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/nilgiris-records-highest-may-rainfall-in-2-years/articleshow/83291084.cms||---

As per the government order, export units, units that have export commitments or export orders, and their vendor units providing inputs to such industries, can function with 10% workforce for carrying out export-related work and for sending samples. Welcoming the move, Tirupur Exporters Association (TEA) president Raja M Shanmugam called the decision a ray of hope for buyers across the globe. It sent a message that the industries in Tirupur are resuming operation, he said. Tirupur has 5,000 export and supporting units. “Export units in Tirupur are catering to the western market and is a multi-seasonal business. Prior to the season, we have to provide samples to buyers to receive orders. If we fail to send samples, buyers might opt other suppliers because the lockdown is imposed only in India. Once we lose the chance, we may not receive orders next season. In such a situation, the state government’s decision has given us some hope,” Shanmugam said. “We have decided to focus on completing pending orders and prepare samples. Other industries in the garment cluster, like knitting and dying, would simultaneously resume operations and within a few days, the momentum would be picked up and the sampling process would go on in a full-fledged manner. “ The Tirupur Exporters and Manufacturers’ Association (Teama) has advised members not to resume business for one week, unless it is necessary, said secretary G R Senthilvel. “It is not advisable to resume business immediately after a drop in Covid-19 cases. I hope buyers would understand the pandemic situation and would not cancel orders. Even if supply is delayed by a week or so, we can make alternative transportation arrangements to deliver goods. But it differs from person to person and the relationship between the buyer and supplier,” he said. Meanwhile, the South India Spinners Association (Sispa) has written to chief minister M K Stalin, requesting him to allow them operate spinning mills with workers staying on mill premises. “While spinning mills were closed for one month, mill owners have been providing accommodation, food and wages to workers. But as mills are not functioning, guest workers have started to leave to their native places. If the situation continues, there would be an acute shortage of workers,” the letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/export-units-ancillary-cos-get-ready-to-resume-ops/articleshow/83291024.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Delhi||As Delhi gasped for air, cops lent more than a shoulder||NEW DELHI: As the second wave of Covid-19 hit the city this April, it led to an unprecedented crisis of oxygen in hospitals. With the existing supply and distribution system under tremendous pressure, hospital after hospital started making frantic calls to Delhi Police as they sought to replenish their stocks. Many hospitals sent SOSs with less than an hour’s supply left. Delhi Police, however, rose to the challenge. It was on April 18 that the cops in outer district received a call for help from Mansa Ram Hospital, which had around 35 patients undergoing treatment with just an hour’s supply left. Local cops inquired around Delhi and managed to get 20 cylinders for them in the nick of time. The cops were soon flooded with cries of help and this prompted Delhi Police commissioner S N Shrivastava to form a core group and a command room to coordinate and handle the matter. A system was quickly put in place and Delhi Police PCR unit was tasked with supervising the transportation. It was decided that PCR vans would provide the security and escort to the tankers, starting from the plants, to cut travel time and hassles. The cops were asked to extend all possible help, support and security as well as provide a “Green Corridor” to all oxygen tankers during their transportation. A WhatsApp group, titled "Oxygen Movement", was created for coordination with DCPs of districts and traffic, PCR, Delhi government officials, special branch and nodal officials. Any SOS raised by a hospital was escalated to the officers concerned and steps taken to revolve the situation immediately. Shrivastava also took up the issue with Delhi Disaster Management Authority and flagged the shortcomings noticed in the existing system by the boots on the ground. The “green corridor” ran in three successive legs operating without break like a relay race. With the oxygen plants being located outside Delhi — at Panipat, Faridabad, Palwal and Surajpur in Haryana and Modinagar in UP— the first leg was covered by dedicated teams of PCR MPVs from the plant to Delhi border point where other MPVs fleet were waiting to receive and escort the tankers inside the locations. “The first escort team immediately turned around and went back to the plant to bring another tanker. The PCR MPVs then took tankers to hospitals or the filling stations, as the case may be, where the local police engaged their motorcycle and vehicles escorts till the hospitals, so that no time was lost in transit. Over 95 MPVs and 500 men worked round the clock to ensure this delivery system ran uninterrupted,” Shrivastava said. Real-time information on the number of oxygen tankers despatched, their route and the proposed time of arrival was recorded by the Command Room for advance intimation to the waiting teams. The Command Room also live-monitored the 10 filling stations inside Delhi that served as oxygen feeders to smaller hospitals and individuals. Multiple teams under ACPs were deployed at Panipat, Surajpur, Faridabad, Palwal and Modinagar plants to oversee the transportation arrangement and to brief the pilots/escorts engaged with the oxygen tankers. It was ensured that a tanker left the plant as soon as it was filled. Police officers at the plant maintained close liaison with Delhi government officials and nodal officers. For border-to-hospital movement, 55 MPVs and 120 personnel were deployed. The cops deployed on this emergency job were given food and water in the vehicle itself. "Between April 29 and May 14, Delhi Police was operating at its full capacity and had physically escorted 1,262 tankers carrying around 7,152 metric tonnes of oxygen," Delhi Police PRO, Chinmoy Biswal said. The oxygen supply was eventually streamlined and physical escorting of oxygen tankers was discontinued on May 14. Thereafter, cops were deployed at oxygen plants, boarder pickets, relevant railway stations and monitoring at CPCR command room level. Since May 14, 1210 tankers carrying 6,158 metric tonnes of medical oxygen have successfully been transported to various hospitals of Delhi till date, cops say. In all, Delhi Police has facilitated the arrival of 2,472 tankers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-city-gasped-for-air-cops-lent-more-than-a-shoulder/articleshow/83291182.cms||Raj Shekhar

Police said Singh, a native of UP, had been living in Sekri town for the past one year and was working as a labourer. “He had a tiff with Khan two days ago over a petty issue. Last night Balbir went to the residence of Khan to confront him and hit him with an axe lying nearby. Khan died on the spot. The deceased wife screamed for help after which the accused fled from the spot,” said police. Fear of being caught by villagers who were hunting for him after the incident, Singh jumped into the well. He remained there till morning when a villager saw him. The villager called other villagers for help who identifies him as the man who killed Khan. The well was 5-feet deep because of which Singh didn’t drown. Some villagers called police which informed the SDRF team for rescue. “The accused was fearing for his life and was not willing to come out. Police assured him of safety which led him to hold the rope tightly and was pulled out,” police said. Police CO Satyaprakash Meena said Singh was arrested soon after his medical examination. “We are collecting evidence from the spot. The reason for his jumping into the well due to guilt or to save his life from the villagers is not known yet,” said Meena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/murderer-jumps-into-well-to-hide-arrested/articleshow/83291125.cms||---

After various corporate houses and service organisations, Premier Mills Group has now come forward to set up a modular oxygen generating system in the ESI Hospital at a cost of Rs 1 crore. Shanthi Srinivasan, managing director, Premier Fine Linens Pvt Ltd, said the system would have a capacity to generate 500 litres oxygen per minute and serve 100 beds at the hospital. “The modular system has a separate compressor unit and a decentralised oxygen concentration system that caters to two beds at the same time, making it an effective alternative to address the current scenario.” At 813, the ESI Hospital has the highest number of oxygen equipped beds in the district presently. It is to be noted that the hospital had just 286 such beds a month ago. Of the 813 beds, 267 are vacant now, as the number of Covid patients requiring oxygen support has come down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/esi-hospital-to-get-rs-1cr-worth-oxygen-generator/articleshow/83291090.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Private centres boost vax drive with 1.5 lakh doses in a week||HYDERABAD: Giving impetus to the vaccination drive in the state, private centres, especially in Hyderabad, have given more than 1.5 lakh doses in the last one week itself. With 90% of the private vaccine centres functioning in Hyderabad, the dose availability has increased. Many centres have tied up with gated communities and apartments. The dose availability shows that the private centres have given more than 20,000 doses daily for the last few days. Till 8.15pm on Sunday, among all the private vaccine centres, the one at Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills, had given highest cumulative doses of 24,970. Most big hospitals have given more than 50,000 cumulative doses. Many citizens, not wanting to wait till the first dose drive is launched for the 18-44 age-group by the government, are preferring to go to private vaccine centres. “They say the third wave is anticipated. It is better to complete two doses by then. We don’t know when the first dose drive will be started by the government, so three members of our family got the vaccine at a private centre,” SR Suresh, a private employee, said. The government has not fixed any cap on the extra service charge being taken by private hospitals. The hospitals are charging anywhere from Rs 100-Rs 250 extra for each dose of the vaccine. Director of public health Dr Srinivasa Rao said that in the coming days, they would be able to vaccinate even ten lakh people a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-centres-boost-vax-drive-with-1-5l-doses-in-a-wk/articleshow/83292253.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||India||‘Mop-up’ drive to ensure jabs for health workers who missed out||NEW DELHI: Concerned over some states still lagging in ensuring vaccine coverage for healthcare workers despite being accorded top priority when India’s vaccination drive began on January 16, the Centre is working with states to plug the crucial gap in the fight against Covid-19. A review of the vaccination drive in the wake of the new policy where states and private hospitals have been allowed to procure vaccines showed targets for healthcare workers hadn’t been met even as the Centre continues to provide shots for this category and the 45-plus age group. The coverage is uneven with Rajasthan still to inoculate 13% of its healthcare workers, but that is much better than Punjab which has covered only 65%. Chhattisgarh has inoculated 88% of its health workers, which is better than the national average of 81%. Telangana, like Punjab, has covered only 64% of workers in this category. Delhi with 73%, Maharashtra (77%) and Andhra Pradesh (83%) also have some way to go and the Centre plans to ask these states to organise a special drive to “mop up” the remaining health workers. Some states have covered close to 100% of health workers. With PM Narendra Modi expressing worries over vaccine wastage, the Centre is trying to ensure it doesn’t cross 1%. Wastage in 2.5-6.15% range has been reported from some states. The ability of states to utilise vaccines has been under the lens, with some failing to use even 50% of the shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mop-up-drive-to-ensure-jabs-for-health-workers-who-missed-out/articleshow/83295653.cms||---

BSF Bikaner DIG Pushpendra Singh was also present at the briefing. A consignment of 56kg heroin worth around Rs 200 crore was seized along the border on Thursday.Asked about the involvement of any terrorist organisation and Pakistan Rangers, Gyaneshwar Singh said their involvement will be probed. If required, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) will investigate this case. At present, links are being connected with each other and it will not be fair to say anything now. On asking about making the dossier, Singh said that there are a few smugglers who often push such drugs into India and action will be taken against such mafia with the help of Interpol. He said maximum smuggling takes place from Punjab. Till now around 270-300kg heroin has been recovered from Punjab near the international border adjoining Pakistan and 61kg from Jammu frontier. Prior to this action, 8kg heroin was recovered from the Rajasthan frontier. These incidents are more frequent in Punjab. The heroin consignment seized in Bikaner is the biggest so far. Till now, two culprits have been caught. The main objective is to catch the main supplier, receiver and the mafia behind it, added Singh.BSF DIG Rathore said that they have full cooperation of NCB. This is the biggest smuggling case in the history of BSF Rajasthan frontier-Gujarat frontier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/aim-to-reach-the-last-link-in-smuggling-racket/articleshow/83291164.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Agra||Many activists of saffron outfits stopped from entering Aligarh village||AGRA: A large contingent of police force was camping by the road leading to Aligarh’s Noorpur village on Sunday to deter any attempt to disturb law and order in the wake of VHP leader Sadhvi Prachi’s announcement to perform a ‘havan’ at a mosque there which was at the centre of a row involving people of two different faiths. Although the VHP leader didn’t turn up in spite of her announcement to visit the village till late evening, several activists of saffron outfits reached near the village and confronted the policemen who didn’t allow them to enter. The row began on May 26 when a wedding procession of a Dalit family was allegedly asked to stop the music for a while near a mosque where people were offering prayer. It led to a melee and some people in the wedding procession claimed that they were attacked by the people of the minority community. Later, local police intervened and booked 11 people. It also claimed that the matter has been settled. A few days later, “house for sale” signs came up on the facades of some houses belonging to Dalit families. Alleged attempts were made to whip up communal passions too. A local AIMIM leader gave a controversial statement and BJP MP Satish Gautam visited the village along with local MLAs assuring the Dalit community a “secure atmosphere”. And on Sunday morning, scores of saffron activists tried to enter Noorpur. “We are not being allowed to enter the village. The administration has threatened the villagers who are now claiming that everything is normal there,” said Karni Sena president Vikas Chauhan. A local resident of Noorpur village, Haji Dalveer Khan, said that an unnecessary controversy is being stirred by political parties. “On May 26, at 5:15pm, a wedding procession was passing through an area where namaaz was being performed in the mosque. Since the ‘baraat’ was playing loud music, we had requested them to stop it for five minutes or play it after crossing the mosque. Though the people agreed, a few anti-social elements created a ruckus and some unidentified persons broke the glass of the vehicle on which the DJ was playing the music,” he said. “This led to a fight. But police reached there on time and impounded the vehicle as Section 144 was in force. The matter was resolved after village elders intervened the next day,” Khan said. Pankaj Pundit from Tappal area, who lives just 1.5km away from the village and is also former co-convener of Bajrang Dal in Khair area of Aligarh, said that there was no religious issue, it was just a brief confrontation. “The controversy was created to divert attention from the hooch tragedy by a particular political party,” said Pundit, questioning as to why an FIR was registered four days after the incident. Meanwhile, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), Anil Talan, who also reached there, appreciated the administration’s decision of not allowing saffron activists into the village. “Misconceptions are being created and this could lead to confrontation,” he said. District magistrate CB Singh and SSP Kalanidhi Naithani were also in the village. Talking to media persons, Singh said, “A peace committee has been formed and five accused have been arrested so far. The situation is under control.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/saffron-activists-stopped-from-entering-aligarh-village-dm-ssp-say-situation-under-control/articleshow/83289551.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||Mumbaikars may find only Udupis open for breakfast||Mumbai: Following the announcement of a 4pm deadline for restaurants and bars, many owners believe only 20% to 30% businesses which cater to morning breakfast or lunch (Udupis) and those who own their premises may serve customers. According to them, a majority of fine dine restaurants and bars record 70%-80% of their business during dinner time. They fear that since offices are also not working at full strength, day-time business with more staff strength may, in fact, incur losses. “It will not be viable to open restaurants for just 10-20% business. Owners are afraid of taking such a risk in the absence of tax/fee waiver. Also, the levels of opening and closure announced by the government may adversely affect the mindset of the staff if they are absorbed frequently,” said HRAWI spokesperson Pradeep Shetty.“We appreciate the unlocking moves. However, although the relaxation of 50% dine-in till 4pm only on weekdays (besides continuing present takeaways/home deliveries as it is) looks good, it is not viable for our businesses as they are largely dependent on timings and operational days,” said Shivanand Shetty, president of AHAR. Time-to-time consultation with the industry may help the government in coming up with more industry-friendly measures, he added.Pradeep said before the current lockdown, the industry had reached 40% to 50% business level in terms of revenue. “With these restrictions that 50% business will again come down to 10%-20% if the present level 3 unlocking norms are followed,” he pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaikars-may-find-only-udupis-open-for-breakfast/articleshow/83292263.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

This Monday, a young married couple, 27-year-old Rowthu Yogeswara Rao and 22-year-old Rowthu Rani were on their way to Visakhapatnam on a motorcycle when they were mowed down by a vehicle. Initially, police were unable to identify the vehicle that mowed down the couple. However, upon carefully probing the accident spot, cops found a spare part belonging to the then unidentified vehicle. Cops consulted automobile showrooms and found that the spare belonged to an Ertiga car, an MUV. Vizianagaram DSP P Anil said that the police then examined CCTV footage and found the car. Upon identifying it, cops then tracked down the car to a 33-year-old Nayini Sankara Reddi, under whose name the car is registered. Police say the couple was travelling through Kanimeeta village, when the speeding car hit the bike and killed them on spot and fled. Police have nabbed Sankara Reddi and seized the car. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/police-identify-vehicle-involved-in-hit-and-run/articleshow/83266857.cms||---
---||Trichy||Parents plump for online storytelling workshop for kids||TRICHY: Closure of schools due to Covid-19 lockdown has forced children to remain indoors without much interaction and extra-curricular activities. Parents are, therefore, relying on online storytelling workshops to improve their children’s imagination and creative skills. ‘Imaginative storytelling workshop’ by Santhosh Mathevan – an independent screenwriter in the Tamil film industry - is one such attempt to rekindle the imaginative skills of children. The workshop, which is for children aged between 5 and 12, will help them become storytellers. However, that isn’t the only objective, said Mathevan and said that anthropologists say that civilisations evolved by storytelling, which enhances their capacity to imagine. But the imagination quotient of people has come down in recent years. People are confined to a specific pattern of life that has reduced their imagination quotient. Explaining one of the activities of the workshop, Mathevan said children will be asked to imagine a story in their own world by choosing animal characters from short animated films shown to them. By making them narrate their stories, we can understand the extent of imagination a child has and trigger them based on their levels, he said. Many parents, who came to him after knowing about the workshop, said that they want their children to be creative and innovate. “I tell them that it’s not a talent, but it is human nature which needs to be retrieved,” he added. A Subramony, 40, parent of a 7-year-old participant from the United Kingdom, found the idea of such a workshop very refreshing as it would assess the student’s imagination individually and help them improve upon it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/parents-plump-for-online-storytelling-workshop-for-kids/articleshow/83291162.cms||Sampath Kumar

Uttar Pradesh Police had announced Rs 1 lakh on any information leading to the arrest of Rishi Sharma, who went missing on May 28 when villagers started dying allegedly after consuming toxic liquor brewed and illegally sold by his gang to authorized vends. At least 100 people have died allegedly after consuming the liquor in villages of Aligarh. Another 12 died after drinking toxic liquor dumped by the same gang along the Upper Ganga canal. Sharma had joined BJP a few years ago and was recently elected as a BDC member from Jawan village. Local BJP unit, however, distanced itself from him after the incident and claimed that he does not hold any position in the party. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Aligarh, Kalanidhi Naithani, said that six teams were constituted to find Sharma. “Police teams had monitored call details of 500 mobile numbers and around 100 informers were activated in five states including Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Delhi, where raids were being conducted. All the accused in the hooch tragedy are behind the bars now,” the SSP said. “The other key accused, Vipin Yadav, Anil Chaudhary and his brother-in-law Neeraj Chaudhary have already been arrested,” he said. Police have also arrested Rishi Sharma’s brother Munish Sharma. So far, 17 FIRs have been registered in various police stations including Akrabad, Jawan and Taapal and 61 people have been arrested. “Properties worth Rs 5crore belonging to this liquor mafia have already been demolished. The administration has also identified his other properties worth Rs 100 crore which were illegally acquired,” said Naithani. Meanwhile, the Aligarh health department has confirmed that it has conducted post-mortem examination on the bodies of 104 people who died of suspected hooch consumption. But it has so far confirmed just 52 deaths due to the toxic liquor consumption and said that viscera samples from the remaining bodies were being sent to the laboratory for confirmation.

The combined number of inoculations in 98 centres of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is nearly equivalent to that in one private hospital where vaccination of 18-44 age group is going on. Officials and office-bearers say not much eligible people from 45-plus category are left to be vaccinated and hence the numbers going down. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) continued Vaccination In Your Locality between May 31 and June 5, which was the second week. It was implemented for the first time between May 24 and 29. On the same lines, zilla parishad (ZP) continued Vaccination In Your Village drive. As per state’s public health department data, 22,888 healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs) and 45-plus took the first/ second dose in the district between May 31 and June 5, for a daily average of 3,815. The numbers also include some from 18-44 age group, who took the second dose of Covaxin on June 4 and 5. The number of beneficiaries was 12,108 (daily average 2,018) in the city in this period. First dose of 18-44 years age group is not allowed at the 98 centres managed by the NMC. During the first week of the drive, May 24 and 29 i.e, 25,200 HCWs, FLWs and 45-plus took the first/ second dose in the district for a daily average of 4,200. Between May 17 and 22, 41,706 were jabbed for a daily average of 5,958. Also, 22,591 were administered the vaccine on May 13, followed by 12,180 on May 14 and 24,379 on May 15. Since then, the numbers have dropped to less than 5,000 per day. Kingsway Hospital started vaccination in the same period, but for 18-44 group. During the same period, the hospital has vaccinated 10,500 people for a daily average of around 1,750. Officials in NMC, ZP and ruling party leader in the civic body Avinash Thakre said, “The falling numbers indicate that not much eligible people from 45-plus remain to be vaccinated. Total 8.16 lakh people from 45-plus have been vaccinated. 1.95 lakh HCWs and FLWs also took the jab, of which many are from 45-plus category. Around 3.3 lakh people were infected with Covid-19 in the second wave from third week of February to end of May. Majority of these are from 45-plus group. Whoever left are availing the benefit. Therefore, government should resume vaccination of 18-44 group.” However, public health department data projects different scenario than claimed by the officials. The government had estimated district population at 52,72,665 and around 30% (15,81,800) in 45-plus group. In all, 8,15,443 (51.55%) from this group have taken the first dose as on June 5. Thus, 7,66,357 are remaining. Still, only 13,586 persons from 45-plus group took the vaccine between May 31 and June 5 for a daily average of 2,264. The NMC and ZP are running 221 centres. Each centre can easily inoculate 300 in a day, for a combined total of 66,300.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dists-vax-numbers-fail-to-rise-for-2nd-week-in-a-row/articleshow/83291176.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Agra||Child care medical infrastructure virtually non-existent in Agra||AGRA: Amid fears that children are just as vulnerable to coronavirus as adults, the central government has issued guidelines for child care to the states in the event of another Covid-19 wave. But the required infrastructure for treating children is virtually non-existent in UP government-run medical facilities. A case in point is Agra where only two Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) beds are available at SN Medical College for the entire district. The district has no dedicated centre for the treatment of Covid-19 infected children. Besides, there is no PICU ambulance available. According to the health department records, there are 6.73 lakh children in Agra district. Out of these, 1.28 lakh are aged between 12 and 24 months. Senior pediatrician at SN Medical College, Dr Neeraj Yadav, said, “At present, we have two PICU beds available with us. We are going to increase the number to 20 soon. Besides, arrangements are being made to set up a dedicated Covid-19 ward for children.” District president of the UP Ambulance Association Ravi Sisodiya said, “There is no private or government PICU ambulance available in the district. In case one is required, a PICU ambulance is arranged from Noida or Delhi. “ Dr RC Pandey, chief medical officer of Agra district, said, “We will be opening a 100-bed dedicated ward for children at SN Medical College and a 20-bed facility at the district hospital next month. A proposal for required machines, medicines and human resources has been sent to the state government. Arrangement for a PICU ambulance will be made soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/child-care-medical-infra-virtually-non-existent-in-agra/articleshow/83289542.cms||---

BSF Rajasthan frontier IG Pankaj Goomer on Sunday accompanied the investigating team and recreated the crime scene at the spot. Besides, the NCB is preparing a dossier which, if required, will help build a case with the concerned agency at the international level to reach the culprits. The joint team during investigation found that the smugglers on the other side possibly got help from Pak rangers in pushing the consignment into India. On the day the incident occurred, there was movement of vehicles on the Pakistani side and there was increase in the activities of Pak rangers. NCB deputy director general Gyanendra Singh, Bikaner sector BSF DIG Pushpendra Singh, commandant 127th battalion Amitabh Panwar and other officers were present. IG Goomer said the case has been handed over to NCB. Two smugglers, Roop Singh Valmiki, 30, and Harmesh Singh, 20, residents of Firozpur in Punjab have been arrested. NCB has produced them in the court has taken them on a 7-day remand. They are being inquired. They have identified two other colleagues. The entire link of the smuggling is associated with Punjab smugglers.

---||Nagpur||Gyms, theatres and water parks cautiously optimistic||Nagpur: The last one year has seen varying degrees of lockdown and unlocking for businesses. But for a few in Nagpur district, the shutters have been virtually down ever since the pandemic started. Gyms, amusement parks and cinema theatres had either not opened at all or did so for only a brief period. While they look forward to unlocking, business owners say there are some concerns too. For movie theatres, the initial hiccup starts with ‘content’. Movie distributor Manohar Wadhwani said, “Immediately there are no new releases lined up because producers want maximum circuits to be covered, if not a pan-India release. So unless movie theatres are open simultaneously in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru etc it won’t be financially viable for producers.” Rohit Buty, promoter of Buty Cineplex (previously Smruti), said, “At least we won’t be starting this month and that’s because we are not convinced that a strong response will be there from the public.” Sanjay Surana, promoter Kamal Talkies said, “I will wait for at least three weeks because the government can again change its decision. So no point in restarting all my overhead expenses to again shut down.” Multiplexes are however preparing to open in line with the expected guidelines. Venkat Raman, general manager of Inox Multiplex said, “Once the order is issued we will require three to four days to prep up the premises for public screening.” In neighbouring Wardha, where movie theatres ran for a couple of months, owners are planning for their next round. Pradeep Bajaj, promoter of Durga and Ganesh theatres said, “We did reasonably well earlier this year due to some new releases, before lockdown happened due to the second wave. I hope new movies are available for release so that people come back.” For gyms, the concern is about seeing footfalls getting back to normal. Arnold Francis, owner of Gold Gym said, “I am sure initially there will be a reluctance among people to come, hence it will take quite some time for things to be normal. When we were given permission earlier, things had started to slowly come back to normal before being closed down in March again,” said Francis. Amusement and water parks briefly got permission to open since the pandemic last year, and promoters hope that business will be back. Gaurav Choukasey, director of Lighthouse Water Park and Rajkamal Water Sports (Khindsi) said, “Monsoon season is when business is the slowest because people avoid water parks. Even resorts operate at below average occupancy level. So it’s hard to predict what kind of response we will get once permission comes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gyms-theatres-and-water-parks-cautiously-optimistic/articleshow/83283109.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Trichy||Trichy: BDU invites application for admissions to PG courses||TRICHY: Bharathidasan University (BDU) has invited applications for its post-graduate and integrated programmes for the academic year 2021-22. Admissions will be held for 36 postgraduate programmes, besides three six-year integrated and seven five-year integrated programmes. For the BCA, B Voc five-year and six-year integrated programmes, filled in applications should be sent within 15 days of the declaration of class 12 examination results. June 28 is the last date for other programmes. Candidates have to file applications online on the university website. While the semester exam for the final year under-graduate students is yet to be conducted, students are asked to apply with the mark statement of five semesters for provisional admission. Admission will be confirmed only if they cleared their under-graduation. The university chose to make slight changes to the names of some of the programmes in the advertisement. For instance, the M Sc Marine Biotechnology programme was mentioned as Biotechnology (marine). Similarly, Biotechnology (Environment) is known as Environmental Biotechnology. While the move was questioned by a section of teachers who say that it could create confusion among the students as it appears that both the programmes are offered by the same department. But both are different programmes. “It is not like an MSW programme, which is offered in three specialisations namely community development, human resource management and clinical social work,” said a senior faculty member from the BDU. Speaking to TOI, G Gopinath, registrar in-charge of BDU, said the names were defined by the concerned department and deans after thorough analysis. The basic idea was to ensure that students don’t face the issue of non-equivalence during employment in government service. Now students can either take up the concerned area of specialization, or they can opt for government services, which seek biotechnology as a basic requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bdu-invites-application-for-admissions-to-pg-courses/articleshow/83291167.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: ‘Class XII marks must be based on Class X, XI board exam score’||TRICHY: Cancellation of Class XII board examinations has come as a relief to the students and teachers, and now the focus has shifted to the methodology to be adopted to calculate marks. Teachers suggest that marks should be awarded based on the students’ marks in Class X and XI board examinations to avoid manipulation by self-financing schools. The state government had asked teachers and the headmaster of schools to give their opinion on conducting board examinations a couple of days ago. While most of them wanted the government to conduct the exams, many government school teachers suggested calculating Class XII marks based on the average marks of the last two board examinations. The Class XII students had appeared for a full-fledged Class XI board examination last year and Class X board exams a year ago. Chemistry, however, was the only exception as the exam for the subject was cancelled due to the pandemic. Marks were allotted on the basis of the tests conducted by teachers throughout the year. While the state government will constitute a committee to decide on the methodology to be adapted to award marks, teachers say that marks based on the Class X and XI board exams could only be a fair assessment unlike what was done last year for the students of Class X. While Class X board exams were cancelled last year because of the pandemic, respective schools were asked to decide on awarding marks based on the tests conducted through the year. “While it was very rare to secure 500/500 marks, last year more than five students secured full marks, which exposed the unfair means adopted by schools, especially the self-financing schools. Marks secured in the previous board examinations are already published, which cannot be altered,” said a teacher. As the practical exams were conducted offline this year and the marks have already been sent to the directorate of school education, we can also consider those marks, the teacher added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/class-xii-marks-must-be-based-on-class-x-xi-board-exam-score/articleshow/83291172.cms||Sampath Kumar

Raju informed about issuing a legal notice to CID after former IAS officer PV Ramesh tweeted that he and his family members were receiving a lot of messages on WhatsApp from an unlisted number. “I am notifying this info in public interest. I and my family members have been receiving #WhatsApp messages from an unlisted number +91 90009 11111 purported to be from @RaghuRaju_MP. MP may respond,” Ramesh tweeted. Responding to this, Raju tweeted: “Shri @RameshPV2010, My mobile was unofficially seized by CID police AP on May 14th, the day of my arrest. Still it is with them. I have issued legal notice yesterday to return it. Four days back blocked that sim and obtained new sim.” In the legal notice, which was officially handed over to the SHO at Mangalagiri CID office, the Narsapuram MP demanded that his mobile phone be handed over to the magistrate, failing which, he would take appropriate legal action against them. “The phone has the personal data of my family members. It also has crucial data pertaining to the party given that I am a standing member of a Parliament committee. The phone is crucial for the discharge of my duties as an MP and standing committee member and other duties,” the legal notice read. Raju also lodged a complaint with Delhi police, seeking action against CID chief PV Sunil Kumar for his ‘unlawful acts’. In a letter addressed to the DCP, he requested him to initiate requisite criminal liability against the CID chief, as his seized phone wasn’t shown anywhere in the records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/narsapuram-mp-issues-legal-notice-to-cid-over-mobile-phone-seizure/articleshow/83266864.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Centre responsible for derailing Telangana vax drive: KT Rama Rao, CMO||HYDERABAD: The TRS government, which has been maintaining issue-based friendly ties with the BJP government is unhappy with its vaccine policy and has squarely blamed the Centre for the vaccination process slowing down in the state. Top sources in the chief minister’s office said the latest guidelines on vaccine supply by the Centre make it even more difficult for states to combat Covid-19. The entire production is being closely monitored by government of India, which is taking 85% of production. In the remaining 15%, various state governments have to compete with other states and private hospitals, who buy at three times the rate. During an “AskKTR” session on Twitter, TRS working president and municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao on Sunday said the Union government’s failure in vaccine administration and procurement was apparent. The remark only reflected the mood in the CMO and TRS government against the Centre’s vaccine policy, said a senior TRS leader. “The central government seems to have no sense of urgency or a clear strategy in spite of knowing fully well that vaccination is the only way out of this pandemic,” said KTR, replying to a Twitter used Srinivas Velumuri during an interactive session. KTR said he himself was yet to take a dose of vaccine. Responding to questions on central government funds allocation for vaccination, KTR said, “The government of India had announced ₹35,000 crore allocations in the Union Budget for vaccination. Assuming we cover 100% population, we need 272 crore doses at Rs 150 per dose. Don’t know where that allocation has gone now.” When a netizen asked, ‘Where is my vaccine?’, Minister KTR said, “Ask the government of India that bungled up and created this situation where states are pitted against one another and against the private sector. They didn’t place orders when they had to and even now don’t want to call for a single tender for the entire country.” Responding to a query on when the entire population of Telangana will get vaccinated, minister KTR said, “We have the ability to vaccinate more than 10 lakh people a day but unfortunately constraints on vaccine supplies are hampering brisk progress.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-responsible-for-derailing-t-vax-drive-ktr-cmo/articleshow/83293808.cms||Roushan Ali

The vaccination might be the biggest ever in the city so far and reached its target hours before its stipulated closing time. Given the overwhelming response from citizens, the 36,000 vaccinations target for the drive was met by 6 pm, even as the drive was originally meant to continue till 9 pm. The drive held for people above 18 years of age, saw many elders being rolled in on wheelchairs and differently abled citizens being brought for the vaccine jab too. Starting from 8 am, people made their way towards the venue from various parts of the city. “We came down from Uppal for the vaccination. We had been trying to book slots for a while now but we are four family members and we were unable to find four slots anywhere. When we learnt about this drive, we booked immediately,” said P Srikanth, who had turned up with his family. The drive, organised by Medicover Hospitals in association with Cyberabad police commissioner and The Society for Cyberabad Security Council (SCSC) is aimed at combating the spread of Covid-19. With over 500 counters, the drive was planned in a way to ensure that there will be no waiting. Different time slots were allocated all through the day, which kept the flow of citizens continuous. “Many are flocking to vaccine centers, because of the increased awareness. However, due to the ongoing second wave, a large section of people are still hesitant to take the jab. This drive will also motivate those who are still in a dilemma. Camps like this will send a strong message and will also give them confidence that it is safe to take the vaccine,” as per an official statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-36k-get-covid-jab-in-spl-drive-at-hitex/articleshow/83292261.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Cyclone Tauktae-hit youth join hands to restore power in villages||RAJKOT: Cyclone Tauktae-ravaged electricity infrastructure in some parts of Amreli and Bhavnagar district will require quite some time to be restored to its original strength. However, what is enlightening here is that self-propelled villagers here have taken the onus of restoring power upon themselves and joined hands with the PGVCL teams. Around 400 youths of the village came forward to erect 65 electricity poles in one day in an area of 3km that has over 400 agricultural connections. When the villagers had earlier represented their plight to the deputy engineer of PGVCL in Amreli rural, M L Parmar, he showed shortage of labour as a reason for the delay in restoration work. Villagers lost no time in offering their services as labour and started work under the guidance of engineers. “We have made several teams each of 40 people and we are planning to erect 400 poles in four five days,” said Sanjay Khut, a youth from the village. According to the villagers, with the approaching monsoon season, they will need electricity for their irrigation work which makes them impatient to get the connection restored soon. In the same way, villagers of Zariya village of Sihor taluka in Bhavnagar last week offered their services to help PGVCL team to restore electricity. The electricity connection to this village situated on a hill runs through a forest. This makes it difficult for the discom engineers to create the infrastructure in a short period. Ratansang Dodiya, a resident of the village said, “All the villagers — aged between 20 and 75 years — joined this work. We also put our tractors at the disposal of PGVCL. As a result, the restoration work requiring almost one week could be accomplished in one day and we got back power supply.” According to PGVCL sources, around 5,500 villages were affected in the cyclone and electricity has been restored in around 97 percent of these villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/tauktae-hit-youth-join-hands-to-restore-power-in-villages/articleshow/83289618.cms||---
---||Mumbai||At Level 2, Thane to unlock today||THANE: The lake city will welcome Monday morning to a near normal pre-Covid routine as the district disaster management authority, Sunday afternoon, declared Thane corporation limits to be in Level 2 and relaxing several restrictions enforced in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic. Thane is the only city other thane Navi Mumbai in the district to feature in Level 2 while Kalyan-Dombvili has been marked Level 3 along with peripheral towns including Ambernath, Badlapur, Mira-Bhayender and the rural parts that have been combined and slotted in Level 3. The Level 2 ranking lifts several restrictions on operations of theatres, shopping avenues and travel constraints also (see box for details) thereby drawing a near normalcy in the routine life of citizens here. Residents will however have to follow the norms while travelling to Level 3 cities including Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombvili. Municipal commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma said the city missed the Level 1 position by a whisker considering that the positivity here was hovering near 5% and the oxygen bed occupancy was also 15%. “The DMA observed that we were on the borderline and has nonetheless marked us in the Level 2 category. We have been told that if the dependency on oxygen beds reduces further this week, we may be elevated to Level 1,” he said. Meanwhile, there was visible excitement among residents and the trader community considering the restrictions will be lifted. Mitesh Shah, a trader representative from Naupada area said, “We are happy that the restrictions are lifted. We have already been complying by the safety norms since the last time and will now be more proactive to do our bit and ensure the volume of cases in Thane remains low,” he said. Bhavika Mehta, a Ghodbunder resident and mother of two teenagers said her family had a list of electronic items and wares to purchase ahead of the oncoming academic year. Officials said there will be a weekly review of all district and units on Thursday following which the DMAs will review and rank the areas accordingly. The administration said despite the relaxations, they will nonetheless be working towards controlling the Covid cases and also appealed residents to follow all safety protocol and don’t let the city slip back on the weekly rankings. “The onus is now equally on the administration to enforce the safety norms and residents also so that they don’t lose their guard and keep the infection at bay,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/at-level-2-thane-to-unlock-today/articleshow/83292293.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Ratan Tadvi, a native of Chhota Udepur, was reportedly scared as he was suffering from other diseases too. Cops are investigating the reasons behind his suicide. Tadvi was admitted to Sterling Hospital on May 30 after being detected positive for Covid. “He was in the ICU and was kept on oxygen. On Sunday, at about 8.30 am, he got up and walked up straight to the window and jumped off the hospital building,” said S V Chaudhary, Gotri police inspector. Deceased was an employee of GUVNL and was suffering from diabetes too. He died of severe injuries on his head. Chaudhary said that Tadvi, a resident of Sankheda, didn’t leave any suicide note behind. When asked the possible reasons that led him to take the extreme step, Chaudhary said, “Some time ago, a patient on the bed next to him had died. It is possible that Tadvi must have been scared by that death and decided to end his life. We are still investigating the reasons,” Chaudhary added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/covidve-man-jumps-to-death/articleshow/83290012.cms||---

Kumar was remanded to judicial custody on June 2. “Considering the averments made in the application and keeping in view the facts of the case, let a reply to the present application be called from the jail authorities concerned on June 8,” directed chief metropolitan magistrate Satvir Singh Lamba. Kumar, in his plea filed and argued through advocates Pradeep Rana and Ankit Rana, stated that he was an Olympian and Padma Shri recipient and has led a “very disciplined life” throughout. “If the applicant is lodged with hardened criminals, the same will have debilitating impact on him and cause irreparable damage to him (especially on his mental health),” the plea stated. The plea pointed out that one of the victims of the incident had 20-odd cases, including that of murder, against him and was associated with one Kala Jathedi gang. “There is a perceived threat to the applicant from members of such a gang,” the plea argued. “Therefore, keeping the applicant with other inmates will cause grave threat to the life, safety and security of the applicant and hence, need for a separate cell is of utmost importance in the present circumstances,” it added. Kumar also asserted that he consumes supplements such as “isolate whey protein, omega 3 capsules, jointment capsules, pre-workout C4 and hyde, multivitamin GNC, etc.” and requires a special nutrition diet owing to his profession. “The supplements are extremely necessary for the applicant to maintain his health and performance,” his application underscored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sushil-kumar-files-plea-for-separate-cell-special-diet/articleshow/83291226.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Ex-defence doctors provide online consultations in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Around 700 people from the state have consulted ex-defence doctors who started providing online consultation on e-Sanjeevani OPD around a month ago. While 100 retired armed forces doctors have registered to provide their voluntary services from across the country, five are from Rajasthan who are giving general consultations at present. City-based ex-defence doctor Col Manish Bassi (retd) said, “Since online OPD was launched a month ago, more than 11,000 consultations have been attended by retired defence doctors across the country while more than 700 have been from Rajasthan alone. On an average, I attend 20-25 consultations daily. Currently, the retired doctors are not providing specialised consultations.” After the consultation, which can be either through calls (audio or video) or chats, doctors give digital prescriptions which can be used for getting medicines. “At times, a relative of the patient also consults in case the latter is unable to give proper details. In one consultation, three medical reports of the patient can be uploaded if required for the doctor to see,” added Bassi. The online consultation can be done between 9am and 5pm. e-Sanjeevani OPD is a government of India flagship telemedicine platform developed by the Centre for Development of Advance Computing (C-DAC), Mohali, under the aegis of MoHFW and is functioning extremely well. It provides free consultations to any Indian citizen. However, with Covid cases surging, the demand for doctors is up as many of whom are deputed for Covid ward duties. This is where the defence veterans are stepping in to help, said officials. The medical branch of HQ Integrated Defence Staff is providing telemedicine service for the serving and retired defence personnel and has coordinated with MoHFW and NIC to roll out this exdefence OPD for civilian patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ex-defence-docs-provide-online-consultations-to-700-patients-in-a-month/articleshow/83291183.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

He asked people to prefer Aavin milk over milk from private companies which he said is adulterated in various ways. “Why do people have to go for private milk companies knowing about the adulteration when Aavin produces milk which can be matched with mother’s milk in terms of purity,” said the minister who was in Pudukottai to inspect Aavin units as well as milk distribution on Sunday. He was responding to a question on charges of adulteration against private milk companies raised by the previous government. He said the government will carry out a probe if it received complaints. Asked about PETA’s suggestion to Amul to promote vegan milk production as dairy business subjects animals to cruelty, the minister said, “Amul has adequately responded to the suggestion and we have nothing more to add to it.” He said milk procurement has gone up from 36 lakh litres a day to 40 lakh litres ever since the new government assumed charge. The sales too have gone up during the lockdown. Aavin procures 63,000 litres of milk every day of which 21,500 is sold as sachets within Pudukottai district alone while the rest is transferred to Chennai for making value-added products. On the chances of milk procurement price being increased by Aavin to benefit farmers, he said the state government reduced price by Rs 3 a litre for Aavin milk which is causing a loss of Rs 220 crore annually. “We have been trying to bring down losses through innovative practises, but increasing procurement price may not be possible soon,” he said. He said Aavin is producing 152 value added products as of now and some more are in the pipeline. Blaming the previous AIADMK government for confining Aavin within the state without realising its potential in national and global market, he said Aavin is not reaching even its neighbouring states. “But products of Amul, Nandini milk and other brands are being supplied to several states. We will not only take steps to take Aavin across the country, but we are in talks with other countries to take our value-added products,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/aavin-milk-equal-to-mothers-milk-min/articleshow/83291185.cms||---

Kataria directed the CMHO to prepare a roster for the doctors, especially working at rural CHCs and PHCs and to put them on night duty as well. Khachariyawas directed that action should be taken against private hospitals if attendants (of Covid patients) were not allowed to meet family members. They also directed the officials to ensure ration is distributed to all the beneficiaries (under NFSA and other schemes) in a systematic manner instead of taking harsh action against officials. They also stressed on the need to strengthen community health centre (CHC) and primary health centre (PHC) services in the district. Instead of buying expensive mobile ambulances, Kataria directed the officials to buy cheaper mobile vans so that health services can be extended to people living in both urban and rural areas. Kataria gave instructions that large-size boards should be put up at all hospitals giving information about treatment under CM Chiranjeevi Yojana. “At the time of admitting patients, they should be explained about the scheme and if the hospital is not able to provide benefits under the scheme for any reason, they should be referred to some other hospital,” he told the officials. Khachariyawas said, “Information about vaccinating people in slum areas and other places must be given to the local MLA. Also, ensure that private hospitals do not indulge in unreasonable profiteering with regard to vaccination. Strict action should be taken against private hospitals for refusing to hand over the body of Covid patients to the family if they are unable to pay up the bill and if they are overcharged,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ministers-review-covid-mgmt-in-district/articleshow/83291190.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Second wave continues to recede: Just three Vidarbha districts report 100+ new Covid-19 cases||NAGPUR: The number of Covid-19 positive patients is reducing constantly in Vidarbha. On Sunday, only 1,021 new cases were reported in the region. Only Amravati (299), Nagpur (196) and Akola (151) reported a three-figure increase in cases.

The move comes after it was found during a micro analysis that city neighbourhoods with many private hospitals reported more cases than the others. K Abishekapuram zone that accounts for more than 80% of private hospitals in the city has reported maximum fresh infections and mortalities. The zone which also houses MGMGH is regarded as medical hub of the central districts. About 35% of infections in the city so far have come from this zone. Officials said that there were complaints from general public about the lethargic behaviour of some private hospital staff including poor waste management practices such as dumping hospital waste at public spots. Trichy corporation has identified 60-80 locations in K Abishekapuram zone as highly vulnerable spots requiring special attention. “More shops will open up from Monday due to lockdown relaxations and there will be public movement. If we do not restrict the activities near the hospitals that treats Covid patients, infections will rise again,” a senior official with the city corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/hospital-localities-in-trichy-ration-shops-in-madurai-more-vulnerable/articleshow/83291191.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Ahmedabad||Geothermal-powered desalination system designed by three profs||AHMEDABAD: Three professors have joined hands to design a geothermal-powered desalination system. “Geothermal energy was used as a heating source for a desalination system in this project. This desalination system is designed to provide drinking water 24 hours and is especially useful in water-scarce areas,” said Manan Shah, a professor at Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), Gandhinagar. The other professors involved in the project include assistant professor Mitul Prajapati of S. S. Agrawal Institute of Engineering & Technology, Navsari and professor Bhavna Soni of Sal College of Engineering, Ahmedabad. Water is the one of fundamental needs of each living thing on the earth. Yet, in past couple of decades the quality and the amount of consumable water is diminishing because of contamination and environmental changes. About 97% of the water, from seas, oceans and bays, is salty and hence cannot be consumed for drinking without processing. In order to meet the demand for potable water we need to carry out desalination of seawater or brackish water, Shah said. Desalination is the process of removing regular salt (sodium chloride) from water. The water from the geothermal-powered desalination system can be utilized for a variety of purposes, including drinking, agriculture, and industrial, said Shah. Gujarat has many potential geothermal energy locations, such as Unai, Tuwa, Dholera, among others. Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source. It is available in the form of high temperature water or steam in the earth and the temperature of this hot liquid is 70C to 200C, which is known as geo-fluid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/geothermal-powered-desalination-system-designed-by-three-profs/articleshow/83291184.cms||---

The Vijayawada taxpayers’ association said that the tax reforms will add a burden of Rs 500 crore on taxpayers over the next three years. CPI(M) state secretariat member Ch Babu Rao said, “While people of the state are facing difficulties in meeting daily expenses, the VMC authorities are planning on adding tax burden. YSRC, in its municipal election campaign, promised to continue the existing annual rent value (ARV) system, but failed to keep its promise.” Meanwhile, Jana Sena has objected the proposed taxation for door-to-door garbage collection. Opposition parties in Andhra Pradesh have threatened to go on strike if the government implements the tax reforms. The TDP has called for state-wide protests in adherence with Covid-19 protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/civic-bodys-proposed-tax-reforms-face-opposition/articleshow/83266875.cms||Venu Lanka

Systems for ground-water recharging and rain-water harvesting, checked. Strict rules in place to curb pollution, checked. Sewage treatment plant (STP) and reusing wastewater mechanism, checked. The green model adopted by a village located just around 11 kms Bhuj, the headquarter of Kutch district, can give modern town-planners from around the world a run for their money. The Kukma village has become a perfect example of coexistence with nature. The green revolution at Kukma was achieved thanks to the community initiative of the population of around 10,000. The gram panchayat too played the perfect role as catalyst to bring about the green change. The villagers have planted 60,000 trees in the last four years. Village sarpanch Kankuben Vankar boasts about how several pockets of dense trees — Krishna baug, Buddha Upvan, Gamadiyo Dungar, Datapur Dungar and Bordi Dungar — have been developed since 2017. One of the green pockets was developed using the Japanese Miyawaki method. The village has a sewage treatment plant (STP) with the capacity of 10 MLD. The treated water from STP is used to irrigate the five acre land on which tree plantation has been done. Kukma has also set an example in water conservation. Students from nearby colleges conduct surveys and come with plans on saving groundwater. There are ten ponds in the village out of which the dredging and deepening work of five has been completed. Also, 25 bore wells have been recharged using the water harvesting method. “Our ponds are full throughout the year. We don’t face water scarcity even in the summer. We believe in zero pollution and anyone littering plastic waste near water bodies gets a warning. A repeat offender is fined Rs 100. Every month the water bodies are cleaned on the day of Amavas,” sarpanch Vankar said. Technology is used to keep surveillance on the violators with 25 CCTV cameras installed at the village. An artificial tank has also been constructed beside a water body for the immersion of idols during religious festivals. The village has come up with a unique plastic waste collection plan. The panchayat gives grains in exchange for plastic garbage collected by the villagers. The panchayat has signed a contract with a private company which purchases the plastic waste.  “Our aim is to make Kukma completely plastic free. However, it’s not possible looking at the wide use of plastic so we request villagers to be careful about not polluting the surroundings with plastic waste. We have also distributed cloth bags to discourage use of plastic bags.” Vankar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/kutchs-kukma-village-shows-the-way-to-live-in-perfect-harmony-with-nature/articleshow/83289679.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Hyderabad||Telangana lockdown cost state Rs 3,000 crore income loss in May||HYDERABAD: Lockdown to contain the surge of Covid-19 in Telangana with just a four-hour relaxation in May, cost the state Rs 3,000 crore in income from multiple sectors and taxes, officials said on Sunday. The initial per day assessment of loss of income for the state because of the lockdown in May is pegged at Rs 150 crore . According to top sources in the finance department, the state government lost Rs 30 crore from registrations, Rs 20 crore from transport, Rs 30 crore from excise, while other sectors and taxes resulted in combined loss of Rs 70 crore in May alone. An analysis of last year’s strict lockdown had put the daily loss for the state from government and private sectors at about Rs 1,700 crore. Using the same parameters for this year’s lockdown, there is an assumption that the per day loss for the state is around Rs 800 crore in both private and government sectors combined. B Vinod Kumar, planning board vice-chairman, said, “The lockdown will have economic impact, but we will not cut down on any social welfare measures promised by the government as during the post-lockdown period, people will need more support. Perhaps we will slow down our capital expenditure if needed.” Even with the economic loss last year, welfare measures were not cut, he said. Both in the government and private sectors, the biggest losses were seen in services and transport sectors. Experts say the lockdown had minimal impact on agriculture and construction, but people in the unorganised sector suffered heavy losses. “Many in the unorganised sector are suffering income loss. The government should come up with schemes for them and give them minimum cash support if needed,” said Dr Krishna Reddy, assistant professor, School of Economics, University of Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-lockdown-cost-state-rs-3000cr-income-loss-in-may/articleshow/83293869.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Coimbatore||Home isolation norms turn stringent in some Tamil Nadu districts||TRICHY/COIMBATORE: Health authorities in several districts have become more stringent in allowing home isolation despite fresh Covid-19 infections seeing a downward trend in the state. The tightening of norms stems from the high number of deaths reported among patients under home isolation who apparently were hesitant to get admitted to hospitals soon after their health deteriorated. However, while Trichy, Coimbatore and Tirupur districts have restricted the home isolation option, things appear to be a bit liberal in Chennai and Madurai where ‘eligible’ positive cases can still self-isolate. In Trichy, the city corporation has told private hospitals not to suggest home isolation for Covid-positive cases. This despite fresh infections in the city falling by 60% compared to the scene in May. Positive cases are told to get screened at government medical college hospital and 14 administrative blocks. Only after the medical team is convinced after checking the vitals is home isolation permitted provided the patient has proper facilities. In Tirupur, the health department has been lodging those who had undergone tests at interim Covid care centres (ICCCs) to prevent the risk of Covid patients becoming spreaders. Once the results are out, they will be moved either to hospitals or CCC based on the doctor’s recommendation. “ We have completely stopped allowing people to isolate at home since May 27,” an official of the health department said. In Coimbatore, the health department is limiting the home isolation option to just a few patients provided they have sufficient facility. The city corporation has formed teams to enquire and confirm that those who opted for home isolation are strictly following norms. A majority of the fresh cases in Coimbatore are lodged either at CCCs or at hospitals depending on the severity of the infection. The availability of beds due to the reduced infection rate is another reason why the norms for home isolation were tightened. As the six Covid care centres (CCC) in Trichy district had only less than 20% occupancy as of Sunday, milder infections are referred to CCC. “We are giving priority to CCC for monitoring mild infection cases over home isolation based on the saturated oxygen level. Though this it to avoid late admissions resulting in deaths, genuine cases will be permitted,” a senior health official in Trichy said. Curiously, the health authorities were less stringent in awarding home isolation option when the cases were peaking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/covid-19-home-isolation-norms-turn-stringent-in-some-tn-districts/articleshow/83297581.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Goa||Goa: At current rate, vaccination of 18-44 age group will take minimum six months||PANAJI: Even as chief minister Pramod Sawant claimed that the state would vaccinate the entire 18-44 age group by July-end, projections based on current vaccination rates show that that may remain a pipe dream unless Goa manages to vaccinate at least 10,000 persons a day. The last four days saw 16,138 persons in the age group get the jab, and at this rate, it would conservatively take close to six months before the entire age group is vaccinated. The directorate of health services estimates that there are around 6.5 lakh individuals in the 18-44 years age group, and 5.5 lakh persons in the 45 years and above bracket. At present, just 10% of the state has been vaccinated. In fact, since the vaccination drive kicked off on January 16, just 96,736 persons have been fully vaccinated. At this rate, the rough projection shows that it would take over four years for the remaining eligible population of the state to receive both doses. The chief minister’s bold statement last week may have raised some hopes, but doctors say that the data and vaccination trends tell a different story. On Sunday, just 4,788 people in the 18-44 years bracket got the jab. The total number of beneficiaries who got vaccinated on June 6 is 10,297, which includes healthcare workers, frontline workers and those above 45 years. Doctors said that there are two issues and both are interlinked. One is to get more people vaccinated and increase the vaccination rate, the other is availability of vaccines. “We are looking at 10,000 vaccinations per day, that is the target for the 18-44 age group. If we are able to do so, we can cover this group in three months. The target is to do it as early as possible,” said an official source. However, a senior GMC doctor said that the state is far from 100% vaccination. “If we could not hit vaccination targets at the peak of the wave, how will we meet targets when cases are low?” the doctor, a head of the department, said. Senior doctors say that unless the state government undertakes a course correction, it would be very difficult for the state to vaccinate a significant part of Goa’s population. “Misinformation and propaganda are big problems in Covid management. The only way to counter vaccine hesitancy is to challenge it and tackle it with urgency,” said a senior doctor who is part of the task force for the third wave. He pointed out to rumours being spread that the vaccine affects fertility, potency and menstruation. One of the biggest challenges before the state is the inconsistent vaccine supply. “You cannot go on campaign mode for vaccination if you don’t have a consistent supply of vaccines” said the GMC HoD. “Once you resolve the inconsistency in supply, only then can you reach out to people.” Doctors have recommended that the state election machinery, along with local elected representatives, should be roped in to enhance participation in the vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/at-current-rate-vaccination-of-18-44-age-group-will-take-min-six-months/articleshow/83292318.cms||Newton Sequeira

As thousands were vaccinated in the camps, the civic body was urged to procure more vaccines to meet the demand. The camps were held at the zonal offices in K Abishekapuram, Srirangam, Ariyamangalam and Ponmalai. Around 314 were vaccinated in Srirangam followed by 265 in the Ariyamangalam zone, 251 in K Abishekapuram and 258 in the Ponmalai zone. Only Covaxin first dose was administered to the people. Official sources indicating the demand for vaccines hinted at the possible suspension of special vaccination camps until the adequate stock of vaccines arrives at the city. Among the 45+ age group people, a total of 475 took the jab on Sunday in 18 UPHCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/1088-takes-shot-in-spl-vax-camps/articleshow/83291201.cms||---
---||Trichy||Road works may cause traffic snarls in Trichy||TRICHY: As lockdown relaxations will come into effect from Monday, roads in the city are expected to witness bottlenecks as multiple roadworks are underway on major roads. As government offices and grocery, meat outlets are set to reopen after weeks, vehicular movement on arterial roads is expected to be high this week. Near Gandhi market, the home for wholesale grocery dealers and vegetable sellers, both the urban local body and state highways are carrying out multiple construction works almost on all major roads. While the Thanjavur main road near Varaganeri Bazaar was closed for all types of vehicles by the state highways to reconstruct a culvert, Trichy Corporation has closed a portion of Melapudur main road for cars and heavy vehicles, not too far away from Varaganeri. Similarly, Trichy Corporation has taken up culvert widening work on Thennur high road, which has been completely closed. Until a few weeks back, the road was serving as an alternate road for the already closed Salai road undergoing bridge reconstruction work. While it is usual for culvert work to go on with partial closure, residents were surprised to see multiple roads completely closed for even two-wheelers.  “While dropping off our workers, we had to face a lot of diversions consuming time and fuel. The construction work could have been taken up in a phased manner,” said C Parthiban, a rice mill owner in Trichy. Police have barricaded key junctions where construction works are underway and people approaching hospitals for emergency were forced to take a longer detour. “We completely closed the roads to finish the work before the lockdown got over. We will take measures for allowing partial movement of vehicles,” a senior official with the state highways department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/road-works-may-cause-traffic-snarls-in-trichy-city/articleshow/83291199.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Companies paying less wages to offset rising cost burden||JAIPUR: Contrary to the concerns of labour shortage at factories that manufacture apparels, home furnishing products and handicrafts for domestic markets, depressed wages are a worry for many labourers who chose not to leave for their native places and stayed back during the lockdown. Jaber Ali, a tailor from Malda district in West Bengal, working in a textile company in Sitapura industrial area said his income per piece had reduced by 20% and there was not enough work to do overtime and make up for the losses. “I used to make Rs 20,000-22,000 per month before the lockdown. Now, that has come down to about Rs 12,000. If I was getting Rs 50 per shirt earlier, now I get Rs 40,” said Ali who chose to stay back unlike some of his friends at the factory who left for their homes just before the lockdown came into force. As markets, malls and retail outlets remain closed, manufacturers catering to retailers like Reliance, Shoppers Stop, Westside and others have slashed production to about 25%. While about 60% of the workers have gone home, there is not enough work for those who stayed back. Digvijay Dhabriya, chairman of PHDCCI-Rajasthan said, “The reduction in wages is factory specific. About 30% of operation cost is fixed. Whether a factory works at 80% of capacity utilisation or 30%, this component remains same. That’s why when a factory runs at a lower capacity, the cost of production per unit of product rises because of the fixed cost. Maybe some companies rationalizing that by reducing some wage cost.” However, he said it is important for a company to engage as many workers as it can during the current situation. Otherwise, they will leave Jaipur and go to other places like Delhi, Noida, or Gujarat, he added. Ali may represent a small group, but most of the tailors are from Bihar. The apparel industry is dependent on them. While the companies catering to domestic market are facing demand headwinds, the work orders for exporters are in a better position and they need the tailors to come back. Vimal Shah, president of the Garment Exporters Association of Rajasthan said, “Tailoring is a major part of the production. We need them and they are willing to come back. But the cancellation of bus service is a hurdle for them. The bus services to Bihar should be restored. Many prefer buses as they are picked up from their villages directly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cos-paying-less-wages-to-labourers-to-offset-rising-cost-burden/articleshow/83291192.cms||---

The state cabinet is likely to extend the relaxation window by a few more hours as Covid-19 cases were showing a downward trend in the state. Presently, there is a lockdown in the state up to June 9 with a relaxation window for the people betweeen 6am and 1 pm, with an hour’s grace period for them to get back to their homes by 2 pm. The cabinet would discuss the situation in the state amidst the second wave of the pandemic, its impact on public health, medical and health facilities, agriculture operations and state economy, and take decisions accordingly. With coronavirus cases showing a downward trend following several measures taken up by the government, the cabinet would discuss the strategy to be adopted and action plan to be put in place department-wise. The council of ministers would also dwell on the preventive measures to be taken by the medical and health department and its readiness to face the possible third wave of Covid-19 in the state. The cabinet would also review ongoing irrigation projects, measures to be taken, availability of water for irrigation purposes during the monsoon and other irrigation-related issues. With the financial assistance under Rythu Bandhu to be extended from June 15 and sowing operations being taken up ahead of the monsoon, the cabinet might take crucial decisions on measures to be taken to control the sale of spurious seeds, availability of fertilisers, pesticides and other agriculture-related issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cabinet-meet-tomorrow-may-take-call-on-lockdown-extension/articleshow/83291203.cms||---

---||Goa||Post-Covid lung fibrosis fills up beds at St Inez chest hosp||Panaji: The number of patients needing hospitalisation post their recovery from Covid with severe pneumonia has gone up. They stand the risk of developing lung fibrosis and, already, all 80 beds at TB hospital in St Inez, Panaji, have been taken by such patients. “Since the Covid-19 patient load during the second wave was much higher as compared to that seen in the first wave, naturally, we are seeing more patients post their recovery. Also, the number of patients whose condition worsened very fast during this wave was greater,” Goa Medical College’s head of TB and pulmonary medicine, Dr Durga Lawande said. Senior pulmonologist and director of Horizon Hospital, Dr Pravin Bhatt said that they now commonly see patients who have higher chances of developing lung fibrosis. “The condition is mostly seen in the elderly who suffered from severe Covid pneumonia with a CT scan severity score of more than 15. Also, alcoholics, smokers, and people having other comorbidities are likely to develop post-covid fibrosis,” Bhatt said. The number of patients needing treatment to avoid lung fibrosis, Lawande said, will depend on how many had severe pneumonia. “Such patients face the risk of developing lung fibrosis and will continue to need oxygen beyond the normal period,” she said. “They will need extended treatment in the hospital. On an average, 75% of the patients who had severe Covid pneumonia will require further hospitalisation in non-Covid wards for an average of 10 to 20 days,” she said. Such patients will need oxygen support for about a month and a half, and their oxygen saturation level will gradually increase. “We closely follow such cases. Some we are still following from the first wave and almost all of them have done well,” she said. Bhatt said that potential patients will be ones who at the time of discharge remain breathless and require oxygen support. Their CT scan will classically show scarring of lung tissue. “The lungs shrink causing breathlessness and have other effects. We start such patients on anti-fibrotic drugs a little early. Most of them will do well. Those who don’t respond to treatment may require lung transplant,” said Bhatt. The oxygen saturation level of persons developing lung fibrosis is low all the time and they will not be able to do routine activities, as the damage is permanent. “We don’t want patients to go into that condition and such patients are started on anti-fibrotic drugs, other supportive drugs, and oxygen immediately. Some are prescribed steroids, but it is done in select cases,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/post-covid-lung-fibrosis-fills-up-beds-at-st-inez-chest-hosp/articleshow/83292367.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Nagpur||‘Cocktail drug’ for Covid now available in Nagpur||NAGPUR: Monoclonal antibody combination therapy of Casirivimab and Imdevimab for treating Covid-19 in the early stages has now reached the city. The drug, also known as ‘cocktail drug’, had gained global attention after it was administered to former US president Donald Trump. Not deterred by the cost, Rs1.20 lakh per pack, many doctors and hospitals are trying to stock the drug, which has two-year shelf life, so as to tackle the anticipated waves as many feel its demand too may shoot up as it happened in case of Remdesivir, Amphotericin B or Tocilizumab. The drug, originally launched by pharmaceutical giants Roche and Regeneron as REGN-COV2, is also expected to be used for treating paediatric patients above 12 years of age, the group feared to be mostly affected during the third wave. Dr Rajendra Agarwal of Asha Hospital, who was one of the first buyers, said the drug seems to be effective on co-morbid patients. “It helps stop replication of the virus if administered at the earliest,” he said. Dr Jaspal Singh Arneja, who also has procured the drug, said the drug should administered as early as possible. “Ideally, it should be the first drug to be given. It has a proven efficacy,” he said. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said clinical trials of the drug, especially on cancer patients, have been encouraging. “The trial showed 74% risk reduction. If given within five to six days of the onset of the symptoms, then it can be beneficial,” he said. “The drug is ideal for cancer, HIV and such immunocompromised patients,” said Dr Shinde. Well-known pharmacist and stockist Jay Tekchandani said he has already supplied the drug to a few doctors and hospitals in the last two days. “We have started getting inquiries and demand seems to be growing,” he said. Renowned paediatrician Dr Sandip Mogre also said studies support the theory that monoclonal antibody therapies can be also useful for paediatric patients between 12 and 17 age and who weigh at least 40 kg. Dr Nilesh Agrawal, deputy director (administration), Alexis Multispecialty Hospital said, “We have procured two units after having a discussion with our medical experts. Our plan is to carefully use it on clinically indicated patients.” Dr Kamal Bhutada, director of ICU, Care Hospital, said the key to success of the cocktail drug therapy is the selection of right patients with risk factors for administering it. “Given early to the patients with high risks may reduce their chances of progression to severity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cocktail-drug-for-covid-now-available-in-nagpur/articleshow/83291228.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Hyderabad||Pandemic draw: Groundwater table hits new lows in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: During the two waves of the Covid pandemic, Hyderabadis have extracted a lot of groundwater. The reason being: Telangana government imposed lockdown in phases based on the spike in the cases and it was observed that Hyderabad district witnessed a huge depletion in the groundwater table. The depletion was noticed when the Hyderabad Ground Water Department (GWD) measured the ground water table through piezometers installed in Asifnagar, Bandlaguda,Bahadurpura, Charminar, Himayat nagar, Saidabad, Musheerabad, Secunderabad, Marredpally, Ameerpet, S R Nagar, Khairatabad, Nampally, Shaikpet and Tirumalagiri areas. GWD observed that in May 2020 and May 2021—considered as ‘peak’ months in the summer season—the ground water depleted between 0.34 meters and 5.27 meters depth below to the ground level. “Usually, the consumption during summer is high, but with the pandemic situation, residents couldn’t leave the city due to lockdown. As a result, they extracted more water,” a GWD official said. For instance, in Khairatabad, the recorded ground table in May 2020 was 15.97 meters. In May 2021, a depletion of 10.70 meters was noticed. Not only is Khairatabad a residential area, but also a highly commercial area, which could be the reason for the highest depletion in ground water consumption, the official opined. Surprisingly, in Marredpally—which used to have very high ground water depletion levels in the city—GWD records revealed that there was a depletion of only two meters.  According to the GWD report, in May 2020, the recorded ground water table was 20.90 meters, but in May 2021, the table fell to 18.35 meters. “Groundwater percolated due to copious rainfall. Additionally, the October floods could have also added to the water table,” the ground water department’s analyst said. The GWD predicts that the city may witness a rise in the ground water table this rainy season, based on the IMD’s forecast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pandemic-draw-groundwater-table-hits-new-lows-in-city/articleshow/83292375.cms||Sunil Mungara

The circular was issued on Saturday by the nursing superintendent of Govind Ballabh Pant Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education & Research (GIPMER) and strict action is likely after an investigation that is already being conducted. The hospital’s medical director, Dr Anil Agarwal, issued an order revoking the circular. Saturday’s circular was issued without any instruction or knowledge of the hospital administration and Delhi government and stands withdrawn with immediate effect, the order stated. Dr Agarwal confirmed to TOI that the circular had been revoked. The Saturday circular read, “A complaint has been received regarding Malayalam language being used for communication in working places in GIPMER. Whereas maximum patients and colleagues do not know this language and feel helpless causing a lot of inconvenience. So, it is directed to all nursing personnel to use only Hindi and English for communication. Otherwise, serious action will be taken.” An official of GB Pant Nurses’ Association said out of around 850 nurses, almost 400 were Malayali. The circular was issued based on a patient’s complaint to a senior officer in the health department regarding the use of Malayalam at the hospital, Liladhar Ramchandani, association president, claimed, adding that “the union disagrees with the wordings”. The circular invited criticism from the medical fraternity, politicians and the public. Congress’ Rahul Gandhi called for stopping language discrimination, while MP Shashi Tharoor called it “unacceptable, crude, offensive and a violation of the basic human rights of Indian citizens”. Last year, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences had issued an order advising staff that regional languages should not be spoken on its premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hospital-revokes-circular-on-use-of-malayalam/articleshow/83291357.cms||---

---||Goa||Strokes, heart attacks: For some, Covid recovery not the end of story||PANAJI: For some of the over 1.4 lakh people in Goa who’ve been cured of Covid-19, recovery isn’t the end of the disease. Across the state, patients have seen the virus come back to haunt them, leading to a heart attack, stroke, or even a pulmonary embolism, a dangerous condition that blocks the artery in the lungs. While Goa Medical College (GMC) has started collecting data of patients with post-Covid-19 complications, doctors said that they have been seeing patients with a history of Covid-19 suffering a wide range of serious complications. “As per guidelines, Covid-19 patients are put on blood thinners, yet in some cases, after recovery or at the time of discharge, we have seen an increase in blood clotting that can lead to complicating conditions. Some suffer while undergoing treatment for Covid-19, and some after their recovery,” said Dr Vinayaga Pandian, a consulting cardiologist at Victor Hospital. Pandian said that one of his senior citizen patients suffered a stroke while still recovering from Covid-19, causing paralysis. GMC consulting cardiologist Dr Manjunath Desai said that a pulmonary embolism (which can also occur post-Covid) is a rare condition and sometimes can be worse than a heart attack. It is difficult to treat and at times can lead to permanent disability and heart failure, he said. “We treated a 40-year-old patient who had a pulmonary embolism. He was picked up on time for treatment, as he came from a family of doctors,” Pandian said. Overall, Desai said that in Goa, they have seen relatively young as well as aged patients having post-Covid heart attacks, and they have been treated successfully. “Though there is a temporal relation between a patient suffering a heart attack or stroke and his Covid history, I cannot say with certainty that the patients in question would not have suffered a heart failure had they not contracted the virus, until proven by a study,” Desai said. Dr Chitralekha Nayak, a consulting physician at Healthway Hospital, said while during the first wave of the pandemic, she saw several cases of heart attacks or stroke after patients had Covid-19, during the ongoing wave, she has seen some peculiar cases of patients having a low-grade fever even after twenty-days of Covid-19. Though their condition was not life-threatening, they still needed to be investigated and put on a short course of steroids, Nayak said. She however stressed that more research needs to be done on this mutation of the virus. “The virus has become very severe, patients are either surviving or dying, even some of those who came on time for treatment,” she said. “Some do not respond to treatment. Those patients probably required oxygen to be given early. Initially, we saw patients’ oxygen levels dropping on the ninth day of the infection, but this time, some had their oxygen dropping on the seventh day itself.” People having underlying health conditions and falling in the high-risk category — those with diabetes, high cholesterol or other comorbidities — or even people with healthy lifestyles but who are unaware of their condition as no tests were done till the problem surfaced, also face risks of developing blood clots. Pandian said that during the pre-Covid era, people could choose to ignore any symptoms of a heart ailment or any discomfort for a day or two, but not anymore. “Now if you are unwell and you decide to put off seeing a doctor even for a day, chances are that you might not live to see the next day, or land with complications,” he said. People should not underestimate symptoms like breathlessness, chest pain, vague headache, vision disturbance, or any vague indicators — sweating profusely, drop in energy levels, abdominal pain, doctors say, adding that it is better to investigate these conditions thoroughly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/strokes-heart-attacks-for-some-covid-recovery-not-end-of-story/articleshow/83292386.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Will float fresh global tender for vaccines, says Ma Subramanian||UDHA GAMANDALAM: The state government will again float a global tender for vaccines as its earlier tender, which ended on Saturday, did not attract any bidders, health and family welfare minister Ma Subramanian said here on Sunday. The minister reviewed the Covid situation in the Nilgiris district. Accompanied by forest minister K Ramachandran, Subramanian inspected the upcoming medical college building in Ooty and the newly installed 6KL oxygen unit at the Government headquarters hospital. Later, he inaugurated a vaccination camp at the Chemmanatham tribal hamlet falling under the Masinagudi panchayat. Speaking to reporters, the health minister said, “For the tribal population in the Nilgiris, vaccination drives are being conducted at their doorstep. Of the total population of 177 in the Chemmanatham hamlet, 152 are above 18 years of age.” All 152 were vaccinated on Sunday. He said, “Once the vaccination drive is over, the tribal hamlet would be declared as the first tribal village in the state to be completely vaccinated.” Of the total population of 27,032 tribals in the Nilgiris, the number of eligible tribal people for vaccination (above 18 years of age) stands at 21,435, Subramanian said, “As many as 3,129 tribal people have taken their jabs so far. By June end, all the eligible tribal population would be vaccinated.” The minister said, “The Ooty GH is functioning with all facilities at par with government hospitals in Chennai. It is a self-sufficient hospital with no shortage of oxygen.” Later, Subramanian launched a vaccination camp for estate workers at Chembala tea estate near Gudalur. At least 150 estate workers were vaccinated on the day. The minister also inspected the Kokkakadu containment zone in Gudalur taluk. He said, “Tamil Nadu will receive 42 lakh doses of vaccine before June.” He warned private hospitals against deviating from government-prescribed norms while treating Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/will-float-fresh-global-tender-for-vaccines-says-minister/articleshow/83291239.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Two women held with heroin worth Rs 78 crore||HYDERABAD: In one of the biggest hauls of narcotic substances in recent years at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) arrested two African women and seized 12kg heroin valued at Rs 78 crore from them. Acting on an input, the DRI team intercepted a woman passenger from Uganda, who arrived from Zimbabwe via Doha on Saturday. “The woman came back to the airport on Saturday to pick up her missing luggage and we found four kilos of heroin neatly stuffed in duct-taped packets between specially made walls in the suitcase,” a DRI official said. Aother woman peddler who arrived with a consignment of heroin was Intercepted on Sunday at the airport by the DRI. “The second accused was identified as Makumba Carol from Zambia. She arrived from Johannesburg via Doha in Qatar Airways flight QR500 at 2.30am on Sunday,” said a DRI official. Carol opted for a green channel, and during the baggage screening, the DRI team noticed suspicious material in her trolley bag. “Off-white powder was concealed inside the drum of plastic pipe roll carried in her checked-in baggage. We retrieved eight kilos of the powder from the drum. Chemical test confirmed it was heroin,” a DRI team member said. DRI officials said that this is the first time such a significant quantity of heroin was seized in Hyderabad from foreign peddlers. “Heroin is highly addictive. Abusers inject, snort or smoke heroin. Addicts who regularly use heroin often develop a tolerance, needing higher and more frequent doses of the drug to get the desired effects,” he said. The peddlers were arrested under the provisions of NDPS Act 1985, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-women-held-with-heroin-worth-rs-78cr/articleshow/83293913.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore district records marginal drop in Covid-19 cases||COIMBATORE: The district recorded a marginal drop in daily Covid-19 cases on Sunday, compared to the previous day, when it added 2,645 more cases. However, there were almost double that number of people who were discharged after treatment on the day, accounting for 4,733 cases, which brought down the total active cases to 31,539. Still, Coimbatore continued to be the district with the highest number of daily fresh cases, as well as total active cases. Covid mortality was lesser than Chennai as Coimbatore reported 38 deaths against 50 in Chennai. Though the situation seems to improve and Coimbatore has been recording a steady decline in the number of daily caseload – from 4,200-odd cases eight days ago – officials said the situation cannot be termed as under control yet. Not just Coimbatore, the entire western Tamil Nadu seems to be a cause of concern. Government data points out that on Sunday, 40% of the new cases reported from Tamil Nadu were from the eight western districts. The eight districts – Coimbatore, Tirupur, Nilgiris, Salem, Erode, Namakkal, Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri accounted for 8,331 out of the 20,421 cases reported in the state. Erode was closely behind Coimbatore with 1,694 cases, followed by Salem (1,071) and Tirupur (1,068). Though the cases are dropping in some districts, the fall is not as remarkable as other districts. Even in the number of active cases, the western zone had about 38% of the total active cases. Even a small district with lesser healthcare infrastructure like Tirupur had 18,859 active cases, higher than bigger cities like Madurai and Trichy. Covid deaths, though, appear to be lesser in the region. Out of the 434 deaths reported across the state on Sunday, 108 were from the region, accounting for 24 %. While Coimbatore reported the highest number of deaths, Salem was a close second with 34 deaths. Health officials are closely monitoring the situation, especially in rural areas and taking efforts to bring down Covid-19 transmission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-records-marginal-drop-in-cases/articleshow/83291240.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Sans RT-PCR, closure for businesses||RAJKOT: Shopkeepers, showroom owners and roadside vendors too in Morbi town will have to mandatorily undergo RT-PCR tests every fortnight if they want to continue their business.  In a bid to curb crowding of people at one place and promote vaccination at the same time, the Morbi municipality has issued a notification stating that the business establishment will be sealed and roadside vendors forced to shut down if they don’t abide by the Covid-19 test rule. The sealing drive will begin today as the municipality chief officer had given five days, beginning June 1, for all owners to get themselves tested. In fact, the Morbi collector had made Covid tests including rapid antigen mandatory for all business establishment owners last month and police had started booking the violators under IPC section 188. However, the municipality has gone a step forward stating that RT-PCR was more authentic. When contacted, chief officer Girish Saraiya, said, “Shop owners are super spreaders as a large number of people gather in their premises. The number of Covid cases have drastically reduced and people are seeing taking it easy again, something which may trigger the third wave.” “We gave them five days time to get tested. Starting today, we will start sealing the establishments of violators” Saraiya added. However, those who have taken at least one dose of vaccine are exempted from this rule. “We also aim to promote vaccination by enforcing this mandatory RT-PCR rule,” the officer said. According to sources, there are around 2,000 registered business establishments in Morbi town. KP Joshi, resident additional collector said, “Our aim is not to harass the traders, but learn from the past experience when people let their guard down and cases spiked. If traders have any issues, we will call a meeting and hear their grievances.” Morbi was the worst-hit during the second wave, mainly due to lack of enough beds and the Covid patients had to be shifted to Rajkot and Jamnagar. There was no RT-PCR testing facility in Morbi till April and it was created only after the massive spike in infections. Jayanti Patel, president of Morbi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, welcomed the municipality’s notification. “Traders should take this positively. Cases are under control at present, but this rule is necessary so that traders don’t infect their customers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/sans-rt-pcr-closure-for-businesses/articleshow/83289815.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

In Dehradun, for instance, the maximum temperature touched the 37 degrees Celsius-mark on Sunday afternoon, which was one notch above normal. In Pantnagar, the day's temperature crossed 37 degrees Celsius. “The maximum temperature will continue to rise and is likely to cross the 40 degrees Celsius-mark in the plains in the days to come. So far, no district in the state has recorded the maximum temperature of 40 degrees Celsius this season. The hills will also witness an increase in the temperature levels,” said Rohit Thapliyal, senior scientist at the regional meteorological centre. He added that the temperature levels were under control across the state so far due to precipitation but the recent rise in mercury is the direct outcome of the dry weather prevailing in the state for the past four days. Besides rising temperatures, the relative humidity has also started increasing in the state.On Sunday, the relative humidity in Dehradun was recorded at 55%, while it was 69% and 59% in Pantnagar and Tehri respectively. However, another western disturbance is likely to have an impact on the weather in Uttarakhand on June 9 and 10, the Met officials said. “A fresh spell of rain and thunderstorm will occur in the state on June 9 and 10,” added Thapliyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mercury-starts-soaring-in-ukhand-likely-to-breach-40-degrees-celsius-mark-in-plains/articleshow/83289786.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Goa||Seafoam at Vasco beach hazardous to people: National Institute of Oceanography study||PANAJI: The presence of seafoam is an alarming condition in waterbodies in the country due to the adverse impact it can have on marine life and people living at or visiting coastal areas. In Goa during the southwest monsoon of 2019, frothing was noticed at Hole beach, Vasco, prompting the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) to study the plausible causes and consequences of seafoam in the coastal zone. In a report published by the NIO, scientists said that the foam formation “must be treated as a serious matter” otherwise, it has the potential “to adversely affect human health” and the tourism industry of Goa. “The Hole beach is a hotspot for tourists. The foam formation site was about 100m from the spot where people go for bathing on the beach. This beach is also connected through the famous Japanese garden which is crowded with children who often end up visiting the beach. Therefore we need to have better public awareness and foam management system,” the report read. The occurrence of foam so far has been found in three states of India in 2019 – Goa, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. Scientists from the prestigious Goa-based institute led by scientist, Dr Suhas Shetye studied inorganic and organic nutrients, phytoplankton abundance and marker pigments and foam-associated bacteria in the coastal region where the frothing was found at Hole beach in Vasco. Surface seawater was collected at the site while the mixing point sample was collected at the site where the inlet water meets the swash zone, and the inlet water (source of contamination) was collected at the starting point of the beach. “Agitation of seawater with high organic matter along with the churning action of breaking waves in surf zone causes sea foam. Along with high organic matter this region also experienced strong winds and humid, overcast conditions during the southwest monsoon that are known to facilitate the production of sea foam,” the report read. It also states that the sea foam was found only at Hole beach where the inlet from garbage dump yard meets coastal waters whereas “it was not observed in any other parts of coastal Goa.” Incidentally, a garbage dump yard is very close to the beach from where the fresh water reaches coastal sea through gutters, streams and inlet. The scientists observed that this inlet water decreases in the post monsoon season and then dries off. The report reveals that Hole beach had inlets with high organic nitrogen reaching up to 121 uM and the seawater at the site had lower salinity as compared to normal oceanic seawater. Excess loading of nitrogen in coastal waters can lead to eutrophication (plants growing on the surface of a waterbody) and algal proliferation. NIO reported an excess of organic nitrogen in coastal waters of Goa coming from fresh water runoff, and aerosol deposition. Organic nitrogen can give competitive advantage to some microscopic plankton in the ocean. In this study the high concentrations of nitrate and organic nitrogen from the fresh water inlet are most likely coming from the municipal dump yard in combination with municipal gutters, the report confirms. “However during the post monsoon season the fresh water inlet’s volume was reduced and more importantly, it had very low organic nitrogen,” the report reads. “High concentrations of inorganic and organic nitrogen along with sufficient phosphate and silicate might have resulted in a phytoplankton bloom at the study area. From the phytoplankton analysis we found that coastal waters of Hole beach had a bloom of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana,” the report reads. Thalassiosira pseudonana is known to produce the most stable surfactant (surface-active agent) as compared to most other phytoplankton. More importantly it can produce foam with a decay time that exceeds 24 hours. Several harmful pathogenic bacteria (see infographic) were associated with the foam and could pose a potential threat for fishermen, swimmers and divers visiting the Hole beach during such foam events. “Some of the species belonging to the Vibrio genus include harmful pathogens of aquatic organisms like crustaceans, mollusks, fish and humans. From the pathogenic bacteria found in this study and from the known effects of these antibiotic-resistant bacteria on marine ecosystem and human health, foam formation can be hazardous in the coastal region,” the study states. Sea foam events have increased in recent years, with countries such as India, Australia, South Africa, Spain, Netherlands and Ireland experiencing foam events in last two years. To avoid such foam formation events NIO has recommended to stop garbage dumping in coastal areas and called for municipal waste management practices to be strictly employed. It also recommends avoiding direct release of untreated sewage and other pollutants from land, and sewage processing systems.

---||Mumbai||‘High immune response in 95% health workers who took the jab’||MUMBAI/ HYDERABAD: A ‘real-world’ study of vaccinated healthcare workers has found Covishield and Covaxin could produce a high immune response in up to 95% recipients and prevent serious disease in those infected after immunisation. Interestingly, the Oxford vaccine Covishield could generate antibodies in more individuals compared to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, a pre-print of the first such Indian study has stated. Most vaccine efficacy studies so far have been lab-based.  The pan-India study of 515 vaccinated healthcare workers—425 with Covishield and 90 with Covaxin— from 13 states and 22 cities found the vaccines could generate immune response in 95% recipients 21-36 days after the second dose. Seropositivity was observed in 98% of those immunised with Covishield as opposed to 80% Covaxin recipients, a finding the researchers called “surprising”. Even the anti-spike antibody titre was found to be significantly higher in Covishield recipients (115 AU/ml) compared to Covaxin (51 AU/ml). While factors such as gender, BMI and other comorbidities didn’t seem to play much of a role, the seropositivity rate or antibodies in people above 60 years or those with type 2 diabetes was found to be significantly lower. Seropositivity rate was significantly more in participants with age less than 60 years (96.3% seropositivity) as against 87.2% in the 60-plus bracket. Infection post vaccination was seen in 5% of the study group, but none suffered from severe Covid-19. Lead author and endocrinologist Dr Awadhesh Kumar Singh of G D Hospital & Diabetes Institute, Kolkata, said the study was not to comment on which one is a better vaccine, but to look at the real-world effectiveness of vaccination. “It has shown that both vaccines are effective. It was surprising no doubt to find that higher number of people who had received Covishield had the antibodies compared to Covaxin. But in the absence of measuring neutralising antibody and cell mediated response, it is difficult to comment whether one is superior,” he said. Results of the Cross-sectional Coronavirus Vaccine-induced Antibody Titre (COVAT) study were published in pre-print server MedRxiv on June 4. The study found antibody levels differed mainly in those who didn’t have Covid-19 in the past and not so much in those who have got the infection. “In individuals who have had Covid infection, both vaccines are equally good and could produce high antibodies even after a single shot. For for those who haven’t got Covid, Covishield could provide an edge, but we need to study more,” he said. Dr Singh said since the gap between Covishield and Covaxin recipients was huge, they also studied the difference in immune response through smaller subgroups. One group had people with a history of Covid-19 infection, while the second comprised those who had never had Covid and the third cohort comprised 56 people each of the same age, gender and body weight. “In all these groups too, Covishield had produced higher antibodies than Covaxin,” he said. Breakthrough infections (coronavirus infection more than two weeks after second dose) were reported in 4.9% following both vaccine doses. The paper stated a majority had mild to moderate infections. Individuals from both groups didn’t suffer severe adverse events post vaccination, though follow-ups would continue for six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-high-immune-response-in-95-health-workers-who-took-the-jab/articleshow/83292425.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Goa||Goa: Young professionals offer free tuition to poor, rural students||PANAJI: The unrelenting pandemic has severely impacted the educational aspirations of children and youngsters. The worst hit are those from economically backward backgrounds. Realising how this can impact the future of these children, five young professionals based in Goa have joined hands to trace such kids and extend free tutoring to bring them back on track. The group plans to travel the distance to the children’s homes in rural and interior areas of Goa, once the pandemic restrictions are eased, and provide them with the required training to bridge the gap. IT professional Neil Salunkhe is even looking forward to training those from poor families who want to crack competitive exams. “We are five of us at the moment, but we are working towards adding more ‘teachers’ to our network,” said Britona-based Nadia D’Souza, who works in the recruitment sector. “We already have three children studying in Class VI, VII, VIII from one family. The parents have five sons and are struggling to keep up with their academics during the pandemic.” It was her cousin, Panaji-based Feliza Goes, who is training to be a teacher, who first brought up the idea of helping students cope with the void in education left by the pandemic. “In the midst of the pandemic, some parents have lost their jobs or income. On the other hand, the children are struggling with online classes. There are orphanages out there where children may not be able to afford the tutoring they require to cope. We are looking forward to helping such students as we spread the word around. We will go to the location once the situation improves and even provide one-on-one online tutoring wherever needed,” D’Souza said. Nadia and Goes began looking for like-minded and qualified persons online, who, like them, had some experience in tutoring children. And they connected with Salunkhe and two other friends. “As we are trying to contact needy students and qualified professionals, we are in the process of holding meetings within the tutors’ group to decide our strength of subjects. We want to help students in villages and remote areas, and those studying in government schools. They will require this assistance the most. But as these children and their parents are not on social media, the biggest challenge for us right now is to identify them,” Salunkhe said. He said that if the village is too remote, then the tutors will look at visiting or staying in the area at least for a week to help the students come on par to the minimum level for their class. “During the first lockdown the need was different. People were struggling to get hold of one square meal a day. But this time around the government is providing enhanced rations and other facilities. In the second wave, children are suffering the most in coping with their education,” MTech degree-holder Salunkhe said. D’Souza said that they are also open to assisting the students with books and other educational requirements if they are found unable to afford it. “We will help the students in whichever subjects they are lagging in and provide tutoring in all, if that is what they require,” D’Souza said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/young-professionals-offer-free-tuition-to-poor-rural-students/articleshow/83292426.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

An exclusive mobile app, ‘I-VACCINE’ unveiled by UFERWAS, is available for booking slots by the 18 plus and 45 plus aged residents. Principal secretary, Industries & Commerce and IT, Jayesh Ranjan, launched it through a virtual meet on Sunday. With this, Telangana has become the first state to get this facility, which was initiated by UFERWAS, an apex body of RWAs, registered with nearly 4,300 residential societies. Over 1.5 lakh people residing in over 3,000 apartments and gated communities can avail vaccination facility, through this newly introduced app. City-based IT professionals including DSN Murthy, CEO of Dhanush Info Tech Pvt Limited and Uday Shankar Payyeti, associate vice president, Cambay Consulting Services, developed this mobile application for the RWAs. Speaking on the occasion, IT principal secretary, Jayesh Ranjan, said, “This new mobile app is a user-friendly app and UFERWAS stands as a role model in the country.” Telangana will overcome shortage of vaccines by July. Bharat Biotech has agreed to provide four lakh vaccine doses to us. Importing Sputnik vaccine is also being planned and a clarity on these doses will be known in the next month,” he said. The Telangana government has tied up with private hospitals in the city, and instructed to organise vaccination camps in different areas rather than in one place. The state health department has chalked out the massive vaccination drive to ensure every person gets vaccinated. For this, many function halls and auditoriums like Hari Hara Kala Bhavan are being booked, said Ranjan. The GMR employees working in RGI airport will also be vaccinated on the lines of super spreaders soon, added the IT official. UFERWAS president, Rao VBJ Chelikani explained the objective of the app while general secretary B T Srinivasan briefed about measures to be taken to ensure vaccine drive through RWAs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rwas-launch-mobile-app-to-simplify-booking-vax-slots/articleshow/83292423.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Hyderabad||Telangana doing well in poverty alleviation||HYDERABAD: The recently-released data on states and their rankings based on their performance in reaching sustainable development goals (SDG) seems to have missed Telangana’s data on percentage of population living below the poverty line (BPL). The first SDG of ending poverty by 2030 had set the target of reducing the number of BPL people to 10.96 per cent but the report mentioned the state’s data as ‘null’. Experts pointed out that the state had actually progressed well in reaching its target. Interestingly, Telangana is the only state in whose case this data is mentioned as null. The government has taken note of this and sources within the government said that while Centre had applied the Tendulkar Committee’s figures on poverty as baseline to talk about the numbers, it did not apply the same to Telangana. Telangana achieved 69 marks under this SDG — even without BPL sub-parameter. According to Tendulkar Committee estimates, 21.92 per cent of the population was living below the poverty line in 2011-12. The target is to reduce the percentage of of poverty by half. Six states and seven UTs have already achieved the target of reducing poverty rates to below 10.96 per cent. Among states, Goa and Andaman and Nicobar among UTs, have the lowest poverty rates at 5.09 per cent and 1 per cent respectively. Though Tendulakar committee findings are taken as baseline, there were other reports on people under below poverty line in between. “Even the NSS date shed light on people in poverty but that was not taken into consideration” an expert said. Experts said that though the state’s data was not captured by Niti Aayog, other growth indicators indicate Telangana has reduced poverty to the desired level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-doing-well-in-poverty-alleviation/articleshow/83292450.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The woman has, in a complaint lodged at VP Road police station, stated that the 31-year-old junior officer had sexually assaulted her at various hotels and on a warship. She has also alleged that he borrowed Rs 2.21 lakh from her, but failed to return the amount. A case of rape and cheating has been filed against the officer at VP Road police station, and naval authorities in Delhi, where the accused is currently posted, have been intimated. Sources said that a police team from the city has left for Delhi, but the officer has not been reporting to work, which has fuelled suspicion that he has gone absconding. The police informed that the woman had met the junior naval officer in 2016 through a social media platform after which their friendship grew with time. The woman has alleged that the officer had accompanied her to hotels in Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur and a warship in Mumbai where they got intimate. A police official said that the woman has claimed that she learnt only recently that the naval officer has tied the knot with another woman.

---||Goa||Goa among least improving states in school education, says Centre||PANAJI: A nationwide assessment of schools by the Union education ministry has said that Goa is among states and UTs to have shown the least improvement over the previous year, and that at least 19 states are ahead of it in the performance grading index (PGI) developed by the ministry. Of a total of 1,000 points, Goa’s scores fell in the 751-800 bracket, along with Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Manipur, Sikkim and Telangana. The states were assessed on 70 parameters for the quality of its school education across the government and aided sectors. Goa attained a ‘Grade II’ rank. Goa was found among the lowest-ranked states and UTs when assessed in the domains of ‘learning outcomes and quality’ and ‘governance processes’, while it was in the top ten when it came to ‘infrastructure and facilities’ and ‘access’. The education ministry’s assessment states that it is understandable that states and UTs, which already had high PGI scores, had little scope to outperform themselves in 2019-20. However, the ministry expressed concerns over states like Goa, which fell in the middle grades, but could have done better over the previous year. “One point of concern however remains that there are a group of States and UTs in the middle range (between 600 to 800) whose PGI score has improved less than 40 points in one year from 2018-19 to 2019-20,” the assessment states. Among these middle range states, Goa’s performance improved the least, gaining only one point over its score of 782 in 2018-19. In comparison, Telangana in the same bracket had gained 15 points. To arrive at the PGI for 2019-20, the ministry has sourced data from various central databases on school education like the national achievement surveys, midday meal assessments, etc. Schools were judged on parameters like students’ performance, infrastructural facilities, and shift of governance processes from the manual to the digital mode, among others. In the domain of ‘governance processes’, Goa was among 24 states and UTs which scored less than 288, and the ministry has said this is a major area where they must focus. As an incentive for states and UTs to improve their performance, the ministry plans to link the PGI with aid in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-school-edu-goa-among-leastimproving-states-says-centre/articleshow/83292458.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

That is not possible. People will have to continue taking precautions even though cases will come down further,” said the official. The official further stressed that there are a lot of people who are under the misconception that since Covid-19 cases are on the decline, vaccines are not important. “Vaccination is important, therefore, take the vaccine,” urged the official at the inaugural of the mass Covid-19 vaccination drive held at Hitex on Sunday. Meanwhile, the state has planned to vaccinate the entire population by the month of August or September. “We will vaccinate the entire 2.75 crore population in the time-frame, with 5.4 lakh doses.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Many schools offering insurance covering fees to those taking loans||HYDERABAD: Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, several schools in the city have started offering insurance covering school fees to those taking loans from the academic year 2021-22. Most of them are said to be offering insurance when parents are opting to pay the fee through third-party firms. Parents said that instead of offering insurance to only those taking loans, the facility should be offered to everyone. “If the intention is to provide insurance for the benefit of students, why not extend it to everyone? What’s the logic behind providing it to those who are taking loans to pay school fee? It is just a way to protect the school from defaulters,” said Ashish Naredi, whose daughter is studying in class 8 in an international school in the city. He said that schools should provide insurance to everyone. “It should be fine even if they collect a nominal amount for the insurance and cover school fee of students for certain years in case of any untoward incident.” Another parent, whose child is studying in class 6 at a school in Begumpet, said “While there was no charge for insurance last year, I have noticed that along with April’s fee, the school has also added books fee and insurance this year.” During the pandemic, several schools in the city and elsewhere in the country tied up with fintech companies to provide loans to parents. If parents opted to pay fees through these firms, they were given an option to pay the fee on a monthly basis instead of paying term fees. Along with the loan, insurance and rewards are also provided to parents. In the academic year 2020-21, as many as 3.8 lakh parents, mostly of schoolgoing children, have taken loans, which are provided at zero or low-interest rates. During the current academic year, even more number of parents are said to be opting for these loans. Meanwhile, some schools are said to be providing accident insurance to students, especially boarders. “We provide accident insurance to boarders, but don’t charge any amount from parents. This insurance covers any accident, like a student getting injured on the playground, etc, but not general health,” said S Narasimha Reddy, principal, Hyderabad Public School, Ramanthapur, adding that they don’t provide any insurance for school fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/many-schools-offering-insurance-covering-fees-to-those-taking-loans/articleshow/83291287.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Goa||Goa: Vinay Tendulkar eyes state polls, may quit as MP||PANAJI: Goa’s lone BJP Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar on Sunday said that he wants to contest the next assembly elections and offered to resign as member of parliament to do so. “I have told the party that I am interested in contesting the next assembly elections (likely to be held in early 2022). If the party confirms my ticket, then I am ready to resign as Rajya Sabha MP. I don’t want to continue in active electoral politics after five years,” the former BJP president, who completes 41 years in BJP, told TOI. The two-time Sanvordem MLA — 1999 and 2002 — said that he wants to return to state politics because he has not been able to do much for the people of the state being a MP. “We have always been with karyakartas and being an MP, one has to spend most of the time in Delhi,” Tendulkar said. He had contested from Sanvordem constituency in 2007 too, but lost to independent candidate, mine owner Anil Salgaocar. He was elected to the upper house of the parliament in 2017 and with it became Goa’s first BJP Rajya Sabha MP. Under former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, Tendulkar was forest minister. He has also been parliamentary secretary. In 2012, he was made party president, which post he held till 2019. While offering to resign as MP to contest the assembly polls, Tendulkar said that while it was not necessary to do so “if the party wants me to resign then I am ready to do so”. The Rajya Sabha MP said that he has “not zeroed in on any constituency” and that he is ready to contest from any constituency as per the party’s decision. However, sources said that he is eying Sanvordem. For the past couple of months, Tendulkar has become active in the Sanvordem constituency. Presently, the constituency is represented by PWD minister and BJP MLA Deepak Pauskar. Elected on MGP ticket for the 2017 assembly election, Pauskar joined BJP to become a minister when the party wanted to shore up its numbers in the assembly. When asked whether he wants to contest from Sanvordem constituency, Tendulkar said that right now the party has an MLA there and that he will abide by the party’s decision. However, the Rajya Sabha MP said that he will start an office in Sanvordem constituency soon on behalf of the trust he has established in his parents’ name to help the people. “I had an office in Sanvordem constituency and I am reopening it,” the MP said, adding that he will open an office in Ponda also to work for the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tendulkar-eyes-state-polls-may-quit-as-mp/articleshow/83292489.cms||Murari Shetye

Consultant physician Dr Nitin Wadaskar said ‘long Covid’ is post-recovery health issues of corona patients, which comes with multiple symptoms but investigations don’t reveal much about presence of any trigger. So, diagnosis and treatment become the most challenging part. “Strangely, there is breathlessness but oxygen saturation is normal. It seems to be affecting Covid recovered patients who are co-morbid, and also occurs among those whose immunity is substantially affected,” said Wadaskar, adding the period between four to 12 weeks after recovery are the most vulnerable. Wadaskar also said life-style modifications, like exercising, are important to keep organs healthy and immunity stronger. Infectious disease specialist Nitin Shinde, attached to Alexis Multispecialty Hospital, attributed the long Covid symptoms to the body’s immune response to delayed inflammation, which may come in multiple phases like bi or tri-phasic. “The patients of long Covid suffer from repeated fevers. They are also generally detected with lung and urine infections,” said Shinde. “These patients present with complex symptoms having persistent inflammation, but nothing comes out in tests. The common symptoms in them include body aches, lethargy and sleeplessness along with anxiety,” said Shinde, adding even long Covid is taking a toll and has serious consequences, including heart attacks, paralysis and death too. Another infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Choudhary (Tayade) said there are a variety of presentations of long Covid, which may come with a plethora of infections, inflammatory syndromes, fungal diseases, different types of viral reactivations and viral related rashes among variety of other complications and symptoms. “Covid is a multi-organ disease and it’s after effects are still being seen in studies and research. The reactivation and inflammation in post-Covid complications is still being analyzed,” she said. “Sometimes, Covid recovered patients turn up with fever. Even after conducting various examinations, we fail to find reason behind the fever and classify it as a post-Covid phenomenon. Such fever is really mysterious,” said Dr Tayade, adding that she either tries to find through investigations whether the symptoms fit into any category of infection or inflammation, or treat them as per symptoms. “We have also seen patients developing neurosis and hallucinations,” she said. Dr BK Murali of Hope Hospital said Covid-recovered patients repeatedly get hospitalized, sometimes even for prolonged period. “Even as the second wave is gradually waning, we still have patients who returned with multiple symptoms after recovering. There are no formal guidelines to diagnose or treat these symptoms, which manifest with wide range of presentations. We have also observed that in long Covid there are gastro-intestinal issues, skin and hair problems too along with kidney failures and diabetes,” said Dr Murali. Dr Mohan Nerkar, a director of Seven Star Hospital, explained long Covid is nothing but extended complications of Covid. “The prolonged effect of Covid aggravates the immune system that triggers multiple symptoms, which can continue up to two to three months. We are mostly seeing these complications in elderly patients,” said Dr Nerkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-wave-ebbs-recovered-patients-back-in-hospitals-with-long-covid-unexplained-symptoms/articleshow/83291294.cms||Soumitra Bose

Four other suspects are still on the run. The Class XII student, who went for a ride on her scooty with two school friends during Covid lockdown, was dragged from her two-wheeler, assaulted and gang-raped by six men in Bhagwanpur Dhimri village on May 31. The traumatised girl informed her parents on June 5 after being counselled by her sister. They later approached the police. An FIR was immediately registered and police teams were dispersed to hunt down the accused. While combing the cane fields near the village on Saturday night, the cops spotted two men. On being questioned, one of them opened fire and they tried to flee. The cops chased them and shot one of them in the leg. Soon, they surrendered. The name of a seventh individual, Vikas Kumar, who clicked some photographs of the sexual assault on his phone, cropped up during interrogation. Vikas was picked up by police on Sunday. A villager, who is said to have witnessed the crime, came forward to help the investigation. He is now a key witness in the case, police said, adding that all the accused are between 20 and 25 years and work as labourers. During the lockdown, they were without work and roaming in the village. They also took away all the money from the girl. When contacted, Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, “We have arrested Vishal Patel (22) and Anuj Patel (23). Vishal was leading the gang. He was shot in his right leg and has been admitted to a hospital. The name of another person, identified as one Vikas, has also come up. Vikas was at the crime scene. He took photographs of the girl and may have called others to rape her. The remaining four will be nabbed soon." “We have collected enough evidence and will submit a chargesheet before the court. We are also ensuring the girl and her parents get proper counselling to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder," the SSP said. According to Sajwan, the girl is entitled for compensation under the SC/ST (prevention of atrocities) Act, as per the guidelines.

Rishika Kumar, a Class IX student of a south Mumbai school, raised a sum of Rs 70,000 from her friends and neighbours, and purchased two oxygen cylinders for the Shahid Khudi Ram Bose Central Jail in Muzaffarpur. The prison houses over 3,000 inmates. “Prisoners are the most vulnerable section of the society and they are dependent on the authorities for their safety and wellbeing,” the superintendent of the prison wrote. The prison required oxygen concentrators to handle any medical situation that could arise if oxygen cylinders were not supplied on time. “The two oxygen concentrators, having a capacity of five litres each, were received by the jail on May 9. They were immediately deployed for treating prisoners as well as staff. This has reduced the loan on the prison hospital and dependency on oxygen cylinders.

According to official data, Kutch district received 282% above normal rainfall last year but the villages on the Indo-Pak border are still crying for life’s nectar. Like every summer, the women of these villages are forced to daily undertake more than five kms walk under the to fetch water. The cattle breeders too, as every year, have migrated to other places in search of water. The Paccham Khavda region has 40 villages coming under 17 group gram panchayats. Rashid Sama from Mot Dinara village and a member of Kutch district panchayat, said all these villages are facing acute water shortage. “Around 30% cattle breeders have migrated with their livestock to Lakhpat and Abdasa in search of water. Senior government officials make promises that they will provide us water by tankers and that we will get Narmada water, but we have got nothing so far,” Sama added. The administration hasn’t drilled bore wells so most of the population here is forced to consume dirty water from ‘virda’ (dug wells). The traditional ‘virdas’ have been, over the years, quenching the thirst of these villages located in the arid landscape. Jumma Sama, a leader of Ratadiya group panchayat, blamed the government officials. “Everyday, I receive many calls from people complaining about water shortage but I don’t have an answer. I don’t get a proper reply from the district administration when I approach them. There are private wells in some villages who are selling tanker water and people have no choice but to buy it,” Sama said. There are many villages which are connected with water pipelines. But the tanks at these villages get water once every two or three months. “We don’t get water tankers easily, we get one tanker after 28 days and they charge Rs 500. We don’t have water for our livestock and we have to go to three to five kms to fetch water,” Hanif Sama, a resident of Mota Bandha village, said. District development officer of Kutch, Bhavya Varma, said the government is working to ease the problems faced by the villagers. “The water supply department is handling the issue of drinking water and we are working on the pond deepening project under MNREGA in this area. We are also planning to create a water recharge structure in government buildings,” Varma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rain-bounty-but-kutch-villages-thirsty/articleshow/83289940.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

They told them about labour shortage in the factories. United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association former president Inderjit Singh Navyug said: "More than a year of fighting coronavirus pandemic and losing human lives has made it difficult for businesses to recover to the older levels. At start of this year, we had a bit of a revival but the second wave washed away its gains. What is worse, our sales crashed fully, while the input cost increased manifold." Navyug claimed that the recent increases in the wages and fuel cost had disturbed the industry, leaving it no option but to ask the government for help. He hoped that the PLIDB and PSIDC chairmen will convey the manufacturers’ concerns to the government." PLIDB chief Pawan Dewan said: "The Centre’s anarchic decisions of increasing the cost of petrol and diesel and imposing a complex GST system increased the formalities of running day-to-day businesses. The Punjab government led by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh will support the industry. The CM and the industry minister will find a solution." PSIDC chief K K Bawa said: "Trade and industry are in a very bad phase, so they need support from both the state and the Centre to survive.

---||Nashik||Nashik: 78% drop in daily new Covid cases in June||NASHIK: The city has reported a significant drop of 78% in daily new cases in the first five days of June when compared to the number of daily cases reported in May. The city had recorded an average of 2,615 new cases per day in April, but due to preventive measures taken by the administration the cases started declining in the second half of May. The city had recorded an average of 985 new cases per day in the month of May. Now, in the first five days of June, the city has recorded an average of 207 cases per day. An NMC official said preventive measures and severe 12-day restriction by the district authorities have overall led to the drop in new cases of Covid-19 in the city. “People should not lower their guards even though new cases of Covid-19 have reduced and more relaxation have been given by the authorities from Monday. We appeal to the people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour to prevent the spread of the pandemic,” he said. During the first wave of the pandemic in September last year, the city had reported over 26,000 cases with 6,000 active patients at any given point. “But the second wave was three times stronger than the first wave. The city registered over 71,000 cases in the month of April alone with a total 28,000 active patients at any given point. The positivity rate had also increased to 40% in April,” the official said. “Since May 24, the scenario has changed for good. The number of active patients have reduced to around 3,042 cases and the positivity rate has also reduced to around 4%,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-78-drop-in-daily-new-cases-in-june/articleshow/83285577.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Gangs square off 6 times in 3 days, 9 held||LUDHIANA: Six back-to-back gang wars in three days at three points have forced police to book dozens of accused and arrest nine, including three minors. Those arrested are from the rival gangs of Shubham Arora and Puneet Bains. An elusive Vishal Gill, wanted for dacoity and attempt to murder, is again found involved. Two of the five latest FIRs (first-information reports) against 15 people include Gill’s name. On May 15, his band had tried to kill Karan Kalia of the rival gang. On August 14, 2020, Gill and his men were charged with looting a gambling den of Rs 14.5 lakh. The series of clashes started on June 3 around 9.30pm, when the henchmen of jailed gangsters Shubham Arora and Puneet Bains came face to face at a wedding in Division Number 3. An hour later, they created a ruckus at Hargobind Nagar, where they vandalised the parked vehicles of residents. To avenge for that night, the Shubham gang fired upon Puneet Bains’ cousin Major Sandhu in Moti Nagar but he escaped unhurt. So, on the night of June 4, the Puneet Bains gang thrashed Shubham’s friend Rajveer Singh brutally. An hour later, the Shubham gang got even with Akash Soni of the Bains group. Additional deputy commissioner of police-I Pragya Jain said: "I got a call from Hargobind Nagar that cars were being vandalised and a second clash had broken out between the gangs, so I gathered all the SHOs (station house officers) of zone 1." She said: "Meanwhile, the residents also started protesting over their loss and some force was put there to pacify them, while the others teams scanned the CCTVs, visiting the scenes of crime, and raided the possible hideouts of these gangs. On June 4, all cops were on duty from midnight till 5am, and they rounded up 20 suspects, of which nine we, later, arrested." The ADCP said a manhunt for the other accused was on. She said: "They will either be behind the bars or forced to leave the area."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ldh-gangs-square-off-6-times-in-3-days-9-held/articleshow/83289979.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Surat||Bride cons businessman of Rs 2 lakh within hours of marriage in Surat||SURAT: He waited for years to find a suitable bride. But when he found one in Surat, this young businessman’s married life lasted for only a few hours. The woman turned out to be a fraudster who conned him of Rs two lakh. Ankit Jain, a 38-year-old businessman from Chikmagalur in Karnataka, recently found a bride named Swati Bhatt through a middleman named Satish Patel in Surat. Patel had sent Bhatt’s photo through WhatsApp to Jain and he immediately agreed for marriage. Patel told Jain that he will have to pay Rs 1.7 lakh to Bhatt’s brother Hitesh Trivedi and his commission of Rs 20,000. When Jain and his mother came to Surat on June 4, he gave Rs 1.5 lakh to Trivedi and Rs 15,000 to Patel. Jain’s mother gave Bhatt a gold ring worth Rs 20,000, silver anklets worth Rs 1,400 and a saree. Later, they went to a temple on the bank of Tapi River near Kapodra and got married in a simple ceremony. After the ritual, when Jain, his mother and Bhatt were going to his uncle’s home at Parvat Patiya, Bhatt asked him to stop the car near Rachana Circle in Kapodra under the pretext of going to the washroom and having snacks. Bhatt went into the washroom but did not come out for a long time. Jain and his mother searched for her, but they could not find her, so he called Trivedi. However, Jain’s calls were not answered so he called Patel. Patel and his wife reached there and told Jain to search for Bhatt there and they would look for Trivedi at his home. But, later, when Patel’s phone was also switched off, Jain realized that he was conned. He lodged a complaint of cheating at Varachha police station on Saturday night. “We are close to arresting one man who had helped them, but until the kingpin Patel is not found, it will be difficult to know whether the gang has conned others or not,” said sub-inspector J S Mahida.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bride-cons-bizman-of-rs-2l-within-hours-of-marriage/articleshow/83290017.cms||---

A car, a hooter, a red-blue light, a khaki turban, tan colour shoes, a police badge and a mask with police logo, besides Rs 50,000 of extorted money were recovered from four of its members. Police said the accused used to target labourers and vendors and extorted money by threatening to lodge an FIR against them. The arrested have been identified as Manpreet Singh, 25, of New Shimlapuri who own a mobile store; Santosh Kumar, 27, of Daba; Rakesh Kumar, 26, of Loharsa; and Ajay Tiwari, 25, of Daba, all three are labourers. The Daba police arrested them on Saturday evening from 33 Feet Road on a tip-off. Joint commissioner of police (rural) Sachin Gupta said, “Manpreet is the kingpin, who used to pose as a cop. He would wear a khaki turban, tan colour shoes and a mask with Punjab Police logo. He owns a car and on it he had installed a red-blue light and a hooter. The accused would roam around in different localities of Daba, especially during lockdown.”On finding a vendor or a shopkeeper working during lockdown, they would threaten to lodge an FIR and extort money. At times, they would take fruits, vegetables and meat, among others, from the vendors and distribute among themselves.” “The accused would claim to be from CIA or Daba police station. They would take money from those without a mask after threatening to challan them. Manpreet owns a mobile store and Santosh, Rakesh and Ajay were his customers. Manpreet made the plan to extort money and lured the trio into it. They would distribute among themselves the money, too,” he added. They are being questioned to know from where they got the police badge and other stuff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/extortionists-posing-as-cops-held/articleshow/83289972.cms||---

On Sunday, the mobile app, ‘I-VACCINE’ was unveiled by the UFERWAS and over 30 RWAs have downloaded it on Day 1. Access of the download application is given to the presidents and vice-presidents/secretaries of RWAs concerned and through them, the occupants/flat owners of apartments and gated communities can register their vaccination details. “Initially, this access is given to know the exact number of people registering for vaccination, so that the vaccination camps will be organised,based on the number of registrations (number of registrations must be 100 and above), at their area, with the private hospitals who have tied up with UFERWAS,” B T Srinivasan, general secretary, UFERWAS, told TOI. The software team will update the mobile application as per requirement, and RWAs can be alerted, he said. Meanwhile, after the application was launched, residents of 474 flats of a gated community in Serilingampally gave their consent to use the app for the vaccine. “A total of 600 doses, including Covishield and Covaxin, will be given to residents of the gated community,” according to UFERWAS member, and president of Green Grace Residents Society, RSV Badrinath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/30-rwas-download-uferwas-vaccine-app-on-day-of-launch/articleshow/83292568.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Central Railway proposes Kolhapur-Gondia Maharashtra Express extension to Rewa in Madhya Pradesh||Nagpur: The Central Railway has proposed to extend 1103/11040 Gondia-Kolhapur-Gondia Maharashtra Express to Rewa in Madhya Pradesh by merging newly introduced Itwari-Rewa Express operated by the West Central Railway (WCR). Rewa is 480km from Gondia. The Maharashtra Express is already a slow train (48km/hour). If extended up to Rewa, the train will traverse a distance of 1,816km. At current speed, the travel between Kolhapur-Rewa will take over 38 hours — Kolhapur-Pune (7.30 hrs), Pune-Nagpur (17.45 hrs), Nagpur-Gondia (2.30 hrs) & Gondia-Rewa (10.30 hrs). Central Railway chief public relations officer (CPRO) Shivaji Sutar said, “The proposal is at an initial level and no authority has approved the plan. It is too early to comment on the issue.” As the train belongs to the Central Railway, on June 4, 2021, the chief passenger transportation manager (CPTM) wrote to officials in both the divisions about the proposal. The letter speaks about discontinuing newly launched tri-weekly 01753/01754 Itwari-Rewa Express. Itwari-Rewa train was flagged off by railway minister Piyush Gopal on February 21, 2021. Former ZRUCC member Pravin Dabli said, “Earlier, several express trains like Maharashtra, Vidarbha, Deekshabhoomi, Gondwana, Jabalpur have been hijacked from Nagpur. While trains from the city are extended to other cities, no trains from other towns are extended to Nagpur despite all requisite infrastructure.” Dabli demanded 12070 Gondia-Raigarh Express should also be extended till Nagpur and from Raigarh till Bhubaneshwar-Puri so that people from Nagpur get a direct train to Odissa. However, Central Railway feels currently the Maharashtra Express runs with four rakes. The train is primarily maintained at Kolhapur. The merging of Itwari-Rewa train will have daily train between Nagpur-Rewa as additional rakes will be available, as per Central Railway. Another advantage Central Railway officials feel is that lie-over of 12 hours of the Maharashtra Express rake at Gondia and its maintenance at Kolhapur will be eliminated. Besides, people from MP will get a train service to Pune. The officials feel that Railway Board will also save Rs100 crore from two rakes and one locomotive costing Rs20 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/c-rly-proposes-kolhapur-gondia-maha-exp-extension-to-rewa-in-mp/articleshow/83291358.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Villagers told TOI that the wires become dangerous especially during rains, as chances of electrocution increases. “We often report loose wires to authorities but instead of helping, they ask us to contact linemen, saying they cannot visit an area unless instructed by a senior,” said a villager who did not wish to be named. Arun Gour from Thatyur village in Tehri district said, “There are over 60 families living in the village and we have informed officials about several spots where live wires are found dangling. So far, not much has been done by the power department to address this issue.” When contacted, Amit Tomar, sub divisional officer of the power department, said, “The incident in Almas is unfortunate but we continue maintenance works throughout the year. Our teams undertake surveys on their own, identifying spots where the wires are loose or pose any threat. We regularly get complaints from residents and rectify those.” Officials from the Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited meanwhile told TOI that “arrangements are being made to check and rectify the issue of dangling wires across the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dangling-power-lines-a-huge-threat-in-cities-as-well-as-villages/articleshow/83290021.cms||Abhijeet Singh

A local outfit’s member also alleged that most of the beneficiaries had either sold the houses or have given them on rent. Following a written complaint by Kranti Sena, city magistrate of Muzaffarnagar Abhishek Singh has initiated the probe into allegations. Flats under the Kanshiram urban poor housing scheme were allotted to thousands of beneficiaries across the state. Singh said, “I have ordered an investigation. The officer will submit a report into the matter soon. Once the investigation is over, action will be taken accordingly.” The outfit’s members alleged that out of about 600 houses built in Kashiram colony, more than 100 flats have illegally been sold or rented out to other people. Its city president Lokesh Saini said, “Due to rigging in the allotment of flats, many flats were awarded to ineligible people. Those beneficiaries already had a house of their own.” One of the owners of a house in Kanshiram colony in Muzaffarnagar, who did not wish to be named, said, “I was given a flat under urban poor housing scheme in 2010. Currently, I am living with my parents in the city. I have rented out the house to my friend.” He also claimed there are many others who, despite having a house of their own, were allowed a house in the colony under the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/administration-in-muzaffarnagar-launches-probe-in-irregularities-in-housing-scheme/articleshow/83290051.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Last Wednesday, the NCB nabbed a 19-year-old youth named Sohail Shaikh and recovered 55 grams of mephedrone at Veera Desai Road in Andheri. During the probe it was found that he used to work for a 21-year-old youth called Feroz Maula Shaikh, who is into drug peddling. Similarly on March 24, a 19-year-old college student was nabbed with drugs and cash while last month, the NCB arrested 20-year-old Ayan Shaikh from Bandra and seized drugs and cash worth Rs 2.5 lakh. On April 13, the NCB arrested a 25-year-old aspiring candidate appearing for the MPSC exams along with a third-year college student with 310 grams of marijuana worth Rs 25 lakh and cash amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh in Parel. During the investigation it transpired that these youngsters were using darknet to procure drugs and crypto currency and online payment platforms to make online payments. “The drug mafia is now using more youngsters in the business. Most of these teenagers caught are a fit case for rehabilitation, but due to the seizure of commercial quantity we are booking them under the stringent act of NDPS,” said Sameer Wankhede, zonal director of NCB. Meanwhile, the ANC has arrested nine women drug peddlers in the past three months. Last week, a 50-year-old woman, Sarraswati Naidu, possessing 1.27 grams of heroin worth Rs 3.8 crore was arrested. Three days prior to this, the agency nabbed Alster Mattuswamy Naidu (38), a housewife from Worli with 115 grams of heroin worth Rs 35 lakh.“The drug mafia is using new faces, particularly housewives from middle-class families to evade coming under the radar of the police,” said Datta Nalawade, DCP, ANC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-teens-housewives-drafted-in-to-supply-drugs-to-deflect-cops/articleshow/83292629.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana district meets 31% of vaccination target||LUDHIANA: Even as vaccination is considered important to avoid third Covid wave, Ludhiana has achieved a daily average of just 31% of the target till June 3. As per a report of June 3 evening—with data of vaccination from April 20 to May 31—Ludhiana’s average daily vaccination target in the period was 28,122, but its achievement was 8,841. Therefore, the district daily met 31% of the target. The report shows that in Punjab, SAS Nagar has the highest percentage of daily achievement of vaccination target between April 20 and May 31 at 80%, Pathankot is second (34%) and Ludhiana third. Sangrur has the lowest percentage at 14. Compared with the data of April 20 to May 18, when the daily achievement of vaccination target of Ludhiana was 33%, the recent rate is 2% less. The percentage was 31% between April 20 and May 12 and 39% between April 20 and April 30. The health department officials say they don’t have vaccines for 18-plus age group, which may have resulted in less vaccination. Civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia says, “Though vaccination for 45-plus is going on, we don’t have vaccines for 18 to 44 years old age group in government set-up. However, their vaccination is going on in private facilities. Whenever we get vaccines for 18-plus in government setup, we will inoculate them.” A health department official says, “The state health department had set a high target for Ludhiana, as it is the biggest district of Punjab. People were not forthcoming initially. Now when they are coming, there is shortage of vaccine, especially for 18-plus in government hospitals.”  “Vaccination is important to prevent the probable third wave. However, its less rate is a cause of concern. The government should make necessary arrangements for providing required vaccine stock so that more and more people are immunized.

The SCERT has realized that the online mode of teaching will continue even in the future and for this, the council has decided to impart training in a planned way. The first batch is going to comprise 100 teachers and will start from the 9th of this month. SCERT director Seema Jaunsari said, “Teachers had to suddenly shift to online mode of teaching which was a major challenge for them. Over time, they got used to various apps used for online teaching. However, in places where the connectivity is poor, the teachers had to visit the homes of the children.” She added, “We have developed a specialised training program for the teachers as in the coming future, online classes will play a major role in the education sector.” Meanwhile, in a shot in the arm for the state, the Niti Aayog’s SDG index report has put Uttarakhand at the third spot among all the states in the country in their respective Gross Enrollment Ratio in higher education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/scert-to-train-teachers-for-online-teaching-from-june-9/articleshow/83290075.cms||Mohammad Anab

As part of this, NMC plans to increase the number of beds with oxygen at its Bytco hospital. During the first wave of Covid last year, the NMC administration had converted its two civic hospitals into Covid hospitals. The experts have projected the third wave of Covid probably in September or October 2021. During the second wave, oxygen beds in civic and private hospitals were occupied and there was a shortage of oxygen beds in the city. “We have a plan to convert maximum beds in Bytco hospitals into oxygen beds. Currently, 305 of the 760 beds in Bytco hospital are oxygen beds. Now, we will increase the number of oxygen beds to 700,” said Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of NMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/plans-to-increase-o2-beds-in-hosp/articleshow/83285609.cms||Tushar Pawar

Accordingly, the government is planning to update them by taking up with the banks concerned and deposit the amount” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-to-deposit-ryhtu-bandhu-amt-by-june-25/articleshow/83292295.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Eatala Rajender to contest Huzurabad poll; will resign soon||HYDERABAD: Former minister Eatala Rajender is most likely to contest the bypoll to Huzurabad Assembly constituency and not one of his family members. Even the BJP top brass has insisted that Eatala should enter the electoral fray seeking re-election and give a strong reply to the ruling TRS by retaining the seat.  Though the TRS leadership has been working day and night to wean away supporters from his camp and openly support the ruling party, the second and third rung leadership and cadre have vowed allegiance to Eatala in the constituency. Sources in the former minister’s camp said that though Eatala had asked for a union ministry and a Rajya Sabha seat, the saffron party did not promise Eatala any of the two. He was told to contest and win the election after which he would be rewarded suitably, and that the BJP and its frontal organisations would go all out to ensure his victory. Eatala is expected to submit his resignation to the Speaker on Monday or Tuesday. With Eatala to enter the electoral fray on BJP ticket, for the first time after the formation of Telangana state Huzurabad Assembly constituency is likely to witness a close triangular contest, which otherwise saw a straight battle between the TRS and Congress and Eatala winning the seat with huge majority in 2018 and 2014 Assembly polls. While the Congress is banking on a major vote split of TRS as Eatala would be cutting into the ruling party vote bank, to win the seat, the BJP is banking on the strong network developed over the years by the former minister in his constituency to work wonders for him in the by-poll. The saffron party will rope in its star campaigners from the national level depending upon the prospects of the party as the polling day nears. A senior leader in the TRS said the name of B Vinod Kumar, former MP from Karimnagar and presently the vice-chairman of State Planning Board is among serious consideration with the TRS leadership to be fielded to take on a formidable Eatala in his own constituency. While the AICC high command will take a final decision on the candidature, P Kaushik Reddy of the Congress, who lost to Eatala in 2018-Assembly polls has already covered nearly 30 villages as part of his campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rajender-to-contest-huzurabad-himself/articleshow/83292269.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Hyderabad||No scientific design at Polavaram dump site, lacks retaining wall: NGT panel||Hyderabad: A six-member National Green Tribunal (NGT) committee on environmental impact of soil muck dumping at Polavaram Irrigation Project said the dump site at Mulalanka village has no scientific design and lacks a retaining wall to prevent silt from the dump site slipping into the nearby rivulet. The NGT committee, led by retired high court judge Justice B Seshasayana Reddy, in its report said that as per the data provided by the Polavaram Project Authority (PPA), 14.6 lakh cubic metres of rock muck and 546 lakh cubic metres of soil muck will remain in the dump yard once the project is completed. The committee visited Mulalanka, other dump sites and a stone crusher unit. Out of 204 acres acquired for disposal of muck at Mulalanka, 173 acres was utilised for dumping while the remaining 31 acres is yet to be used. However, the dumping site did not cause any displacement of families as reported by the revenue divisional officer of Jangareddygudem, it said. The PPA made a requisition for an additional land of 83.45 cents for expansion of the dump yard and the government passed an award in 2018. “The field verification had revealed that the land owners are still in occupation of the land covered under the award. Dumping of muck generated from the project site is going on at Mulalanka. But, no retaining wall was constructed to prevent silt falling into Kadiamma Vagu. No measures were taken to prevent dust storms during dumping and unloading of the muck,” the committee said. The ground water quality was well within the permissible limits of Bureau of Indian Standards, the committee said. The petitioner was more concerned with the land acquired in Mulalanka for setting up the additional dump yard and added, “His main grievance appears to be non-payment of compensation.” The Central Soil and Material Research Station (CSMRS) said the dump contained only native soil. Similarly, a heavy metal analysis carried out by CSIR-NEERI had shown that heavy metals such as arsenic, boron, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, mercury, manganese, nickel, lead and zinc were below response levels, the CSMRS said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-scientific-design-at-polavaram-dump-site-lacks-retaining-wall-ngt-panel/articleshow/83292323.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Mumbai||Queue for meal lengthens: Jobless and elderly wait for a handout||It was one of those days when Kunal Tewari woke up in his one-room tenement at Sion Koliwada and found he had no work. The lockdown has reduced him from a cable TV technician to a handyman on daily wages. His monthly income has dwindled from Rs 15,000 to about one-third. The ‘kholi’ he shares with three others costs Rs 1,000 in rent every month. He picks recyclable waste, cleans toilets, sweeps the parks, doing anything that will take care of meals and incidental expenses. But today the 36-year-old migrant has to cover the 2-km distance from Koliwada to Aurora Theatre on foot and wait for the food truck to arrive. The cherry red BEST mini bus comes to a halt in the parking space opposite the defunct cinema hall at high noon. A couple of young men dressed to look like office staff step out and ask the stragglers to form a line. Someone inside begins handing out the ‘puri bhaaji’ packets. Women are allowed an extra pack or two for their children. Kunal asks for an additional one, but is denied. He walks away, softly growling about the unfairness of it. “Aap dekhna, kranti aane wale hi (You watch, there is a revolution coming,” he says, when asked if the portion was inadequate. “How can government refuse someone a little extra food? Isn’t this the public’s money paying for it? This is no way to treat people.” His elder brother’s recent death in Nagpur and his inability to meet the family has deepened the mood of alienation. Kunal’s dependence on handouts coincided with the onset of the pandemic. But he is yet to reconcile to the grim reality of waiting in a queue to receive a meal. Most days he tries to keep away. “Why would I want to face this zillat (disgrace)?” he asks. The sudden and bewildering level of impoverishment experienced by Kunal is illustrative of the plight that 230 million Indians now find themselves in, having fallen below the minimum wage threshold of Rs 375 per day (State of Working India Report 2021’ by the Azim Premji University). In Mumbai alone, both BMC and NGOs have run a meal distribution program, catering to the homeless and jobless during the two lockdowns. Packets are collected from community kitchens and distributed twice a day in all 24 wards. BMC feeds 10,000-12,000 on every trip, halting at designated points on fixed routes while NGOs supplement the effort at other spots. It is usually khichdi, pulav or puri bhaaji, fodder that is considered good enough to spend an hour waiting for on the pavement. A bespectacled Shivlal Yadav is sitting under a tree outside Ruia College, reading the ‘Aaj Tak’ newspaper, waiting for his share. “The food is the way it is made for poor people. It is not going to be 5-star,” is the wry response when asked to describe its quality. A native of Gorakhpur who has spent more than 32 years in Mumbai, Yadav displays a sense of resignation about the toll wrought by the pandemic. “I came to the city in 1979. I have worked in manufacturing, in a steel unit. I have been a driver to some big sahabs. But the options are few when you are 62 years old.” Yadav’s life has been a rollercoaster all along. The initial years in Bombay were spent learning a trade. He found a stable job, met a woman at work, they married, had a daughter. One morning, it all unravelled when his wife died trying to save the child from being run over by a train. Yadav thought of going back to Gorakhpur for good. He sold a small house in Damu Nagar in Kandivli and built a pucca house for himself back in the village. “I never felt like marrying after that, but I stayed on in the city.” He knows what he will do when the lockdown is lifted. “I’m not going to come here for the food,” he says, putting the newspaper back into a cloth bag containing an umbrella and other possessions. The city can still throw up enough opportunities for an honest day’s pay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/queue-for-meal-lengthens-jobless-and-elderly-wait-for-a-handout/articleshow/83292743.cms||Sunil Nair

The load test has become necessary after a similar test in February had proved to be “inconclusive.” The Tiljala traffic guard said it expects some challenges on Monday — despite the enhanced restrictions — as several relaxations have been granted leading to a rise of private cars and two-wheelers on EM Bypass. KMDA has also initiated the process to engage agencies for doing structural condition tests and retrofitting works of Kidderpore steel bridge over Tolly Nullah and Dhana Dhanyo setu in Alipore for which the traffic police will need to come up with traffic diversion plans for KMDA to take up the work. The authorities have also started working on the proposals as submitted by the police to set up two bridges on the circular Canal and another on the EM Bypass close to Avishikta crossing. “At Ambedkar bridge, Sunday was like a trial run,” an official said. Officials said that they are expecting to complete the load test on the flank in the next few days and take up load test on the Garia-bound eastern flank from June 10 onwards and complete the work by June 14. Cops said that the PWD’s work on Red Road too is progressing as per plan. The work has been undertaken to facilitate the replacement of the existing masonry arch culvert which has been damaged. “With less traffic on road diverting traffic bound for Maidan via Mayo road has so far faced no major issues,” said a traffic cop. The work of repairing the single span of EM Bypass bound flank of Ultadanga flyover is presently going on without any need to close any lane. An official said, “Plans are at a final stage to allow load test on the Chitpur Bridge.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ambedkar-bridge-load-test-starts-others-under-care-too/articleshow/83291556.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The drive is being organised by the Surat district panchayat for those students hailing from Surat district. “To avail of its benefits, the students from Surat district will have to carry their passport, Aadhaar card, student visa and official admission letter given by the respective university along with them while coming to get the shot at the vaccination centre. This is part of the state government's special Covid-19 vaccination drive for students travelling abroad for higher studies,” said health official from Surat district panchayat. “Those students who have already taken the first dose of vaccine and they need to travel abroad for their studies before the fixed date of second dose, will benefit from this drive. Students have been asked to visit this vaccination centre between 9 am and 5 pm from Monday to Saturday,” an official added. The students will be issued a vaccination certificate from this centre. Vaccine shots will be administered to students who have completed 28 days of first dose of vaccination but have not completed the mandatory 84 days to become eligible for the second dose. Government officials say that the beneficiary students will be administered the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine after four weeks instead of 10 weeks. The state government, like many states, has also reduced the gap between two doses to 28 days instead of 84 days and given priority to students going abroad for their studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vaccination-for-surat-students-going-abroad-starts-from-today/articleshow/83290140.cms||---
---||Delhi||With art under viral attack, a helping hand for craftsmen||New Delhi: Dipak Biswas, from West Bengal’s Birbhum, has been working as a craft wooden lacquer handicraftsman for over 30 years. But the Covid-19 restrictions have affected production massively, and the little that he manages to produce hardly gets sold. Being the sole breadwinner in the family, Biswas has been worried over fulfilling their essential needs. Several artists and craftsmen like him have been battling the same situation. To help such people, Society for the Promotion of Indian Classical Music And Culture Amongst Youth (SPIC MACAY) has started “Support the Artist” series. Through contribution, the voluntary organisation has already helped 18 artists from different parts of the country. Each of them has been given Rs 5,000 and SPIC MACAY hopes to reach out to 200 artists. Suman Doonga, the convener and director of media, told TOI, “We have already collected some money. Lal Path Lab has donated Rs 5 lakh and another Rs 5 lakh has come from a private company based in Bangalore. It is a unique concept where there are episodes with the name of the artist, art form and his/her performance. It is a self-sustained model with a video so that anyone can support with money using bank details given in it.” During the pandemic, “artists in our country across the arts spectrum are suffering from difficulties due to loss of work and no means of sustenance. Many artists have been forced to take up other menial tasks. Some of them have resorted to selling day-to-day wares on streets, while some are selling vegetables, shoes, masks and other utilities.” However, Doonga continued, some of the technologically proficient artists are adapting to technologies to conduct workshops and sell their creations. “The art and crafts, which has kept the human culture alive for thousands of years, is dwindling.” SPIC MACAY will also undertake various other initiatives such as online interactions, concerts, workshops and exhibitions to support artists. “To ensure that support keeps pouring, we plan to have artists’ interviews by our volunteers across the country, followed by a performance by them as part of the series. After that, we will appeal to the audience to contribute for that particular artist and we will match their contribution,” added Doonga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-art-under-viral-attack-a-helping-hand-for-craftsmen/articleshow/83291640.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Pune||No e-pass needed for inter-district travel, curbs on movement after 5pm: Pune police||PUNE: Joint commissioner of Pune police Ravindra Shisve has said that from Monday (June 7), no e-pass will be needed for inter-district travel. An e-pass will, however, be required to enter an area or district marked as level 4 or 5 in the state guidelines. Shisve said no e-pass is required for movement within Pune city from 7am to 5pm, adding that non-essential travel is not allowed from 5pm to 7am. “We will follow all guidelines issued by the state government and policies formulated by the PMC,” he said. “A person travelling from Pune to a level 4 or 5 area/district will have to apply for an e-pass, which will be granted as per assessment of travel purpose,” Shisve told TOI on Sunday. He said no e-pass is required to travel to level 1 or 3 areas or districts. Citizens can apply for an e-pass at covid19.mhpolice.in. The move is in line with the state government’s fivelevel unlocking plan that is based on a district’s weekly positivity rate (WPR) and Covid bed occupancy. A level 4 or 5 classification suggests a district or area still has a high WPR and bed occupancy. No e-pass for inter-dist trips, curbs stay on after 5pmThe PMC and the PCMC have already issued orders allowing shops and establishments to stay open from 7am to 4pm. “An hour-long grace period will be given to ensure people can return home. From 5pm onwards, a nakabandi will be in place to see there is no movement without valid purpose,” Shisve said, adding that citizens have been urged to stay home and not take vehicles out after 5pm for non-essential travel. “People can travel for emergency purposes. Citizens are requested to cooperate at checkpoints. Night curfew will remain in place,” Shisve said. On crowd management, he said nakabandi will not be in place for an hour after 4pm. “We anticipate a fairly large number of vehicles on the roads during this time as people will need to get back home from offices or businesses. Shops will have to shut at 4pm. We will be on patrol along with PMC officials,” he said. In PMC areas, officials said manpower is being diverted to ensure that Covid norms such as social distancing and masking are being followed by citizens and those running businesses. Rule-breakers will be fined, they said. Officials also said the civic body has allowed police authorities to take action against rule-breakers. However, some rights of charging fines and issuing of notices have been retained by the civic administration. “Flying squads have been formed to take action. They have been assigned duties as per the ward offices. Even the head office of the anti-encroachment department will monitor and initiate action against traders or customers found breaking Covid rules,” said Madhav Jagtap, head of the PMC’s anti-encroachment department. In PCMC areas, to avoid overcrowding at marketplaces, police and civic officials said they plan to allow shops to operate on alternate days. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said, “For major market areas, we have decided to implement the odd-even shop opening rules. Necessary changes to the rule will be made if we find that it's not yielding results.” He said teams have been formed to ensure Covid norms are not broken. Ramnath Pokale, additional commissioner of police, Pimpri Chinchwad, said most sectors will be open from Monday. But curbs will continue and people will have to be careful, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-e-pass-for-inter-district-travel-unless-its-to-level-4-5-areas-joint-cp/articleshow/83291642.cms||---

They said that at noon, they hardly have any customers. However, it may be noted that the district is in the level 3 category of the state government’s unlock plan. Accordingly, shops and establishments, including restaurants, are allowed to operate only till 4pm. After 5pm, there are strict restrictions even on movement of people. The hotels and restaurants are allowed to operate with 50% capacity. They are allowed to make home deliveries between 4 pm and 8 pm “It is really a good decision, as hotels, restaurants and bars will start functioning after over two months. But the timings are odd,” said Sanjay Chavan, president of the Association of Hotels, Bars and Restaurants (ABHAR). “Around 90% of the total business comes at night. Hence, we want the government to allow us to function between 3 pm and 9 pm instead of 7 am and 4 pm,” said Chavan. “We have already started the cleaning activities and will open from Monday. Around 90% of the staff working in hotel and restaurant kitchens are from states like Bihar, UP etc. Around 50% of the employees have gone to their native places,” said Shailesh Kute, owner of one of the major hotels in the city. “We will call them only after we are allowed to function at night up to 10 p.m.. For the time being, we will start working with the staff available. Nevertheless, it will take around a month or two for the normal functioning of hotels and restaurants,” said Kute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/eateries-seek-permission-to-operate-from-3pm-to-9pm/articleshow/83285644.cms||Tushar Pawar

We also have diverted our staff from Covid duties. Only ICU staff are on Covid duty owing to a few remaining cases,” Sassoon dean Muralidhar Tambe told TOI. Tambe said mucormycosis was a worry, with over 200 patients treated at Sassoon. “We have not got any breather even though Covid cases have reduced,” he said. Sassoon has treated over 9,000 Covid cases since March 2020. Meanwhile, Pimpri Chinchwad civic chief Rajesh Patil said they have started non-Covid OPD for general patients from June 1. “YCMH still treats Covid patients, but general patients too have been allowed,” he said. The Annasaheb Magar Stadium jumbo unit, which had closed in the fourth week of May, has become operational with 200 beds to take some pressure off YCMH, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/non-covid-care-resumes-at-sassoon-ycm-hospital/articleshow/83291610.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Nashik||Nashik shops told to strictly adhere to deadline of 4pm||NASHIK: As the process of unlocking will begin in Nashik from Monday, a plan has been chalked out by the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) along with city and rural police to ensure that owners of essential and non-essential shops adhere to the new rules issued by the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Sunday. The DDMA is headed by district collector of Nashik and other members include NMC commissioner, commissioner of police, Zilla Parishad chief executive officer and superintendent of police (rural). The DDMA has unilaterally decided that Nashik district will be considered as a whole unit as far as levels of restriction for breaking the chain are concerned. Accordingly, it has been decided that level 3 restrictions would be applicable in Nashik according to which all shops and establishments will close by 4 pm and from 5 pm onwards gathering as well as movement of the citizens without valid reasons will be restricted. Deputy commissioner of police Amol Tambe said there will be presence of police on the roads from 5pm to 5am to ensure people follow the rules. “We have our teams and checkpoints in place. The personnel posted there will not allow movement of the people after the mentioned timings under any circumstance,” he said. It should be noted that after 5 pm only those belonging to emergency and essential services will be allowed to move but not without identity cards. The industries have already been instructed to give an identity card to the employees and workers working with them. The NMC also has made arrangements to ensure restrictions are followed properly. “Since shops and establishments are now going to function on a daily basis on weekdays, people should stop crowding. We will also have to see that shops and private establishments do not take undue advantage of the liberty for which enforcement teams have been formed,” Praveen Ashtekar, NMC additional commissioner, said. “Two teams each for all the six divisions have been formed to ensure shops and establishments shut down at the right time and failure in following the rules will attract penalty,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-shops-told-to-strictly-adhere-to-deadline-of-4pm/articleshow/83285646.cms||---

As of Sunday, PMC limits had 28 micro-containment zones – nearly 20 times less than in April, when the city had 497 zones. Seven of 15 wards under the PMC have zero containments zones and, of the rest, Sinhagad Road and Dhankawdi-Sahakarnagar wards each have nine zones – the highest in the city. As per PMC norms, any housing or commercial complex with more than one building, with 20 or more positive cases, will be declared a micro-containment zones. When the cases had started to peak, many such containment zones were declared in areas like Kothrud, Hadapsar, Satara Road and Ahmednagar Road. As per data released by Pune Smart City development Corporation and PMC, Kothrud, Warje, Dhole Patil Road, Dhanori, Kalas, Bhavani Peth, Bibvewadi, Kondhwa, and Yerawada have no micro-containment zones and four wards – Kasba Peth, Aundh-Baner, Shivajinagar-Ghole Road and Nagar Road-Wadgaonsheri – have one each. The Wanworie-Ramtekdi ward has two containment zones, while Hadapsar-Mundhwa has four zones. “The decision to reduce or increase the containment zones is taken based on the recent history of positive cases in those areas,” Sanjeev Wavare, assistant medical officer of PMC, explained. “After the lockdown and the restrictions in movement, the positive cases across PMC limits areas have gone down. This decline is reflected in the changes in containment zones,” Wavare added. After the start of the pandemic, PMC had first sealed Peth areas (Maharshinagar to RTO and parts of Kondhwa) on April 6, 2020. A week later, some other areas including Nagar Road, Parvati Darshan and Patil Estate were sealed. Over the next eight months, most parts of the city had containment zones. On December 31, 2020, PMC removed all containment zones till the second wave started in March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/micro-containment-zones-in-pmc-limits-see-big-drop/articleshow/83291611.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

Besides, troubles associated with online booking, the issue which is largely associated with beneficiaries of Covaxin, has been occurring as aspirants of the first dose are found claiming the booking slots opened for the second dose. Confirming the same, health officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, (AMC) Dr Neeta Padalkar said that necessary on-site verification would be carried out to reject citizens in 18-44 age group turning up for the first dose. “We appeal to the citizens below age of 45 years of age not to book slot on CoWIN portal for the first dose as such vaccination has been temporarily halted at state-run health centres. Citizens should cooperate considering that those needing second dose should not miss their vaccination,” she said. While the government had allowed vaccination of everyone above the age of 18 from May 1, the measure was halted by around mid of the third week of May following insufficient stock of vaccines. The CoWin portal was showing four AMC-run vaccination sites within municipal limits of Aurangabad for immunization of citizens above 18 years with two of them — Aurangabad UHC and Bansilal Nagar UHC — offering Covishield while Kranti Chowk UHC and Raj Nagar UHC giving Covaxin. While four private hospitals have also resumed the vaccination drive by procuring doses on their own, two of them have been giving jabs to citizens above 45 years of age only whereas two others are engaged in on-site vaccination of industrial workforce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/1st-dose-aspirants-claim-slots-open-for-2nd-dose/articleshow/83281816.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata, Salt Lake take guard against waterlogging||KOLKATA: With monsoon less than a week away, civic guardians of both Kolkata and Salt Lake have promised less suffering from waterlogging this year. According to a Kolkata Municipal Corporation sewerage and drainage department senior official, the civic body had already checked and revamped its drainage infrastructure thoroughly as part of its preparedness to combat Yaas. “We are relatively in an advantageous position due to the threat that the cyclone had posed. We checked the functioning of all our drainage pumping stations, conducted necessary repairs of some heavy-duty pumps and took measures necessary to combat waterlogging. These measures will go a long way to ensure that the city doesn’t get affected due to heavy rain during monsoon,” Tarak Singh, a member in the KMC Board of Administrators (BoA), said. However, a KMC sewerage and drainage department senior official said water bearing capacity of some drainage outfall canals that carry storm water which gets flushed out by the drainage pumping stations, needs attention. “The KMC brass has taken up the matter with the state irrigation department which will try to conduct a dredging operation to improve the water bearing capacity of these outfall canals,” the official said. Singh said the KMC had taken desilting of city’s major underground sewerage lines that will give relief to residents who are staying in city’s traditional waterlogging pockets and low-lying areas. Similarly, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) is gearing up to save residents of Salt Lake and Rajarhat from inundation. BMC officials said they were satisfied with the monsoon preparations for large areas of Salt Lake but Rajarhat is still a worry. “Unlike Salt Lake where the drainage network is systematic, large areas of Rajarhat are still vulnerable so far as waterlogging is concerned,” a BMC official said. New Town Kolkata Development Authority officials said that this year they were well prepared to face monsoon. “We have already taken up extensive desilting programme across New Town including places like Chinar Park and VIP road near Haldiram where waterlogging has been an issue in the past. Meanwhile, a 10-year-old girl, named Mandira Pakhira, was killed after lightning struck her during a thunderstorm at Jyotsriram village of Jamalpur block in East Burdwan on Sunday afternoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-salt-lake-take-guard-against-waterlogging/articleshow/83291645.cms||Saikat Ray

However, the officials claimed that Sundays have always seen a low passenger turnout. “We advanced our plans of starting the services on Monday by a day so that people could know that buses will be plying from Monday. Initially, we will start 416 buses on 179 routes,” Dattatray Zende, the traffic manager with the PMPML, told TOI. The public transportation services in the state had been shut from April 3 as a result of second Covid wave and the restrictions that followed. Officials of the state-owned MSRTC said that even they had a slow start with around 130 buses plying on intra-district and inter-district routes. “The response has been satisfactory considering that today is a Sunday. We have had an average passenger traffic of around 25% to 30% in each of the buses. Buses plying within the district are moving with 50% capacity and no standing passengers. Buses are ferrying passengers at full capacity to some districts, in accordance with the latest ‘break the chain’ guidelines. It is mandatory to wear a mask during a travel,” a senior official with the Pune division of the MSRTC told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-msrtc-services-restart/articleshow/83291638.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Delhi||Buddha Comes Home: Relish Global Artefacts At Peace||New Delhi: While the National Museum is closed to visitors due to the lockdown, a new door has opened for history and heritage lovers. With just a few clicks of their mouse, they can see Buddhist artefacts not only at the depository in Delhi, but also those at the museums in many other cities across Asia. The National Museum is collaborating with museums in China, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan on digital exhibitions related to Buddhism. These galleries can easily be accessed by people on their computer screens. This is part of the Delhi institution’s initiative on digital exhibitions. “The reason why we adopted this concept was because people were unable to physically visit the museum. We could have created virtual tours for them, but what we did was to put up digital galleries so that they could enjoy history from home,” said Subrata Nath, additional director general, National Museum. “Such digital galleries are rare in India.” Nath revealed that more such digital galleries would be created by the museum. “We have collaborated with numerous countries on such virtual galleries,” he said. “We have infinite online space and we can put up any number of artefacts and items for viewing. People can also see antiques and historical objects from other countries, which they could have only by visiting those countries otherwise.” Abira Bhattacharya, assistant curator, pointed out that the old ASI building next to the museum had been converted into a Buddha gallery. “In November, our collaborating foreign exhibitors used 3D technology to image the artefacts and artworks. Then my colleague Sama Haq and I compiled them for the gallery,” said Bhattacharya. The assistant curator said the gallery would “establish that Buddhist art and preaching began in India and it travelled from here to the world, especially to Asian countries.” She added that the National Museum was planning 10 more exhibitions and work would begin on the 3D imaging once the lockdown was relaxed. To view the galleries of the eight countries, one can go to nmvirtual.in. There, after selecting any of the countries, they can access the virtual gallery that showcase both artefacts and artwork, with some of the items offering a 360-degree view. Some of the Buddhist objects on show include the Fasting Siddhartha (2nd-3rd century CE) from Lahore Museum, mural and art from Dunhuang, China, bronze statues of Buddha from Kyrgyzstan and a 19th century White Tara mineral painting from Russia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/buddha-comes-home-relish-global-artefacts-at-peace/articleshow/83291706.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

Weddings, however, are sober and confined to smaller groups than usual.  For instance, Bharatmatrimony recorded its best ever numbers since its inception in 1997 in both new registrations and successful marriages fixed through its site. Betterhalf.AI saw the number of subscribers double last year. “Soon after the lockdown was announced, we pivoted our business and made our site easy to use for both bride and groom seekers. The reported success stories (marriages concluded) for FY21 were one lakh as against 96,000 a year before. The actual numbers may be four or five times higher as not everyone informs us,” said founder of Bharatmatrimony Murugavel Janakiraman. “I would say that 2020-21 was the best ever fiscal year after we lost a few weeks to sudden lockdown,” he added. Subscriber additions too saw a smart uptick. Paid subscriptions of Matrimony.com went up by 8.4 lakh, up 19%, during the period. Ditto for other online match-making enablers. BetterHalf.ai, an AI-powered matchmaking app for marriages doubled its paid subscriber base in 2020 adding 5,000 new subscribers in the year. The company’s monthly revenues too have grown 10% month-on-month from 2019 to 2020 and stood at around $30,000 per month in 2020. The app claims a daily active user base of around 50,000 with users spending an average of 10 minutes per day on the app. The startup, which was a participant in Silicon Valley’s Y Combinator, recently closed a $3 million pre Series A funding round. Pawan Gupta, Co-founder, Betterhalf.ai. said the overall matchmaking industry has seen a 20-30% jump in their active users and revenues during the pandemic. “People staying more at home and the need to talk to a companion has led to a surge in user-activity for partners. While we don’t think more people got married in 2020, their activity on matchmaking apps grew by 20% to 30%,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/marriages-are-made-in-heaven-matchmaking-happens-online/articleshow/83291751.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli
---||Delhi||Why you must not queue up at govt offices yet as Delhi starts to unlock||NEW DELHI: After 48 days of lockdown, markets and offices in the city will open once again on Monday with restrictions in place and the capital’s lifeline — Delhi Metro — will again be available to the public with 50% seating capacity. While all government offices will open with limited manpower, public dealing will be kept to a minimum and online services encouraged. Though the number of Covid-19 cases and fatalities and the positivity rate have dipped significantly from the peaks witnessed during the last week of April and the first week of May, Delhi government is not taking any chances and is going for a gradual unlocking. According to sources, around 250 enforcement teams will be deployed by district authorities to keep a hawk eye on markets and other public places, apart from stringent measures near liquor shops, which the authorities feel may see overcrowding. “Our enforcement officials would ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is strictly followed, especially at public places where there is a chance of crowding,” a district official said. All shops at malls and markets, including liquor shops in Delhi, will open on the odd-even basis from Monday between 10am and 8pm. Private offices have been permitted to function with a maximum of 50% staff. All essential shops can continue to remain open on all days and neighbourhood shops have been permitted to do business on all days. Gyms, restaurants, cinema halls, saloons, spas and bars, educational institutions, weekly markets and parks, and gardens will not open and the bar on weddings in public places will continue while takeaways from restaurants will be available. Shops selling essential goods, including educational books and stationery items, fan shops in malls, markets and market complexes, are permitted to open on all days without restriction of timings. A government official said that at the moment, no public dealing work at offices such as regional transport offices would be allowed. Sources said registration of properties might be allowed soon at sub-registrars’ offices. “Many services of the government are available online and people are encouraged to use these services,” an official said. Sources in Delhi Development Authority said public dealing at its offices would take some time to start and even then appointments would have to be taken online. The three municipal corporations have issued orders for operations of zonal offices with 50% staff strength. The mayors said most of the municipal services were available online and citizens could reach out to the zonal offices in case of any problem. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said a mass disinfection drive was being carried out. East corporation mayor Nirmal Jain said most of the key services like sanitisation, healthcare through dispensaries, certification etc were also being provided during the lockdown but anyone facing any problem in accessing the online portals could visit offices. “People can also call the mayor’s helpline,” he added. In case of Delhi Jal Board, orders have already been issued to open the cash counters and meter readers have also been asked to start field visits from Monday for billing on actual reading basis. A senior official said that as Delhi government had unlocked the activities with restrictions, field visits would start from Monday for billing. “Zonal revenue officers, who have been made nodal offices to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour, have informed all meter readers to start the work,” an official explained. “Roster of staff is being prepared for indoor duties and no more than 50% outdoor staff will be called to the office on one day, but their work will be monitored on all days. Cash counters will open on all working days and people can reach out to zonal offices,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-you-must-not-queue-up-at-govt-offices-yet-as-delhi-starts-to-unlock/articleshow/83291688.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kolkata||ATM hacking case cracked, masterminds held in Surat||KOLKATA: The bank fraud section of the detective department — helped by inputs from the anti-fraud unit of a private bank — has finally cracked the sophisticated Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) ATM hacking case that rocked the city and led the fraudsters to escape with over Rs 2 crore. While the cops arrested two persons from Kolkata, the masterminds were nabbed from Surat in Gujarat. The cops said the duo, arrested in Surat, are Manoj Gupta (40) and Naveen Gupta (30) and the accused are residents of Fatehpur Beri in south Delhi. The cops have produced the two accused at a court in Gujarat and are bringing them to Kolkata on transit remand. The two men on the run — who hosted the main gang in Kolkata, communicated with them and finally helped the main gang to withdraw money — have been arrested from Kolkata. They have been identified as Biswadeep Routh and Abdul Saiful Mondal. Both accused were produced in a court here and taken into police remand. They are wanted in multiple cases across several police stations, said a police source. “This is the beginning and more arrests are on the cards,” said V Solomon Nesakumar, joint CP (In charge, Crime). Police sources that CCTV footage and most importantly, technical surveillance, led them to the accused. “There were a few mistakes made by the accused. We used them to fix up Routh and Mondal. We arrested the Guptas on Saturday. Two more teams are still working in north India. The black box used by this gang to cut off the LAN connection at ATMs might have been procured from south Bengal from where new cyber gangs are operating. We are working on these leads too,” said an investigating officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/atm-hacking-case-cracked-masterminds-held-in-surat/articleshow/83291678.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||Piaggio braces for ‘transitional’ June & July||Pune: Piaggio India is bracing for a “transitional” period in June-July and says the three-wheeler sector, “neglected” over the past year, needs a fillip. “We expect a progressive reopening of our outlets across India in June and July, which will be a transitional period for our business. We also expect a real revamp in sales and demand, but people also need confidence to visit the outlets, given the current situation,” Piaggio India’s chairman and managing director Diego Graffi told TOI. Piaggio manufactures a range of premium scooters under its Vespa and Aprilia brands in India. The automaker said these scooters received a “very good response” in terms of sales and that it was on track to cross its sales targets till April before the second wave caused closure. Graffi said this also disrupted the manufacturing process, with raw materials reaching unprecedented costs. “We did not have regular production in May, with a total utilization of less than 50% of our capacity. There were supply chain issues with many vendors affected by the lack of oxygen supply. There has been an unprecedented rise in raw material costs,” Graffi added. Graffi also expressed concern about the commercial vehicle market in India, which Piaggio has significant interests in. The company manufactures vehicles — mainly three-wheelers — in the cargo and passenger spaces and has also makes electric vehicles in the commercial segment. Piaggio and its competitors have seen major dips in its India sales in that segment. “The three-wheeler sector has been completely neglected ... three-wheelers provide employment to many people in India, and there are a lot of options for the commercial vehicles sector, such as revising GST on three-wheelers for a few months, having a specific scrappage policy to make the shift to BS-VI emission standard, and priority-sector lending,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/piaggio-braces-for-transitional-june-july/articleshow/83290222.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Delhi||Delhi: Corporations start disinfection drives, market associations mark shops for odd-even||NEW DELHI: As the city prepares to unlock on Monday, the municipal corporations have started disinfection drives at commercial complexes and markets. Market associations, too, are marking the shops to follow the odd-even guidelines. The Karol Bagh association has marked the 125 shops at the Ajmal Khan Road market while the Chandni Chowk main road market will continue with the “1-2 marking” system used last year. The inner lanes and katras in the Walled City, where social distancing is difficult to follow, will continue to pose challenges in maintaining the Covid-appropriate behaviour, traders say. Some associations argue that a graded plan based on the width of road and planned/non-planned nature of markets should have been adopted. Murali Mani, who heads the Karol Bagh association, said half of the shops would open on Monday, the weekly closure day for the popular market. “From social distancing circles to sanitsation points, we have made all preparations, but our biggest concern remains access of customers to markets. If the government is asking traders and workers to produce e-passes/ID cards for movement, how common customers will come,” he added. The association will also appeal to the corporation to put the pedestrianisation project on hold, Mani said. In Walled City, Sanjay Bhargava, who heads Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said, “Of the 650 shops, those marked 1 will open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and the rest on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.” There should have been a separate plan for inner lanes and katras, he added. In the south, Rajender Sharda, head of the market association at Greater Kailash-II M Block, said a more liberal unlock plan should have been allowed for planned markets with ample space. “How will a customer know which shops are open and which ones are closed? In many cases, one plot can have multiple shops.” The association has made it mandatory to make a sanitisation point outside every outlet, get all 45+ workers vaccinated and remove encroachment. “We have also got our security guards vaccinated. All parking attendants should also be vaccinated as they are the first point of contact,” Sharda said. Sanjeev Mehra, president of the Khan Market Traders Association, listed the problems of this central Delhi market. “Each shop number has three units. How do you choose? How will customers remember the shop numbers? If they want multiple things, will it not require multiple visits?” Mehra also pointed out that it wasn’t clear if customers would need e-passes. North corporation mayor Jai Prakash, who was overseeing the drive in Old Delhi markets like Sadar Bazar, said big markets had been covered while the rest would be on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-start-disinfection-drives-mkt-associations-mark-shops-for-odd-even/articleshow/83291702.cms||Paras Singh

The taman trees, which stood along the footpath opposite Phoenix Mills, were about 20 feet high, but have been reduced to stumps less than 6 feet in height around May 31. The BMC has lodged an FIR at NM Joshi police station. As a row of buses is usually parked along the street, the “clandestine” hacking could have gone unnoticed. The knives are out for the Shiv Sena-ruled BMC with the BJP taking a dig at the felling of trees in the jurisdiction of state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, against the backdrop of World Environment Day. The BJP has alleged that the trees were hacked to give a clearer view of commercial hoardings along the street. MLC Pravin Darekar and BJP city president and MLA Mangal Prabhat Lodha visited the site on Sunday and sought action against municipal officials. Darekar said that the “open” hacking of trees mirrors absence of fear of the law. “On the one hand, there is a dearth of oxygen today, and on the other, trees which are a source of oxygen are being hacked… We need answers,” he said. A senior BMC official said, “The hoardings are on railway land. We have also informed railway officials,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-15-trees-hacked-for-clear-hoarding-view/articleshow/83292876.cms||Richa Pinto

The incident took place on May 31. The deceased, Savitri, lived with her husband who suffers from cancer and is bedridden. The couple had recently hired Monu to help with the household chores. Monu, instead, roped in two of his friends, Naveen and Vishal, to rob the couple. On the night of May 31, the three accused allegedly entered the house and attacked the woman to question where the cash and jewellery were kept. When she resisted and tried to raise an alarm, the accused strangled her and fled. The woman was taken to a hospital by neighbours. Cops later questioned Monu, who claimed innocence and said that two robbers had targeted the house.

The committee overseeing the management of the Kotla burial ground near ITO has stopped the construction of a permanent tombstone/structure at his burial site as, officials say, it was being carried out without any authorisation. The former member of parliament from Siwan, who was lodged in Tihar Jail, died on May 1 due to Covid-19 complications and was buried in the Covid section of the ground on May 3. “Due to shortage of space, we had stopped construction of new permanent structures a few years ago so that space could be reutilised,” said Mashkoor Rashid, a member of Jadid Qabristan Ahl-e-Isalm (Delhi Gate). “Our workers found that a maqbara was being built with concrete pillars and walls. The work was stopped by us as no permission had been taken,” he added. Committee members say the family’s request will be considered on June 10, when it will be decided whether to destroy the half-built structure or allow its completion. “The construction should not have started without the approval,” a member said. The ground has overseen bulk of the Covid-protocol burials in the city during both Covid waves and is running out of space. Mohammad Shamim, a supervisor, said around 1,500 bodies had been buried in the five-bigha Covid section, while a 4-acre site near Millennium Park was currently locked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-permission-panel-stops-work-at-shahabuddins-kotla-burial-site/articleshow/83291745.cms||Paras Singh
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand’s sex ratio at birth falls from 912 in 2005-6 to 840 in 2021; hill state now has worst sex ratio at birth, reveals Niti Aayog’s SDG Index||Nainital: Uttarakhand’s sex ratio at birth is currently among the worst in the country, as per the sustainable development goals (SDG) indicators released by Niti Aayog a few days ago. The state’s performance has been steadily declining every year as far as the sex rtatio at birth is concerned. The third National Family Health Survey (NFHS) done in 2005-6 revealed Uttarakhand’s sex ratio at birth was of 912 female births per 1,000 male births, which was below the then national average of 914. After a decade, in 2015-16, the sex ratio at birth in Uttarakhand dropped to 888, as per the NHFS -4. In 2018, the ratio dipped to 850 and thereafter to 841 the next year, according to SDG surveys in those years. This year, the ratio stands at 840, making Uttarakhand the state with the worst sex ratio at birth. Meanwhile, several states which previously had highly skewed sex ratios at birth have shown improvements. Punjab and Haryana, where the sex ratio at birth was 734 and 762 respectively in 2005-6, increased to 860 and 836 by 2015-16. In 2021, the situation in Punjab has improved, its sex ratio at birth is now 890. Haryana’s has dipped to 843. In fact, neighbouring state Himachal Pradesh was almost at par with Uttarakhand in 2005-06, when its ratio was 913 (compared to Uttarakhand’s 912). This year, Himachal’s figures have increased to 930, leaving Uttarakhand behind by almost 10%. Kerala has been the best performer as per the current SDG survey, with 957 females born per 1,000 males in the state in 2021, which is better than the ideal rate of 950. According to the district-level break-up of the data as per the NHFS-4 in 2015-16, Pauri Garhwal had the worst sex ratio at birth then, at 705. Pithoragarh was the second worst, at 758 sex ratio at birth. The state capital Dehradun did not perform too well either, as the figure was 832. Almora topped the list, with 986 female births per 1,000 male births. Health experts said that the declining numbers are a matter of concern for Uttarakhand. “We are way behind the ideal figure of 950 and our performance is worsening with each survey. For years, we have been hearing about the skewed figures in Haryana and Punjab, but it is high time that the focus is turned on Uttarakhand and it gets its act together. Decision needs to be taken at the highest levels and a survey should be carried out in the state to find the cause of the trend,” said Anoop Nautiyal of Doon-based Social Development for Communities Foundation which is working on health-related issues in the state. Meanwhile, when queried about the state’s dismal performance, state government spokesperson and cabinet minister Subodh Uniyal told TOI, “There may be several reasons for the skewed sex ratio, especially in the hills. However over the last few years, we have worked to increase literacy rates and to inform men and women that there is no difference between a girl and boy. We will begin to see the results of our efforts in the coming days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhands-sex-ratio-at-birth-falls-from-912-in-2005-6-to-840-in-2021-hill-state-now-has-worst-sex-ratio-at-birth-reveals-niti-aayogs-sdg-index/articleshow/83288196.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Delhi||Sisodia strikes back after BJP calls scheme a scam||New Delhi: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday claimed that the central government’s opposition to his government’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme showed that it didn’t want black marketing and pilfering of foodgrain to stop. Sisodia was responding to BJP’s criticism of Delhi government with its spokesperson Sambit Patra accusing chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of doing “drama” for politics.After Patra dubbed the scheme as a “scam”, Sisodia retorted: “Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wants ration to be delivered at the doorstep of every person’s home, but Sambit Patra wants to continue the illicit tradition of ration appropriation.”Earlier, Patra claimed that CM Kejriwal was trying to mislead the country. “BJP wants to say clearly that the drama has been exposed. Kejriwal painted a picture that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is preventing door-to-door ration delivery. This is false. One nation, one ration card is a central initiative. Delhi government refused to implement it. Thousands of migrant labourers are devoid of the benefit of the scheme (sic),” Patra said.He said under the National Food Security Act, 72.7 lakh people were provided ration. The central government gives foodgrain under two schemes — NFSA and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana — in Delhi, he added.“Kejriwal has hidden a provision. Delhi agencies will pick and give processed foodgrain and levy extra charges for flour made of wheat. Kejriwal did not speak on how much extra charge he wanted from the poor. We will not be able to find who is getting the ration. It is a scam,” he added.Sisodia hit back in strong terms. “In today’s time, when everything can be delivered at your doorstep, why is the Central Government protesting against the delivery of ration to households?” He said Delhi government wanted to ensure adequate staples for sustenance of every household and also stop black marketing of ration.Sisodia said that after the chief minister’s appeal to the Prime Minister, Delhi government was hopeful that the scheme would be cleared, but Patra berated Kejriwal at his press conference. He said Patra claimed that 80 crore Indians received ration, but missed out on the crucial information on how much of this ration was stolen and sold in the shadow economy on a large scale.“Sambit Patra has alleged that Delhi government wants to earn an extra buck through ration distribution. But he conveniently forgot that the central government has released an order wherein state governments can charge an addition Rs 3 if they wish to provide grounded wheat to people,” he said, adding that BJP government in Haryana charged Rs 3 and distributed flour instead of ration even as Delhi government was charging Rs 2 for the same and also planned to deliver ration to the homes of the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-strikes-back-after-bjp-calls-scheme-a-scam/articleshow/83291740.cms||---
---||Delhi||BJP, Cong trade charges with AAP on distribution of ration||New Delhi: With a fresh row erupting over the doorstep delivery of ration, BJP and Congress on Sunday tried to corner the AAP government on the issue. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said it was a “total lie” that the Centre was not letting Delhi government distribute food to the poor. He said under the National Food Security Act, 2013, and the Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojna, the Centre was already giving free ration to 80 crore people for May and June.Gupta alleged that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was coming up with such lies to hide his own failures, while the reality was that Delhi had got more than its fixed quota under the PM scheme. He claimed that while Delhi government had got 72,782 MT of ration, it had lifted only 53,000 MT and distributed just 68% of that. Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta said e-PoS devices had been installed all over the country by the Centre. But the scheme was withdrawn in Delhi. Delhi functionary Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi, too, targeted Delhi government on the issue. Lekhi alleged that Delhi government wanted to raise an army of middlemen for sending ration to these shops.Congress, on the other hand, slammed both Centre and the state, claiming that they were conspiring to deny poor people anything free, whether it was free vaccination or ration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-cong-trade-charges-with-aap-on-distribution-of-ration/articleshow/83291741.cms||---
---||Ghaziabad||Curbs eased in Noida and Ghaziabad, but malls, gyms to stay closed||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: Lockdown restrictions would be lifted partially in Noida and Ghaziabad from Monday as the Uttar Pradesh government has announced the relaxation of curbs in several districts where Covid cases have dipped below 600. On Sunday, Ghaziabad’s active cases stood at 496 after the health department discharged 162 people in the past 24 hours. Noida, on the other hand, had 583 active cases. The easing of curbs is only for 12 hours on weekdays. Night curfew and weekend lockdown will continue across the state. According to the government guidelines, all markets, industries, transport, offices and logistical firms can resume operations but with strict Covid protocols in place. However, shopping malls, gyms, spas, cinema halls, clubs and educational institutions will remain closed. Standalone shops can stay open from 7am to 7pm on weekdays. In densely populated areas, vegetable markets have been asked to shift to open places. Restaurants and hotels can stay open for deliveries, but not for dining. However, exceptions have been made for eateries along highways and expressways and street vendors. The guidelines have also specified on the number of people that can gather at one place. No more than 5 devotees will be allowed in religious places while weddings and other such social gatherings will happen with only 25 guests. A maximum of 20 people will be allowed in funerals. For those using the public transport to commute, two passengers can be allowed in auto-rickshaws, while three persons can ride an e-rickshaw. A car can ferry four persons in total. Traders have been demanding that they be allowed to keep their establishments open for a longer period to make up for the losses incurred during the lockdown. During a recent meeting in Ghaziabad over the opening of economic activities, the traders had appealed to the government that shops be allowed to down shutters at 8pm instead of 7pm. The demand was, however, not accepted in the latest order. Officials said traders in Ghaziabad could not be granted special exemption. With the second Covid wave on the wane and the state government lifting the lockdown from most districts on June 1, residents of both Noida and Ghaziabad had been repeatedly demanding that the curbs be eased. The district administrations said the unlock would happen gradually. “We have asked all offices to mandatorily set up Covid helpdesks. The offices should try to encourage work from home. However, if employees have to come to office, nobody with symptoms should be allowed,” said Suhas LY, the Noida district magistrate. Asmita Lal, the acting district magistrate of Ghaziabad, said the guidelines would be enforced strictly. “We will ensure that people follow Covid-appropriate behaviour while they are out. Police will challan violators while the health department will intensify testing and contact tracing in containment zones,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/curbs-to-be-eased-in-noida-gzb-from-today/articleshow/83296330.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Woman corporator booked for theft, assault||MUMBAI: A corporator and her associate were booked on Saturday for thrashing the staffer of a snacks shop in Malad a fortnight ago and stealing from the cash counter. After the corporator pressed charges of molestation against the eatery staffer, Radhakant Yadav, he spent six days behind bars before getting bail. Bangur Nagar police said they are probing both complaints and have not arrested the corporator. On May 20, Yadav was working alone at the snacks shop. He had served samosas to a customer who ate them and gargled water before spitting on the street. According to the FIR, the corporator arrived on a scooter and slapped the customer for spitting. She shooed him off before opening the grille of the shop and barging in. “I did not know that she was a corporator. She slapped me as well and asked if the shop had a valid licence. She demanded on knowing where were we getting water from for serving along with snacks,” Yadav said in his statement. The corporator then entered a bathroom inside the shop where she slipped and fell. “She lost her cool and started hitting me on my face and back with a pipe lying there. I suffered a bruise under my eye and started to bleed,” said Yadav. Within half an hour, her three associates landed up. “They rained kicks and blows on Yadav and hurled expletives. Before leaving, one of them stole Rs 28,000 from the cash counter. The corporator then called for an excavator and got the front portion of the shop demolished. Bystanders shot video clips that show she was present during the demolition,” said the shop owner Mahadev Gawale. The group took Yadav to the Bangur Nagar police station where he was booked on charges of molestation. After his release on bail, Yadav went to the police station on Saturday and lodged a complaint against the corporator. She did not respond to repeated calls for comment on Sunday. Her identity has not been disclosed as she has complained of molestation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-woman-corporator-booked-for-theft-assault/articleshow/83292882.cms||---
---||Delhi||Following HC boost, Centre’s ‘fact sheet’ on Central Vista||NEW DELHI: With Delhi High Court terming redevelopment of Central Vista a project of national importance, the Centre has come out with a detailed “fact sheet” explaining costs and regulatory aspects of the scheme that so far involves an allocation of Rs 790 crore in 2021-22. The housing and urban affairs ministry on Sunday said only two projects of the new Parliament building with tendered cost of Rs 862 crore and redevelopment of Central Vista avenue with tendered cost of Rs 477 crore had been awarded and works were underway. Expenditure incurred on these projects till March 2021 is Rs 195 crore. The ministry said there was no diversion of funds away from health priorities amid Covid-19. Stopping work at this stage will entail creating liabilities and workers’ interests in terms of livelihood would be hurt and, if completed at a later date, the project would cost more with inflation. The government said contrary to claims, the project paid considerable attention to environmental provisions as well as increased public space. It said the various clearances were not bundled into the master plan as that was not permissible. Building plans were uploaded online for DUAC and the heritage conservation committee to scrutinise, increasing transparency. The revamp of Central Vista will increase overall greenery and public space, it claimed. The ministry proposes to transplant 3,230 trees to Eco Park at NTPC, Badarpur and 1,753 within the project sites. Another 2,000 trees are to be planted in the area. While some Jamun trees will be transplanted, those that were part of Lutyens’ original design will not be moved. “Central Vista will have a net gain of 563 trees...Further, the entire project shall be undertaken without cutting a single tree. A total of 36,083 trees will be planted in the city and overall green cover will increase substantially.” Using North and South Blocks for museums will open up around 80,000 sqm display area, much larger than at National Mueseum now. Over 2.25 hectares of public and semi-public land shall also be converted into green spaces. On the overall cost, it said the Rs 20,000 crore was “gross rough estimate” for all work that include new Parliament building, chambers for MPs, Central Vista avenue, 10 buildings of CCS, Central Conference Centre, additional buildings for National Archives, IGNCA, official residences for the PM and the VP, PMO’s executive enclave, Cabinet Secretariat, National Security Council Secretariat, relocation of National Museum. It said none of the listed heritage buildings would be demolished. The annex of the archives, which came up later, is being removed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/following-hc-boost-centres-fact-sheet-on-central-vista/articleshow/83291749.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Rs 1-crore relief for kin of lab technician who died of Covid||NEW DELHI: Revenue minister Kailash Gahlot on Sunday handed over a cheque of Rs 1 crore to the family of corona warrior Jag Parvesh Dagar. Dagar, a resident of Najafgarh in Delhi, was a lab technician in the Chaudhary Brahm Prakash Ayurveda Charak Sansthan, Khera Darbar. He succumbed to Covid-19 in June last year, Delhi government said in a statement. The bereaved family consists of Dagar’s father, wife and two children. He had joined service as a lab technician on a contractual basis in 2012. “We are proud of all the Covid warriors who provided their service in this critical time. It is because of the dedication of these warriors that Delhi was able to fight the pandemic and save lives. I pray to God to give courage to the whole family,” Gahlot said, while offering financial aid to the family of Dagar. The minister also assured the family that Delhi Government is concerned about all the families who lost their loved ones to the pandemic. He also assured them of any support that they might need in the future. The ex-gratia payment has been approved by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in favour of the wife and father of the deceased, the statement said. Gahlot is the MLA from Najafgarh Assembly Constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-1-crore-relief-for-kin-of-lab-technician-who-died-of-covid/articleshow/83291761.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Dehradun: Vaccination certificates issued to residents without inoculation happening||DEHRADUN: Rajnish Kumar, 36, on Friday, had registered for vaccination at Doon Club where the inoculation drive is being run by Max Hospital. However, he couldn’t reach the vaccination venue on the given day. He then took to the CoWin portal again to re-book the slot and found that his vaccination certificate was already uploaded. “If my certificate has been uploaded on the app, I cannot get vaccinated anywhere else because as per the government, I am already vaccinated,” he told TOI on Sunday. Kumar says that he tried to reach out to Doon Club authorities regarding the matter but was told that the club is only providing space and the vaccination exercise is being managed by the hospital. “I was provided with a doctor's mobile number who was running the drive. She told me that my bill for vaccination is available with her. When I told her that I never came for vaccination, she said that she will look into the matter but never got back. Later, I got a call from another person from the hospital who said that he will get me vaccinated the next day, but it didn’t happen,” he alleged. He added that he also made several calls to the district magistrate’s office and tried to get in touch with the Covid control room as well but no one was ready to help. When queried about the issue, authorities of Max Hospital said that “ the vaccination drive is being conducted at the designated centre under government guidelines in a fair manner". “Once a beneficiary registers on the CoWin portal and gets an appointment for vaccination, the system generates an OTP that is shared before inoculation. We are also maintaining manual data entry. However, since a concern has been raised by the individual, we are looking into the matter to resolve it,” a statement issued by the hospital said. Meanwhile, a somewhat similar experience was related by Sunil Kumar, who had booked a slot at a primary healthcare centre in Selaqui locality of Dehradun on May 14, and found that his vaccination certificate was uploaded on CoWin App even though he didn’t go for the vaccination. “I had booked a slot, but later changed my mind. I didn't avail the shot. However, the app is showing that I took my first dose of Covishield on May 14 and now my second dose is due between June 26 and July 9. I have no idea how this happened,” he told TOI. When contacted, chief medical officer (CMO), Dehradun, Dr Anoop Dimri said, "After investigation, it was found that Sunil Kumar changed his mind after getting a vaccination token at the PHC. As per our staff, all the formalities were already completed and his certificate was also issued by then." On being queried why certificates were not being made after the person had got vaccinated, the CMO said that "the issue will be looked into and rectified". “We will set up an inquiry in this matter,” the CMO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/vaccination-certificates-issued-to-residents-without-inoculation-happening/articleshow/83288246.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra orders fresh probe into Shiv Sena minister Anil Parab’s land deal||NAVI MUMBAI: The state government has ordered a fresh probe into alleged violations related to a Ratnagiri land deal involving state transport minister Anil Parab. The probe has been ordered under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966, after objections were raised over the inclusion of a sub-divisional officer (Dapoli), Sharad Pawar, in the first inquiry committee; the two-member panel was headed by Ratnagiri’s zilla parishad CEO. Records in possession of TOI show that Parab sold a little over an acre of the sea-facing Sai Resort at Murud village, Dapoli taluka, to Kandivli resident Sadanand Kadam for Rs 1.1 crore. The three-acre resort is allegedly illegal. Parab told TOI, “I have sold my property in Murud village.” He declined to comment on allegations, levelled by, among others, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya. “It’s between them (the complainants and the plot’s owner),” said Parab. The Ratnagiri collector ordered the fresh inquiry on Friday under section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code on a complaint from Prasad Karve, an aide of late Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray. The collector had formed the previous committee on May 25 to inquire into allegations of illegalities and violations that included those pertaining to land transaction, non-agricultural land permission, construction of a road to the resort, violation of CRZ rules, and house tax. Of the property in question, Parab sold 4,250 sq m (1.05 acres) out of about 12,600 sq m to Kadam on December 29, 2020. “Parab had purchased the land from Vibhas Sathe on May 2, 2017. Sathe had illegally obtained the non-agricultural land with permission for a ground-plus-one building from the SDO, Dapoli. But, Parab constructed three buildings, of which two are ground-plus-two,” alleged Somaiya. “Parab violated land transaction rules, non-agricultural (NA) land permission, construction of buildings and road rules, CRZ rules, house tax rules, and resorted to forgery for the resort in collusion with the SDO, revenue staffers and others. I had objected to SDO Dapoli Sharad Pawar’s inclusion in the inquiry committee as he had passed the non agricultural (NA) order with ground-plus-one permission and had complained about it to Dapoli police,” added Somaiya. “I have demanded cancellation of the NA permission and demolition of the illegal structures in Aaple Sarkar portal,” said Karve. The two-member committee comprising the zilla parishad CEO and SDO Dapoli was looking into Somaiya’s complaint. Karve’s complaint will be probed under the new inquiry. This has been learnt from separate letters (in TOI’s possession) written to the complainants by Sanjay Shinde, additional collector, Ratnagiri. Shinde did not respond to calls and text for comment. “The zilla parishad has jurisdiction over the assessment of all properties. SDO is the (land) permission granting authority. A report has been sought on the allegations,” said Dr Indurani Jakhar, CEO, Ratnagiri zilla parishad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-orders-fresh-probe-into-sena-minister-anil-parabs-land-deal/articleshow/83292913.cms||Umesh K Parida

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand first state in country to introduce Gross Environment Product (GEP) — forest, air, water & soil quality and quantity to be measured, assigned monetary value||Dehradun: Uttarakhand is set to become the first state in the country to assign monetary value to four of its critical natural resources -- air, water, forest and soil. The quality and quantity of these natural resources would determine the Gross Environment Product (GEP) of the state which would be used in evaluating the state’s Gross Domestic Product GDP). The announcement to this effect was made on the occasion of World Environment Day on Saturday by chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat and state forest and environment minister Harak Singh Rawat. Terming it a ‘breakthrough step’ by Uttarakhand, Rakesh Kumar, director of National Environmental Engineering Institute (NEERI), Nagpur, told TOI, “GDP talks about consumption, while GEP is about what is created naturally. It will give us a good picture of where we are heading in terms of our ecosystem because the base of GDP is GEP. Once Uttarakhand starts the process, other states can also follow suit.” The demand to incorporate GEP in the state’s evaluation mechanism had been pending for the past few decades and many academicians and environmentalists had been pressing for it. The calculation put forward by green activists estimates that Uttarakhand, through its biodiversity, gives services to the tune of Rs 95,112 crore per year to the nation. The state has over 71% area under forests. It is also home to the Himalayas, is the origin point of rivers like Ganga, Yamuna and Sharada as well as home to wildlife reserves like Corbett and Rajaji Tiger Reserves. Noted ecologist and former vice-chancellor of HNB Garhwal University SP Singh who had been mooting the need for ‘Gross Ecosystem Product’ for over two decades, expressed happiness at the step taken by the Uttarakhand government. Singh, who is currently senior honorary scientist at Indian National Science Academy (INSA), New Delhi , told TOI, “It was established back in 1997 by ecological economists like Robert Costanza that at the global level, the value of ecosystem services is about twice as much as the global GDP. Therefore, the step taken by Uttarakhand is an extremely important one as it would help in conservation of environment and also help save us from the effects of climate change.” Doon-based environmentalist Anil Joshi who, too, had been pushing for GEP for close to a decade, said, “It was back in 2009 that then then-government had agreed upon the proposal to incorporate GEP. It has taken over a decade for the proposal to see daylight. Nevertheless, better later than never. This will help everyone in recognising the importance of environmental products.” Meanwhile, forestry experts also hailed the move. “Uttarakhand is a state which provides a lot of environment services and in continuity as a result of which, there is a natural degradation in those services. So, this is a welcome move,” said AS Rawat, director, Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE), Dehradun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-first-state-in-country-to-introduce-gross-environment-product-gep-forest-air-water-soil-quality-and-quantity-to-be-measured-assigned-monetary-value/articleshow/83288278.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Delhi||No first dose of Covaxin for 18-44 years in Delhi now||NEW DELHI: With only limited doses available in the capital, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Sunday directed all private hospitals and nursing homes to ensure that only those in the 18-44 years age group eligible for a second dose were administered Covaxin. At the government vaccination centres where Covaxin is being administered, the health and family welfare department of Delhi government had already given similar directions on Thursday. The restrictions apply through June or till further orders. At the Delhi government’s vaccination centres, free doses of Covaxin for those aged 45 years or more are also being given to only those eligible for a second dose. While presenting the vaccination bulletin on Sunday, AAP MLA Atishi said that there were 5.8 lakh vaccine doses available for the 45-plus category, including 5.6 lakh doses of Covishield and 21,850 of Covaxin. Atishi said the idea was to ensure that those who had got the first dose of Covaxin a month ago could get their second dose on time. “Covishield is being made available all over Delhi for above 45 years,” she said, adding that there was no vaccination for Delhi’s youth between 18 and 44 years for two weeks now and it would take at least five days for the vaccines for this category to arrive. “It is time for the youth in Delhi to get a second dose. Now, many youngsters are going to Meerut-Bulandshahr, 100 to 200 km away for vaccination because vaccines are not available in Delhi,” she said, urging the Centre to provide sufficient vaccines for the youth. “Vaccines administered at expensive rates are beyond the reach of a lot of young people in Delhi. However, they are forced to get vaccinated at prices as high as Rs1,500,” she said. She said so far 56.5 lakh people have been vaccinated in Delhi, including 12.8 lakh people who have been given both doses of the vaccine. She said that Delhi government is making full preparations to deal with a likely third wave, but vaccination is the only way to avoid the third wave. Atishi said that it is the central government that decides how much vaccine should be given to which state and private hospitals and then the vaccine manufacturers supply it to the states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-first-dose-of-covaxin-for-18-44-years-in-city-now/articleshow/83291780.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Earlier, Ernst and Young was given the assignment. However, the entire process under which GMR Airports had emerged as the highest bidder was cancelled last year.Now under Deloitte, the privatization process will start all over again, said a source in the MIL. This development was also confirmed by airport director Abid Ruhi.Deloitte will be paid around Rs75 lakh for providing the roadmap towards privatization of the airport. Ernst and Young, which had the similar assignment, was paid a slightly higher amount, a source said. Four other consultancies had bid for the assignment. A decision to appoint Deloitte was taken two days ago, said a senior officer in the MIL here.Deloitte has been lately appointed consultant for privatization of six airports under Airports Authority of India (AAI). Under the earlier model, MIL was supposed to get revenue share from the gross earnings of the private player. Now, there is a broad plan to have revenue-sharing model on per passenger basis, said a source.MIL is a joint venture of Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) and AAI. As a part of the plan to develop Nagpur airport under the Mihan project, MIL had invited bids for offloading 74% stake. In turn, the private player is supposed to invest in the airport for creating infrastructure.Now, the whole process would start afresh and Deloitte would be suggesting the modalities of privatization of the airport, based on which fresh tenders will be called. The preliminary report by the consultant is expected to be submitted within 45-50 days.GMR Airport’s tender was cancelled last year because the percentage share of the revenues it offered to MIL was less than what the latter earned on its own. GMR had offered to share over 14% of its revenue with MIL. This, in absolute terms, was much less than what MIL earned on its own from the airport operations.At present, Covid has taken a major toll on the airport’s earnings. The passenger traffic has come down to 2,000 a day, which is 25% of the pre-Covid levels. Even as the traffic had improved after the first wave, there was a sharp decline in the second wave, said sources.In a nutshellEarlier Ernst and Young was the consultantGMR Airports had emerged as the highest bidderThe tender was cancelled, GMR offer on revenue share was less than what MIL earns nowDeloitte to will suggest a fresh roadmapCovid has brought down passenger traffic to 20%||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/deloitte-new-consultant-for-airport-privatization/articleshow/83288368.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Pune||Pune: Vaccine supply to be streamlined this week||PUNE: The supply of Covishield and Covaxin is expected to be streamlined from this week onwards, said officials from the public health services department of the Pune circle. The district received around 29,000 doses of Covaxin on Saturday evening. Of the total, 12,000 Covaxin doses were distributed to Pune rural areas, 10,000 to areas under Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), and around 7,000 to Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). The district is likely to receive a large amount of Covishield doses on Monday, added an official. The inconsistent vaccine supply has affected the pace of daily vaccination across the district severely since the second week of April. In the first week of April, the district had witnessed daily vaccination of over 85,000 jabs in a single day. However, after the supply of doses was hit, the average vaccination per day has remained between 10,000 to 15,000 jabs, per day. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), health services, Pune circle, told TOI, “We were expecting the Covishield stock on Sunday. However, it will now be made available on Monday. We are hoping to get more than 50,000 doses of the vaccine. Apart from that, we have been informed by the state authorities that the stock will be replenished at least twice this week.” Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state government on Covid-19 and former director-general of health services (Maharashtra), said that streamlining vaccination is the only solution to tackle the next wave of Covid-19. Meanwhile, officials of the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies had to keep the vaccination shut on Sunday owing to the shortage of doses. Vaccination at private hospitals remained underway without any hassle. On Monday’s vaccination drive, the PMC stated that it will conduct a Covishield vaccination drive across 56 centres while Covaxin will be administered across 16 centres. The slots for both vaccines can be booked via the CoWin app at 8am on Monday. PCMC officials stated that the civic body will conduct Covishield vaccination sessions across 64 centres. Covaxin shots will not be administered in PCMC areas on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccine-supply-to-be-streamlined-this-week/articleshow/83291800.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The duo had met on social media two years ago. The woman said that she had been duped of Rs 35 lakh during this period. The accused used different aliases online. He befriended her in 2019. She said that she was forced into intimacy after false promises of marriage were made.

---||Chennai||For greener future, need to work together, be accountable: Experts||Chennai: There’s no better time than now, as we start over after the pandemic, to set right years of ecological degradation and environmental destruction. Keeping up with the theme for UN Decade of ecological restoration, The Times of India, in association with Nippon Paints India and SSVM Institutions, organised a webinar on World Environment Day with a panel of experts discussing ways in which this goal could be achieved."Post the pandemic, the quantum of medical waste generated, and the ways to treat it, are likely to emerge the immediate biggest causes of concern," said Arun Krishnamurthy, founder, Environmentalist Foundation of India. "While saving lives and protecting frontline workers will be of utmost priority, we must be careful that toxic waste generation and poor disposal don’t land us in bigger danger. The amount of non-biodegradable trash generation in every household increased by 18%-22% in the past 16 months due to packed goods and package material being procured," he said. Arun also said the hardship of the pandemic could inspire steps towards effective sanitation and waste management, much like how the GCC helped restore 268 water bodies in the city, while recovering from the 2015 floods.The panelists also spoke about how the pandemic has demonstrated that long-standing consumption and lifestyle patterns could be altered, and lead to positive changes in the form of reduced carbon dioxide emissions. But they also pointed out how with the reopening of cities, these changes could be fleeting and stressed on the need for long-term transformation."In India as we don't pay our sewage and garbage bills, the government has few options to dispose of them and they land up in our sensitive ecosystems," said Niyati Sareen, project director, Water and Education, Hinduja Foundation. "People must be held accountable."Mahesh Anand, president, Decoratives, Nippon Paint India said one of the ways big companies could bring about change was by adopting smaller MSMEs and ensuring they followed the rules. "As all our products are GreenPro certified, we take the effort to educate our suppliers of raw material, to make their products GreenPro certified as well. This is one way the manufacturing industry can ensure its processes leave minimal footprint," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/for-greener-future-need-to-work-together-be-accountable-experts/articleshow/83283404.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Woman waits for 12 years for second child, dies the day after delivery||AHMEDABAD: In a tragic incident, a woman in Piplaj of Anand died a day after giving birth to a son. She had tested positive for Covid and the child was delivered after she developed serious complications. Jalpa Patel gave birth to a baby boy on April 25 and succumbed to coronavirus on April 26. The son was a precious child born after 12 years of yearning wherein Jalpa had even undergone multiple cycles of IVF treatment. “When the pandemic struck last year, we stopped all treatment. Luckily, we conceived naturally. But the joy was short lived as Jalpa died a day after the delivery. My only consolation is that she was conscious enough to know she had given birth to a healthy child,” her husband Chetan said. The couple is already parents to a 13-year old girl who suffers from mild mental retardation. Family said that Jalpa was keen to have a second child so that when she grows up, there is a sibling guardian to look after her even in their absence. Ironically, Patel family is faced with a rare situation where the child of elder brother Chetan is left motherless while a surrogate is pregnant with the biological child of younger brother Urvish and his wife Darshana who are based in Australia. "Jalpa bhabhi had said that even if I cannot travel to India for the birth of our child due to suspended air travel between India and Australia, she would take care of both babies till I come to India," said Darshna from Australia. Dr Falguni Bavishi, IVF specialist who is looking after Darshana's surrogacy treatment, said it is a rare situation created by the pandemic for hopeful mothers. When the pandemic struck, Urvish's wife Darshana had come to Ahmedabad in March 2020 for her IVF treatment. She suffered from adenomyosis, a condition in which endometrial tissue exists within and grows into the uterine wall. "I was told that due to this condition, my uterus cannot sustain a pregnancy. I was advised for surrogacy. We started the treatment and just when the embryos were formed, we had to rush back to Australia as air-travel between the two countries was shut down," says Darshana. Darshana is eagerly awaiting for the second wave to ebb out in India. "We wish to adopt Param as Jalpa bhabhi always said the baby is as much ours as hers," said Darshna. "I will be happy to give the baby to my younger brother's family for adoption so that my younger brother and my son both have a happy life," said Chetan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/12-yr-wait-for-baby-covid-kills-mom-after-delivery/articleshow/83292957.cms||Radha Sharma
---||Pune||Eateries in Pune cautiously get ready to welcome patrons at 50% capacity||PUNE: Eateries across the city are all set to open their doors for dine-in service at 50% capacity as per relaxations announced by the state government. “We are thoroughly sanitizing the entire premises. QR codes have been placed on each table to enable contactless ordering and avoid cluttering. Wearing a mask and conducting temperature checks is mandatory for all staff, as well as maintaining safe distance while interacting with customers. We will prefer keeping the dine-in experience limited to independent visitors or groups of two-three people. Larger groups will not be allowed,” said Vaibhav Paliwal, owner of Nukkad Cafe at Vimannagar. Raaj Paree, CEO of Cult House/Terra in Magarpatta, said, “This time we will take extra precautions. We are highly equipped and aware about the situation. There will be regular temperature checks for customers and in-house staff. A strict ‘No Mask, No Entry’ protocol will be followed.” Amjad Khan, owner of Deccan Darbar in Kondhwa, predicts that footfall across restaurants will comprise largely of regular customers. “We have personally communicated to our regular patrons to book a table or give us a call before coming over. We have made it a point to inform our customers about the mandatory safety protocols, and those who refuse to follow it will not be given entry.” Many eateries are encouraging customers to make reservations instead of walking in to avoid crowding. “Walk-in customers will be accommodated only if there are fewer than 50% patrons at the restaurant. A waiting area will be set up if the customer inflow exceeds allowed capacity. Since we have to shut by 4 pm, we expect footfall would be negligible,” said Pankaj Joshi, manager of The Spices Restobar and Grill at Undri. Praful Chandawarkar, founder of Chiranjeev Restaurant and Foods Pvt Ltd, said, “Though we recommend prior reservations to ensure seamless hospitality, we understand that it is not always possible to do so. We will have a board outside the restaurant displaying our total capacity, current occupancy, and seats available. Making the most of the time restrictions, we will launch an amazing breakfast menu very soon.” Ganesh Shetty, president of Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association, said, “It’s a good start, but not economically viable for A-grade restaurants to open with such time restrictions as dinner time is the peak business hours for them. Only about 30% of the restaurants will decide to open for dine-in with the implementation of the current curfew regulations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/eateries-cautiously-get-ready-to-welcome-patrons-at-50-capacity/articleshow/83291804.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Sambhaji Raje says will lead Maratha stir from June 16||MUMBAI: On the 348th anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s coronation on Sunday, his descendant Sambhaji Raje, who is a Rajya Sabha member, said from atop Raigad that he would launch a state-wide agitation for Maratha reservation from the Shahu Maharaj Samadhi Sthal in Kolhapur on June 16. In his address from the fort that was once Shivaji’s capital, he said reservation is the Marathas’ right and the protest will be for the 70% poor population in the community. Shivaji Maharaj was formally crowned chhatrapati, or emperor, of his realm on Raigad on June 6, 1674. On the occasion, the MP paid his respects to the Maratha warrior king accompanied by only a few participants in view of the Covid-19 restrictions. “I do not want to politicise the Maratha quota issue, but the agitation is for sure,” he said. “I am fighting for the poor Marathas and not the rich ones. I am not interested in allegations and counter-allegations going on between the current and erstwhile rulers in Maharashtra.” He said that after Kolhapur, he along with members of the Sakal Maratha Samaj will protest in every district and challenged local public representatives to face them. He announced that he will lead a long march from Pune to Mumbai, which will witness the participation of lakhs of Marathas if their demands are not met. Convenor of the Sakal Maratha Morcha Vinod Sable said that they passed a resolution to extend support to Raje in a meeting held on Raigad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sambhaji-raje-says-will-lead-maratha-stir-from-june-16/articleshow/83292921.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Get car learner licence via online test||Mumbai: You can soon get a learner licence for driving a car from the local RTO while sitting at home, announced state transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne on Sunday. He further said that car registrations will also be done at dealer level to expedite sale and deliveries which were stalled for over a month now. While the transport department is giving finishing touches to the learner module which may be unveiled in a few days, Dhakne said that the new system will do away with hundreds of applicants arriving at various RTOs across the state daily. “It will be a course for which the applicant will have to enrol by paying the nominal fee he or she would pay for a learner licence,” he said. The applicant will have to compulsorily go through the eight-day course module and watch a few road safety videos and go through some documents on road signs and traffic safety rules. “After watching the videos, the applicant can apply for the learner licence test from any place and at any time. It will be an online examination with multiple choice questions,” he said. The learner licence test is usually of 20 marks. Once you clear the test, the system will automatically generate the marksheet and upload the learner licence certificate on screen. You can then save the certificate as a file or take a printout before going for motor driving training at a local school, an official said. The final / permanent driving test will be manual and one will have to compulsorily come to the tracks for the test. Said an official, “We expect the restrictions to be eased so that permanent tests can be restarted soon at the local RTO," an official said. Dhakne said that dealer level registration will ease the RTO work. “Dealers can upload all documents, car papers and digitally sign them besides paying tax online. The tax will also be computed as per the ex-showroom cost of the vehicle,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-get-car-learner-licence-via-online-test/articleshow/83292945.cms||Somit Sen
---||India||Meet on university entry test this week||NEW DELHI: The Union education ministry is to convene a meeting of the vice- chancellors of central universities to discuss, among other agendas, the implementation of the Central University Common Entrance Test (CUCET) this week. The ministry will also announce the new dates for JEE (Main) of April and May cycles and NEET-UG within the next 15 days. Due to the surge in Covid-19 cases across the country, the JEE (Main) exams were postponed. NEET-UG has been scheduled for August 1. However, the National Testing Agency didn’t start the registration process due to the lockdown. Following the cancellation of the class XII exams by most of the national, state and private boards, the higher education institutions, while waiting for the board’s decision to announce their assessment policy, are also looking at alternative options over concerns of “evaluation disparity”. The discussion on CUCET indicates that the government is thinking of reviving the implementation plan which was kept at abeyance due to the surge of Covid-19 cases across the country. “The cancellation of the class XII exams of the CBSE was done keeping in view the pandemic situation. However, that raised concerns over the disparity in evaluation of the class XII results as they will be based on assessments at school level. The ministry is going to take up the matter with the VCs of central universities and discuss implementation of CUCET and term-end exams in HEIs. The meeting is likely to be convened this week, which however depends on the availability of the minister,” said a senior official at the MoE. Ministry officials, while indicating that though NEET-UG is likely to be postponed to a later date, said the JEE (Main) and NEET-UG will not be cancelled. “There is no question of cancelling these exams. However, a review will be taken either this week or the next and new dates will be announced in the next 15 days depending on the Covid situation. The delay in these competitive exams will also adversely affect the admission cycle,” said the MoE official. While the February and March cycles of JEE (Main) were conducted successfully, the NTA postponed the April and May cycles following a surge in Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/meet-on-university-entry-test-this-week/articleshow/83296204.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat second biggest target for Delta force||AHMEDABAD: “Increase testing, hasten isolation, prevent crowds and inter-mingling of people, ensure wearing of masks and increase vaccination.” On May 28, in a minuted video conference, the Union health ministry had a stern warning for Gujarat and two other states that were stricken by the deadly double mutant variants of the Covid virus (B.1.617). The states were told to keep their guard up and to ensure strict Covid protocols. This warning was for a reason. After UP, Gujarat had the second highest proportion of double mutant isolates — almost 77%. In Maharashtra, 47% of the samples had the double mutant Covid variant and in Delhi the figure was 35%. These two states had recorded a surge in cases and deaths. In Punjab, 10.4% of the samples tested had the double mutant, MP showed 12.9%, West Bengal had 27%, and Andhra Pradesh’s figure was 47%. On February 2 this year, the B.1.617 double mutant was first detected in Gujarat. In a matter of days, it ripped through the state’s population and became the dominant strain, thanks to the violation of Covid protocols. Also, last week, another warning was sounded when the Government of India’s Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequencing Consortia (INSACOG) said that another infective strain, N440K, had been found. It was found between March and April 24 in nine of the 280-odd samples sequenced by INSACOG laboratories. “Gujarat has been advised to strengthen public health response in areas where the presence of B.1.617 and its sub-variants was seen in high proportions,” said a senior state health official. “We are hurrying with vaccinations and pressing for more campaigns for Covid protocols.” The official added, “Gujarat is among the high-burden states and has received frequent written communications from the Union health ministry.” Gujarat has been told at regular intervals to impose stringent measures. “We have been advised to maintain strict surveillance in districts reporting new Covid variants of concern (VOC),” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-2nd-biggest-target-for-delta-force/articleshow/83292984.cms||Paul John
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan scores high in school education||JAIPUR: The Union ministry of education on Sunday released the third edition of Performance Grading Index (PGI) 2019-20 in which Rajasthan got Grade1+ i.e., level 3. Compared to last year, the state has improved its performance significantly. The PGI is a tool to provide insights on the status of school education in states and Union Territories. Rajasthan scored between 851-900 points in 2019-20 PGI, which is a significant improvement from the last two indices where state scored 751-800. The central government introduced the Performance Grading Index (PGI) with a set of 70 parameters to catalyse transformational change in the field of school education. The PGI for states and Union Territories was first published in 2019 with reference year 2017-18. The PGI exercise envisages that the index would propel states and UTs towards undertaking multi-pronged interventions that will bring about the much-desired optimal school education outcomes. Rajasthan’s better performance his year can be attributed to the focus given on the access, infrastructure and other facilities. School education expert K B Kothari said this is good news for the state that we have performed well over the years. “The government has focussed on school education with new policies working in different sector and this index is the result of that. I hope we will further improve,” Kothari said. There is, however, an expectation that the next PGI report will not be favourable to Rajasthan or any state due to the impact of pandemic. Kothari said that learning outcomes have suffered in the country due to no physical classes and promotion of students amidst pandemic. He explained, “Around 40% children have no access to internet facilities. In rural areas of the state, situation is even more severe. Although the government has started various schemes, but without any classes for over a year education will suffer, especially in primary classes. We need to start working on how to improve the learning outcome of schools during pandemic.” The PGI this time is structured in two categories, namely, Outcomes and Governance & Management and comprises 70 indicators in aggregate with a total weightage of 1,000 points. Punjab, Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu, Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Kerala occupy the highest grade (Grade A++) for 2019-20. Although, no state was able to reach the perfect Level 1 after scoring 951-1,000 score.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-scores-high-in-school-education/articleshow/83291825.cms||---

The monsoon has covered Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Solapur, Pune, Osmanabad and southern parts of Raigad districts so far, said the officials. Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecast division at IMD, Pune, said, “Conditions such as the upper air cyclonic circulation over Konkan, Goa region and North East Arabian Sea over Gujarat coast, trough line between North Maharashtra till Kerala, extended low pressure and westerly winds had made monsoon active for the last 24 hours over Konkan, Goa, Madhya Maharashtra and some parts of Marathwada. As a result, these areas have received rainfall on Sunday.” “However, the disappearance of some of the systems that activated monsoon over Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada region would disappear till June 10. From June 11 evening onwards, monsoon would again reactivate over these regions. Pune city as well as district is expected to get rainfall from the evening of June 11,” Kashyapi added. On Sunday, the skies mostly remained overcast since the morning. The ghat areas of the district have recorded light rainfall, said met officials. Due to consistent overcast conditions, Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories recorded a sharp fall in day and night temperatures. Shivajinagar and Lohegaon recorded 31.3 degrees Celsius and 30.6 degrees Celsius as day temperatures, which were below normal by 3 degrees Celsius and 2.4 degrees Celsius respectively. The officials have predicted partly cloudy conditions particularly in the afternoon and evening hours with light rainfall till June 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/monsoon-clouds-enter-pune-district-cover-30-area-of-state-says-imd/articleshow/83291819.cms||Sandip Dighe

The strike has left around 5,000 tonne of garbage on the city roads. Many people had dumped trash on the road due to no door-to-door collection of waste. Some resident welfare societies had started hiring private contractors to pick up the garbage but that is not affordable to everyone due to high rates. Sandeep Chaudhary, operation manager of garbage collecting company, said, “We had a meeting with LSG secretary Bhawani Singh Dehta on Sunday evening. He assured us that the state government will step in to resolve the issue of pending payments soon. So, even though no payment is received yet, based on the assurance of the state government, and in the interest and safety of the citizens of Jaipur, we are resuming services in both Heritage and Greater from Monday onwards.” According to Chaudhary, the corporation is yet to clear their Rs 290 crore of bills due to which they are not able to give salaries to their staff since January. Around 320 vehicles of garbage collecting company were standing in the parking lot since Thursday, due to the ongoing tussle of payment by Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Greater. More than 200 complaints have been filed in the JMC, Greater complaint center related to garbage collection not happening. There are more than 700 garbage depots in the city that are all overloaded with company stopped working and on every corner of the road garbage piles can be seen making it difficult for the commuters to pass. The garbage depots have become a menace in Walled City. Residents registered their disapproval on these strikes and irregularity of vehicles arrival in the city. Kishan Kumar from Kishanpole said, “Vehicles do not come on time even on regular days. Strike has shaken the entire civic administration in Jaipur. Authorities should try for alternate solution for it.” There has been strike in bits and pieces in the city earlier. Many-a-times, company had stopped working in some parts of the city for weeks before being cajoled to resume work. It is after a long time the entire city went on stand-still and if the issue of payment is not resolved soon, this will come and haunt the residents again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/firm-calls-off-strike-but-city-buried-under-garbage/articleshow/83291832.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The second wave of Covid — during April and May — had wreaked havoc on the police department in the state as 66 police personnel succumbed to the infection in April, while 43 personnel died in May. These figures are behind the 88 deaths of police personnel reported in September 2020. In April 2021, 6,949 police personnel tested positive for Covid, making it the second-highest number of cases after September 2020, when 7,753 cases were recorded in the state police force. Senior police officers said Covid-related restrictions were implemented across the state through police, exposing the personnel to symptomatic and asymptomatic Covid citizens at public places and in contaminated zones. As per the data obtained from the director-general of police’s office, since the Covid outbreak, a total of 43,117 police personnel, including 102 in the first three days of June 2021, have tested positive, while 470 police personnel succumbed to the infection. Additional director-general of police (administration) Sanjeev Kumar Singhal said, “Every single life is precious. All-out efforts are being made at the respective police unit level and from the state police headquarters to ensure police personnel who contract the infection get best of the available treatment.” The officer reiterated that apart from appointing coordinating and nodal officers at police unit level, helplines have also been set up at the unit and state levels, so that if any Covid related issue remains unsolved at the district level, it is addressed by the DGP office. Apart from ensuring the best available treatment, stress is also put on sanctioning loans from welfare and vaccinating police personnel across ranks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/over-100-cops-succumbed-to-covid-in-two-months/articleshow/83286424.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Now, such institutions will instead have to submit a self-certified document, assuring that they have put in place all the fire safety systems in line with the prescribed rules, an official release said. The self-certified fire NOC will have to be submitted to the officer concerned in the education department. In another significant decision, the government said a building should not be denied a fire safety NOC for not having the required Building Use (BU) permission. This implies that if a building satisfies all requirements of a fire safety NOC, it will get such an NOC even if it does not have the BU permission. Officials of the fire service should understand that issuing a fire NOC is required for a building to obtain the BU permission, the statement said. The statement added that if a building meets fire safety provisions, it does not require BU permission to get the fire NOC. The government’s decisions come days after the Gujarat high court pulled it up over the issue of fire safety in buildings and establishments in the state. In response to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed in the HC, local authorities had said that hundreds of hospitals, educational institutes, and residential and government buildings in Gujarat do not have fire safety NOCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/9m-building-no-basement-you-can-self-attest-fire-safety/articleshow/83293129.cms||---

Viraj Kale, a Class XII student, said that many students have prepared very hard for HSC examinations since last one year and their efforts should not go unnoticed. “I think it will be unfair for hard-working to students to see they are merely getting promoted along with other students who were not that serious about studies. Holding HSC examination for at least core subjects is essential therefore amid ongoing unlock process covering many parts of Maharashtra,” he said. While Maharashtra government has decided against holding HSC examination this year due to the pandemic situation, it has sent formal proposal for approval of the Disaster Management Authority before making a formal announcement. Rajanikant Garud, vice-principal of Deogiri College in Aurangabad, said that the government should consider the option of online examinations for core subjects of HSC. “The state universities have conducted online examinations and same steps should be emulated for HSC examinations. The state government should not blindly copy CBSE in every policy decision and apply its own logic also considering the local situation,” he said. Over around 1.6 lakh students register for HSC examination from Aurangabad division every year while average more than 1.8 lakh students appear for SSC every year. As the SSC exams have been already cancelled, a section of stakeholders has demanded utilising these centres for HSC exams in order to avoid crowding. When contacted, Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHE) authorities refused to comment on the demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/chorus-grows-for-hsc-exams-for-core-subjects/articleshow/83286467.cms||---

The alarming rise in cases of black fungus infection has taken the progressive count of mucormycosis cases to 852 with 91 citizens, mostly those undergoing post-Covid recovery, succumbing to the disease during the second wave. Notably, the health issue of continuous rise in mucormycosis cases is now found to be compounded with a trend of increased mortality. While the mortality rate among mucormycosis patients was around 9% by end of May, it has now touched 11%. Stressing that spotting early signs of mucormycosis is the key, health authorities said diabetic patients undergoing post-Covid recovery should be more watchful. “Delayed medical intervention could be one of the causes among mortalities among mucormycosis patients. Those who are undergoing post-Covid recovery should consult a doctor if they sense any possible symptoms,” Dr S P Dange, dean of Government Dental College and Hospital in Aurangabad said. Headache, stuffy nose, nasal discharge, localized pain in or around the nose, redness of eyes, tenderness of facial tissues, cold and sneezing are being identified as early symptoms of mucormycosis. Notably, Maharashtra government has already announced that mucormycosis patients will be treated for free under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana — the flagship health insurance scheme of the government. As per official data, MGM Hospital has reported the highest 171 cases of mucormycosis so far, followed by Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad, (163) and MIT Hospital (122), among other health institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-reports-244-mucormycosis-cases-34-deaths-in-june/articleshow/83286454.cms||Prasad Joshi

The move aims at providing direct connectivity to more than 100 colonies, including Privthi Raj Nagar scheme. A nod has also been given in the JDA’s executive committee meeting to provide compensation the owners whose land will be acquired to construct these missing links. As per the proposal one 200-feet wide road has been named as Vande Mataram Marg which will be constructed between Gopalpura Bypass and Diggi Malpura Road. “The total length of the road is eight kilometre, out of which the JDA has already carried out construction in six kilometre. In remaining two kilometre, the exercise to acquire land from the farmers will be initiated. As decision has been taken to give the prompt compensation, it is believed that farmers will come forward to surrender their land.” Once Vande Mataram road is operational, residents of approximately 50 to 60 colonies will get direct connectivity to Kalyanpura railway overbridge. The civic body will construct the second road parallel to the Vande Mataram Marg. It will start from JDA’s West Way Height scheme on Ajmer Road and will pass through Gate No. 3 of Muhana Mandi to Diggi Malpura Road. The total length of this road is 10 kilometres. This road will ease the way for the people of about 40 colonies. The third sector road of 200 feet will connect the first and second roads. This road, about 7 km long, will directly connect the Ring Road from Golayawas Circle via Journalist Colony. Similarly, fourth and fifth sector roads of 200-200 feet will also connect the first and second roads at different points. An official said, “Residents of three dozen colonies will get direct connectivity with the construction of a road going from Goliawas Circle to the Ring Road via Patrakar Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-plans-to-construct-5-200-ft-roads-to-ease-traffic/articleshow/83291839.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Education institutes to change assessment patterns||AHMEDABAD: Recently, the education department in Gujarat and CBSE at national level decided to scrap the annual exams of the students, and instead working on a formula to assess the students’ academic prowess. But the premier educational institutes in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar are grappling with the issue for the past one year. This year, majority of the institutes said that the systems have got matured with experience and they have methods of teaching and evaluation in place. But in absence of ‘offline’ exams in majority of cases, the institutes have come up with new ways to assess the students. Prof Kabeer Jasuja, dean of academic affairs at IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn), said that assessments are now based on methods more suitable for online mode such as take-home or open book examination, viva-voce, projects, assignments, short quizzes, etc. “All exams are being conducted online. Focus is now on continuous evaluation,” he said. “Additional flexibility was provided to students to drop project-based courses, given the Covid scenario.”  “Over and above regular evaluations, MICA has introduced annual competency test to assess integration of concepts learned across course each year,” said Mini Mathur, co-chair of PGP program at MICA. MICA has also introduced mandatory dissertation in form of industry research study, subject knowledge assessment and a boot camp to prepare students for industry. Prof S Shantakumar, director of GNLU, said that compared to 50% weightage given to the annual exam, 30% to mid-term and 20% to continuous evaluation, the mid-term examination is scrapped and continuous evaluation now accounts for 50% marks. “We have also decided to exempt the final year students from the online presentation of seminar papers and instead evaluate them based on their written submission,” he said. At IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A), the institute has continued with continuous evaluation based on multiple components distributed over the term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/education-institutes-to-change-assessment-patterns/articleshow/83293130.cms||Parth Shastri

With the Covid positivity rate of 2.24% and 22.19% occupancy of oxygen beds by Covid patients, Aurangabad has found itself in ‘Level 1’ in the latest ‘Break The Chain’ order of the state government and is cleared off from all curbs by the effective Covid management so far. Aurangabad district, excluding municipal limits, is placed under ‘Level 3’ and will witness certain curbs, including the restricted working of commercial establishments and capping on the number of people attending weddings. The rural areas of Aurangabad district have reported a positivity rate of 5.46% and 20.34% occupancy of oxygen beds by Covid patients. Even if the curbs are lifted in Aurangabad, authorities have appealed to the citizens to follow Covid appropriate behaviour (CAB). “The curbs are being lifted with the hope that the citizens will follow CAB, failing which, the situation will be back to square one. Wearing masks, maintaining hand hygiene, following social distancing and using e-payments gateways should become part of our life,” AMC health officer Dr Neeta Padalkar said. As per the official data, Aurangabad district currently has 2,567 active cases, which includes 460 cases from municipal limits of Aurangabad. City-based traders’ leader Ajay Shah said citizens should not throng markets from Monday. “The unwanted crowding can give a fresh boost to the spread of Covid and we may face another lockdown-like situation. To end this vicious cycle, we as a society have to show some discipline in our day to day life,” said Shah, who is the state vice president of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT). While industries from municipal limits of Aurangabad have been excluded from any form of curbs, RT-PCR has to be carried out for the staff every 15 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/curbs-lifted-in-aurangabad-partial-relaxation-for-rural-areas/articleshow/83286490.cms||---

He was 85. His death comes barely a month-and-a-half after Farid died while undergoing treatment at a hospital here on April 1. The trio was known for delivering a number of hits including the evergreen numbers ‘Der Na Ho Jaye Kahin Der Na Ho Jaye’ and ‘Ek Mulakat Zaroori Hai Sanam.’ “Saeed had recorded the song ‘Der Na Ho Jaye Kahin Der Na Ho Jaye’ with Lata Mangeshkar as the female playback singer for the film Heena. However, the music director later realised that he needed all three of us for the song. When the song was recorded, it created a big impact and fetched us some good events from all across the world,” Amin Sabri told TOI. On Sunday, Saeed had gone to take bath when he had a heart attack. He was rushed to a hospital where he died. “It is a big jolt as what my father could achieve we can’t even think of doing that. We had performed at Aamir Khan’s house and at various other functions in Mumbai. Prior to Covid times, we were performing at various events,” Amin added. TOI had once interviewed the trio in which Saeed had expressed his annoyance over not getting any award and had said he was disillusioned with Hindi cinema. “We know how to sing but we have no idea how to sell our talent? We can’t act as sycophants and run around music directors,” Saeed had said. “Humari sun ne wale ki daad hi humara award hai (For us the appreciation from our listeners is our award),” Saeed had said. In the evening he was buried at the Ghat Gate situated cremation ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/renowned-qawwali-singer-sabri-brothers-dad-dies/articleshow/83291841.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Chandigarh||Farm stir: Charuni leads thousands from Ambala to Delhi, says more to follow||Ambala: Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni on Sunday marched towards Delhi border with a cavalcade of thousands of his supporters, starting from a toll plaza at Shambhu border of Punjab and Haryana. The visuals looked similar to November 25, 2020, when Haryana farmers had started movement under ‘Dilli Chalo’ call by Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM). This time, however, farmers were not stopped or blocked by Haryana Police as was done earlier in November. Thousands of farmers from villages of Ambala district gathered at Shambhu border in the morning and started moving for Delhi in their vehicles in the afternoon. Once the farmers’ cavalcade started movement, one side of the three-lane National Highway-44 was jampacked and people heading for Delhi faced long jams. People also had to commute on service lanes. The cavalcade was heading for the Singhu border to provide strength in numbers to an ongoing agitation against three agro-market laws passed by the Centre last year. Apart from Singhu, farmers continued to pour into the protest sites on the Tikri and Ghazipur borders of Delhi. On their way to Delhi, Charuni’s cavalcade, which started from Ambala-Patiala border, was welcomed with flower petals at Shahabad, Pipli and Karnal on NH-44, also known as GT Road. “A cavalcade of about 2,500 vehicles from Ambala district moved towards Delhi and another one will be taken from Panipat on June 10. This movement is being done to warn the government to accept the demands and to show the enthusiasm of one district. If such a call is given to the entire nation, Delhi will be choked,” said Charuni. To a query that talks have not resumed with the government for several months, Charuni said, “The government is worried more than us (farmers). In the last six months, the graph of BJP has come down drastically and people are hating this party now. It is evident from the election results of West Bengal and the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh (UP). We are starting a ‘Mission UP’ to defeat BJP there.” Happy to see the gathering of a large number of farmers, Charuni said, “The farmers of Ambala district have once again pumped new energy and enthusiasm in the andolan (movement). On November 25, 2020, the farmers of Ambala district had firstly marched towards Delhi under ‘Dilli Chalo’ after breaking barricades and facing water-cannons of the police. Today again, thousands of farmers from Ambala have given a new direction to the andolan by reaching Delhi.” In Karnal, Charuni’s convoy was given a rousing welcome at Bastara toll plaza on National Highway-44. It left after having langar. There, Charuni said they were ready for talks with government, but it should take a call. BOX Mandsaur police firing victims remembered: SKM Bathinda: The Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) stated on Sunday that farm activists organised events across the country, and even online, to mark Sankalp Diwas to remember and pay respects to six farmers who were killed in police firing at Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh on June 6, 2017, during a protest to demand renumerative prices for their produce. SKM stated that reports of protests to observe Sampooran Kranti Diwas (Total Revolution Day) on Saturday were still pouring in from across the country. Abhishek, Punam Chand, Chen Ram, Satya Narayan, Kanhaiya Lal and Ghanshyam were killed during the agitation at Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh. SKM said farmers vowed to continue the struggle initiated by Mandsaur farmers and take it to a logical conclusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-stir-charuni-leads-thousands-from-ambala-to-delhi-says-more-to-follow/articleshow/83291842.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Doctors find tracking blood creatinine levels key to cheaper mucormycosis care||PUNE: Careful tracking of blood creatinine levels can do away with expensive mucormycosis medication, treating surgeons have found. The liposomal form of amphotericin injections — a key drug against the infection — can cost a patient Rs 35,000 every day.  The conventional form of the drug costs just Rs 350 per day, but needs to be given carefully with a blood test every alternate day to rule out drug toxicity in the kidneys. If creatinine levels are raised, the 21-day course of the drug can be finished with two to three ‘pit stops’ also called ‘amphotericin holidays’ to allow the body to normalise levels. Creatinine is a waste product that is channeled out of the system via the kidneys. The efficacy of both forms of amphotericin — the expensive and the cheaper one — is equal. But the drug’s conventional form (the cheaper version) should not be given to patients with significant comorbidities, including renal failure and diabetic ketoacidosis. In the rest, conventional amphotericin can effectively arrest spread of mucormycosis. All doctors need to do is strictly monitor blood creatinine levels and clear damaged tissue, experts said. “Liposomal amphotericin is, no doubt, safer than the conventional one and everyone would want the safer version. But there is no difference in efficacy of both forms of the drug,” said ENT surgeon Samir Joshi. Joshi, head of the ENT department at BJ Medical College and Sassoon General hospital, has treated about 201 patients with post-Covid mucormycosis. “More than 85% of these patients successfully recovered through monitored use of conventional amphotericin and carefully planned debridement surgeries,” he said. Before Covid, Joshi had treated 65 patients with mucormycosis using conventional amphotericin. “Of them, 63 patients recovered and have survived,” Joshi said. He said unwarranted concerns, that conventional amphotericin causes kidney damage, has led to “hyped demand” for the drug’s liposomal form. “Careful monitoring with blood creatinine and few other tests can tide over this risk and allow effective use of conventional amphotericin,” Joshi said. In fact, it is the combined use of amphotericin with surgery that does the trick. Surgery removes the dead and necrotic tissues. Amphotericin then goes on to arrest advancing fungus in adjacent live tissue. “Both are essential. They are complementary to each other and are indispensable,” Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-docs-find-tracking-blood-creatinine-levels-key-to-cheaper-mucor-care/articleshow/83293150.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Similarly, for Monday too, the UT has not placed any order for oxygen from the plant. Sources in Chandigarh administration said the city has been allotted oxygen quota of 20 metric tonne (MT) a day by the central government, but in the last few days, city’s demand did not cross 10MT even. The sources also confirmed that the plant in Himachal Pradesh, from where they have been getting oxygen alloted by the central government, has now started giving oxygen to the industries, which was earlier stopped due to supply to the hospitals and health centres. “Besides Chandigarh, as the requirement of oxygen of the Punjab has also reduced considerably, the plant started giving oxygen to the industries. If Chandigarh need very little oxygen, it is not financially viable to transport from Himachal. Therefore UT administration is not ordering everyday these days,” an official said. Moreover, UT administration has also withdrawn quota restrictions for private hospitals and now these private hospitals can take oxygen according to their requirement without any check over the supply on them. Sources in the UT revealed that since the things have normalised, they are not checking oxygen supply agencies as well. Earlier, the situation had turned so serious that the UT administration had to deploy cops to ensure transportation and supply of oxygen in the city. Not only this, the administration had also appointed its staff at Himachal Pradesh based Barotiwala oxygen plant, oxygen plant in Chandigarh and refilling station at Derabassi round the clock to monitor the supply of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/demand-for-o2-falls-drastically-ut-stops-daily-supply-from-hp-plant/articleshow/83293132.cms||Deepak Yadav

A police team led by senior Padmakar Ghanwat solved five recent robberies after arresting the suspect Fida Hussain Irani of Shivajinagar in Pune. “The suspect has 31 of chain and cellphone snatching registered against him in Maharashtra, Goa and Telangana,” Ghanwat told TOI. On May 24, he had pushed a person walking along the road in Koregaon Bhima and had snatched his two cellphones. “While probing the case, we got a tip-off that Irani was involved in recent robberies near Koregaon Bhima,” Ghanwat said. He was nabbed Irani after a brief chase. “We have recovered two cellphones and a scooter from him,” Ghanwat added. During questioning, Irani admitted to his involvement in the five recent robberies. “In the last one, he had snatched a smartphone of a pedestrian by alleging that the latter had clicked photographs of women,” Ghanwat said. Irani has 18 cases of chain and cellphone snatching registered against him with the Pune city police, 11 cases in Hyderabad in Telangana and two with the Goa police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/chain-snatcher-held-in-koregaon-bhima/articleshow/83291846.cms||---

Owners and operators of gyms in the city find themselves in a similar situation, with the pandemic forcing many to down their shutters. “I am neck-deep in debt and struggling to provide for my family. I don’t know if my gym will open; I’ve heard nothing. I failed to find another job for over two months” Vikas Suresh Pathare, a trainer at a gym in Kondhwa, says. He is not alone. The struggle is far from over for many trainers and gym owners. Shrikant Jadhav, general secretary of the Maharashtra Gym Owners’ Association, says nearly 40% of the gyms in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad had closed permanently in the past year. “The restrictions in the past two months have forced another 5% out of business. Some who managed to survive will open on Monday, but it won’t be easy,” says Jadhav. There are around 700 gyms across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. Nilesh Kale, president of Pune Fitness Club Association, says, “Gyms can open only till 4pm at 50% capacity for those vaccinated and with appointments. Our clientele is largely in the 18-44 age group and not many have been able to get vaccinated.” Another trainer now works as an assistant to a local transporter. “I load heavy sacks of vegetables in trucks, for which I am paid Rs 150-180 daily. However, work is hard to find every day. As a trainer, I would earn Rs20,000-22,000 per month. I haven’t heard from my employer about the gym reopening and will continue as a daily wage worker,” he says. A gym owner in Kalyaninagar says, “Before the pandemic, I had 250-300 clients. It has dropped to 30-40 now. The time when anyone could hit the gym whenever they wanted to is over.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hit-by-recent-curbs-gym-operators-trainers-stare-at-uncertain-future/articleshow/83291844.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Ahmedabad||Covid-19: New positive cases in Gujarat down at an 84-day low at 848||AHMEDABAD: On Sunday, Gujarat recorded the deaths of 12 Covid positive patients, a 65-day low for the state. The cases are also down at an 84-day low at 848. But the analysis of the mortality rate reveals that it’s slightly but steadily going up. On Sunday, the daily mortality rate (the number of daily deaths per daily cases) was 1.4%, which was 1.5% on Saturday. To put the figure in perspective, the overall Covid mortality in 2021 is 1% (0.98%) as 5,626 deaths were recorded against 5.71 lakh Covid cases. The year has so far recorded 57% of the Covid pandemic’s total deaths and 70% of the positive cases. “The month of April, which recorded the highest cases and deaths during the pandemic, had a mortality rate of 1%,” said a city-based epidemiologist. “The mortality rate, however, is definitely down from the initial months of the pandemic when it was as high as 5% and 7% in April and May 2020.” The epidemiologist added: “But the increase in mortality rate shows that critical patients are still at risk.” City numbers reveal that Rajkot recorded the highest mortality rate among the four major cities in 30-day cases and deaths analysis at 1.3%. It was followed by 1.2% in Surat, 0.8% in Vadodara, and 0.7% in Ahmedabad. During the period, the state’s mortality rate was 1.1%. The shares of deaths in the eight municipal corporation areas and the rest of Gujarat in the past 30 days were 43% and 57% respectively, indicating more deaths outside the areas of major cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-positive-cases-in-state-down-at-an-84-day-low-at-848/articleshow/83293136.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Pune||Malls and restaurants await order on full opening||Pune: Industries and services feel heartened about the Level-3 reopening protocol that will be implemented in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad from Monday, but have also sought more leeway over the coming weeks, especially for malls and restaurants.The ir owners await positive orders. “It is disappointing that malls were not allowed any relief under the current reopening plans with many shops having to remain closed that would otherwise be open under the current orders in Maharashtra. However, with cases falling, what we have been hearing from the administration is that it is a matter of a week or so before malls are allowed to reopen. We also recognise that the government has its own concerns over the spread of the disease. We are completely ready with our plans and SOPs to reopen as and when the orders come. We would hope that we would be able to reopen with all facilities, such as multiplexes and food and beverage, as they attract the biggest footfall,” Mukesh Kumar, chairman of the Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI), said. Industries will largely remain unaffected by the order, as they had been functioning with some levels of capacity utilisation. For offices, some say that they will wait and watch before calling their employees back, or will call employees back to work depending on levels of vaccination. For offices located in rural Pune, which is currently under level- 4 restrictions, especially the tech hub at Hinjewadi, the companies say that they will largely continue to work from home, with only a skeletal staff for maintaining supporting infrastructure such as servers or air-conditioners. “Some companies did plan to return to offices partially from June. However, with the slowdown in vaccination, and the threat of a third wave, companies will wait longer as the previous move back to office was tough as they had to shift a lot of equipment back to offices,” Col (retd.) Charanjeet Singh Bhogal, chief operating officer, Hinjewadi Industries Association, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/malls-and-restaurants-await-order-on-full-opening/articleshow/83291847.cms||---

Patel, who was on visit to his home district and his constituency Mehsana on Sunday, added that the existing oxygen production capacity of 800-900 metric tonnes (MT) would be ramped up to take it to 1,200 MT. “The arrangements have been made based on the experience of the second wave. Moreover, oxygen concentrators that can generate 5 to 10 liters of oxygen per minute are also being received through PM Cares initiative and individual/ institutional donors. That would also be used for Covid patients requiring oxygen treatment,” said Patel. Patel visited the spots in Gozaria and Langhnaj where 20 cubic meter and 10 cubic meter oxygen plants are being set up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/75-new-o2-plants-for-3rd-wave-dycm/articleshow/83293166.cms||---

Owners and management of such enterprises are ensuring the safety of the staff and clients by implementing strict protocols. Manasee Dogra of Manasee Hair Studio 101 in Kalyaninagar and Kharadi, said, “We have made sure all our staff has been vaccinated. They still have to wear PPE kits and masks. Our priority is to sanitise our premises, including all equipment and furniture, using a de-fogger. While most beauty parlours and salons are air-conditioned, we think that proper circulation of fresh air is key at the moment, so we will focus on proper ventilation.” “We will only take clients on appointment-basis as we are working with 50% of the pre-Covid strength of our staff, and we want to ensure that proper social distancing is maintained. Walk-in clients will be told to take prior appointments.” Prajakta Gupta, the founder and director at Cologne Spa in Koregaon Park, said that with operation hours till 4pm, they can manage only a dozen appointments a day, which seems like a good start after being shut down for months. “All therapy rooms will be fumigated every two hours and sanitised after every session. We have been using disposable sheets and towels even before the pandemic, which we will continue even now. The staff members will thoroughly sanitise after each session with a client. They will also be equipped with the PPE gear. We will only service clients that have no symptoms. If we find that a client has a slight cough, even if they are not Covid-positive or have been vaccinated, we won’t take any chances for the safety of our staff and other clients, and politely ask them to come back after they are well,” Gupta said. “We will be opening the salon as per the guidelines. We expect a rush of customers, which is why one has to take prior appointment as per the guidelines. Only 50% capacity in terms of seating would be allowed,” Kiran Shinde, who runs New Delight Men’s Parlour in Kasba Path, said.

---||Chandigarh||Study finds direct link between Covid, diabetes, mucormycosis||CHANDIGARH: In the first evidence-based multicentre study on mucormycosis, conducted at 16 centres across the country, the direct role of Covid was found in causing or worsening diabetes, which may predispose these patients to mucormycosis. Moreover, 18 days after Covid infection in those on high doses of steroids or diabetes, mucormycosis was detected. The study was recently published in the reputed, “Emerging Infectious Disease Journal,” a journal of CDC, Atlanta, US as “Multicenter Epidemiologic Study of Coronavirus Disease associated Mucormycosis, India.” A retrospective observational study was conducted during September 1 and December 31, 2020. Data was collected from AIIMS, New Delhi, Sir Gangaram Hospital, Delhi, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram, AIIMS Bhopal, Apollo Hyderabad, St John’s hospital, Bangalore and other hospitals in Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai, Coimbatore and Lucknow, for all confirmed mucormycosis cases among patients with and without Covid. Among 287 mucormycosis patients, 187 (65.2%) had Covid associated mucormycosis (CAM). The researches found that there was a 2.1-fold rise in mucormycosis during the study period compared with September-December 2019. The most common sites of infection were found to be the nose, with eye involvement (in 58% cases) followed by nose with eye and brain involvement (27% cases) and then lung infection (9% cases). “It shows a considerable number of patients reported late to the hospital after the disease progression to the brain. Besides facial pain, nasal blockage and discharge; toothache and loosening of teeth were seen in a high number of cases for the first time,” said Prof Arunaloke Chakrabarti, corresponding author of the study and the head, department of medical microbiology, PGIMER. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying disease among CAM and non-CAM patients. Covid was the only underlying disease in 32.6% of CAM patients. The mucormycosis case-fatality rate at 12 weeks was 45.7% but was similar for CAM and non-CAM patients. Age, rhino-orbital-cerebral involvement and intensive care unit admission were associated with increased mortality rates. In patients with CAM, newly-detected diabetes mellitus was more frequent compared to non-CAM cases (20.9% versus 10%). In fact, patients with diabetic ketoacidosis developed CAM early, in less than eight days of Covid-19. On the other hand, those patients who developed CAM later had mostly received steroid treatment. It was seen that inappropriate use of steroids (63.3%) either in very high doses or use in patients who did not need it was associated with development of late CAM, that is, more than eight days after Covid-19 diagnosis. Among 187 CAM cases, 61 (32.6%) had Covid as the only underlying disease; 13 of those cases were not treated with glucocorticoid or other immunomodulatory therapies. Whether Covid itself causes immune dysregulation and predisposes patients to invasive mucormycosis remains an unproven possibility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/study-finds-direct-link-between-covid-diabetes-mucor/articleshow/83291843.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Chandigarh||City gym owners, hold employees protest demanding reopening soon||Chandigarh: Demanding re-opening of gyms, workers, trainers and owners of various gyms, situated in the city and in surrounding areas, held a protest at Matka Chowk in Chandigarh on Sunday. Gym owners said they were in deep financial troubles and if gyms are not re-opened soon, they would be forced to shut down. “I am paying huge amount for this place I have taken on rent in a market. But there has been no income for over two months now. How am I supposed to pay the rent and also give salaries to the staff?” said Jabir Singh, who runs a gym in Sector 22, Chandigarh. Singh said most of the gyms in Chandigarh and Punjab are in dire straits. “Most gyms are on the verge of closure. The government must order to re-open them to save not only the gym owners but also the staff and the trainers,” added Singh. The gyms were closed some more than two months ago due to surge in the Covid cases and also in the number of deaths. According to the protestors, now that they cases have come down, the government should extend the relaxations, already given to shops, to gyms as well. “Mohali recently extended shop timings and lifted the even-odd restrictions and even Chandigarh has been quite sympathetic to the cause of the shopkeepers. But it seems no one is listening to us,” said Eklawya, who works as a gym trainer in Sector 8. “I have not got any salary for two months now. I have already started looking for some other job, finding which as you know won’t be an easy task,” added Eklawya. The protestors also raised the issue of the alleged suicide by Nikhil Mehta, a gym trainer, last week. Mehta had allegedly committed suicide after had been jobless for some months now due to closure of gyms. Later, the gym owners and trainers of Punjab Gym Welfare Society met Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu and gave him a memorandum of their demands. “The health minister has assured us that the gyms would be reopened soon,” said society in a statement. Gym owners and trainers had also held a protest in Zirakpur on June 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/city-gym-owners-hold-employees-protest-demanding-reopening-soon/articleshow/83293190.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kerala: BJP leadership supports K Surendran, criticizes CPM||KOCHI: The BJP leadership has said that the state government was using the Kodakara highway robbery case to harass the party state president K Surendran. The BJP leaders told a news conference in Kochi on Sunday that the party would stand united behind Surendran and face the case. BJP former state president Kummanam Rajasekharan said that the CPM was engaged in vendetta politics by summoning the BJP state president’s family members for questioning. “One of the factors which forced the CPM to do this is the conviction that the former speaker and an ex-minister had been quizzed in connection with the gold smuggling case and the investigating agencies are going ahead with the probe. The chief minister’s office is still in the shadow of suspicion. C M Raveendran, who was questioned in connection with the case, still continues in the chief minister’s office,” Rajasekharan said. The BJP leaders also alleged that Surendran’s son was dragged into the Kodakara heist case as a bid to take revenge against arresting Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s son for drug trafficking case. Muslim appeasement is another reason behind the move. Both the LDF and the UDF are apprehensive about the increasing mass base of BJP among Hindu and Christian communities. The case is that a person (Dharmarajan), who distributes election materials for BJP, has lodged a police complaint that he lost money. Police, who should have nabbed those who looted the money, are trying to link the complainant with BJP leaders. This proves whether it is Pinarayi Vijayan or Narendra Modi who misuse investigating agencies for political purposes, the BJP leaders said. “The investigating agency examining the call list of the accused while probing a case is quite normal. In the Kodakara case, police are examining the call list of the complainant and it is strange,” said Union minister of state for external and political affairs V Muraleedharan. All those who were held, except one, have links with the CPM. He asked whether the police are not taking the call list of the accused as it may prove the link with the higher-ups in the LDF. They alleged that the probe was being stage-managed by the chief minister’s office. “The BJP leaders will appear before the investigating agency with their heads held high. Police are conducting the probe into the areas where it has no powers. It will be good for the officials “who are slaves of the ruling party” to remember the plight of those who probed ISRO spy case,” they said. Meanwhile, the BJP core committee meeting, which was scheduled to be held at a hotel in Kochi, was shifted to the party district committee office following police serving a notice to the hotelier asking that no such meetings should be allowed in the wake of Covid-19 situation. SIT dismisses BJP leaders’ charges: The police team probing the Kodakara highway heist case has refuted the allegations of the BJP leaders that the probe is focussed entirely only tracing the contacts of the complainants, and not on the accused. They also declined to comment on the reports that they will question K S Harikrishnan, the son of BJP state president K Surendran. “We have arrested 21 people by tracking the contacts of one or two people who were nabbed initially. Only four or five accused may have directly participated in the looting, and we have nabbed the rest of the accused who were associated with them in different ways. The investigation is not complete and there are possibilities of tracking more contacts of the accused,” said a senior officer in the special investigating (SIT) team. The SIT sources have identified that Dharmarajan, the complainant in the case, had spoken to Harikrishnan over phone a couple of times. However, they have not yet decided whether to call him for questioning. They also said Dharmarajan has disclosed to them that he was involved in some other transactions with the BJP leaders . BJP to revitalize party: The core committee of BJP, which met in Kochi on Sunday, decided to revitalize the party in the state up to the grassroots level. It also decided to start agitations against the state government. Muraleedharan said that government will take steps to bring back the bodies of Malayali nurses who were killed in an accident in Saudi Arabia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bjp-leadership-supports-surendran-criticizes-cpm/articleshow/83290669.cms||---

A company from Malta has offered to supply doses of the Russian Covid vaccine, Sputnik. Pharma Regulatory Services has offered 60 million doses after a global tender floated by Haryana. Each dose will be priced at Rs1,120. “This is the diligent way to go about it,” said ACS, health Rajiv Arora. “You see, heavy cost and factors like timely delivery and other issues are involved. Even as the company has offered an expression of interest, we cannot move forward without adequate verification. Hence, we are carrying out this exercise before proceeding further. That’s why we are routing it through Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Government of India,’’ said an official involved in the process of procurement. According to information, the communication was consequent to the offer made by the company. As the matter reached the CMO, senior officials advised verification of the company. “We had recently floated a global tender for Covid-19 vaccine in response to which we have received a letter of intent from a Malta based firm by the name of Pharma Regulatory Services Limited. You are requested to help us verify the credentials of the company,”the letter read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/check-maltese-firm-offering-sputnik-hry/articleshow/83291849.cms||Manvir Saini

---||Pune||Pune district reports 128 new cases of fungal disease last week||PUNE: A total of 128 Covid-recovered patients were diagnosed with mucormycosis in Pune district last week, a report by the district administration has said. The total number of cases of the invasive fungal infection has gone up to 801 in the last two months. Of these, 61 patients have succumbed. A total of 204 patients have recovered. Data showed that 536 patients are currently undergoing treatment at various hospitals in the district, with key anti-mucormycosis drugs such as amphotericin B still in short supply. “Doctors have been grappling with widespread shortages of oral anti-fungal tablets and conventional amphotericin, in addition to the chronic scarcity of liposomal amphotericin B injection,” said ENT surgeon Rajeev Yende. Until recently, doctors were relying on lipid emulsion or conventional amphotericin B and oral anti-fungal tablets to overcome shortages of liposomal amphotericin B. “But these basic drugs, including oral tablets such as posaconazole, are also now scarce,” said maxillofacial surgeon JB Garde. Oral tablets such as posaconazole reduce the need for amphotericin. “Besides posaconazole, there’s an isavuconazole capsule which is effective. But it is expensive and again, difficult to get,” said another doctor. Posaconazole prevents fungi from producing a substance called ergosterol, which is a component of fungal cell membranes. Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (Pune) said, “A sharp spike in mucormycosis cases has triggered the drug shortages. We are trying to sort it out. There are quite a few Indian firms producing oral posaconazole tablets.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-reports-128-new-cases-of-fungal-disease/articleshow/83291859.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The undertaking will be allowed to operate buses with 100% occupancy. At the same time, queues are also expected at bus stops as BEST will not allow standees to travel in buses although it will ferry more passengers than it did last week. “With suburban trains still being denied to several office-goers, shop workers etc, they will depend entirely on BEST for transportation,” said a senior official. Sources said that the ridership is likely to increase from 9 lakh daily to nearly 18 lakh in the next few days. Sources said there are plans to operate double deckers on Express highways. Although BEST spokesperson Manoj Varade said that the maximum fleet will be on roads, committee member Sunil Ganacharya was skeptical. “The fleet size of BEST’s own buses has dropped to 1,995 while it has 1,250 buses on wet lease. How will it cater to the rush of citizens? There could be chaos at bus stops if there is no proper planning,” he feared. Newly appointed general manager Lokesh Chandra took stock of the situation and has directed officials to provide maximum services to commuters from Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-ridership-likely-to-double-after-city-unlocks/articleshow/83293249.cms||Somit Sen
---||Kochi||Delhi hospital withdraws controversial circular||KOTTAYAM: A government-run hospital in Delhi had to withdraw a controversial order, which banned on duty Keralite nursing staff from talking in Malayalam, within 24 hours due to a high-octane social media campaign by nurses and the Malayali community in the capital. The Aam Aadmi Party-led government sensed danger as the campaign gained momentum and directed the hospital to withdraw the order. The order issued on Saturday evening by the nursing superintendent of GB Pant Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research was withdrawn on Sunday morning after many leaders– including Rahul Gandhi, Shashi Tharoor and K C Venugopal – tweeted their support for the protesting nurses. The medical superintendent issued a circular which stated that the earlier order ‘issued without instructions or knowledge of the hospital administration and Delhi government stands withdrawn, with immediate effect’. Unlike the earlier circular that was not marked to higher authorities, the copy of the new circular was marked to all higher authorities, including the health minister and the principal secretary of Delhi. The circular issued by the 800-bed non-Covid hospital stated: A complaint was received that Malayalam was used for communication at workplace where maximum patients and colleagues don’t know the language. So all nursing personnel must talk in Hindi and English or action will be taken. Malayali nurses then held a Google meet by 9.30pm on Saturday with leaders of various nurses association in Delhi. An action committee was formed and a Twitter campaign was planned. Action committee member Fameer C K, also the secretary of AIIMS nurses’ union, said though this was the first written circular issued with regard to speaking Malayalam, Keralite nurses in Delhi have been facing ‘racism’. “For some, we are Madrasis. The problem is related to this. But nobody wants to speak about it. It is not right to ban a language in a metro like Delhi where people who speak different languages reside. A majority of the nurses are working after cancelling their leaves during the pandemic and instead of appreciation, the superintendent issued this circular,” he said. Committee member Jeemol Shaji said the superintendent must apologize. She is the acting nursing superintendent and who gave her rights to issue the circular without discussing it with anyone, she said. Anessh Babu, a staff at the hospital, said there were no complaints about speaking in Malayalam. Joldin Francis, secretary of UNA Delhi unit, said all Malayali nurses association and Malayali organizations jointly came out in protest. Additional general secretary K J Tony said Delhi Malayali Association office-bearers spoke to chief secretaries of Kerala and Delhi after the circular was issued. “ After the new circular was issued, CM Pinarayi Vijayan wrote on FB that a government institution picking Malayalam language from several other languages in the country and issuing an order against using it is an encroachment over our diversity. Dividing employees in the name of language and culture is unbecoming of a modern society. The CM also commended authorities for withdrawing the controversial order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/delhi-hosp-withdraws-controversial-circular/articleshow/83290682.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

While BJP is facing the challenge of proving the popularity of its government, Congress is facing the challenge of showing that since the 2017 assembly election and 2019 parliamentary election, it has managed to consolidate its position. After the death of BJP MLA from Jubbal-Kotkhai in Shimla district, Narinder Bragata, another assembly seat has fallen vacant in the hill state. Byelections will now be held at three places. Fatehpur assembly seat of Kangra fell vacant following the demise of Congress MLA Sujan Singh Pathania while Mandi parliamentary seat fell vacant after the death of BJP MP Ramswaroop Sharma. A day before the demise of Narinder Bragta at PGI, Chandigarh, BJP’s Core Committee met in Chandigarh to discuss the issue of bypolls on Fatehpur assembly seat and Mandi parliamentary seat. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur attended this meeting. In the state, preparations were on to hold byelections to Fatehpur and Mandi seats and now Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly seat has also fallen vacant. On Monday, election commission officials will hold a virtual meeting with state chief secretary to discuss bypolls. Even if the state assembly does not notify the vacancy of Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly area, the chief secretary is likely to inform election commission officials about it. BJP had won the Mandi parliamentary seat in 2019 by a huge victory margin of 4,05,459 votes. BJP’s Ram Swaroop Sharma secured 6,47,189 votes to defeat Congress’s Aashray Sharma, who could secure only 2,41,730 votes. In 2014 and 2019, BJP won all four parliamentary seats of Mandi, Kangra, Shimla and Hamirpur while Congress failed to even open its account. In Kangra district, former Congress minister Sujan Singh Pathania won from Fatehpur assembly seat in 2017. Bypoll is due there following his demise. Since 2003, both the Congress and BJP have won from Jubbal-Kotkhai seat in turn. In the 2003 election, Congress’s Rohit Thakur had won this seat by a margin of 6,844 votes. In the 2007 election, BJP’s Narinder Bragta won this seat by a margin of 2,824 votes. In the 2012 election, Rohit Thakur again won this seat by a margin of 9,095 votes while in the 2017 election, Bragta won this seat by a margin of 1,062 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/bypolls-on-3-seats-in-hp-bjp-cong-face-litmus-test/articleshow/83296811.cms||---

---||Delhi||First day sees more focus on awareness than enforcement||New Delhi: As markets and offices opened on Monday after 48 days of lockdown, district authorities kept a strict vigil to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour at public places. On day one, the focus was more on awareness than enforcement. According to sources, around 250 enforcement teams have been trained to be deployed by district authorities to keep a hawk eye on markets, malls, office complexes and other public places. “On Monday, we focussed more on dissemination of information and creating awareness than stringent penalising, which will start in the next couple of days,” said a district official. Another official said there were a lot of queries on Monday regarding timings allowed for private offices. According to Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) order, private offices were allowed to function with 50% strength between 9am and 5pm. The staff would have to show a valid authority letter and identity card issued by their employer or company. “Many people who have private offices were confused about the timings and the clause that they were allowed to open only till 5pm. Monday also saw many rounds of meetings with market welfare associations and malls,” an official said. While private offices are allowed to open from 9am to 5pm, markets can be open from 10am to 8pm. Apart from district magistrates, DDMA had also made district deputy commissioner of police, deputy labour commissioner and market trade associations responsible to ensure compliance with rules. “Apart from markets and offices, we will keep a vigil near liquor shops, which the authorities feel might see overcrowding. In case social distancing is not maintained at these places, they will be closed,” the official said. The authorities were also trying to ensure people wore masks, maintained social distancing, washed hands and used sanitsers at all offices and market complexes. To maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour at public places, enforcement teams would ensure there was no spitting or consumption of liquor, pan, gutkha, tobacco etc. at these places, the DDMA order stated. Not only were offices and shops liable to be closed if norms were not maintained and these were seen as a public health hazard, the owner of the office and shopkeepers were also liable for criminal prosecution under relevant laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/first-day-sees-more-focus-on-awareness-than-enforcement/articleshow/83322303.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kochi||Kerala: Local self-governing department heads to draft guidelines for survey||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has begun preliminary work towards identifying families suffering from extreme poverty in the state. The government has entrusted additional chief secretary (ACS), local self-governing department (LSGD) and principal secretary (urban) to draft the guidelines for the survey to be carried out for enlisting the number of families under extreme poverty category in the state. The government has announced in the state budget of a micro plan for extreme poverty eradication in the state. Approximately five lakh families are expected to be included in this category. The government plans to collect accurate data of these families so that corresponding plans shall be executed. ACS LSGD Sarada Muraleedharan said that consultation with experts has begun. “We are in the process of finalizing consultations with experts in this area to derive parameters and methodology in identifying families reeling from extreme poverty. Over the years, Kerala has done well in reducing poverty in the state, still a lot of families are marginalized and this is our last mile, which is also challenging,” said Muraleedharan. ACS LSGD and PS (urban) will finalize the guidelines and submit it to the state cabinet for final approval. Once this approval is received, mode of survey will be decided. In his budget speech, former finance minister T M Thomas Isaac had quoted the Reserve Bank of India statistics of 2011 and said that the percentage of people living below poverty line in Kerala was only 11.3%. He said that the national average is 22% and though the official statistics after 2011 is not available, it might have been reduced to 56% in Kerala, by this decade, that is almost 4 to 5 lakh families. He had stressed the need for specific family-based micro plans to identify such families. According to the budget document, prior to the implementation of the micro plan, a priority list will be prepared by conducting a state-level survey based on distress factors among the existing Ashraya beneficiaries and the newly-nominated families by LSGDs and Kudumbashree.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lsgd-heads-to-draft-guidelines-for-survey/articleshow/83290687.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The Shikrapur police on Saturday found the victim’s body near a dairy at Talegaon Dhamdhere in Shirur. The victim was bludgeoned to death with stones. The police initially did not have any clues to ascertain the victim’s identity. “We shared photographs via different social media platforms and identified that the victim was from Pabal village,” an officer from the Pune rural police said. He said that the police also got information that the victim had heated arguments with a person recently. “We detained the person for questioning. He then revealed that he killed the man as the latter was harassing and stalking his wife for the past few days,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-held-for-bludgeoning-man-to-death/articleshow/83291911.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Talking to TOI, Jain said, “It was an emergency, as my pet Britney, was very unwell and therefore had to be immediately taken to a vet in Khar from DN Nagar in Andheri during the lockdown period. While many of the Ola drivers I had booked cancelled the rides on seeing the dog with me, one of the drivers was very rude and ruthless as he coldly told me ‘Marne do usko, main kya karu’. I wanted to ask him if he would say the same with a human.” Jain added that she had also taken a blanket/bedsheet along so that taxi seats will not get dirty. Yet, she had to suffer. “Britney is recovering now, as I somehow manage to transport her. However, I want to know what action Ola will take on such uncouth and stone cold drivers who did not budge even after seeing my pet crying in pain. I may also take legal action against them if the cab company does nothing about it,” said Jain. When TOI contacted an Ola spokesperson, she stated, “We regret this unfortunate incident. The decision to allow a pet in the vehicle is with the driver. This is because some of them may be afraid of pets or have allergies. However, we will definitely take strong measures to ensure more sensitivity and empathy to avoid such behaviour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-let-your-dog-die-rude-ola-driver-tells-shocked-pet-owner/articleshow/83293291.cms||Vijay Singh

A division bench comprising justices K Vinod Chandran and M R Anitha gave the order after considering an appeal filed by Indus Towers Ltd. The court said ‘cell on wheels’ is intended to provide coverage when the construction of a permanent tower is continuing on the basis of a valid building permit. Building permit for constructing a permanent tower at Manappilly near Ayyampilly in Ernakulam was stayed by tribunal for local self-government institutions and a single bench had refused to interfere. The appellant then sought permission for installation of a ‘cell on wheels’ and contended before the division bench that it does not require a building permit. Stating that the court cannot agree to such an argument, the bench pointed out that the objection of nearby residents is not confined to construction or the structural facility but also on the operation of the tower in the area. Agreeing with the single bench’s decision not to issue an order in favour of the appellant, the division bench said in the judgment, “Otherwise, whenever a building permit is declined or interfered with by a competent court, the telecom operator or their service provider could install a mobile tower so as to get over the objection of the nearby residents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cant-bypass-court-stay-on-mobile-tower-work/articleshow/83290683.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Surgeons find a way to make mucor care 100 times cheaper||PUNE: Careful tracking of blood creatinine levels can do away with expensive mucormycosis medication, treating surgeons have found. The liposomal form of the amphotericin injection — a key drug against the infection — can cost a patient Rs 35,000 every day. The conventional form of the drug costs just Rs 350 per day, but needs to be given carefully with a blood test every alternate day to rule out drug toxicity in the kidneys. If creatinine levels are raised, the 21-day course of the drug can be finished with two to three “pit stops”, also called “amphotericin holidays”, to allow the body to normalise levels. Creatinine is a waste product that is channeled out of the system via the kidneys. The efficacy is equal for both the expensive and cheaper forms of amphotericin. But the conventional form (the cheaper version) should not be given to patients with significant comorbidities, including renal failure and diabetic ketoacidosis. In the rest, conventional amphotericin can effectively arrest spread of mucormycosis. All doctors need to do is strictly monitor blood creatinine levels and clear damaged tissue, experts said. ENT surgeon Samir Joshi said, “Liposomal amphotericin is no doubt safer than the conventional one and everyone would want the safer version. But there is no difference in efficacy in both forms of the drug.” Joshi, head of the ENT department at BJ Medical College and Sassoon Hospital, has treated about 201 patients with post-Covid mucormycosis. “More than 85% of them recovered through monitored use of conventional amphotericin and careful debridement surgeries. Their long-term follow-ups will consolidate this success rate,” he said. Before Covid, Joshi had treated 65 mucormycosis cases using conventional amphotericin. “Of them, 63 patients recovered,” he said. Joshi said unwarranted concerns, that conventional amphotericin causes kidney damage, has led to “hyped demand” for the drug's liposomal form. “It is the fear of kidney damage in minds of people and physicians that has led to overrating of the liposomal form. Careful monitoring with blood creatinine and few other tests can tide over this risk and allow effective use of conventional amphotericin,” Joshi said. In fact, it is the combined use of amphotericin with surgery that does the trick. Surgery removes dead and necrotic tissues. Amphotericin then arrests advancing fungus in adjacent live tissue. “Both are essential and complementary to each other,” Joshi said. Sandeep Karmarkar, ENT surgeon with Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “Debridement (clearance) of all affected tissues is vital. Only after thorough removal can the drug reach the target site.”  Currently, neither conventional nor liposomal amphotericin is available easily as supply is limited. “Liposomal amphotericin B is non-toxic, causes fewer electrolyte changes, higher dosages can be given within a short period of time and tissue penetration is better. Only disadvantage is it’s costlier than conventional amphotericin and beyond the reach of many,” Karmarkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tracking-creatinine-levels-in-blood-key-to-cheaper-mucor-care/articleshow/83291933.cms||Umesh Isalkar

However, so far, the government has not responded to the demands. One of the demands was calling a special two-day session of the state legislature to discuss the Maratha reservation issue. Sambhajiraje, after performing rituals at the Raigad fort on the occasion of the coronation ceremony of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, said: “Henceforth, I will take an aggressive stand no matter what happens. I met every major leader before laying out the demands. However, there has been no assurance so far from the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. We don’t want to get into a blame game for the loss of reservation. We want justice for the Maratha community. I have decided to start the protest from Kolhapur on June 16. More protests will then be held at every district headquarters across the state.”Sambhajiraje’s other demand, made on the behalf of the Sakal Maratha Samaj, was immediate issuance of joining order to more than 2,000 Maratha youths who had secured government jobs before the interim stay on the reservation came into effect in September 2020.He also demanded benefits for the Maratha community on the lines of benefits given to other backward category (OBC) students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sambhajiraje-plans-maratha-quota-protest-in-kolhapur/articleshow/83286578.cms||---

This was disclosed by PWD minister P A Mohammed Riyas on Sunday after visiting the tunnel construction site along with revenue minister K Rajan and minister for higher education R Bindu. Riyas said that the government was giving high priority for completing the construction of the tunnels and opening them for traffic. Steps would be taken to open at least one of the tunnels at the earliest possible, he said. The tunnels are being constructed on the Mannuthy- Vadakkencherry stretch of the national highway linking Kerala to Tami Nadu and other states. The contract for the six-laning of the 28.5-km road and the construction of the twin tunnels was awarded in August 2009, and its work was started around 2012. Each of the twin tunnels will be one km in length and one of them will carry the traffic from Thrissur to Palakkad, while the other will be for the traffic in the opposite direction. The delay in the construction was causing disastrous traffic blocks and accidents on this artery of the Kerala’s road network. Riyas said the government was aware of the lapses in the construction of the tunnel and steps would be taken to open at least one of the tunnels after holding talks with the contracting company representatives and officials. Minister Rajan, who is also the MLA from the area, said there was no point in relying on promises of the company officials, as they were going back on their words in the past. They had given assurances in the past even to the Union ministers to complete the work quickly and have ditched them, Rajan said. Rajan said steps would be taken to broaden the existing road at Kuthiran by one metre soon, and this would be helpful in easing the traffic during the monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cm-to-hold-meeting-on-tuesday/articleshow/83290705.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Tohana standoff intensifies: 1 FIR yet to be withdrawn, 2 still in jail||Hisar: The standoff between farm activists and Haryana government in Tohana town of Haryana’s Fatehabad district intensified on Sunday, even as JJP MLA Devendra Babli had a day before apologised to the farmers and withdrawn complaints in two FIRs registered at Tohana police station. In the latest showdown, farmers gathered around Tohana Sadar police station on Sunday to seek the withdrawal of a third FIR and release of two SKM activists, Ravi Azad and Vikas Sisar, arrested in connection with the case. The third FIR has been registered on a complaint by a police personnel, so government permission is required for withdrawing it. Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is spearheading protests against the three farm laws passed by the Centre last year, described Babli’s apology as “perfunctory”, or insincere. The three FIRs had been registered after a clash had taken place between the Tohana MLA’s staff and farm activists. While the MLA alleged that farm activists pelted stones at his vehicle and injured his private secretary, farmers have accused the legislator of using profanities for them. SKM said an appeal had been made to farm unions across Haryana to surround all police stations by staging protests on Monday to pressure the government to withdraw the FIRs and release its arrested activists. It has also appealed to farmers from Sirsa, Fatehabad, Jind and Hisar to assemble in large numbers at Tohana Sadar police station. On Saturday, SKM leader Yogendra Yadav met district administration officials on behalf of farmers and held meetings which lasted four hours, but to no avail. Farm leaders have appealed to activists to start camping at Tohana Sadar police staton, like the protests on the borders of Delhi, by parking tractor-trolleys and building huts in front of the police station. BKU Haryana (Charuni) gave a call to allf armers protest outside all the police stations in Haryana up to 4 pm on Monday. The message has also been circulated in the district-level groups of farm union and the farmers would be protesting outside the police stations in Haryana. On Saturday, Babli apologised to farmers and said he had forgiven those who hurt him. After this, the way was cleared for the cancellation of the two FIRs registered at Tohana City police station. However, the FIR at Tohana Sadar police station was registered on June 3 and now require’s the government’s consent. Farmers had started talks with the administration from Saturday night, but the deadlock is yet to be broken. As per sources in district administration, there was no possibility of a solution on a Sunday as the matter was directly related to the government. Fatehabad deputy commissioner Narhari Singh Bangar said talks were going on with farmers. Sources in Fatehabad district administration said the dismissal of the FIR registered at Tohana Sadar police station was similar to the case in Hisar, where a similar case was withdraw. In that case, however, farmer leaders promised not to indulge in violence in future. In Fatehabad, if the police had not reached the house of JJP MLA Devendra Babli, there could have been violence, said the sources. “When farm leaders did not live up to the promises made earlier, how can they believe them now?” said sources. Case can be withdrawn under section 321 of CrPC There is a provision in Section 321 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to withdraw such cases. On behalf of the government, the district attorney, deputy district attorney or assistant district attorney can file an application in the court and then the court decides on it at its discretion. Under this provision, the FIR lodged against many, including Hisar MLA Kamal Gupta (the FIR lodged during the demonstration at Jindal House during the Congress government), was withdrawn by the government. Apart from this, police can also file a closure report in the court after its investigation Court grants bail to Vikas and Ravi but not accept bail bonds Tohana Sadar police station in-charge Vinod Kumar said the bail plea of both accused farm activists Vikas Sirsar and Ravi Azad has been granted by Tohana court, but they had not been able to deposit the bail bond due to which both were in jail. He could not give more information about the case.

Tthe DMK would work to make all the 22 languages including Tamil in the Constitution’s eighth schedule get such a status. In a statement, Stalin recalled the efforts of his father and former chief minister M Karunanidhi to get the “classical status” for the language. While an official announcement was made on June 6, 2004, a government notification was issued on October 12, 2004, Stalin said in his statement. The status of a classical language was the right honour for the Tamil language. “DMK will continue to work to spread the reach of the Tamil language. It will also work towards making all the languages that are part of the eighth schedule to become the official and administrative language of the Union government,” Stalin said. “We have been insisting and working towards this since 2004. Not only Tamil, but all the 22 languages that are part of the eighth schedule, to be made the official and administrative language of the Union government,” DMK Rajya Sabha MP and party spokesman T K S Elangovan told TOI. PMK founder S Ramadoss condemned All India Radio for airing all programmes in its Chennai digital transmission service in Hindi. Ramadoss alleged this was Hindi imposition and demanded that only Tamil programmes be transmitted from the Chennai station. In tweets on Sunday, Ramadoss said Tamil programmes are neglected in AIR’s digital transmission channel from Chennai, DRM 783KHz. Digital radio transmission is a modern radio technology and an alternative to FM channels. Rather than airing Tamil programmes using the technology, Hindi is being thrust, he alleged. Condemning Prasar Bharti and AIR, he demanded that Hindi programmes are stopped immediately and Tamil programmes and Tamil news be aired in the channel. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stalin-will-make-tamil-official-language-at-centre/articleshow/83290686.cms||D Govardan

---||Delhi||Delhi: No queues or chaos at liquor shops this time||NEW DELHI: Unlike the previous Unlock phase last year, no serpentine queues, fights or chaos were seen outside liquor shops on Monday morning, when the shutters opened after a gap of over 1.5 months. Some outlets opened on an odd-even basis, but did not have stock of popular brands, while others were seen carrying out maintenance work with their shutters half open. At one of the shops, the staff said that when they would open next on Wednesday, their stock would be replenished. While through the day barely 5-10 people were seen outside many shops, by the evening, footfall started to grow in locations like Gole Market. The wine and beer shop in Savitri Complex near Greater Kailash was closed, but the outlet in Kohinoor Mall was open. “We are closed for the day, but the shop is operating smoothly at the other nearby location in Kohinoor Mall, which is also owned by the same operator,” said a staff member. The liquor shop near Hauz Khas Metro station in August Kranti Marg intersection was open with barely 3-4 people around. A disappointed Sadhu Sharma said the shop did not have any of the brands he wanted. The staff said they had not been able to replenish their stock since the lockdown and were selling leftover brands they had available. A similar situation prevailed at shop 1A in DDA shopping centre phase-2 Munirka, where regular brands had run out of stock. Rakesh Mewati, a customer, said only expensive brands were available. “We will have to wait for a few more days for the situation to normalise. The lockdown was much longer last year and the liquor shops in Noida and Gurgaon have opened only sometime back in the current lockdown,” he added. The staff at several liquor shops said many customers had been enquiring about home delivery option, but they had no idea when that would start. The two liquor vends near Capital Court in RK Puram were open, but reported a similar problem of low stock. Several shops, including those along Vikas Marg, were closed, while shops in Mayur Vihar Phase-1 Acharya Niketan barely had a couple of customers around noon. Many sites reportedly had increased footfall by evening, but the situation remained under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-queues-or-chaos-at-liquor-shops-this-time/articleshow/83322391.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Use DSR technique to manage hard crust in paddy fields: PAU expert||Crop Talk An expert of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana has advised farmers to manage ‘krand’ (hard crust) in the paddy sown using direct seeded rice (DSR) technique. M S Bhullar, head, department of agronomy, College of Agriculture, PAU, said, “If rainfall occurs after sowing and before emergence of crop seedling, ‘krand’ formation occurs in all field crops, including direct seeded rice. ‘Krand’ refers to the formation of hard crust on soil surface, which prevents emergence of crop seedling.” There is, however, no need to panic, he assured, advising farmers to visit their fields regularly and personally after rainfall. Bhullar said, “As and when soil surface gets dry, crust formation starts, which needs to be broken immediately.” Krand can be broken using two methods, he said. First, in fields where rice seed has not germinated or the seedlings have not yet come near the soil surface, ‘krand’ can be broken with ‘sarian (iron rods) waali krandi’ or ‘jaal’ or with rice seed drill (which was used for sowing). ‘Krandi’ or drill must be operated at a shallow depth, which is sufficient to break hard crust and does not disturb the seed/seedlings below, he said. Second, in fields where seedlings are ready to emerge but have been prevented by hard crust, or some seedlings have already emerged while others are below, Krand can be broken by hand operated krandi (with care) or by application of light irrigation to keep upper surface soft for easy emergence of seedlings, he said. ‘Krand’ broken at the right time and using the right method, depending on the condition of rice seed/seedlings in the field, did not pose any problem for seedling emergence, Bhullar said. At times, seedlings come out in a moist field on their own after rainfall. So, as long as the surface soil is soft and moist, farmers need not be in a hurry to run krandi/drill or apply irrigation, he said. Sowing rice with Modified Lucky Seed Drill (with press wheels) also helps in solving krand problem, he stated. Attached wheel presses the area in between crop rows, which becomes deeper and in case of rainfall after sowing, the soil from the inter row area does not move in the crop rows, which prevents/reduces krand formation, he said. Bhullar stressed on sowing paddy seeds at 1.0-1.5 inches depth so that it becomes easier for seedlings to come out. Farmers must keep themselves updated about prevailing weather and if there is a prediction of rain within 2-3 days, it is better to postpone sowing to save the crop from krand, he advised. Agriweather The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast rise in maximum temperatures by 3-5 degrees Celsius over most parts of northwest India during the next 3-4 days. Weather is expected to remain dry in both Punjab and Haryana till June 10 as per the met department forecast. For detailed weather information, call 1800-220-161.

---||Chennai||Kids are taking stock… and how||Chennai: When her son turned nine this year, Preethi Rao felt it was time she had a talk with him about the bulls and bears, and the big bad world of investing.Rao decided to use the just launched board game Big Bull Junior to introduce her son to the stock market. "It’s important to educate children on finances and investments. It’s math in practice, where you learn to use the numbers to grow your money," says Rao, associate director at LEAD at Krea University. "Once he begins to understand trading, we will help him get into real-time stocks," says the Chennai-based woman.While Rao has taken the gaming route, in New Delhi, Utsav Goyal learned his lessons by diving headfirst into the stock market. After studying how to trade in Class XI, when he turned 18, Goyal opened a Demat and trading account and bought stocks and shares with his pocket money savings of `7,000. Under the Securities and Exchange Board of India rules, a demat and trading account can be opened only at the age of 18 (until then parents can open and manage accounts for their children)."My dad then gave me capital and I did a little more serious trading. I made some money, lost some as well, but I’m still in the game," says the 19-year-old. His biggest lesson, he says, is that patience and perseverance pay off when it comes to stocks. "As a teenager, you tend to be aggressive by nature and rush to buy and sell. But soon enough, you learn to control your emotions if you want to invest. I see it as a life lesson from the stock market."The markets too are taking stock of the young. According to a Forbes report, retail brokerage firm Zerodha recorded about 70% of its investors in the 20-30 age group. Another virtual stock broking firm, 5paisa.com, saw investors aged 18-35 climb to a little over 80%.While parents continue to be the main source of education about finances for their kids, social media too is fuelling teen interest. Goyal, for instance, says many of his friends are showing interest in trading because of social media influencers. A recently released survey from financial services company Wells Fargo & Company reported that about a third of teens between 13 and 17 years said social media was their source of information on investments.Social media and stock market apps such as Trading 212 that allow under-18s to bet on stocks using virtual wealth in several thousands of pounds are making waves. Trading 212 has stopped onboarding new clients because of unprecedented demand.Meme stocks — which is basically a stock that has seen an increase in volume more because of social media hype than because of the company’s performance — has made making investments trendy among teenagers. Recently, popular meme stock GameStop saw its prices skyrocketing thanks to an online forum.HowTheMarketWorks, a free stock market game that allows users to create their own custom stock game, receiving a virtual $100,000 or more to get started, is used by more than 400,000 individuals and in 10,000 college, high school and middle school classrooms.Since its launch in April, replenishment orders for the board game Big Bull Junior game have already begun coming in. "Parents are clearly looking for ways to build financial literacy in their children. And games are the best way to get started," says Philip Royappan, DGM Marketing of Funskool.Chennai-based Santosh Subramanian, the game’s inventor, explains that it serves as a primer on the stock market and allows players to control the value of the different stocks. "One learns to build a portfolio and manipulate the market," he says.After dabbling with stock simulators as a young teen, New Delhi-based Divya Roongta began actively investing her pocket money in stocks, SIPs and digital gold when she turned 18. In 2020, when she was in Class XII, she went further than just investing. She and friend Vrinda Chandra started Finsnap to educate teens on personal finances. "We conduct webinars in schools on investments in stocks, equities, mutual funds, SIPs and so on. Most teens think investing in stock is paisa double.

All through life, we are taught how to make money, but never how to keep it.

---||Pune||Maha move one level up in education performance index||done Pune: From level IV to level III, Maharashtra has progressed in the performance grading index for 2019-20 academic year as against the previous year, riding on improvements in the governance processes and equality in education. The state’s progress in three other parameters such as learning outcome and quality, access to education and infrastructure remained unchanged when compared with 2018-19. The report was released by the Union ministry of education on Sunday. The assessment of the states was conducted based on five indicators — learning outcomes and quality, access, infrastructure and facilities, equity and governance processes. The aim of the performance grading index was to pinpoint the gaps, and accordingly prioritize areas for intervention to ensure that the school education system is robust at every level. At the same time, it is expected to act as a good source of information for best practices followed by states and UTs which can be shared. Former director of education, Vasant Kalpande, said, “Marginal changes in parameters in the sectors like health, achievements always happen when reviewed periodically. This is a natural phenomenon and such statistically insignificant differences don’t need to have any specific reason or explanation.” The survey said the governance process parameters had many states score fewer points. This parameter was an important indicator as it would lead to critical structural reforms in areas ranging from monitoring the attendance of teachers to ensuring a transparent recruitment of teachers and principals. Headmistress of a civic school in the city, Hema Mane, said, “It is common knowledge that shortage of teachers and principals and administrative staff, lack of regular supervision and inspection, inadequate training of the teachers, timely availability of finances are some of the factors plaguing the education system. Through the PGI, the shortfalls can be measured objectively and regularly. This is crucial for taking necessary steps to eliminate the gaps.” The survey report said in the case of learning outcomes, it has been observed that, in general, the scores obtained in the higher standards are less than those in the lower standards. It is therefore imperative to ensure better interventions at the lower standards as it will have a positive cascading effect at the higher levels. Indicators like availability of ICT facilities and timely availability of textbooks and uniforms, which are critical inputs for better performance of students and mentioned in the RTE Act, are measured in the infrastructure & facilities domain. Significant shortfalls in these areas have also been captured by the infrastructure Index. Box Performance Against Five Indicators The total weightage under the PGI is 1,000 points with each of the 70 indicators having an assigned weightage of either 10 or 20 points Indicators— total weightage — 2018-19 — 2019-20 Learning outcomes ad quality — 180 — 144 — 144 Access —80 -- 76 — 76 Infrastructure and facilities —150 -- 126 — 126 Equity — 230 — 210 — 224 Governance processes —360 — 246 — 299 About The Index The Performance Grading Index is a tool to provide insights on the status of school education in States and UTs including key levers that drive their performance and critical areas for improvement Grading will allow all the states and Union Territories to occupy the highest level, Grade I, at the same time, which is a sign of fully developed nation||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-move-one-level-up-in-education-performance-index/articleshow/83291963.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Committee members are particularly assisting domestic helps and caregivers, who work in the households, to get the jab for free. “We arranged a vaccination camp for our block residents, where several domestic helps were also given the vaccine for free,” said Narottam Dutta, secretary, Salt Lake BE block Nagarik Sangha. Though the priority goes to the residents of the township, some block committees and local clubs are encouraging the citizens to register the names of their domestic helps. “We are administering the vaccine to domestic helps while the residents are paying for their slots,” said Arunabha Hazra, an executive committee member of CD block citizens council that conducted a vaccination camp on Saturday and Sunday. Several block committees in Salt Lake have already conducted vaccination camps in their community halls with an average of about 500 residents, including domestic helps. “This initiative will help more Salt Lake residents to get vaccinated,” said a Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/block-level-vax-camps-for-salt-lake-locals-domestic-helps/articleshow/83290731.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||India||'Bar on sharing information could have been less harsh'||NEW DELHI: Both serving and former bureaucrats said the amended pension rules, which make it mandatory for retired officers of intelligence and security organisations to seek prior permission for writing or speaking on the domain of their former organisation, could have been made less "harsh" by having a time bar, say of 10 years after retirement, rather than making them applicable for life. A former RAW chief and an ex-home secretary, both reluctant to be named, said while it was a standard practice for intelligence officials of foreign agencies to be barred for a reasonable period after retirement from writing or talking about their experiences and sharing the domain knowledge they gained while working for their former organisations, the amended CCS (Pension) Rules seem to have "taken things a bit too far" by imposing restrictions for the remaining part of a retired officer's life. AS Dulat, who served in RAW and IB and later authored a couple of books, said, "Apply the rule for two years, five years, 10 years or even 20 years after retirement, but not forever." He said the term 'domain of the organisation' was vague. "Who will define what constitutes the domain of an organisation?" he asked. He said the adverse feedback may eventually lead government to modify rules to provide for a "fixed time limitation post-retirement" and also specify what constitutes the "domain of the organisation". He said the head of an intelligence or security organisation was a busy person and couldn't be expected to spend time reading manuscripts. "Clearances could take forever," he told TOI. KM Singh, an ex-IB official, said the rules were "draconian" as they would keep highly experienced officers from sharing good practices and domain knowledge with future generations. Dulat agreed, citing the example of former NSA and IB chief MK Narayanan, who often writes for newspapers. "Given his wide experience, everybody looks up to him. Why should he need prior nod?" he asked. Singh was apprehensive that even if clearance was given, much of the content may be omitted or censored. The 'prior nod' rule is now applicable to even officers of central police organisations like BSF, ITBP etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bar-on-sharing-information-could-have-been-less-harsh/articleshow/83296248.cms||Bharti Jain

Meanwhile, the state government will receive 9,000 vials of liposomal amphothericin B injection on Sunday late night. “These tablets will be supplied to the state in a week’s time. Apart from this, the state government has already issued a purchase order of Rs 59,750 for liposomal amphotericin B. We have also purchased 59 Cresemba tablets - an antifungal drug - which is also an alternate and crucial drug for liposomal amphotericin B. The 20,000 posaconazole tablets will be the second line of treatment for mucormycosis,” said Alok Ranjan, managing director of Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation Limited (RMSCL).According to data received from RMSCL, there are 2,686 cases of black fungus or mucormycosis in the state. Of these, 2404 patients are under treatment and 164 patients have been cured. While there have been 88 deaths due to the fungal infection, 30 patients have left against medical advice (LAMA). Considering the number of black fungus patients under treatment (2404), the state would require 1.4 lakh vials of a substitute for liposomal amphotericin B injections. Ranjan said RMSCL had already placed an order for 10,000 lipid amphotericin injections as an alternative arrangement. The Centre had made an additional allocation of 13,350 vials of liposomal amphothericin B injection. The state government on Saturday received 2,350 vials of the drug via two special aircraft. The state also received 3,000 vials of the drug from Cadila Pharma on Saturday late night. The state will receive 14,350 vials of the drug in 48 hours since the allocation has been made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-places-order-for-20k-posaconazole-tablets/articleshow/83292000.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The children—most of them from the north eastern states—reached Ernakulam by train after the railways started Covid special services from last year-end till April this year. Running away in Covid timesThe officials said some of the children travelled without food for two to three days and had reached the city hiding out of the sight of the railway police on trains. “Some of them suffer from mental disorders. As Ernakulam is the last point of some of the trains from the north east, the runaway children end up here and we rescue them. On asking why they left home, many won’t reveal the reason. They start talking once they are lodged in care homes,” said an official with the child helpdesk, which rescues children reaching Aluva, Ernakulam town and Ernakulam junction railway stations. “Of the 20 children, four were rescued along with their mothers who were forced to leave their homes due to domestic abuse. In some cases, the children were in unsafe conditions as their mothers were found to be suffering from mental health problems, said the official. “We produce the children before the child welfare committee and it sends them to the care home and initiates steps to send them back with assistance from the child welfare committees in their home districts,” he added. In some cases the parents themselves approach the child welfare committees after coming to know about the whereabouts of their children. “Some may be too poor even to buy the train tickets to Kerala. In such cases, we book tickets for them,” the official said. Though personnel belonging to the railway protection force conduct inspections in moving trains, many of these children go unnoticed as they might be sleeping on berths. The official said in some cases they will have to convince the children that they are there to rescue them and not to harm and only then they will go with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/20-children-rescued-from-trains/articleshow/83290740.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||BJP: K Sundara’s allegation part of conspiracy||KOZHIKODE: Close on the heels of the allegation that BJP state president K Surendran gave Rs 10 lakh to Janadhipathya Rashtreeya Party (JRP) chairperson C K Janu, K Sundara, Surendran’s namesake who withdrew his nomination for contesting from Manjeswaram constituency, has also claimed that he was paid Rs 2 lakh and a smart phone in return for his withdrawal. Soon after Sundara’s claim surfaced on Saturday, BJP Kasaragod district president K Sreekanth rubbished the allegation and said that they suspect that Sundara was making these allegations due to the influence exerted by the CPM and the Muslim League as part of a conspiracy against the BJP. Sundara claimed that he was given the money and the phone soon after he withdrew the nomination papers against Surendran who lost by a mere 89 votes in the 2016 elections in which Sundara secured 467 votes. Sundara, had reportedly demanded that the party pay him Rs 15 lakh and a licence to run a wine shop in Karnataka in return for his withdrawal. He also claimed that these too would have been delivered to him if Surendran had won the seat. Sreekanth, however, termed the allegation totally baseless. “It was not because of any such promises that he withdrew his nomination. He had then publicly talked about the reasons for his withdrawal. He is now coming up with new allegations, opposite to what he had said then. It is due to external influences. There is a conspiracy against BJP. The allegation of Sundara is part of that conspiracy,” said Sreekanth, adding that BJP never illegally gives money for anything. BSP had in March filed a complaint after Sundara went incommunicado on March 22. A case, however, was not registered as Sundara talked to the police. Later, BJP claimed that he was withdrawing his nomination. The next day, he attended a press conference at the BJP office and said that he was withdrawing the nomination upon the request of Surendran and that he did not face any threats. Sreekanth said that the police had talked to Sundara then and he had made no such allegations at that time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/bjp-sundaras-allegation-part-of-conspiracy/articleshow/83267326.cms||---

Police have been holding talks with market associations and helped them in creating social distancing markings. “The economic activities can go on, but wearing masks and Covid-appropriate behaviour are important. Delhi Police has been changing its strategies to deal with the violators. From challaning to giving them roses, we try to ensure people understand that we need to be together in this fight,” Srivastava said. The commissioner took stock of the situation and visited various markets to check the situation on the ground. In various districts, the cops held meetings with market associations and tasked them with the responsibility to ensure social distancing. “The city is gradually opening up and we need to ensure we don’t let our guards down. Monday was the first day of reopening and our focus was to ensure the process ran smoothly,” said RP Meena, DCP (South East). In other parts, including south, central, New Delhi, where a chunk of malls falls, also saw less people.

The decision was taken after the initiative got lukewarm response. A mere 51% of the total targeted beneficiaries turned up for inoculation during the first two days of the programme. A directive in this regard was issued by the state nodal officer for vaccination, A Dodde. Dodde said: “We are extending the drive to other days apart from weekends in order to increase the coverage so that more and more people could be inoculated.” Meanwhile, TOI visited a few Covid vaccination centre (CVC) on Sunday and found that the turnout continued to be low even after special CVCs had provisions of spot registration for beneficiaries. At Birsa Munda Football Stadium Morhabadi CVC, only 70 persons had turned up to take their jabs till the afternoon, even though the centre had a capacity of vaccinating more than 200 beneficiaries. A few beneficiaries at the Morhabadi CVC said that many people were not aware of the special CVCs and that was the reason for the low turnout. “I was informed by a friend’s father who works in a media house about the special CVC, so I brought my mother for vaccination today. Many do not know that they can get their registration done at the centre. I guess the government should spread the word,” Ashok Bhokta said. On being asked what steps were being taken to ensure more and more beneficiaries were informed about the intensive drive, Dodde said: “We have distributed IEC materials to all districts and deputy commissioners have been asked to spread the word through mass media. The health secretary (Arun Kumar Singh) has also spoken to the DCs and has asked them to take corrective measures in this regard.” As per the data from the health department, a total of 1,55,778 beneficiaries out of the targeted 3,03,320 have been inoculated during the first two days of the vaccination drive taking the coverage to around 51%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-extends-intensive-vax-drive-for-45-plus-to-all-7-days/articleshow/83290509.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Chhota Jagdish Mahto, who hails from Kashidih village under Tatkyo panchayat of Devipur block, is believed to be the oldest person in Jharkhand to take the jab. Following his vaccination, Mahto urged everyone not to pay heed to rumours and take the vaccine. “If I can take the vaccine at this age then others too must not hesitate from taking the vaccine," Mahto said, who lives with his only son and two grandsons. According to Devipur block development officer Abhay Kumar Jha, he and his subordinates were urging the villagers to take the shot during the special weekend vaccination drive when he noticed Mahto sitting outside his home. “When asked, I was surprised to see Mahto readily agree for taking the jab,” Jha said adding that the centenarian was later felicitated by the block officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/101-yr-old-man-in-deoghar-sets-example-takes-shot/articleshow/83290780.cms||---

Pakistan also reacted the uranium seizure and demanded a thorough investigation into the case. Seven persons were arrested on Thursday with 6kg of uranium from the city area following a tip-off. Police said they have handed over the sample to a UCIL team on Saturday evening. Experts also conducted a test on the seized sample but did not find any harmful radiation, they said. SP Chandan Kumar Jha said, “We are waiting for the test report from UCIL. It will take about five days to arrive.” Meanwhile, police said they are interrogating the arrested accused to find out the links involved in the uranium smuggling network and identify the other gang members involved in illegal trade related to radioactive material. On Thursday, police filed an FIR against the seven persons who were arrested from a place under the Harla police station area. The accused confessed to them that they were searching for buyers. Based on their statement, a case under sections of the Atomic Energy Act of 1962 and the IPC was filed. The seized uranium was found in three bags containing the stamp ‘Made in USA’. The developments also attracted the attention of Pakistan, which on Friday demanded a thorough investigation. Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri tweeted, "Pakistan is deeply concerned at yet another incident of an attempted illegal sale of 6 kg of uranium in India. Such incidents point to lax controls, poor regulatory & enforcement mechanisms, and the existence of a black market for nuclear materials in India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/seized-uranium-sample-sent-to-ucil-lab-for-test-bokaro-police/articleshow/83290539.cms||---

---||Goa||Contrary to Cabral, 2020 sees just 315 divorces, 2021 has 108 so far||Panaji: While law minister Nilesh Cabral claims that his suggestion for pre-marital counselling for couples is based on the large number of divorce cases in the state, data obtain from state government shows that in 2020, the state witnessed around 4.5% divorces while during the first five months of 2021, the divorce rate was 2.5%. As per the information of the state government, in 2020, 6,379 marriages and 315 divorces were registered in the state. In 2021, up to May, 4,313 marriages and 108 divorces were registered. A senior government officer said that the proposal for counselling was prepared to save the institution of marriage, the breakdown of which impacts two families. Explaining the reason behind the proposal, the officer said that earlier, it was a joint family system where people of all age groups lived together in the house, “Older family members would teach the children family values. Now, with the rise of nuclear families, there is no one to inculcate these values in children. Pre-marriage counselling will help the couple understand the importance of family values,” he said. On Saturday, Cabral said that as an “educated person” and a minister who enjoys “certain privileges”, he was well within his rights to recommend pre-marital counselling for couples looking to tie the knot. Further, he said that he would submit a white paper to try and convince chief minister Pramod Sawant about the role that premarital counselling could play in reducing divorces. Last week, Sawant had said the government would not consider the proposal as it has been receiving mixed views from different sections of society. “The government is not keen on introducing something new of this kind right now. At present, my decision is not to consider it,” Sawant had told TOI. Meanwhile last week, in a social media post, state BJP vice-president Dattaprashad Kholkar demanded to know how many couples file for divorce within six months of marriage. “Are the 25-30-year-olds of Goa immature and uneducated that they don’t understand the aspects of marriage? Aren’t the parents and family elders capable of counselling their wards?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/contrary-to-cabral-2020-sees-just-315-divorces-2021-has-108-so-far/articleshow/83292051.cms||Murari Shetye

According to sources, the chief minister wants to meet Union home minister Amit Shah, finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman, Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawath and health minister Dr Harsha Vardhan. Sources said that chief minister is expected to discuss vaccine policy and release of pending funds for Polavaram project along with other key issues with the Union ministers. The CM’s plans to visit New Delhi gained significance in the wake of his recent letters to other chief ministers on joining hands in seeking a uniform vaccine policy for all states. Sources said that the CM is also expected to discuss the three capital cities issue with the Union home minister during his visit. He is likely to reiterate his request to the Centre to declare Kurnool as judicial capital and shift the high court to Kurnool.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/cm-postpones-new-delhi-visit-may-go-on-thursday/articleshow/83289377.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vijayawada||With YSRC set to control LC, aspirants stake their claims||Amaravati: With the terms of several TDP MLCs getting over soon, YSRC is set to get absolute majority in the legislative council. By the end of June, YSRC is likely to have 33 members in the House of 58 MLCs. The YSRC leadership is preparing the list to fill the 15 seats that are getting vacated. Since YSRC is expected to win all the seats, party general secretaries are shortlisting names. General secretaries and in-charges of party affairs in districts will submit separate lists to chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy for taking the final call. Before assembly elections, Jagan had promised several aspirants for tickets that the party will accommodate them in Upper House. Sources said aspirants for MLC berths are reminding general secretaries of the CM’s promise. However, the CM’s decision to strictly follow social balance and gender equality in filling the posts is likely to upset some key contenders. Sources said the chief minister has decided to fill chairperson posts of state-level corporations ahead of council elections only to eliminate some of the leaders from the council race. The Election Commission (EC) has issued notification to conduct elections to three seats to replace sitting members MA Shariff, DC Govinda Reddy (TDP) and BJP state president Somu Veerraju last month. However, it deferred the polls in view of Covid-19 second wave. Meanwhile, another eight seats from local bodies’ quota would fall vacant on June 18. Except Ummareddi Venkateswarlu, the remaining seven members are TDP nominees who are retiring from Upper House. Although the elections to municipal corporations and municipalities were completed, the fate of zilla parishad elections is hanging in balance as the Andhra Pradesh high court division bench is yet to take up the case for hearing. Earlier the HC single bench had suspended the ZP elections and directed the State Election Commission (SEC) to go for fresh elections. The Election Commission of India (ECI) might wait for the completion of the ZP elections to fill the vacant legislative council seats from local bodies’ quota as ZPTC members were electoral college members. Similarly, four legislative council members from nominated quota are due for retirement shortly. While three members are from TDP, one from YSRC will retire at the end of the month. All the four seats will also go into the YSRC kitty. After the completion of elections to nearly 15 seats, YSRC’s strength is expected to touch 33 in the House of 58 giving it complete majority. TDP’s strength in the council will be reduced to 15. While five members are associated with Progressive Democratic Front (PDF), four independent members and BJP’s PVN Madhav are other members in the council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/with-ysrc-set-to-control-lc-aspirants-stake-their-claims/articleshow/83289367.cms||Samdani MN

Doctors have noted a trend in which patients in home isolation getting D-dimer tests done unilaterally, either on the advice of a non-doctor, or “Dr Google”. “A D-dimer test should be done purely on doctor’s advice,” said GMC consulting cardiologist Dr Manjunath Desai. “If somebody has a muscle sprain or trauma, the level of D-dimer will be high. It is advisable that people should consult a doctor who can interpret the test readings.” Dean Dr S M Bandekar said that tests like D-Dimer and IL6 are done when a patient continues to have a fever. Hospitalised patients, after evaluations, are prescribed blood thinner medications that they need to continue even after discharge from hospital, for a period of time as determined by the treating doctor. “A D-dimer test is done for symptomatic patients having fever for 7-8 days, or for patients who have a breathing problem,” said chest physician Dr Anil Mehndiratta. “They are put on blood thinners for a month. (The same is) for patients who are smokers or who are prone to clotting disease. It is normal protocol.” The danger is when a non-medical person interprets the D-dimer test results and starts self-medicating. Dr Vinayaga Pandian, consulting cardiologist, Victor hospital, said that D-dimer test results need to be interpreted with caution. “D-Dimer levels can be slightly high in a person after Covid recovery,” he said. “That does not mean that the patient starts popping all the blood thinners. Do it only if advised by a doctor, or you might develop complications. For a doctor, it is always easy to treat a disease rather than a patient with complications.” Bandekar said that the expert committee had suggested to the government that the home monitoring mechanism should be tightened so that Covid patients having comorbidities are monitored properly. These suggestions were accepted. It was also suggested that patients having comorbidities should either consult their family doctor or a health officer of the nearest primary health centre. If both options were not feasible, such patients must be shifted to an escalated Covid-care centre, so that those facing risk of complications are adequately monitored, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-dr-google-d-dimer-tests-only-on-docs-advice-experts/articleshow/83292204.cms||Bindiya Chari

Mechanised boatowners too feel that they would want to delay the new season by at least two weeks as the current situation is not amenable both with regard to the pandemic and the market. Speaking to TOI, Ch Satyanarayana Murthy, president of Dolphin Boat Operators’ Welfare Association, said that boatowners are not in a position to resume fishing from June 16. “We are likely to face labour, ice shortages and other issues,” Murthy said. Owners of mechanised boats say that they have been incurring losses for the last few years. Some boatowners have sold off their boats and quit the trade. “The fishing trade depends on a number of factors such as weather, market, export atmosphere. We have been incurring losses for the past few years. We will wait and watch and will resume the new fishing season on July 1,” said M Lakshman, a boatowner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/fishing-ban-ends-on-jun-15-fishermen-wait-and-watch/articleshow/83289465.cms||Nalla.Babu

Citing lease expiry and encroachment, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) pulled down some temporary structures at the school and sealed the premises on Saturday afternoon. At the protest, parents of students studying at the school said that the school offers various therapies apart from regular academics which help the disabled children. “Nearly 190 students are studying at the school. We request the state government to intervene and ensure that the school runs as usual,” said a protesting parent. School founder and secretary K Srinivasa Rao said, “GVMC gave the space on lease in 2013. Student strength has now increased to 190. We offer a number of free services to students. I request the government to do justice to the children,” said Rao. Explaining the demolition, GVMC commissioner G Srijana said that K Srinivasa Rao has obtained the old sanitary inspector office’s building in the reserved open space of Sector-12, MVP Colony on lease for nominal rent. “Under guise of the temporary allotment, he has occupied the layout space with is meant for a playground and has continued unauthorisedly for the past seven years. Further, he has encroached and extended the office building with sheds without prior approval from competent authority,” said Srijana. The GVMC commissioner assured that if Hidden Sprouts Special School wants any alternate accommodation, it will be provided while duly following procedure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/students-protest-demolition-of-school-structures/articleshow/83289510.cms||---

The Coast Guard air-lifted 50 year old Yi Myong Bok, a South Korean national who had partial left hand paralysis and low blood pressure and brought him to Vasco.

The petition, filed by state Congress president Girish Chodankar, has been listed for hearing.

---||Goa||Goa: Door-to-door dengue drive at Calangute||CALANGUTE: After two cases of dengue came to light in Calangute around three weeks ago the Candolim primary health center (PHC) along with the Calangute panchayat has launched a door-to-door anti-larval drive to prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases which normally surface in the rainy season near stagnant water. “There was no spread after those two cases were found three weeks ago because we took preventive measures,” Candolim PHC medical officer Dr Roshan Nazareth said. These measures covered identifying containers in which water could accumulate, anti-larval spraying, fogging and fever surveillance. “We managed to stop it from spreading," he said. Besides Calangute and Candolim, the anti-larval drive was also carried out in surrounding villages which fall under the Candolim PHC jurisdiction like, Arpora, Saligao, Sangolda, Nerul and Reis Magos through the sub-health centres. The drives are being done along with the village panchayats. “We cover one ward per day and we go door-to-door with the panchayat ward member. This year we also asked the panchayats to bring a garbage collector to take away the discarded plastic bottles and other waste. We identify the areas where water can get accumulated and also abandoned containers in which water gets filled. These can be breeding sites for mosquitoes,” Dr Nazareth said. He said the team has also covered most of the wards while the Calangute panchayat has asked for the drive to be repeated as a precautionary measure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/door-to-door-dengue-drive-at-calangute/articleshow/83292455.cms||---

Continuous rain on Saturday did not help matters, making it difficult for buyers to access the road. Chicken shop owner Abid Bepari said, “We are fed up knocking on the doors of the municipality. People avoid coming to the market and doubt the quality of our product because of the mess in front of our shops. Nobody seems to be serious about hygiene.” Aarti Naik, a senior citizen who stays near the chicken market at Khariawada, expressed concerns of the spread of dengue and malaria. She said, “We have been fighting dengue cases and deaths before Covid-19 and it looks like we might have a rise in number these cases along with pandemic.” Councillor of ward no. 13 Shammi Salkar said, “I have requested the labourers who lift garbage to clean this area on a daily basis. The problem is that this area is a collection point of my ward. The garbage collector dumps the garbage at the point but the vehicles do not lift it daily.” Chicken shop owners said that the garbage collection contractor is supposed to store the waste in a special shed till it is lifted. But since, this is not happening, stray cattle, dogs and rain scatter the waste further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/waste-outside-vasco-chicken-market-raises-dengue-malaria-concerns/articleshow/83292514.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: ‘Need to restore ecology degradation’||PANAJI: The degradation of ecology due to infrastructure development without assessing the impact on the environment and ignoring ethical responsibilities needs to be reversed and ecosystem services reinstated to pristine status, speakers at a webinar on World Environment Day stated. The virtual programme on ‘Restoration of ecosystem’ was organised, among others, by the department of environment and climate change. Mahesh Patil, a member of Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) and Manoj Borkar, a reputed biologist spoke on ‘Ecorestoration approach - a case study of bauxite mine’ and ‘Eco-restoration and relictual species: Goa’s Tarantulas at crossroads?’ at the webinar. Of the more than 900 species of tarantulas globally, India has about 53. IUCN has assessed 14 of these large-bodied spiders for conservation and redlisted eight. “Currently only four species have been documented from Goa’s Western Ghats and more await discovery,” Borkar said. The ecologist highlighted pitfalls of aggressive infrastructure development. “Out of four, two tarantulas — the Indian Violet and Lesser Goa Mustard — occur in a small isolated population in the precincts of the Sahyadris and are threatened by the fast pace of linear infrastructure,” he said. Borkar said that Goans have an ethical obligation to preserve the state’s rich endowments of bio wealth for posterity and suggested creation of “rescue habitats” to conserve them. He said that he and his collaborator from the department of climate change in IIT, Hyderabad, have done a study on using one of Goa’s tarantula species as a bio-indicator of heavy metal pollution. Patil described the acceptable post-mining land uses, which includes commercial, residential, recreational, agricultural or public facility improvement as well local community needs. “Schemes related to agriculture, forestry, fisheries and livestock, which are being implemented in Jharkhand, and local tourism infrastructure can provide livelihood opportunities to stakeholders,” Patil said. In Goa, Sesa Goa, now Vedanta, is one of the few mines that has regreened its mine at Sakhali and started horticulture and pisciculture. The state has more than 250 mining pits which lie unutilised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/need-to-restore-eco-degradation/articleshow/83292546.cms||Paul Fernandes

This came after the governor, earlier in the day, termed Bengal’s law and order “extremely alarming” and asked state chief secretary H K Dwivedi to brief him on Monday and “indicate all steps taken to contain post poll violence.” Trinamool’s Krishnanagar MP Mahua Moitra, responding to the governor’s Twitter posts on law and order, wrote back on Twitter: “Uncleji only way WB’s ‘grim situation’ will improve is if you move your sorry self back to Delhi & find another job”. She followed it up with another Twitter post, in which she named six OSDs, mentioning their current designation and relation with the governor, adding, “And Uncleji — while you’re at it — take the extended family you’ve settled in at WB Raj Bhavan with you.” Raj Bhavan has not responded to TMC’s nepotism barbs. “These are baseless allegations and lies,” said BJP Bengal general secretary Sayantan Basu. “ADCs are state appointees. This is a weak attempt to deflect the discourse from the issue of deteriorating law and order in Bengal,” he added. “This governor had been sent here with a political mandate. Now that BJP lost miserably in Bengal, he couldn’t deliver his promise. Now he is trying another game,” Moitra, speaking to TOI later, said, adding, “We didn’t want to play these petty personal games. But people should know the truth now. We also have a right to question. Who pays for Raj Bhavan? Isn’t it the public exchequer? Why has he put his relatives, and those of his aides, there? Let him come out and say that this is untrue. Let him file a defamation and police case against me.” In response to the governor’s two-page note on Bengal’s law and order, Moitra also put out a one-pager on all the six names, along with the details. Dhankhar, on Twitter, claimed lakhs of people were being displaced and property worth hundreds of crores vandalised in Bengal. “Extremely alarming law & order scenario. Security environment is seriously compromised. In such a grim situation called upon (the) Chief Secretary to brief me on the law and order situation on Monday 7th June and indicate all steps taken to contain post poll violence,” he posted on Sunday. “Democratic values are openly shredded and trampled by ruling party harmads. People are in mortal fear of police and that in turn is at the feet of ruling party rogue elements,” he had tweeted. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier questioned Raj Bhavan’s bypassing the CM — or the council of ministers — to directly summon state officials. Banerjee had also indicated that she may have to step in to ask state officers not to attend such meetings. Trinamool Congress secretary-general Partha Chatterjee criticised the governor for speaking too much. “He should ideally remain silent, but he is unable to do it and has been making comments just to keep afloat,” Chatterjee claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/how-many-osds-at-raj-bhavan-tmc-asks-guv/articleshow/83292705.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The developments have prompted the BJP to cry foul, with senior functionaries terming it a “conspiracy” and “politically motivated”. The name of Adhikari, who’s also the state leader of the opposition, is one of four names in the FIR, which also mentions his brother Soumendu, a former chief of Contai Municipality. The complaint that names the Adhikaris has been lodged by Ratnadip Manna, member, board of administrators, Contai Municipality. Manna had lodged the complaint on June 1 alleging that around 12.30pm on May 29, tarpaulin worth Rs 2 lakh stacked at the municipality store was forcibly taken in a mini truck by illegally breaking open the locks. This was done at the Adhikari brothers’ “directions”, the complaint alleges. Manna claimed he, along with another board member, Sk Habibur Rahman, had accosted two people they spotted. “We arrested one person, Pratap Dey, on Thursday. He was remanded in three days’ police custody. We are looking for Himangshu Manna, who is another accused,” said Contai police inspector-in-charge Amalendu Biswas. Himangshu, sources said, was earlier responsible for the Contai municipality stores. The police officer said the cops had not only lodged the FIR under penal sections but also sections 51 and 53 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The complaint also mentions Suvendu’s guards — all central force personnel — who were also present. A CISF jawan, now assigned to guard Suvendu, has also been summoned for questioning. In the cash-for-jobs complaint, Bera has been remanded in police custody till June 12 after Maniktala police pleaded in court that they needed custodial interrogation to unearth the “masterminds”. Bera, arrested on Saturday, has been named in an FIR lodged on February 27 that claims he, along with Chanchal Nandi, had taken Rs 2 lakh promising a Group-D (field staff) post to the complainant, an Askokenagar resident, in the state irrigation department in 2019. The FIR alleges that the duo had organised a special job camp on the premises of the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics Cooperative Housing Society on Kolkata’s Maniktala Road sometime between July 2019 and September 2019. The FIR has been lodged over criminal conspiracy, cheating and fraud (IPC sections 120B, 420, 467, 468 and 471). Joint police commissioner V Solomon Nesakumar refused to comment, only saying a person had been arrested at 8.35pm on Saturday. BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Sunday said the FIRs were “a conspiracy against the BJP.” Sayantan Basu, Bengal BJP general secretary, alleged the FIRs were “politically motivated, and lodged with vested interests.... They have falsely implicated hundreds of BJP workers and tried to intimidate them. This case is no exception,” adding, “The Contai FIR is a ridiculous allegation by a party whose own leaders had been involved in corruption over relief material during Cyclone Amphan. The Adhikari family can never stoop so low to as to encourage stealing of plastic sheets.” None of the Adhikari brothers has commented on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-name-suvendu-bro-in-fir-close-dragnet-around-aides/articleshow/83292647.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The complaint also mentions Suvendu’s guards — all central force personnel — who were also present. A CISF jawan, now assigned to guard Suvendu, has also been summoned for questioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fir-against-suvendu-over-yaas-relief-theft/articleshow/83296355.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||If pizza can be delivered at home, why not ration: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: “If pizza, burgers, smartphones and clothes can be delivered at home, why not ration,” asked CM Arvind Kejriwal at a press meet Sunday, urging PM Modi to lift the “blockade” on the AAP government’s doorstep ration scheme. The city government had completed all necessary procedures — from filing tenders, issuing work orders to planning the entire delivery mechanism — required for implementing the scheme, the CM claimed, adding people are now scared of overcrowding at ration shops. “I think door-to-door delivery of ration should be implemented elsewhere too. It will also help prevent the spread of Covid. These shops are superspreaders,” Kejriwal said. Rrequest with folded hands not to stop scheme: KejriwalKejriwal said the Centre has taken the stance that the Delhi government has not taken approval from them, but it is baseless. He said the city government has been writing multiple letters stating that the scheme is going to be implemented and for taking approval. He said the Delhi government did this without any legal obligation to do so. Kejriwal said the Centre had earlier objected to the previous name of the scheme, ‘Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana’. "Our goal was not to make our name shine. Anyhow this scheme should be implemented and the poor should start getting their ration. We accepted your point and removed the name of the scheme itself. We accepted all the objections you made. After all this, you say that we did not take your approval? How else to get approval, sir," he said, addressing the PM. Kejriwal added the Centre has said the scheme is being stopped due to a court case involving ration shopkeepers in the Delhi High Court, but neither has the HC stayed the scheme, nor has the Centre had put forward any objection in court, he said. "With folded hands, I request you on behalf of the seven million poor people of Delhi, please do not stop this scheme, it is in the national interest. Let it happen. I have supported you in all matters of national interest. I have always said that there should be no politics in any work of national interest," Kejriwal said. "If the government of any opposition party also does any work in the national interest, then we will always support it. Please support us in this work of national interest. Till now the governments have kept the poor people of the country standing in the lines of ration for 75 years. Don't make them stand in ration lines for the next 75 years, otherwise, these people will not forgive us," he said. "This ration is neither mine nor yours. It is not of the BJP or Aam Aadmi Party. This ration belongs to the people of this country, bought with their tax money," he said. "It is both my responsibility and your responsibility to distribute this ration to the people without theft," he said. Kejriwal said that ration in the name of the public is issued in the files but most of it is stolen. "This ration mafia is very powerful. Seventeen years ago I dared to challenge this mafia," he said, adding he used to work in an NGO in the slums of Delhi back then and had ‘dared to get the poor people their ration’. "It is said that the connections of this ration mafia are very high. In the 75 years till date, no government has dared to end this mafia," the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/if-pizza-can-be-delivered-at-home-why-not-ration-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal/articleshow/83296357.cms||Sidharatha Roy

This was revealed in the genome study of patients conducted by the Union government. In April 2021, 64% of patients whose samples were studied were infected with this virus variant. The B.1.617 variant also called as double mutant, was found in only 2.2% of the samples in March, as per the study. Sources in the state health department said, a total of 1,068 samples from Madhya Pradesh were processed and analysed for genomic analysis. Of these samples, lineages were found in 1,012 samples. And the variant B.1.1.7 was found to be predominant in samples analysed from March 2021, this B.1.1.7 is considered more infectious than others, but the recent lineages of B.1.617 variant found thereafter in the samples is deadlier resulting in the fatalities. A total of 392 samples from March 2021 were analysed from Madhya Pradesh of which 231 samples had B.1.1.7 variant. The other variant B.1.617 was only present in 79 samples which was roughly 20.2%. However, the spread of the second variant B.1.617 could be understood from the fact that in April itself, 64.2% of the samples analyzed had this variant, and B.1.1.7 was found in only 0.7 % samples. April was the peak month for the spread of the second wave of infection in Madhya Pradesh. In May around 200 samples were analysed from the state, in 46.5% the variant B.1.617 was found, while in B.1.1.7 was found in none, other virus lineages were found in 53% of the samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/second-wave-spread-in-madhya-pradesh-due-to-double-mutant-genome-study/articleshow/83296362.cms||Amarjeet Singh

He was “absconding” for the past several months. The CBI has received “inputs” that Vinay has gone to Vanuatu in Polynesia and may want to join the investigation virtually. Mishra’s lawyers have refused to comment on it. “The Calcutta HC had asked Vinay Mishra to appear before it on May 3. He could not appear due to the pandemic and we sought a modification of the order. The hearing is scheduled on Monday,” said Ayan Poddar, Mishra’s lawyer. The CBI had issued a lookout circular against Vinay this March after an arrest warrant was issued by the agency’s special court in Asansol. CBI sources said Vinay allegedly worked as a frontman for Enamul Haque — the prime accused in the cross-border illegal cattle trade — and stashed money for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coal-scam-accused-tmc-neta-could-be-in-vanuatu/articleshow/83296381.cms||Rohit Khanna

Junior doctors across government-run medical colleges in the state are on strike for the last seven days demanding hike in stipends and among others. Hours after the meeting between Junior Doctors’ Association (JDA) and medical education minister failed on Sunday evening, Madhya Pradesh Medical Council issued notices for cancellation of registrations of five office-bearers of JUDA. The council has asked the office-bearers to individually appear before the ethical committee of the council at the office of state health commissioner in Bhopal on June10. The office bearers, including JUDA president, vice president, joint president and two secretaries, have been asked to explain why their registration should not be cancelled for unauthorised absence from work and forcing others to follow suit. The notices claimed that the conduct of the JDA office-bearers was in violation of Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquettes and Ethics) Regulations 2002 and Madhya Pradesh Essential Services Maintenance Act, 1979. JUDA strike: Deadlock continues after meeting with SarangOn May 31, MGM Medical College, Indore, dean had issued notices to the office-bearers over unauthorised absence from work. The strike by junior doctors has been deemed illegal by the MP High Court, after which the 3,000 junior doctors submitted their resignations. According to reports, JUDA representatives, reached the minister Sarang’s residence without prior appointment. Sarang was on his way to attend the District Crisis Committee meeting when he learned about JUDA representatives were at his residence and wanted to talk. Meeting with Sarang lasted for about nine minutes and remained inconclusive. During the meeting, both sides stuck to their stance. JUDA has offered to return to work in the medical college, only after they receive a formal order that their demands have been met. MP JUDA president Dr Arvind Meena stated that junior doctors’ stipend has not increased since 2018. He reiterated that assurance by the government after one day token strike on May 6 did not translate into action. In response, Minister Sarang said that the government is increasing the stipend of JUDA and proposal is being sent for the approval of the cabinet. For three years, 2018 to 2021, an increase of 18% has been proposed. On Monday, a hearing in the case is expected in the MP High Court during which the state government will submit its reply during the hearing on Monday.

---||Kolkata||Kids battle separation anxiety as doctor parents avoid contact for safety’s sake||KOLKATA: Doctors on Covid duty, who have been avoiding contact with their children fearing transmitting the virus, are now having to confront another problem: separation anxiety. Many of them have discovered that their absence has turned the kids moody, irritable and depressive. A doctor couple, who were living away from their daughter and their mother and mother-in-law, said their daughter had become edgy and anxious, even as they themselves suffered from guilt over not giving the child enough time. “During weekends, we drop by separately for a few minutes to inquire about how everyone is and what they need for the week,” said the girl’s father, a doctor at SSKM Hospital. “I can see the hurt in my daughter’s eyes. At times, it seems as though she will break down, but she hasn’t. She usually puts up a brave face and behaves maturely, taking instructions on what she should do for her two grannies and how they should conduct themselves to avoid the infection. We are missing out on her childhood.” Paediatrician Sumita Saha, too, has experienced her son’s trauma. “I have a 10-year-old child. He’s very attached to me and usually sleeps beside me. When I went into isolation after contracting the virus, he would stand in front of my room and want a hug. But I couldn’t allow that. He would then put his foot through the door and ask me to touch it with my feet. He would ultimately go to sleep clutching one of my clothes,” she recounted. These children are missing out on their parents’ touch — a pat, a kiss, a hug — gestures that matter a lot to a child, said child counsellor Yashabanti Sreemany. “Even thou-gh they are aware of the reason for their parents’ behaviour, the emotional needs need to be fulfilled. When it keeps prolo-nging, like it has during Covid, it begins affecting children,” she said. Sreemany has seen multiple cases of doctors’ children suffering from separation anxiety. The problem, she believes, is twofold. Seeing young men and women, and even boys and girls getting admitted with Covid, doctors are paranoid about taking the infection home and are taking extreme precautions to keep their family safe. They speak to their children sparingly, talk from a distance, avoid physical contact, wear masks when children are present and practically spend minimal time with them. Shamik Ghosh, consultant paediatrician and neonatologist, says the separation due to Covid is making some children feel insecure. “Many children who have not got the desired attention or affection from their parents for over a year are feeling neglected and are beginning to behave differently. Doubts have crept in. They are suffering from mood swings, have become irritable and curt. Depression is setting in. Even sleep is getting affected,” he said. Psychotherapist Jolly Raha, who has come across such cases as well, says parents need to explain the issue in a manner the kids can understand. “A child needs to be told and explained that the mother, father or both of them are fighting against this virus and helping cure those who are being attacked by it. Each child has an image of the mother or father. This will enhance the image and make them feel proud,” she reasoned. Ghosh concurred. “As a paediatrician, I can vouch that children are very resilient. They can adjust to changes. They are suffering from separation anxiety but they will come to terms with it in their own way. But it is also important for parents to spend time with them and maintain the bond, maybe through video calls,” he suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kids-battle-separation-anxiety-as-doc-parents-avoid-contact-for-safetys-sake/articleshow/83292863.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The visuals looked similar to November 25, 2020, when Haryana farmers did the same under a ‘Dilli Chalo’ call by Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM). This time, however, farmers were not stopped or blocked by Haryana Police as was done in November. Thousands from villages of Ambala district gathered at Shambhu border in the morning and started moving towards Delhi in their vehicles in the afternoon. Once the cavalcade started movement, one side of the three-lane National Highway-44 was jampacked and people heading for Delhi faced long jams. The cavalcade was heading for Singhu border to provide strength in numbers to an ongoing agitation against the farm laws passed by the Centre. Apart from Singhu, farmers continued to pour into the protest sites on the Tikri and Ghazipur borders of Delhi. “A cavalcade of about 2,500 vehicles from Ambala district moved towards Delhi and another one will be taken from Panipat on June 10. This movement is to warn the government to accept the demands and to show the enthusiasm of one district. If such a call is given to the entire nation, Delhi will be choked,” said Charuni. To a query that talks have not resumed with the government for several months, he said, “The government is worried more than us (farmers).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/thousands-of-farmers-march-towards-delhi/articleshow/83296418.cms||JK Singh
---||India||Alert over Prachi’s plan for ‘havan’ at mosque||AGRA: A large police contingent was camping by the road leading to Aligarh’s Noorpur village on Sunday to deter any attempt to disturb law and order in the wake of VHP leader Sadhvi Prachi’s announcement to perform a ‘havan’ at a mosque there which was at the centre of a row involving people of two different faiths. Although the VHP leader didn’t turn up in spite of her announcement to visit the village till late evening, several activists of saffron outfits reached near the village and confronted the policemen who didn’t allow them to enter. The row began on May 26 when a wedding procession of a Dalit family was allegedly asked to stop the music for a while near a mosque where people were offering prayers. Some people in the wedding procession claimed that they were attacked by the people of the minority community. Later, local police intervened and booked 11 people. A few days later, “house for sale” signs came up on the facades of some houses belonging to Dalit families. Alleged attempts were made to whip up communal passions too. A local AIMIM leader gave a controversial statement and BJP MP Satish Gautam visited the village along with local MLAs assuring the Dalit community a “secure atmosphere”. And on Sunday morning, scores of saffron activists tried to enter Noorpur. “We are not being allowed to enter the village,” said Karni Sena president Vikas Chauhan. A local resident of Noorpur village, Haji Dalveer Khan, said that an unnecessary controversy is being stirred by political parties. District magistrate CB Singh and SSP Kalanidhi Naithani were also in the village. Talking to media persons, Singh said, “A peace committee has been formed and five accused have been arrested so far. The situation is under control.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/alert-over-prachis-plan-for-havan-at-mosque/articleshow/83296437.cms||---

The elder girl drowned while the mother and infant— six-months-old escaped with injuries. Cops said the accused Raja Bhaiya Yadav, 35, is on the run. Raja was going to his native village Dadhiya along with his wife Bitti and two daughters- a 6- month-old infant and the other 8-year-old. Yadav, a marginal farmer by profession, was bringing his wife from his in-law’s home in Chandala tehsil of Chhatarpur. Woman climbs out of well with her infantInstead of going home, he took his bike off the road and reached a dug-well without an embankment. Pretending to fetch water from the well, he parked his vehicle near the water body and suddenly pushed his wife and two daughters into the well. When she tried to get out, he threw stones from above and escaped, she later told police. The woman got out of the well along with the 6-monthold while her elder daughter drowned. She also sustained head injuries from the stones thrown at her. She managed to reach Chandala police station and lodged a report. Rajendra Singh, investigating officer, said the accused was angry with his wife for delivering three daughters. After the birth of the last daughter, he misbehaved forcing her go to her parents' place. On Sunday, he was getting her back when he tried to kill her.

---||Kolkata||Paediatric ventilators, Covid beds at West Bengal government hospitals soon||KOLKATA: In a bid to scale up paediatric Covid facilities prior to a possible third wave, the state government has decided to have close to 10,000 paediatric Covid beds spread across government-run hospitals in Bengal. Sources in the health department said 20% of these will be HDU beds while 5% will be CCU beds with ventilator facilities, while the rest will be general beds. Even as health department officials said the state has a good number of paediatric ventilators and is also procuring more, a trial will be conducted at Medical College Hospital Kolkata (MKCH) on Monday to check if adult ventilators can be used on paediatric patients. “If we face a third wave, it could be about three to four months away. And since children who are not vaccinated are likely to be affected, we need to have our facilities ready in advance,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan, where rounds of preparation meetings are held. In Kolkata, all teaching medical colleges, including Dr BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children (DBCRMHC), RG Kar Medical College (RGKMC), MCHK, SSKM Hospital and Chittaranjan Seva Sadan (CSS), have been asked to either ramp up their paediatric Covid units or set up new ones. “We have 20 paediatric Covid beds, including four beds with ventilation, in addition to 20 SARI beds. In order to remain prepared we would be doubling the number. We also have 30 paediatric ventilators,” said DBCRMHC principal Dilip Pal. RGKMC has already started working on creating 50 paediatric Covid beds, including 10 CCU beds. The hospital has already got four ventilators and it will be getting at least six more. “Work is also on to set up a 40-bedded SARI ward for children. We should be ready with our unit in within two weeks,” said RGKMC principal Sandip Ghosh. CSS already has a Covid care unit in its mother and child hub. The hospital in Hazra will now have a dedicated 40-plus bedded paediatric Covid unit spread over two floors. “While one floor will cater to newborns, the other section will be for older kids. We already have two ventilators and some more will be procured. We should be ready in about two weeks,” said Ashish Mukhopadhyay, principal CSS. Doctors, however, are hopeful that even if more children are affected in the third wave, only a few will require ventilation support as the ACE2 receptor in children, through which the spike protein of the virus goes into the body, is not well developed in the respiratory tract. Children are most likely to suffer more from manifestations like diarrhoea and dehydration. “But we need to keep a certain number of paediatric ventilator beds ready,” said a paediatrician in a government hospital. At MCHK, technicians will be checking if the pressure and volume of adult ventilators can be augmented to suit the requirement of paediatric patients. This, health department officials said, is to have a know-how in advance so that adult ventilators, which the state has more in numbers compared to paediatric ones, can come to rescue in case the need arises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/paediatric-ventilators-cov-beds-at-govt-hosps-soon/articleshow/83290979.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

In the course of its long journey, the big cat even crossed a few rivers, some of them wider than a kilometre, foresters confirmed. According to chief wildlife warden V K Yadav, the male tiger, radio-collared in end-December last year, has mostly stayed in the Bangladesh Sunderbans. “It was captured from Harinbhanga for-est, just opposite the Harikhali camp under Basirhat range, and later released with the satellite collar on December 27. After initial movements for a few days on the Indian side, it started venturing into the Talpatti isl-and in Bangladesh Sunderbans and crossed rivers such as Choto Harikhali, Boro Harikhali and even the Raimangal,” Yadav said. According to him, in over four months — from December 27 to May 11, when the radio collar stopped giving signals — the tiger moved across three islands: Harinbhanga and Khatuajhuri in the Indian Sunderbans, and Talpatti island in the Bangladesh Sunderbans, and mostly stayed in the Bangladesh Sunderbans, and did not even come close to human habitats. The purpose of the project — jointly taken up by the forest department and WWF-India’s Sunderbans chapter — was to decode negative interactions between tigers and villagers in the Indian Sunderbans. The last recorded location of the tiger on May 11 was at Talpatti island in Bangladesh. In January 2017, a tigress was radio-collared and released in the South 24 Parganas division, the buffer area of the forest. This tiger, too, travelled a linear distance of over 100km in four months to reach the tip of the Bay of Bengal before finally settling in its territory. Before that, five other tigers — one of which had also ventured into Bangladesh’s Talpatti island — were also radio-collared in the Indian Sunderbans. The purpose of all those projects was to find the territory and home range of Sunderbans tigers. This time, the project’s focus was studying man-tiger conflict patterns in the Indian Sunderbans. On being asked whether the big cat was fine since the collar stopped giving signals after May 11, Yadav said: “The gadget also had a mortality sensor, which gives signals in case of the tiger’s death. But that didn’t happen. We also didn’t get any static signals from the collar, which points that the tiger is safe. In all probability, the collar has slipped off its neck. In the Sunderbans, salinity in the water can also damage radio collars.” According to him, this tiger was not clicked by camera traps. “So, it’s possible that it had come from the Bangladesh Sunderbans when we had captured it for collaring,” Yadav added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/collared-in-india-tiger-covers-100km-in-4-mths-to-reach-bdesh-sunderbans/articleshow/83292765.cms||Krishnendu Mukherjee

When contacted, the discom— Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut company – blamed it on the billing software and assured to rectify it at the earliest. Manzar Bhopali, a resident of Koh-e-Fiza area was shell-shocked after receiving the bill. He first received the text message alert on Sunday morning which read ‘bill amount of Rs 36,86,600 to be paid by June 21’. He cross checked the due bill amount on the discom portal which reflected the same. Till Sunday evening, his revised bill was not received, that made the poet vent out his feelings the best way he does, penning his thoughts. ‘MP Ajab Hai, Bohat Kuch Gazab Hai’ was the title of his post on social media in which he also tagged MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. “At a time when artists and poets are suffering due to the pandemic, this is one incident which I did not anticipate. There is no way I can afford to pay the bill. It caused anxiety to me and my family,” he said. Bhopali, was diagnosed with Covid-19 last year. After that, he has limited his movement and has not been seen in public for months. “The bill cannot be overlooked as a mistake. It is an invitation for corruption,” he alleged. Bhopali has been vocal about lack of a plan for artists and poets under financial stress during the pandemic and lockdowns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/power-shock-madhya-pradesh-discom-serves-rs-36-lakh-bill-to-poet-manzar-bhopali/articleshow/83296452.cms||---

But officials are sceptical as they expect that the government should clarify whether or not occupants of special buildings like hospitals, laboratories and even offices that are below 9 metres, but have paid the impact fees between 2011 and 2016, should merit exemption under a similar rule. “Fire rescue work is easier in G+2 floor buildings. Also, even if people try to escape from the second floor, they could still be saved in case of fire incidents,” says a senior TDO official at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). The official also added that a number of buildings could not obtain fire NOCs as there was some or the other dispute with the administration over slight deviations from the building layout plan or an extra construction. “This would have meant delaying fire inspections even as people begin occupying the buildings,” said the senior TDO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rule-change-to-remove-red-tape/articleshow/83293128.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: Surgeons find way to make black fungus care 100 times cheaper||PUNE: Careful tracking of blood creatinine levels in patients battling post-Covid mucormycosis can ease the pain of daily medication costs from Rs 35,000 to Rs 350, treating surgeons have found. While the liposomal form of amphotericin injections — a key drug against the infection — is prohibitively priced, the conventional form of the same drug costs 100 times less but needs to be administered carefully, with a blood test every alternate day to rule out drug toxicity in the kidneys. If creatinine levels are raised, the 21-day course of the drug can be finished with two to three “pit stops” — also called “amphotericin holidays” — to allow the body to normalise. Creatinine is a waste product that’s channeled out of the system via the kidneys. Read AlsoKarnataka: How they survived deadly mucormycosisThere are more than 1,700 people suffering mucormycosis in Karnataka, but despite fear of the fungal infection and despair over the lack of hospital beds and the drug to treat it, 62 patients have recovered.ENT surgeon Samir Joshi said “unwarranted” concerns over conventional amphotericin causing kidney damage had led to the “hyped demand” for the drug's liposomal form. “We should dispel this fear”. The efficacy of both forms of amphotericin is equal, say doctors. The catch is that the drug in its conventional form should not be given to patients with significant co-morbidities, including renal failure and diabetic ketoacidosis. In the rest, conventional amphotericin can effectively arrest spread of mucormycosis, specialists have found out. All a treating doctor needs to do is strictly monitor blood creatinine levels and clear damaged tissue. “Liposomal amphotericin is, no doubt, safer than the conventional one and everyone would want the safer version. But there is no difference in efficacy of both forms of the drug,” said Joshi, head of the ENT department at Pune’s BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital. He has treated about 201 patients with post-Covid mucormycosis. “More than 85% of these patients successfully recovered through monitored use of conventional amphotericin and carefully planned debridement surgeries. Their long-term follow-ups will consolidate this success rate.” Before Covid struck, Joshi had treated 65 patients with mucormycosis using conventional amphotericin. “Of them, 63 patients recovered and have survived,” he said. The combined use of amphotericin and surgery usually works. Surgery removes the dead and necrotic tissues. Amphotericin then goes on to arrest advancing fungus in adjacent live tissue. ENT surgeon Sandeep Karmarkar said, “debridement (clearance) of all affected tissues is extremely vital. Only after a thorough removal will the drug be able to reach the target site”. Currently, neither the conventional nor liposomal amphotericin is available easily as supply is limited. “Liposomal amphotericin B is non-toxic, causes fewer electrolyte changes, higher dosages can be given within a short period of time and tissue penetration is better,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-surgeons-find-way-to-make-black-fungus-care-100-times-cheaper/articleshow/83296475.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Bengaluru||Covid-19: 7% fatality rate last week is Bengaluru's highest ever this year||BENGALURU: The weekly Covid case fatality rate (CFR) in Bengaluru peaked during the May 29-June 4 week to touch 7%, the highest seen in 2021 so far. During this period, the city witnessed 25,699 fresh Covid-19 cases and 1,797 deaths. The CFR remained at 4.8% during the May 22-28 week even though the state capital recorded 1,37,343 Covid-positive cases and 2,037 fatalities in the period. Read AlsoDoctors' ethical dilemma: Save the young or seniors?With an increasing demand for ICU beds and ventilators, clinicians are facing an ethical dilemma over allotment of beds: Young breadwinners or senior citizens? The focus is certainly more on saving the youngsters, multiple hospital authorities told TOI on the condition of anonymity.However, the case positivity rate is falling. From May 29 to June 4, BBMP conducted 4.2 lakh tests and case positivity rate stood at 6%. It was nearly 12% in the previous week.The weekly positivity rate was highest between May 1 and 7 with 38.6% when 78,903 had tested positive for Covid-19 from 3.9 lakh tests done. P Rajendra Cholan, special commissioner (health), BBMP, said high CFR is because the denominator - or total positive cases - is less". ‘Focus on reducing CFR to less than 1%’The average daily Covid positive cases has come down to 3,500 in the past one week, whereas it was 6,000-8,000 in a day in the past week. The absolute number of Covid deaths is less. The CFR is calculated not based on the total affected population, but with the total number of Covid cases in the particular time period. There is no increase in the absolute number of deaths,” said Cholan. Read AlsoKarnataka has seen five post-jab fatalitiesTwenty-seven people who took the Covid-19 vaccine experienced serious adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) between January 16 and March 12. Twenty of them recovered and two are in the hospital, while five people passed away.During May, CFR was 2.5%, much higher than 1% CFR in April, Cholan said. “We have to reduce the CFR to less than 1% and efforts are on to this effect. We are analysing the pattern of deaths, especially with regard to brought-dead cases, deaths occurring in home isolation, deaths post discharge,” said Cholan. Dr Giridhara R Babu, epidemiologist and member of Karnataka Covid technical advisory committee, the week-to-week comparison of CFR may not be right as there will be a lag between the surge in cases and surge in deaths. “The week-to-week analysis is helpful in comparison. However, CFR will not go high suddenly, when the cases are going down. There is no reason to believe the case severity is more in the last week. This could be a reflection of the earlier cases and lag time,” said Dr Babu. The Covid deaths seen on a particular day are the cases from 15 days ago, according to experts. BBMP officers up to 80% of the deaths are among senior citizens with comorbidities. The civic body is checking on the vaccination status of senior citizens who have succumbed to Covid. “Nearly 20% of the deaths are among youngsters and middle-aged without comorbidities. This is worrisome,” said Cholan.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Doctors in 3 hospitals...should’ve suspected custodial torture||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Justice K Narayana Kurup commission of inquiry, which probed the custodial torture of Rajkumar by Nedumkandam police and his subsequent death, has found serious lapses on the part of doctors at Nedumkandam and Peermade taluk hospitals and Kottayam medical college hospital. Rajkumar of Kolahalamedu, Idukki — who was taken into police custody on June12, 2019 — had died nine days later after he was brutally tortured in police custody. The commission report, tabled in the assembly, explains in detail the “callous and irresponsible” behaviour of these doctors, who failed in diagnosing Rajkumar's actual condition when he was taken to these hospitals. “They, the doctors in all the three hospitals, forgot for a moment that Rajkumar was brought by the police in a moribund condition, after making him a mincemeat, unable to walk, speak or move, and in such a scenario, they should have suspected custodial torture..,” it says. Insulate docs from policeAt Nedumkandam taluk hospital, where Rajkumar was brought after three days in custody, unable to walk or speak, casualty medical officer Vishnu Mohan — despite suspecting police assault — only advised him to be kept under observation. The next day, he was examined by another doctor, Padmadev P N, who without fully examining his body issued a medical certificate to police for producing him before the judicial magistrate, the report says. ‘Victim had gained 8kg in 6 days’Though he was in the hospital for 18 hours, no one cared to examine him to ascertain his actual medical condition to bring out the “iceberg phenomenon”, wherein, a large percentage of the hidden problem is submerged from view and only the tip is seen from outside, it finds. The report said the victim had gained 8kg in six days due to the fluid overload, after suffering grave internal injuries from torture. At Peermade taluk hospital, where he was brought from Peerumedu sub-jail after his condition worsened, he was examined by doctors inside the ambulance, where once again they missed all injuries on his back, despite noticing the swellings on knees and ankles. The doctor who examined him stated before the commission that he did not suspect the patient of having any visible injury and did not get sufficient time to examine him thoroughly. Rajkumar was taken to Kottayam medical college hospital at the behest of doctors at Peermade taluk hospital. He was examined by orthopaedics senior resident Libin Thomas Manathara, urology senior resident Mohammed Anwar Aslam, surgery additional professor Sunil and radiology senior resident K Vivek, to whom Rajkumar mentioned about the police assault, as per the commission findings. The inquiry also found that the first post-mortem examination by doctors at Kottayam MCH -- led by associate professor and deputy police surgeon Jameskutty B K and medical officer, department of forensic medicine Subiraj Natarajan -- was casual, perfunctory, amateurish and without following the NHRC guidelines. It found that the post-mortem certificate “maintained a suspicious silence on major contusions suffered by Rajkumar”, which was brought out in the second autopsy by a team of forensic surgeons as instructed by the commission. The commission found that the first autopsy was only a half-truth, in which torture and complications of multiple blunt force injuries etc did not find a place. The autopsy report was unclear and ambiguous with the distinct possibility of people thinking that the deceased had died due to pneumonia and not torture, it said. “But for the re-autopsy performed by a team of three forensic surgeons as ordered by the commission, the death of Rajkumar would have been a riddle wrapped in mystery," the commission said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-doctors-in-3-hospitals-shouldve-suspected-custodial-torture/articleshow/83296329.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Kolkata||Ballistic team to examine Sitalkuchi firing site today||Kolkata: The CID is taking a ballistic team from the State Forensic Science Laboratory to Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar on Monday after initial investigations have indicated that the April 10 firing by CISF personnel during assembly elections there could have taken place aimed towards the booth. “Initial investigations have found a bullet mark on the classroom door that was acting as the polling booth entrance. FSL experts will be studying the area and ascertain at what height those (bullets) were fired and the distance travelled by the bullets. This will also ascertain the long-time controversy if bullets were indeed aimed at the chest,” a CID source said on Sunday. The fresh developments come on the evidence of the four-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) that had travelled to Sitalkuchi last month and studied the area minutely. “Forensic reports will be crucial for this probe. We cannot go wrong in this respect,” an officer said. CID sources said they might yet again examine the six witnesses, including two women who are prime witnesses. Senior CID officers had earlier spoken to the minor who was allegedly beaten up by CISF jawans, an event widely believed to have triggered the incident. The six witnesses’ statements, claimed sources, are crucial to verify those recorded by five Bengal police officers before CID at Bhawani Bhavan earlier. CID said it will also decide in the next few days the further course of action regarding six CISF personnel who were summoned between May 26 and June 2 to Bhawani Bhavan. These personnel were on duty that fateful day and were believed to have opened fire. “None of the personnel turned up to record his statement for the second time in a row. We have not received any communication from CISF in this regard. We are hoping to get a formal communication from them in the next few days,” an officer said in Kolkata. The CID brass has indicated that all probe developments will be shared with the Calcutta High Court once the case comes up for hearing. The CID officer ruled out any virtual questioning, saying it was not covered under CrPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ballistic-team-to-examine-sitalkuchi-firing-site-today/articleshow/83291945.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The agency has come across inputs that Vinay has gone to Vanuatu in Polynesia and may want to join the investigation virtually. His lawyers, however, refused to comment on it. “We cannot comment on the matter. The Calcutta High Court had on April 22 passed an order and asked Vinay Mishra to appear before it on May 3. He could not appear due to the pandemic and we sought a modification of the order. The hearing is scheduled on Monday,” said Ayan Poddar, Vinay’s lawyer. CBI had issued a lookout circular against Vinay this March following an arrest warrant by the agency’s special court in Asansol. Officials have reasons to believe Vinay had first gone to Dubai and then left for another country. CBI sources said Vinay allegedly worked as a frontman for Enamul Haque — the prime accused in the cross-border illegal cattle trade — and stashed money for him. The Enforcement Directorate, probing the illegal coal mining case, had earlier claimed that prime accused Anup Majee had given several crores to Vinay. Vinay’s brother Vikas was arrested by ED.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/coal-cattle-scam-accused-vinay-may-have-left-country-cbi/articleshow/83291932.cms||Rohit Khanna

Chand said that India’s policies on subsidy, price and technology have remained too much in favour of rice, wheat and sugarcane, and there is need to make the procurement and minimum support price policy favourable to pulses. “Covid cases started spreading in the rural areas in May, and agriculture activity in the month is bare minimal,” he added. “...it (May) is a peak summer month and no crop is sown, no crop is harvested except some off-season crops.” Agriculture activity, he said, peaks in March or till middle of April. “So even if less availability of labour is there in May till mid-June, I don’t think that will impact agriculture,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-second-wave-wont-hit-agri-sector-says-niti-aayog-member/articleshow/83296505.cms||---

In Patna, there are 13 branches of IMA. The decision for filing separate cases was taken at a meeting chaired by acting president Dr Ajay Kumar following a call from the IMA. The national president-elect of the IMA, Dr Sahjanand Prasad Singh, was also present in the meeting. He said similar cases were being lodged in other states of the country. The IMA’s national body has also started chemical examination of Coronil in a government lab in New Delhi. It is an Ayurvedic medicine promoted by Ramdev as immunity booster and effective against respiratory problems and fever caused by bacteria or virus. “The Covid-19 pandemic came as a big challenge for the medical system of the world and all countries fought with most of the common measures, medicines and line of treatment. India did its best and also became the leader in developing the vaccines and launching the immunisation drive,” Dr Sahjanand said. He, however, lamented that Ramdev’s derogatory tone and sceptical remarks against allopathic treatment, oxygen administration to severe Covid patients and even the vaccines being administered to protect people created an environment of doubt and suspicion in the society at a time when the medical fraternity was rendering tireless services and many of them and their kin died. “Ramdev should set up a Covid hospital, like many private hospitals, and help people in trying times instead of raising doubts on modern medicine,” Dr Sahjanand said. IMA Bihar secretary Dr Sunil Kumar said the state branch would lodge a case within a few days and all other units would do the same soon. A grant of Rs10 lakh from the IMA’s national Covid Martyrs Fund was presented by Dr Sahjanand to Sugandhi Devi, wife of Dr Anil Kumar Singh of Muzaffarpur, who died of the Covid recently. The meeting also urged the state government to make provisions for appointing all the unemployed doctors by relaxing some of its conditions for building up a better healthcare system. Dr Sunil also expressed condolences over the death of 151 doctors in Bihar due to the Covid infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/105-ima-units-to-file-cases-against-ramdev/articleshow/83289317.cms||VK Tripathi

He said that his party has given him an opportunity to serve the people and that he was trying to make the best use of it. "The rest is left to the high command," he added. On the reported lack of leadership options in the state BJP, Yediyurappa said he would not endorse speculation and added that there is "a plenty of options both at national and state levels". The CM said he did not want to criticize anybody, including dissidents who approached the Delhi leadership. Within hours, the state party leadership came out to back the CM and downplay his statements. Union minister Pralhad Joshi ruled out "any intention" of replacing him as the CM at present. "He is doing a good job amid the Covid crisis and despite his age. He has expressed loyalty to the party and said he would obey the high command's order." BSY not power hungry: KateelParty state president Nalin Kumar Kateel said Yediyurappa had proved himself to be an “idol” for the state cadre and his statement was that of a loyal party leader and worker. “He has never been power hungry. The BJP has never discussed it (Yediyurappa’s resignation) on any platform. He is our unanimous leader. Our national leaders have made it clear there is no change of leadership in the state. Hence, all these debates are irrelevant,” Kateel said. Yediyurappa’s close aides – ministers Basavaraj Bommai and R Ashoka -- tried to downplay the debate. “The CM seems to have been pained by some people visiting New Delhi and projecting themselves as leaders and chief minister candidates. This, at a time when the state is reeling under the pandemic,” said revenue minister R Ashoka. Asked about the high command’s no-action stance against dissidents, Ashoka said BJP general secretary Arun Singh has made it clear to all of them that there would be no leadership change. Bommai said the government will prevail upon the national leadership on the need to bring discipline in the party’s rank and file. Yediyurappa’s son BY Raghavendra read his father’s statement “as nothing but an assertion that the BJP central leadership has backed the CM”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-bs-yediyurappa-spikes-rumours-says-will-stay-as-cm-till-party-asks-him-to-resign/articleshow/83296564.cms||---

---||India||Experts suggest way to measure O2 saturation for support info||MUMBAI: A leading public hospital has proposed a simple method to predict which Covid-19 patients are likely to require oxygen support or higher care during hospitalisation. In a research paper published in the latest edition of JAPI, doctors from KEM Hospital’s pulmonary medicine department said the assessment only requires one’s oxygen saturation readings to be taken once while lying down and immediately another reading while sitting up. If the readings differ quite a bit, it is possible the patient has Covid-induced platypnea-orothodeoxia syndrome (POS) — a condition in which breathlessness is alleviated when lying down and worsens while sitting or standing up. “Even a fall in oxygen saturation in sitting position as compared to supine position can predict the need for oxygen therapy,” said the study. The doctors, led by head of department Dr Amita Athawale, said POS could be an “uncommonly common bedside sign”. “Normally it should be equal in sitting and lying down position. But in Covid, different readings in sitting or standing position suggest s/he be checked early for hypoxia.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/experts-suggest-way-to-measure-o2-saturation-for-support-info/articleshow/83296566.cms||---

Despite the pandemic, a student of the country's premier tech school bagged the highest annual pay package of Rs 51.5 lakh from a startup. The average student yearly pay package has gone up to Rs 11 lakh this year from Rs 10 lakh last year. 269 companies took part in campus hiring, 15 yet to joinInterestingly, more companies have participated in this year’s recruitment drive, which will go on till end of June. Till now, 269 companies have taken part in the process, and 15 companies are yet to join in. This year, the company tally is expected to be 284, way higher than 256 of the last year. The institute has 800 undegraduate students, of which 666 were eligible for the drive. And 566 students of them have been made job offers so far. The PG sections have 600 students, and 541 candidates of them are participating in the placement process. As many as 339 (or 57%) candidates have been placed so far. Last year, most of the recruitments had been done in the traditional fashion before Covid-19 broke out towards the end of March, and only the last few days of the drive went online. Vijay Desai, chairman of career development centre of NIT-K, Surathkal, said the institution expects at least 30 more BTech and MTech students to land jobs by this month-end. Some legacy companies which were on the campus include Isro, BEL, BEL-CRL and GAIL, and they zeroed in on a good number of students from BTech and MTech streams. CS & IT students in demandAlmost every single student of Computer Science and IT was picked with these streams accounting for 100% and 98%, respectively, campus hiring. At least 70% BTech students from each department walked away with job offers. About 80 students – or 10% of total BTech strength in the final year – stayed away from placements since they said they have secured admissions for higher studies in institutions in India and abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/in-online-nit-karnataka-hiring-student-bags-rs-51-lakh-pay/articleshow/83296604.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The induction of Nataraj, who was the first transgender to be honoured with a Padma Shri in 2019, and Mallika Srinivasan, CMD, TAFE Limited, and a third-term legislator Rajaa, who recently obtained a doctorate, and a former senate member of the University of Madras has broad-based the representation to the council. “We promised in our manifesto to broad base such councils that will suggest areas of focus to put Tamil Nadu on the growth path across sectors. Another council that will advise the state on finance is likely to be announced soon,” said DMK spokesman T K S Elangovan. Policy body was reorganised by previous govtA State Planning Commission was originally established by former chief minister M Karunanidhi in 1971 as an advisory body to recommend developmental schemes for the state. While presenting the state’s budget in 2017, finance minister D Jayakumar had promised to reorganise the Planning Commission as SDPC and facilitate it to play a larger role including suggesting ways to achieve higher economic growth for Tamil Nadu. His promise was fulfilled three years later, when the previous AIADMK government formed the SDPC on April 23, 2020 but retained former state finance minister C Ponnaiyan as its vice-chairman, a post he was handling for the State Planning Commission. Among the other part-time members, Vijayabaskar is with Madras Institute of Development Studies, while Ismail, an ecologist, was formerly director of EcoScience Research Foundation.

In her reply to Mysuru regional chief GC Prakash, who is investigating whether heritage norms were violated, Sindhuri claimed the construction of the pool was a "pilot project" under Nirmithi Kendra. Sindhuri stated that since the government body "had no space to execute the project", it used a small portion at the bungalow. The pool was constructed in January at a cost of Rs 28 lakh and the project was approved at a Nirmithi Kendra general body meeting. Incidentally, the local DC is chairman of Nirmithi Kendra society. ‘Pool land not connected to heritage bldg’The 2009-batch IAS officer pointed out that new buildings were constructed on the premises of heritage properties such as Mysore City Corporation, Vasanth Mahal, Jaladarshini and the RC Office (High View). She stated that “none of these constructions in the campuses were considered as any violation to the heritage building.” In her letter dated June 5, which she released to the media, the IAS officer said: “Nirmithi Kendra executed the pool work at Rs 28.7 lakh out of its own funds as per its prescribed objectives to test and implement locally available resources by adopting cost-effective technology (sic).” The bungalow is spread over 5.1 acres and the pool occupies a small piece of land which is unconnected with the heritage building, she said. After a row erupted over construction of the pool, the revenue department, on May 31, ordered the RC to conduct a probe. Sindhuri’s explanation is in response to information which the RC had sought on June 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/pool-at-mysuru-dcs-house-cost-rs-28-lakh-to-build-admits-rohini/articleshow/83296647.cms||---

Weddings, however, are sober and confined to smaller groups than usual. For instance, Bharatmatrimony recorded its best ever numbers since its inception in 1997 in both new registrations and successful marriages fixed through its site. Betterhalf.AI saw the number of subscribers double last year. “Soon after the lockdown was announced, we pivoted our business and made our site easy to use for both bride and groom seekers. The reported success stories (marriages concluded) for FY21 were one lakh as against 96,000 a year before. The actual numbers may be four or five times higher as not everyone informs us,” said founder of Bharatmatrimony Murugavel Janakiraman. “I would say that 2020-21 was the best ever fiscal year after we lost a few weeks to sudden lockdown,” he added. ON AN UPTICKPaid subscriber on matrimony sites rose in 2020 Subscriber additions too saw a smart uptick. Paid subscriptions of Matrimony-.com went up by 8.4 lakh, up 19%, during the period. Ditto for other online match-making enablers. BetterHalf.ai, an AI-powered matchmaking app for marriages doubled its paid subscriber base in 2020 adding 5,000 new subscribers in the year. The company’s monthly revenues too have grown 10% month-on-month from 2019 to 2020 and stood at around $30,000 per month in 2020. The app claims a daily active user base of around 50,000 with users spending an average of 10 minutes per day on the app. The startup, which was a participant in Silicon Valley’s Y Combinator, recently closed a $3 million pre Series A funding round. Pawan Gupta, co-founder, Betterhalf.ai. said the overall matchmaking industry has seen a 20%-30% jump in their active users and revenues during the pandemic. “People staying more at home and the need to talk to a companion has led to a surge in user-activity for partners. While we don’t think more people got married in 2020, their activity on matchmaking apps grew by 20% to 30%,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-marriages-are-made-in-heaven-matchmaking-happens-online/articleshow/83296601.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

As per the composite 70-point grading index assessing the quality of school education, Tamil Nadu got 906 points out of 1,000 points, an increase of more than 100 points compared to 2018-19. Only Punjab ( (929) and Chandigarh (912) have performed better than TN, which also moved two grades up from grade II to grade I ++. Among the southern states, however, TN (132) has the lowest score in learning outcome and quality compared to Karnataka (160), Kerala (154), Andhra Pradesh (154) and Telangana (142). In access to school, only Kerala (79) and Punjab (79) have better scores than TN (77). In infrastructure and facilities too TN fared well, with only Punjab, Delhi and Chandigarh being ahead of the state. “According to the ASER 2018 report, one in four TN children in Class VIII were not able to read Class II level text. Only 50% students studying in Class VIII were able to do division. The reports from National Achievement Survey(NAS) and Annual Status Report on Education (ASER) on learning outcomes over the past10 years are worrying,” said educational activist B Oliver. Burden of elementary school teachers should be reducedTamil Nadu also performed well in other domains of equity and governance processes. The grading index was developed to assess the quality of school education offered by states. The information on the indicators is drawn from data available from the Unified District Information System (UDISE), National Achievement Survey (NAS) of NCERT, Mid Day meal website, Public Financial Management System (PFMS) and Shagun portal. The state should focus on foundation literacy and numeracy skills to have better learning outcomes. “The department also needs to focus on basics such as listening, speaking, reading, writing skills for Classes I to VIII students,” B Oliver said. K Devarajan, former director of school education said majority of elementary schools in the state have two teachers. “The teachers are burdened with non-academic work. Most two-teacher schools effectively function as single teacher schools due to various tasks assigned to elementary teachers. Teachers should be left alone to teach and they should be held accountable if students lack basic reading and writing skills,” he said. He further said the school education department should ensure students passing out of Class V should have basic reading and writing skills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/in-south-tamil-nadu-schools-lag-in-learning-outcome/articleshow/83296646.cms||A Ragu Raman

---||World||Netanyahu alleges election fraud, accuses rival of duplicity||JERUSALEM: PM Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday a newly formed Israeli coalition that is poised to unseat him was the result of “the greatest election fraud” in the history of democracy. He made his sweeping accusation at a time when Israel’s domestic security chief has warned publicly about the prospect of political violence. Netanyahu focused his allegations on a broken campaign promise from the man set to replace him as PM, nationalist Naftali Bennett. Bennett had pledged not to partner with left-wing, centrist and Arab parties, but on Wednesday announced with opposition leader Yair Lapid that they had formed a governing coalition with factions from across the political spectrum. Under a rotation deal, Bennett will serve first as PM, followed by Lapid. No date has been set for a vote in parliament to approve the new government, which follows an inconclusive March 23 election, but it is widely expected to be sworn in on June 14. “We are witnessing the greatest election fraud in the history of the country, in my opinion in the history of any democracy,” Netanyahu said in comments to legislators of his right-wing Likud party. “That’s why people justifiably feel deceived and they are responding, they must not be shut up,” he said in the remarks, which referred indirectly to Bennett’s campaign promise not to team up with Lapid and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/netanyahu-alleges-election-fraud-accuses-rival-of-duplicity/articleshow/83296723.cms||---
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: One junior college to be opened in mandals without government college||AMARAVATI: In yet another move to strengthen public education system, the state government has decided to open at least one junior college in mandals where no government college is available. The state government had already identified that 93 mandals are without any government college and asked the district administrations to pick up one suitable high-school to upgrade it as a junior college. New junior colleges would be opened right from the coming academic year. The grant of new junior colleges is expected to help the students from economically challenged communities to pursue their dreams of higher education as many students were dropping out of education at high-school level as they were unable to take the costs in private and corporate educational institutions. The state government has directed the regional intermediate officers and district educational officers to ready the list of high-schools that could be upgraded into junior college. The government asked the officials to keep the available infrastructure in mind before identifying the suitable high-school for conversion of Junior college. Meanwhile, the Municipal Teachers Federation (MTF) state president S Ramakrishna demanded that the government should also open new junior colleges in urban areas as children from slums in towns and cities are unable to access to the higher education. “About 40 per cent of population is residing in urban areas and half of the towns and cities are packed with slums. Lakhs of children are dropping out of education due to high poverty and exorbitant fees in corporate educational institutions. It is high time to focus on strengthening the public education system in towns and cities,” said Ramakrishna. He said that it was unfortunate that not even a single new junior college was sanctioned to the urban areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/andhra-pradesh-one-junior-college-to-be-opened-in-mandals-without-government-college/articleshow/83296705.cms||Samdani MN

Under the Disaster Management Act, they have been ordered to share the contact details, name, address, symptoms and drugs provided to anyone with influenza like symptoms. This is in addition to the previous order where private clinics, hospitals and scan centres were asked to share information about patients with fever and other influenza like symptoms. Now, pharmacies have to send details daily to gccpvtpharmacyreports@chennaicorporation.gov.in. “We realized many people were buying paracetamol and similar medicines over the counter for fever symptoms and did not get tested. And the pharmacies also did not inform us about these patients. To bring them under the ambit of the civic body and to ensure they do not spread the disease to others, we have issued this order. This way, corporation medical officers and doctors will reach out to them and ensure they are tested. And if they test positive, they will be isolated and treatment would begin,” said commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. The order was issued under Section 30(2)(v)(vi) of the Disaster Management Act. The Tamil Nadu Covid19 regulations, 2020, also stated that every facility should immediately inform all suspected Covid cases to the city health officer of Greater Chennai Corporation. The corporation has appointed entomologists for each zone to monitor this. A senior officer said this measure was there last year too but pharmacies didn't share the data regularly as it was done informally. “This year all these measures have been brought under the Disaster Management Act. This way, we have ensured action will be initiated if they do not comply and data will be shared with us daily. A monitoring system will ensure it is followed up every day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-19-chennai-corporation-orders-pharmacies-to-share-with-it-details-of-people-buying-paracetamol-other-medicines/articleshow/83296767.cms||Komal Gautham
---||Business||Central Bank, IOB may be taken up for privatisation||NEW DELHI: The Centre may sell its stake in Central Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) as part of its mega privatisation initiative unveiled in the Union Budget in February. While the two banks have been recommended for disinvestment by government think tank NITI Aayog, Bank of India (BoI) may be a potential candidate for sale, sources familiar with the deliberations told TOI. The proposal from the government think tank is being vetted by the disinvestment and financial services departments, ministry sources said. The exercise is part of a multi-stage process for finalising entities that are to be taken up for privatisation. While NITI Aayog has been tasked with recommending the names, it is then reviewed by the inter-ministerial group of officers and subsequently by a group of ministers, before the Union Cabinet puts its seal of approval. Sources in the department of investment and public asset management (Dipam), which handles the government’s asset sales programme, said it will examine the proposal with the department of financial services and discuss the legislative changes needed for the privatisation of the state-run banks. “The timeline will depend on the legislative changes required,” the sources added. Besides, the issue will have to be discussed in detail with the RBI as the law and regulations provide a special dispensation for state-run entities in several areas. The Cabinet recently cleared the decks for the sale of government stake in IDBI Bank, but sale of the Centre’s holding in the two staterun entities will break new ground as the Narendra Modi administration has embarked on an ambitious privatisation drive, which for the first time includes the financial services space. The government is hoping to conclude the sale of IDBI Bank stake during the current financial year. Among the dozen staterun lenders, NITI Aayog had set its eyes on the six entities that were not part of the merger initiative a few years ago and included Bank of Maharashtra, Punjab & Sind Bank and UCO Bank in addition to BoI, IOB and Central Bank. It, however, was of the view that the better off entities would attract greater interest, resulting in the shortlisting of IOB and Central Bank. Based on the current share price, the two entities are together valued at around Rs 44,000 crore with IOB’s market cap estimated at Rs 31,641 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/central-bank-iob-may-be-taken-up-for-privatisation/articleshow/83296734.cms||Surojit Gupta

The action came a couple of hours after a video of the woman, who gave her name as Tanuja Kanthulla and claimed to be an advocate, went viral on social media and a head constable lodged a complaint. In his petition, Rajith Kumar of the Chetpet traffic police said he was on duty with his colleagues Prabhakaran, Anand and Vimalraj when they intercepted a car around 7.45am for not following the protocol. The driver, who identified herself as Preethi Rajan of Kilpauk, said she was on her way to purchase fish on the beach but did not possess an epass. Police took her licence, registered a case and handed over an e-challan. The woman then made a call on her mobile phone. Within a couple of minutes, Tanuja Kanthulla arrived in a highend car, hurled abuses at the police personnel and threw away the e-challan, the complaint said. In the video, which runs for nearly 2.17 minutes, Tanuja, who said she was an advocate, threatened to strip the police personnel of their uniform if they did not mend their ways. “She was not wearing a mask, another violation, and grew furious when we asked her to put it on. We asked her to speak politely to which she refused,” said Rajith Kumar. The woman was booked under Sections 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant.), 294 B (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place,), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 506 (1) criminal intimidation. Stating that Sunday’s incident was unpleasant, the city police appealed to the public to cooperate with the law enforcers in implementing lockdown restrictions. Field officers have also been instructed to treat the violators politely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/woman-booked-for-lockdown-violation-in-chennai/articleshow/83296896.cms||---

Nestle’s statement comes at a time when it is stepping up consumer engagement across India after being hit by global reports that said more than 60% of its product portfolio falls into the unhealthy category. “Recent reports have questioned the healthfulness of Nestle products, because of a global internal working document that was reported out of context,” said a Nestle India spokesperson. “The portfolio analysis only covers about half the global sales, since several prominent categories were not included.” “Our approach as a credible, trustworthy and responsible company is to always communicate with consumers on facts, in a humble and transparent tone and manner,” said the spokesperson. “In fact, looking at the global portfolio as a whole, less than 30% would not meet stringent external ‘healthfulness’ standards, mostly representing indulgent products, which are acceptable in moderation as part of a healthy, balanced and enjoyable diet.” The maker of KitKat and Maggi noodles said over the next few days it will enhance its engagement with consumers, reassuring them that it genuinely cares about what matters to them. The company, however, did not reveal the percentage of its domestic portfolio that falls into the healthy or unhealthy category. A TOI report had earlier said Nestle aims to accelerate the launch of fortified products and reduce percentage of salt and sugar in its existing offerings. An international presentation circulated among top Nestle executives earlier this year revealed only 37% of Nestle’s food and beverage products had a rating of over 3.5 as per Australia’s health star rating system in which products are given scores on a scale where maximum is 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nestle-less-than-30-products-fail-health-norms/articleshow/83296898.cms||John Sarkar

My elder son, Kulwant, died in a road accident 7-8 months ago. Rinku is married. About 12.30 pm on Saturday, I came to Pehowa to purchase domestic items from my village. About 3 pm, I was walking home from the village bus stand when somebody told me that Rinku had injured Jagmal, who had been rushed to Mission Hospital, Pehowa, by my brother-in-laws Balbir and Satpal.” “I reached the Mission Hospital and saw that my husband was seriously injured. When I inquired, it came to light that Rinku attacked him over domestic issues after a heated argument about 3 pm. My husband had been mentally upset since Kulwant’s death. Rinku and Jagmal used to argue often over petty issues. Jagmal died on the way to hospital,” said Praveen in the complaint. Pehowa police station house officer (SHO) sub-inspector (SI) Suresh Kumar said, “The accused was arrested on Saturday and the weapon used in crime also recovered.

He has pointed out that resentment is brewing in minds of environment-lovers against the proposed move. Earlier, Arora had approached the National Green Tribunal against the felling of over 2,000 trees at a closed sugar mill compound in Faridkot. In his email sent on Sunday, Arora has written that the perusal of a letter dated April 2, issued by the department of forests to SDO (water supply and sanitation), of Muktsar, reveals that the proposal to remove 256 trees for purpose of laying down underground water pipe has been approved, and trees are being auctioned/sold out. He mentioned that laying an underground water pipe is not a project which would require removing such a large number of trees. In Chandigarh, he said, underground cables or pipes are laid at times, but not a single tree is removed for that reason. May be the proposed project requires removal of 5-6 trees, but not of 256 fully grown trees in what he described as a “wholesale manner. It appears the forest department is doing a mindless exercise, he said, adding that the decision requires serious reconsideration at highest level. The forest cover in Punjab is just 3.67%, against the national goal to increase it to 33.33% of total area. In the face of such a grim situation, any decision to remove even a single tree must be taken in rare cases, he said. The trees require protection against indiscriminate felling, he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/lawyer-writes-to-chief-secy-to-reconsider-okay-to-axe-256-trees-for-pipe/articleshow/83292045.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh: Drunk ‘baraatis’ held hostage after bride calls off wedding||PRAYAGRAJ: A 22-year-old bride from a Pratapgarh hamlet walked out of the wedding ceremony after her would-be husband and his band of guests turned up drunk at the venue and tried to force her to groove to music onstage before exchange of vows. Sensing the insult, the bride’s family swiftly held the groom and ‘baraatis’ hostage and asked them to return dowry gifts even as cops arrived to mediate amidst a heightened drama in the district’s Tikri village late Saturday. The woman refused to budge even after the groom’s family called police, requesting them to mediate and solemnise the wedding. Talking to TOI, station house officer, Mandhata, Shrawan Kumar Singh said, “A farmer from Tikri village had arranged his daughter’s marriage with a Ravendra Patel of Kutiliya Ahina village during the corona curfew. He had made necessary arrangements for the ceremony, but the groom and ‘baraatis’ arrived drunk. Initially, the bride’s family ignored their overtures, but the situation turned ugly when the groom pressed the bride to dance before the jaimala ceremony. When the bride refused, the groom created a ruckus. Irked by his behaviour, the bride walked out and her family members held the baraatis captive.” Police were sent an SOS and they rushed to the wedding venue to resolve the issue. “The crisis ended when the groom’s family agreed to return cash and other gifts taken from the girl’s family when the marriage was fixed,” said the police officer.

Since June 1, the city has registered a dip of about 60% in occupancy rates at hospitals and now, the health department plans to reduce ICU and ventilator beds reserved for Covid patients from 75% to 50%. General Covid ward beds will be reduced to 30% from 60% in each hospital, officials said. The move will provide a breather to hospitals struggling to admit non-Covid patients. Gurgaon chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Virender Yadav said: “We are getting less than 100 cases daily for the past few days and hence, we will reduce the existing 75% reserved ICU and ventilator Covid beds in 42 hospitals across the city to 50%. For Covid ward beds, the reservation will be reduced to 30% from 50%. The number of Covid beds might be reduced further depending on the case load.” The current positivity rate in Gurgaon is about 1%. While there were 2,657 Covid patients in hospitals on May 1, the number fell to 201 by June 1. The number of patients in ICUs has come down by about 95%. It was 1,102 on May 1 and one month later, on June 1, the figure was 50. The number of patients requiring ventilator support was 337 on May 1, on June 6, it was 22. On Sunday, 81 Covid patients were hospitalised in Gurgaon and 29 of them were in ICU. In the 42 hospitals across Gurgaon, there are 5,658 beds of which 2,829 are reserved for Covid patients. Before the recent surge, 1,810 beds had been set aside for Covid patients. Officials have said several Covid beds are vacant and they are discussing the possibility of reducing the number of beds further. “We have asked the health department to submit a proposal on how many Covid beds can be reduced, given the current situation,” said a senior official from the district administration. “This will help more non-Covid patients who are seeking treatment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-set-to-reduce-covid-19-beds-in-hosps-as-cases-dip/articleshow/83291353.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Gurgaon||Schools with less than 10 kids told to step up enrolment||Gurgaon: Facing resistance from the teachers over closure of schools with an enrolment status of less than 10 students, the education department has decided to give an opportunity to these schools to reassess the possibilities of reopening the schools. Directorate of school education has decided to reconsider its decision to shut down all the schools that have less than 10 students enrolled in them. The department has asked the gram panchayats and villagers to raise the request for reopening the schools that were decided to be shut down or merged with the nearest government school. The district education department has been asked to prepare a report on the status of all such schools and the ones that can be reopened. The officials, however, will have to assure that the enrolment status of these schools will be improved in this academic year. “The department has received few requests to reassess its plan to shut down or merge. These schools had less than 10 students and we wanted to rationalise our resources. However, if the villagers want the schools to be operational, they can send their requests to the respective district education department. If the overall enrolment in these schools can be increased to over 25 students, then we can consider reopening them,” said an official. The move comes after villagers, with the support of government school teachers, demanded the schools that are within the 1 km radius of the villages should not be shut down. Last month, the education department had decided to close down over 40 primary schools in the state that have less than 10 students enrolled in them. Additionally, orders were issued to merge around 175 primary and 51 middle schools having student enrolment less than 25 with the nearest state-run schools. Department has termed this as a regular rationalisation exercise to maximize the utilization of their resources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/schools-with-less-than-10-kids-told-to-step-up-enrolment/articleshow/83291506.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

---||Gurgaon||Restos and bars can open with 50% capacity, so can corporate offices||Gurgaon: Bars and restaurants in Haryana have been allowed to open with 50% capacity between 10am and 8pm, a move that will pro-vide a much-needed relief to the staggering hospitality industry. Corporate offices can also open with 50% staff strength, provided all Covid protocols are followed and the premises are sanitised at regular intervals. The Haryana government on Sunday extended the lockdown by a week till June 14 but offered several relaxations considering a dip in the number of daily Covid cases. The government order specified that restaurants and bars should ensure a seating arrangement where there is sufficient social distance between each table. The eateries will also have to undertake regular sanitisation and ensure all its workers and guests wear masks. They will have to close for dining sharp at 8pm but can take orders for home deliveries till 10pm. The closing timing of malls has been extended by 2 hours till 8pm. Owners of restaurants and bars in the city backed the government decision but also urged the authorities to extend the closing time. “We had been eagerly waiting to open and serve our customers. However, the government should ideally revise the timings because a majority of the restaurants’ earnings come during the dinner time. The opening hours are a bit dull. For many, it can get a little difficult with the current norms,” said Inderjeet Singh Banga, the owner of Pirates of Grill. He added that the government should prioritise workers of the hospitality sector and ensure they are vaccinated at the earliest. Monica Kumari, who owns Nook Gourmet and Nook Inn and Suites Hotel, said the hospitality sector needed to resume business at the earliest to make up for the losses it had incurred during the lockdowns. “This is a good decision, considering the fact that Covid-19 will take longer to be erased fully. Business owners and customers need to fight this situation together. We seek the support of customers to maintain social distance and follow other protocols,” she added. Games will resume at the Golf Course between 10am and 8pm. The club house, restaurants and bars at the Golf Course will also open, but the authorities have been asked to ensure there is no crowding. A maximum of 21 people can visit temples and other places of worship at a time. Weddings, funerals and cremation will be allowed with no more than 21 people. The order has also said that weddings can be held outside houses, but no procession would be allowed. For other gatherings, a maximum of 50 people have been allowed. For more than 50, permission has to be taken from the deputy commissioner. Similarly, the timing of shops in crowded markets has been extended from 9am-3pm to 9am-6pm. An odd-even rule has already been imposed for standalone shops. This means that shops with an odd number can open on odd days while those with an even number on the remaining days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/restos-and-bars-can-open-with-50-capacity-so-can-corporate-offices/articleshow/83291743.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Gurgaon||From one lockdown to another, how small businesses in Gurugram are struggling||GURUGRAM: With the pandemic and the lockdown last year, several businesses suffered huge losses. But as things looked up towards the end of 2020 and many traders and entrepreneurs found their businesses crawling back to normalcy. Another lockdown this year, however, has changed the picture. Smaller businesses have either lost the race or are struggling to stay afloat. People have devised various methods in an attempt to cut down losses. While some have changed their businesses, others have adopted more customer-friendly models to retain old clients and get new ones. TOI spoke to a few owners of small businesses to see how they are coping. Zuber Ahmed, flute sellerZuber Ahmed had moved to Gurugram from Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh three years ago. He knew the basics of playing a flute and once in the city, he thought it would help him earn a living. Zuber started selling flutes and playing it at birthday parties and small events. For the past few months, his business had slowly picked up compared to last year. But then Covid cases started rising again and a lockdown was announced. “I would make Rs 1,000 a day and from that I would keep Rs 600 for myself and the rest of the money would go towards buying flutes. Now, I barely make Rs 200-300 a day,” Zuber said. “I took lessons on YouTube so I could get better. But no parties are happening now and I hardly get a chance to play,” he said. He stays in Gurugram’s Sector 10 with his wife and two daughters. He had taken a loan of Rs 9,200 that he needs to repay. Recently, one of Zuber’s acquaintances tweeted about him and sought help. Zuber got some donations and the family left for Sultanpur. Ajay Kumar, grocery store ownerIn March, Ajay Kumar opened a grocery store, along with a small counter for homemade masks and sanitisers. He had a mobile phone accessory shop earlier, but with sales dipping, he thought a grocery store was a better idea. “There was not much left in the mobile accessories business due to tough competition,” he said. According to Kumar, in the past one year, two businesses have done well, grocery and health-related products. “Becoming a chemist requires some qualifications and a licence. But setting up a grocery store is relatively easy. Also, anyone in the family can run it, if I am not around,” he said. With his old shop, he used to earn Rs 1,000 a day. But that has doubled now. Sometimes, the daily earning is even more than that, he said. Vipin Dabas, salon ownerSalon owner Vipin Dabas said the business has seen a dip of about 50 % in the past one year. “I am not able to support my staff. I had 12 of them earlier, but after the first wave, the number came down to seven. Although my landlord supported me by reducing the rent by about 50% initially, and 40% of that amount after that, my balance sheet is in the negative,” said Dabas, whose salon is in Sector 23. “I urge the government and landlords of all salons to support us at this time when our businesses have been hit hard,” he said.Dabas added that after the lockdown was lifted last year, the daily footfall at his salon was down by 50-60%. “The maintenance cost is killing the business. Although some salons have shifted to home-service mode, that cannot be a replacement for in-store services,” he said. His staff members are also struggling. With marriages and other events getting cancelled or postponed, there is hardly any work, he said. Sunita Lather, boutique ownerWhen Sunita Lather opened her shop at a rented basement space at Sector 51, the business had a lot of promise. “But the lockdown was announced and I had to shut my boutique. I did not have any knowledge of online businesses and I could not make a shift to that mode,” she said. Later, when the restrictions were relaxed, her landlord was not comfortable with reopening the shop. Hence, the store has been shut since March last year, she said. Her husband has a grocery store at Ardee City. But most people buy things online, sales figures are not good. Recently, he has started home delivery services but he is not able to compete with the big stores. Sunita said she is waiting for the lockdown to be lifted so that she can reach out to her clients. Chandra Bhan, cosmetic store ownerFor Chandra Bhan, the lockdown has been a big setback for his cosmetic store in Faridabad. “I was making about Rs 20,000 a day. But the business has suffered a lot since last year,” he said, adding that daily sales have been reduced to Rs 5,000. He had to let go of several workers and now, the store has less than half of its previous strength. “People are not going out. Weddings and other functions are not happening and all this has affected us,” he said. Now that shops can stay open for sometime, Bhan is hopeful that things will slowly get better again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/from-one-lockdown-to-another-how-small-businesses-in-city-are-struggling/articleshow/83291759.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

Among the issues that were discussed was the suspension of licences for repeat offenders, deputing traffic personnel around weekly markets, fixing the numbers and routes of auto and e-rickshaw passengers, challans for unauthorised buses, trucks and other big vehicles, free parking in sector markets and so on. “We held an online meeting on the traffic situation in the city and how to curb the issues related to it. We also raised concerns about regular traffic congestion on MP 2 elevated road and the need for signboards specifying no parking zones. Also, information should be provided regarding the fine amount for violations,” said NP Singh, president of DDRWA. Others suggested streamlining the traffic in Greater Noida near Pari Chowk and action on e-rickshaws and passenger autos for violation of traffic rules, immediate rectification of defective lights at various places in the city and installation of CCTV cameras at major intersections. “We also demanded regulated parking lanes in society markets and at sectors with high rise apartment complexes,” said Anil Singh, member participant. While DCP Saha assured action on all points, he asked for resident and RWA volunteers to help maintain traffic rules in their sectors and feedback on the traffic personnel working in their sectors for improvement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/before-curbs-are-eased-meet-on-citys-traffic/articleshow/83292889.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

Das, who was part of several dance shows and had ended up as a runner-up in one such show seven years ago, was making a living by imparting dance training and taking part in shows. He had also been an assistant choreographer in two films. But the lockdown last year and the second Covid wave made him join a job as a delivery boy. The accident has left him with seven broken ribs and doctors have warned him not to ride bike. Returning to dancing might take longer, they said. Locals claimed the sergeant, posted with Rabindra Sarobar PS, allegedly misbehaved with Das after the incident and even threatened him. Locals then gheraoed the sergeant, demanding his arrest. A force from Lake PS reached the spot and brought the situation under control. Lalbazar has now suspended the sergeant pending further inquiry even as an FIR has been lodged based on a complaint of Das’s wife Sangeeta Mondal Das. “I joined the firm as I could no longer bear to see my father shoulder all financial burden. I had worked barely for 48 hours when I was asked to pick up a delivery from a Biryani joint at Ranikuthi. I was on my bike and near Ashoka Hospital when I saw another two-wheeler coming out of a blind alley at a high speed. It smashed my bike. As I fell, I could hardly breathe and felt a numbing pain on my ribs. Another fellow food delivery employee helped me. A few others also rushed to my help. I told the rider that he should not have ridden the bike at such a speed. He asked me to shut up or face a kick. It was then that I realized that he was a cop,” said Das on Sunday. In her complaint letter, Sangita alleged that the cop was under the influence of alcohol. Das said he was still having issues with breathing and cannot sit straight for long after being released from a hospital at Jodhpur Park after treatment. “I will have to follow the doctor’s advice but I really want to join the job as early as possible,” he said. “CCTV footage has been collected. We will also probe if the sergeant misbehaved with locals,” said a senior officer. DCP (south east) Sudip Sarkar said, “The officer has been suspended pending inquiry. The complaint is being probed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dancer-turned-food-delivery-man-hit-by-cop-on-bike-injured/articleshow/83291032.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The blood bank, which is the largest in the district, has only 46 units left, officials have said. It has a capacity to stock 50 units. With a spike in Covid numbers, blood donation camps have not been held for about two months now. Officials fear that if people do not donate blood, treatment of patients with thalassaemia, anaemia, cancer and renal problems, those who had accidents would be difficult. Officials said, people can donate blood at the hospital any day between 10 am and 4 pm. They have also urged local organisations to organise blood donation camps.  “Not many people are coming to donate blood because of Covid. Moreover, due to the lockdown, many scheduled camps had to be cancelled. Now, it is an emergency situation,” the blood bank’s senior technical officer AK Tomar said. Officials said that it is important to have a steady supply at the blood bank. “Keeping additional units does not serve any purpose, as they become unusable over a period of time,” an official said, adding that usually, 400-450 units of blood are in the bank. Tomar said 15 thalassemia patients are in touch with the blood bank. “Apart from this, blood is also needed for cancer patients, those who are on dialysis and those injured in accidents,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/no-camp-due-to-covid-hosp-faces-blood-stock-crunch/articleshow/83292891.cms||Aditya Dev

---||Gurgaon||1 more sham call centre that targeted US citizens busted||Gurgaon: A call centre in Sector 23 was on Saturday evening busted for allegedly duping US citizens on the pretext of blocking social security numbers and forged arrest warrants, the police said on Sunday. The police said they received a tip-off regarding the fake call centre being run from plot number 3,202 in the sector. Next, a team raided the call centre late on Saturday evening. Around 30 employees were found at the spot, an officer said. During interrogation, the team leader told the police that the call centre had been operational for the past two months and its owners are Jigar Parmar, Maulik, Bhaula and Deepak. “These men purchased customer data from several websites and uploaded them on their own server. This information was used by their employees to call the customers,’” said the officer. On average, 3,000 calls were made per day from the call centre. ACP Cybercrime Karan Goel said the accused identified themselves as officials of the Social Security Administration or the customs department or even the FBI to the victims. “They duped the victims by telling them that their social security numbers had been misused. They also forged arrest warrants with the victims’ details and used it to extract money from them,” Goel told TOI. The police found various such arrest warrants at the site. One of them mentioned that the person concerned was in possession of drugs. The criminals asked the victims to make payments via credit or debit cards or vouchers from brands like Nike, Amazon and Ebay. “Around 90% cases are with gift vouchers whereas the remaining 10% are with card transactions,” said Goel.

Police have registered a case against unknown people and launched a search. The victims have been identified as Nasir Muhammad, the imam of a mosque in Rampur village in Dankaur and one Fateh Mohammad. Both were admitted to a nearby hospital and are now stable. The incident took place around 8.30 pm on Saturday when the victims were praying at the mosque. A local resident said it was a fallout of an argument that took place on Saturday morning between one Wasim and a woman. “Following this, the woman informed her family members about the altercation and they all went to Wasim’s house and threatened them. We thought the matter was resolved but at night, they came to the mosque and attacked others even though they had no connection with Wasim,” he said, adding that another resident, Shafi Mohammad, complained to the Dankaur police. Police said that while the Imam suffered head injuries, Fateh received injuries on his back. Wasim is on the run. Arvind Pathak, SHO of Dankaur police station, said that primary investigation indicates that Wasim allegedly harassed the woman. “We have registered a case against unknown people under section 147 (rioting), section 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), section 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship, with intent to insult the religion of any class) and section 296, (disturbing religious assembly) of IPC,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/woman-harassed-suspect-on-the-run-group-beats-up-2-others-outside-mosque/articleshow/83292907.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

"It is planned to expand the trade with more quantities, chartering exclusive cargo flights with 5 metric tonne capacity daily from Agatti to Bangalore for subsequent transport to Tokyo, Japan." This chartered flight will bring other essential commodities like hatchery eggs from Bangalore to Agatti and return with Tuna fish. The administration said that as per the estimated data of the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), Lakshadweep can harvest up to a lakh metric tonne of Tuna annually. “Lakshadweep is a completely organic territory and devoid of any polluting industries which make sure that no chemicals leach into the aquatic system making the marine resources here free from harmful contaminants. The Lakshadweep tunas are known to have the least histamine content mainly due to their traditional hook-and-line fishing method and short fishing durations. Hence, the tunas of Lakshadweep islands are considered to be of premium quality which can fetch the highest price in the international market,” said the administration. Previously, efforts were made to export dry Tuna fish to Srilanka, however, the price offered was much lesser than the domestic Indian market, hence this could not succeed for long. “Till now, sustainable basic infrastructure facilities, including ice plants, cold storage fish handling centers, etc. were inadequate. Now, three major containerized ice plants with German technology have been installed in Minicoy, Agatti and Amini islands on a war footing. Around 20 tonne-capacity cold storage facilities and other infrastructures also have been created in various Islands,” the administration said. The statement said that a meeting of mega tuna exporters and stakeholders in Lakshadweep was held at Kochi. According to the administration, a Bangalore-based company, Sashmi food Pvt ltd with an approved chilled EU (European Union) export plant, which exports fish and fisheries products to Japan, has expressed its willingness to export Lakshadweep Tuna directly to Japan. The company’s team had reached Agatti during the third week of May and started the groundwork with fishermen and their cooperative society. Fishermen were trained on good handling practices and transportation of packaging materials to Agatti. The Administration has deputed a team of senior officers of the Fisheries Department to facilitate the entire process at Agatti island, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lakshadweep-starts-tuna-export-to-tokyo/articleshow/83297317.cms||---

A week-on-week comparison showed 13 zones in the city had a negative growth rate of fresh cases; that is the number of cases in these zones in the last one week was lower than in the previous week. Royapuram alone showed a minor increase at 0.7%. In neighbouring Thiru-vi-ka Nagar, the growth rate was at zero per cent. The Chennai average itself is -5.5%. The lowest growth rate is in Perungudi (zone 14) at 10.6% percent. Eight of the 15 zones have a lower growth rate than the Chennai average (see graphic). Correspondingly, in the last seven days, there has also been a significant fall in the number of active cases in the city. On the whole, active cases have dropped from 38,680 to 24,290. There has been a drop in all zones. Currently, the maximum number of active cases is in Kodambakkam zone at 2,320 cases.

Brent crude futures for August rose 28 cents, or 0.4%, to $72.17 a barrel by 6:37 am, their highest since May 2019. US West Texas Intermediate crude for July touched $70 for the first time since October 2018 and was at $69.91 a barrel, up 29 cents, or 0.4%. Both contracts have risen for the past two weeks as fuel demand is rebounding in the United States and Europe after governments loosened Covid-19 restrictions ahead of summer travel. Global oil demand is expected to exceed supplies in the second half despite a gradual easing of supply cuts by Opec+ producers, analysts say. A slowdown in talks between Iran and global powers in reviving a 2015 nuclear deal and a drop in US rig count also supported oil prices. Iran and global powers will enter a fifth round of talks on June 10 in Vienna that could include Washington lifting economic sanctions on Iranian oil exports. While the European Union envoy coordinating the negotiations had said he believed a deal would be struck at this week's talks, other senior diplomats have said the most difficult decisions still lie ahead. Analysts expect Iran to increase its production by 500,000 to 1 million barrels per day once sanctions are lifted. In the United States, the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating fell for the first time in six weeks as growth in drilling slowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/oil-hits-new-multi-year-highs-investors-eye-iran-nuclear-talks-this-week/articleshow/83297533.cms||---
---||World||Merkel party wins big in last German state poll before general election||MAGDEBURG, Germany: Angela Merkel's CDU party scored a convincing win on Sunday in the final regional vote before the first general election in 16 years not to feature the veteran chancellor, giving a major boost to her conservative would-be successor. The CDU under new party chief Armin Laschet won around 37 percent of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt, partial results showed, well ahead of the second place far-right party AfD on 21 percent. "This is essentially a sensationally good result," CDU general secretary Paul Ziemiak said. "The CDU has won this election clearly." Merkel's party has been a dominant force in the former East German state of Saxony-Anhalt for decades, topping all but one edition of state elections there since reunification in 1990. But there had been jitters ahead of the vote as pollsters had foreseen a neck-and-neck race between the CDU and the anti-immigration AfD. Ralf Brinkhaus, who heads the conservatives' parliamentary group, said Sunday's clear win "gives us a tailwind" for the national election. "That is also a success for Armin Laschet," he added. Nominated as conservative chancellor candidate in April, Laschet inherited a series of problems including anger over the government's pandemic management and a corruption scandal involving shady coronavirus mask contracts. At Germany's last regional elections in March -- in the states of Rhineland Palatinate and Baden-Wuerttemberg -- the CDU suffered its worst ever results in both states. Laschet himself had also suffered from weak popularity, following damaging infighting within the conservatives for the chancellor candidate nomination. But the mood has picked up in Germany in recent weeks with the country's vaccination campaign gathering pace and large parts of the country reopening after months of shutdowns. Ziemiak credited Laschet for the strong showing Sunday, underlining his participation in the campaign there along with Saxony-Anhalt's state premier Reiner Haseloff. The result, up from 29.8 in 2016, was "the largest increase (in vote share) in a state election since the victory of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia in 2017" -- a win that Laschet had secured for the party. "The voters in Saxony-Anhalt have given Laschet an invaluable gift. After his lousy start as chancellor candidate, it was clear that he would not be a man drawing euphoric optimism for his campaign. Rather, the motto was to sit it out", said Spiegel Online. "What he needs above all is calm, and now he has it," it added. Laschet has promised to maintain the CDU as the "force of the political middle ground" and had vowed not to work with the AfD. The AfD established a strong foothold in Saxony-Anhalt with 24 percent of the vote in 2016, having capitalised on anger over Merkel's decision to allow in a wave of migrants from conflict-torn countries such as Syria in 2015. But the party has failed to improve on its previous score, despite recent moves to attract voters by styling itself as the party bashing Merkel's tough shutdown measures during the pandemic. For Greens leader Annalena Baerbock, whose party scored a disappointing result in Saxony-Anhalt with between 6 and 6.5 percent, the CDU's success was down to voters seeking to block out the AfD. Many people had voted for the CDU because they "did not want right-wing extremists in the government," she said. She admitted however that the Greens' showing was poorer than hoped, as she blamed the "specific" electoral landscape in Saxony-Anhalt for the performance. Though an improvement on 2016's 5 percent, the result could puncture the ecologist party's momentum at the national level -- already hurt by a series of gaffes in recent weeks. Campaigning with a clear focus on climate protection, the party had "not achieved what we set out to do," said Baerbock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/merkel-party-wins-big-in-last-german-state-poll-before-general-election/articleshow/83297461.cms||---

The district has also covered one-third of its target in the 18-44 years group. Neighbouring Ghaziabad, however, has been able to administer the first vaccination dose to about 55% of the targeted population in the 45+ category. For the 18-44 age group, the figure is just about 10%.According to government data, Gautam Budh Nagar has a target of vaccinating about 12 lakh people across all age groups. However, including the migrant population in the district, about 15 lakh people are eligible, sources said. While seven lakh people have taken the first shot, more than one lakh residents have taken both doses. In the 45+ age group, 86% people have taken the first dose. The population in this category is estimated at over three lakh. Those who got one shot also include 85% of the total number of healthcare workers and 79% of frontline workers in the district.  There about eight lakh people in the district are in the 18-44 category. Ghaziabad has a population of around 46 lakh and about half of that is over 18 years old. According to official data, the district has a target of inoculating about 23 lakh people. While over 15 lakh are in the 18-44 years bracket, more than 7 lakh are in the 45 + group. In the 18-44 group, 1.5 lakh people have got the first dose.  In the 45+ category, close to four lakh people have got the first shot. Around 73,000 people have got both the doses, officials said. The district has fully vaccinated 16,300 healthcare and 11,650 frontline workers. Since January 16, when the drive started, about seven lakh doses have already been administered in Ghaziabad and the health department has given 64% of the doses in April and May, officials said. Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said: “We need to vaccinate about 15 lakh people in total. There are many government and private centres that are inoculating people, including 24x7 sites and drive-through centres. People should take advantage of these facilities so that the entire population is vaccinated at the earliest.” He added that so far, the district is at the top in terms of the number of vaccines administered across the state. Those who stay outside the state, however, are finding it difficult to get jabs at Uttar Pradesh centres. In Ghaziabad, the government is allowing only those with Aadhaar cards mentioning local addresses to get their second shot of Covaxin at its centres. Some Delhi residents have said that while they have registered on Co-WIN, if they click on a government vaccination centre in Uttar Pradesh, the system shows an error message and says “no record found”. A senior health official said: “There are many people from Delhi, Gurgaon and other districts outside the state who are registering themselves to get the vaccine shots here. Since doses are limited, we need to prioritise.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/86-above-45-yrs-get-1-dose-in-noida/articleshow/83292133.cms||Snehil Sinha

A group of residents and workers of Eldeco Utopia is being trained by cardiologist Dr Nishith Chandra — who stays in the society itself — on how to use the machine. Many people who have recovered from Covid have been found to have an uneven heartbeat. Left unattended for the first few minutes, the person can turn critical and even suffer a cardiac arrest. AED helps regularise the heart beat momentarily by sending an electric pulse or shock to the heart and gives enough time to the patient to reach hospital. The AOA bought the machine for Rs 1.1 lakh. But this is not the first time that Eldeco Utopia has taken the initiative in making arrangements for Covid care on its premises. The society was the first to set up an isolation bed facility with oxygen in April last year. The facility was functional during the second wave too. “In the post-Covid period, heart related complications are becoming common. There have been a number of cases of cardiac arrests. So, we have procured an AED for the benefit of residents. Training is being provided to the residents and staff on how to use the machine by Dr Nishith Chandra,” said PK Mishra, the RWA president. Dr Chandra said that in case of a heart-related complication, the first few minutes are extremely crucial. “More and more young people are getting affected this time. Even after a patient has recovered, the chances of a sudden cardiac death are frequent. In case of a cardiac arrest, the chances of survival go down by 10% every minute. This means that a doctor has only 5-8 minutes to save a person’s life. It is nearly impossible for a doctor to arrive in those first few minutes. Keeping this emergency in mind, we have trained a number of residents and guards to become the first responders. We now have an AED to save a person’s life,” said Dr Chandra. Asked about the machine, Dr Chandra said, “They are used to prevent or correct an arrhythmia, a heart beat that is too slow or fast. Defibrillators can regularise the heart’s beating if it stops suddenly.” In April last year, Eldeco Utopia was the first society in Noida to set up five isolation rooms in their clubhouse. “We have developed the necessary medical infrastructure with the help of doctors who stay in the society. The AED now has provided a boost to the health facilities,” said Mishra. At one point during the second wave, Utopia had 157 active cases. Now, there are none.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/post-covid-care-society-buys-device-to-regularise-heart-beat/articleshow/83292180.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) services were fully suspended since May 20 in view of the Covid-induced lockdown, which was first imposed on April 19 and then successively extended by the city government. We're glad to see you. Please maintain social distancing and travel if it's absolutely necessary. https://t.co/A017P0du55— Delhi Metro Rail Corporation I कृपया मास्क पहनें😷 (@OfficialDMRC) 1623029461000Metro services initially ran partially, catering only to people from essential services, but from May 10, it was suspended in view of rising cases amid the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. On Monday, trains begun plying, with the scheduled starting time for services being 6am. "Only half of the available trains will be inducted into service with a frequency ranging from nearly five to 15 minutes on different lines," a DMRC official had said on Sunday. The move comes in the wake of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announcing various relaxations on Saturday, allowing metro trains to operate with half capacity and shops in markets and malls to reopen on odd-even basis from June 7. He asserted that the city's economy needs to be revived in view of improving Covid-19 situation. Delhi recorded 381 fresh cases of Covid, the lowest in over two and a half months and 34 fatalities, while the positivity rate dipped to 0.5 per cent, according to data shared by the health department here on Sunday. "The number of trains will be inducted in full strength in a graded manner by Wednesday and thereafter, services will be available as per normal frequency which was available before the lockdown," the DMRC had earlier said. Passengers will be allowed to travel by seating only on alternate seats with no provision for standing travel till further directions, officials said. In view of this stipulation, the capacity utilisation of the system will be around 10-15 per cent of its total capacity available in normal days, the DMRC had said. The general public is advised to cooperate with the metro authorities in ensuring compliance to Covid appropriate behaviour inside metro premises throughout their travel, officials said. "In order to ensure social distancing and compliance to 50 per cent seating inside trains, public is also advised to take extra time for their daily commute and exhibit covid appropriate behaviour outside the stations also while waiting for their turn to enter the station," the DMRC had said in a statement after the chief minister had announced relaxations in lockdown norms. Entry at stations will continue to be regulated through identified gates as was the practice earlier. The DMRC has 10 lines spanning 242 stations, and 264 stations including the Rapid Metro in Gurugram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-metro-resumes-services-after-nearly-3-weeks-with-50-per-cent-capacity/articleshow/83297621.cms||---

The institute has also resumed its diabetes clinic along with antenatal and postnatal clinics for lactating mothers owing to the increased footfall. Both facilities will include clinical examination, diagnosis, laboratory investigations and prescription. GIMS director Brigadier (retd) Dr RK Gupta said, “We are ready to start our general OPDs from Monday as the number of Covid cases have come down. Currently we are witnessing a surge in post-Covid complications such as black fungus in recovered or admitted patients. One of the main reasons behind the increase in mucormycosis cases is uncontrolled diabetes discovered in patients. Hence, we have decided to resume diabetes clinic services from Monday from 12 noon till 3pm.” Clinical consultation, including history taking, examination, diagnosis, laboratory investigations, insulin and oral medication will be available at the diabetes clinic. Also, GIMS has decided to start its antenatal and postnatal clinics daily from Monday from 9am to 1pm. “We will provide a wide range of services including health check-up, blood tests, urine tests, pregnancy immunisation and family planning services,” Dr Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/covid-patients-down-gims-to-start-opds-today/articleshow/83292197.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Kolkata||Changes in Covid treatment protocol leave doctors worried||KOLKATA: Frequent changes in Covid treatment protocol and altering reliance on drugs that were initially thought to be effective but later replaced by more ‘effective’ ones remain a worry and anxiety for doctors who have been kept on their toes ever since the pandemic struck in March 2020.  Patients, on the other hand, have been at the receiving end of a forced experiment in the absence of a definite Covid drug. More worryingly, doctors say, the trial with medicines will continue since there is yet no evidence-based Covid medicine that acts effectively and may end only with the pandemic. “We are in a state of flux and will continue to do so for we won’t have the time to time to develop medicines in the midst of an ongoing pandemic. Every few months, we have had drugs supported by reasonable evidence that it may act against Covid. But then, it was found to be relatively ineffective in most cases and some other medicine was found to be working better. The changing protocol has not only kept us confused, it has also left patients in a great deal of anxiety,” said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. While hydroxychloroquine was initially taken to be the principal drug, soon it was rejected in favour of others like Ivermectin, Colchicine, Flavipiravir and Remdisivir. The latter was taken to be the most potent one till WHO declared last month that there was no evidence to show it worked against Covid. Doctors point out that while these are existing medicines that were found to have anti-viral properties in limited studies and are being used purely for want of anything better, choices were limited. “Remdisivir seemed to have worked in millions of cases around the globe which led to the dependence. Now, do we have a better new drug?” asked consultant Arindam Biswas. The city saw a mad rush for Remdisivir when stocks ran out last month. “I know several patients who died without the drug and their families are repenting. The WHO observation will console them but what about the others for whom the drug seemed to have worked?” asked Joydeep Ghosh, consultant at AMRI, Mukundapur. Only two groups of drugs have stood the test of time, pointed out Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. “Steroids and blood thinners like enoxaparin and dalteparin.” Dhar agreed. “I would rather interpret the WHO observation on Remdisivir as that the drug doesn’t work for all Covid patients across the board. My experience is that it indeed works for those who require oxygen at an early stage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/changes-in-covid-treatment-protocol-leave-doctors-worried/articleshow/83291009.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
