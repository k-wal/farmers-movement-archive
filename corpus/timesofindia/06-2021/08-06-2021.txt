No program details were revealed, but De Blasio has asked veteran music producer Clive Davis -- who often draws A-listers to his events -- to organize the line-up.  "You can see the comeback happening," De Blasio told a press conference, announcing a "Homecoming Week" of events to celebrate the Big Apple's emergence from the pandemic, which hit the city especially hard in the early days.  "But we want to amplify, we want to make it bigger."  The concert will be the culmination of an "amazing, memorable, once-in-a-lifetime week... to celebrate the rebirth of New York City," the mayor said.  He did not offer a specific date, but The New York Times said August 21 is the tentative plan.  Davis -- who has worked with music legends Bruce Springsteen, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston during his storied career -- told the Times he hopes to recruit eight "iconic" stars for a three-hour event that will be broadcast worldwide.  Many of the 60,000 tickets would be distributed free of charge, Davis said, though there will be VIP seating as well.  De Blasio told reporters that he expected the line-up to be "heavy on New York artists."  The concert would be the latest in a series of major music events hosted on Central Park's Great Lawn, like Simon and Garfunkel's classic free concert in 1981 or the Global Citizen concert in September 2019.  De Blasio's announcement comes as America's most populous city seeks to relaunch its tourism industry.  Vaccination efforts have drastically reined in coronavirus case numbers.  More than 63 per cent of adults in New York City have received at least one dose of vaccine, according to official data.  Many restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus have been lifted, and New York state governor Andrew Cuomo said Monday that most of the remaining measures would be eliminated once 70 per cent vaccination is achieved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-york-plans-huge-august-concert-to-celebrate-post-covid-rebirth/articleshow/83320700.cms||---

It is after mounting pressure and unrelenting resistance of farmers that the Haryana administration agreed to concede the demands of the protesting farmers, in the Tohana incidents, the morcha claimed on Monday evening. The group claimed that after farmers' unions announced a plan of state-wide gherao of all police stations in Haryana, the administration released two activists of SKM Vikas Sisar and Ravi Azad in the middle of the night. They also reached the protest site at Tohana Police Station on Monday. SKM stated that a decision was taken on June 4 that the social boycott and protests against leaders of BJP and allies will be in the context of their official programs (government or political), and not personal or private events (like weddings, funerals etc). SKM has decided to mark the martyrdom of Banda Singh Bahadur, a valiant warrior who gave land rights to the tillers of the land, at protest sites on June 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/release-of-activists-farm-union-claims-victory/articleshow/83318796.cms||Neel Kamal

First refusal is the privilege of deciding whether to accept or reject something before it is offered to others. The global health body also urged emerging powers among G20 countries including China, Brazil and India to contribute urgent financing and vaccines for the Covax dose-sharing facility. The request comes as vaccinations gather pace across the globe, with over 2.15 billion shots being administered in at least 215 territories around the world.   Here's the latest on the Covid crisis from across the globe ...Cannot force China to give more Covid origin info: WHOA top World Health Organization official said on Monday that the agency cannot compel China to divulge more data on Covid-19's origins. He added it will propose studies needed to take understanding of where the virus emerged to the "next level". Pressed by a reporter on how the WHO will "compel" China into being more open, Mike Ryan, director of the agency's emergencies programme, said at a press conference that the "WHO doesn't have the power to compel anyone in this regard". There are competing theories: that the virus jumped from animals, possibly starting with bats, to humans, or that it escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. Members of a WHO team that visited China earlier this year hunting for Covid-19's origins have said they did not have access to all data, fueling continued debate over the country's transparency. 'Covid manufacturers should turn attention to Covax'World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Covid manufacturers should turn their attention to the Covax facility, which has struggled to get donation-funded doses to poorer countries. Tedros voiced his frustration that several poor countries have been unable to immunise their health workers, the elderly and other populations most vulnerable to severe Covid-19 disease. Some rich countries meanwhile, having bought up vaccine supply, are drawing up preparations to start vaccinating children, he said. Tedros has called for a massive global effort to vaccinate at least 10 per cent of the population of all countries by September, and at least 30 per cent by the end of the year. Covax is co-led by the WHO, Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. It has been hit by inequalities in the global vaccine roll-out, and also delivery delays. Spain opens borders to tourists, cruise shipsSpain has jumpstarted its summer tourism season by welcoming vaccinated visitors from most countries as well as European tourists who can prove they are not infected with coronavirus. It also reopened its ports to cruise ship stops. The move opened borders for the first tourists from the United States and other countries outside of the European Union, travelers who had been banned since March last year, when the pandemic hit global travel. Moderna seeks to use vaccine for adolescents US-based Moderna has filed a request with the European Medicines Agency for its Covid-19 vaccine to be granted authorization for use in adolescents. In a statement on Monday, Moderna said it had filed data for a conditional marketing approval in the 27-nation EU bloc to expand its coronavirus vaccine to children, beyond the green light it received in January for use in adults 18 and over. If authorized, it would be the second Covid-19 vaccine for children to be cleared in the EU. Moderna has also filed for authorization to use its vaccine under emergency use regulations in the US and Canada. China tightens curbs in GuanzhouResidents of the southern Chinese city of Guanzhou will not be able to leave unless they can show that it is absolutely necessary to do so, following an outbreak of Covid-19 that has sickened dozens of people in recent days. Anyone who is given permission to leave must show a negative test for the virus taken in the previous 48 hours. The same rule applies to anyone seeking to leave the surrounding province of Guangdong. The city also is restricting indoor dining, conducting mass testing and banning residents in high-risk neighborhoods from leaving their homes. At least two districts in the city of 18 million people have been closed off entirely. The variant causing the Guangzhou outbreak — the delta variant first identified in India — is reportedly more infectious because those who have it are slower to display symptoms while carrying more virus particles. The city reported four locally transmitted cases in the 24 hours before Monday morning, bringing its recent total to more than 100 since May 21. India revamps vaccine policyPrime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday the Centre would offer free Covid-19 shots to all adults from June 21. In a major change in the vaccination policy, the Prime Minister also announced that the centralisation of the immunization drive and said that states will be provided Covid vaccines free of cost. The Supreme Court had asked the Centre to review its vaccination policy saying it was “prima facie arbitrary and irrational” in allowing states and private hospitals to charge people in the 18-44 age group for the jabs. Germany relaxes curbs for those getting vaccinatedGermany has dropped restrictions on who can get vaccinated against Covid-19, but many people still will have to wait some time to get a shot. A prioritization system in place since vaccinations started after Christmas officially ended Monday, and everyone 12 and older is now entitled to make an appointment. Up to now, Germany has been working through the oldest and most vulnerable, as well as people in selected professions. A few German states are keeping the prioritization system in place at specialized vaccination centers for the time being. Germany had given at least one shot to 45.4% of its population by Friday and had fully vaccinated 20.7%. Thailand rolls out AstraZeneca shotsHealth authorities in Thailand began their much-anticipated mass rollout of locally produced AstraZeneca vaccines on Monday, but it appeared that supplies were falling short of demand. Hospitals have been posting notices for several days that some scheduled appointments would be delayed, adding to existing public skepticism about how many doses Siam Bioscience would be able to produce each month. The government has said it will produce 6 million doses in June, then 10 million doses each month from July to November, and 5 million doses in December. Delta variant 40% more transmissible: UKBritain's health secretary has said that the delta variant, which is fast becoming the dominant coronavirus variant in the UK, is 40 per cent more transmissible compared to the country's existing strains. Matt Hancock acknowledged on Sunday that the rise in delta variant cases may delay the government's plan to lift most remaining lockdown restrictions on June 21. He also said he wouldn't rule out continuing measures such as face masks in public settings and working from home where possible. Optimism that Britain can vaccinate its way out of the pandemic took a dent in recent weeks with growing concern that infections are again rising, fueled by the delta variant, which was first found in India. More than 12,400 cases of the delta variant have been confirmed in the UK. Meanwhile, French health authorities are also racing to contain scattered cases of the more contagious delta virus variant, as the country prepares to reopen its borders to vaccinated visitors and celebrates plunging Covid-19 infection and hospitalization rates.

Some policies increasing these obstacles require urgent administrative changes to end this humanitarian crisis, which could force over 200,000 children to eventually self-deport, including 10,000 children in the next year,” states ‘Improve The Dream’ an organisation led by documented (legal) dreamers. Dip Patel, President of this organisation told TOI, “Improve The Dream was started because change was necessary and there wasn’t enough attention for aging out children at the federal level. It started with a simple vision, that every child that grows up in America should have a clear opportunity to become an American on paper and continue living in the country we call home. It did not make sense to me that children who grew up here had to self-deport. And even solutions to fix this problem, for dreamers, had always excluded children who grew up here in a documented status. I believed that all children should be protected, irrespective of the status they grew up in.” Read also: Bill includes legal dreamers for a pathway to US citizenship, it will help over a lakh Indian childrenTOI has often written on the challenges faced by legal dreamers – children who entered US on H-4 visas (dependant visas), but who age out when they turn 21. As Indians have a backlog that runs into several decades for obtaining a green card, children of Indian couples (where one or both parents are typically on an H-1B visa) face the brunt. Such children either have to obtain a study visa meant for international student (such as an F-1 visa) or face self-deportation to India. Read also: An Indian legal dreamer has her say before US House sub-committee on the challenges of ‘ageing out’Patel adds, “About four years ago, I decided to turn that frustration of feeling ignored by the government into advocacy for change. Today, we are raising awareness and educating policymakers for both legislative and administrative changes that would help permanently protect all children from aging out." In response to the invite for public comments, ‘Improve The Dream’ calls for fortification of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) so as to cover legal dreamers. Undocumented dreamers are currently protected from deportation and are also eligible for work authorisation, legal dreamers do not enjoy this leeway and this needs to change. In addition to suggestion on use of proper interpretation of various provisions of the Child Status Protection Act, the organisation has two other very important suggestions:  Revise the USCIS guidance that requires all non-immigrants to bridge to F-1 (international student visa) via B-2 (tourist visa) status: As explained earlier, once legal dreamers age out, to continue with their studies in the US, they need an F-1 visa. In April 2017, USCIS issued a new policy requiring that applicants in B-1/B-2 status extend their status to cover any ‘gap’ between the expiration of their previous status and the F-1 program start date. However, in February 2018, USCIS revised its original instructions to also include applications filed by all other non-immigrant statuses. Given that the current F-1 processing times may take up to a year or more, one may need to file several B-2 extensions to ‘bridge the gap.’ During this time, many non-immigrants who are in the process of adjusting status may be unable to take classes to complete their degree. These changes occurred without the issuance of a formal policy memorandum or the typical notice and comment period. ‘Improve The Dream’ has requested USCIS to reverse the February 2018 update and issue a formal notice and comment period for the April 2017 change.  Direct USCIS to create a parole program through a policy memorandum to protect children of long-term visa holders who age out: This will allow children who age-out and self-deport to be paroled back into the country for ‘urgent humanitarian and significant public benefit reasons.’ Congress has granted USCIS clear authority for this action states the organisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-immigration-reforms-end-ageing-out-provide-a-path-to-citizenship-and-eradicate-bridge-related-challenges-say-legal-dreamers/articleshow/83321174.cms||Lubna Kably

This is in addition to the monthly 5 kg highly subsidised foodgrain they get under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Last month, the government announced the third phase of PMGKAY only for May and June. Last year, the scheme was implemented from April to November. “The government is standing with the poor for all his needs as his friend,” Modi said during his address to the nation on Monday. Officials said under the current phase of PMGKAY, the Centre would allocate around 280 lakh tonnes of wheat and rice for seven months (May to November) and it would bear an additional expenditure of approximately Rs 90,000 crore for this. During last year, the Centre had allocated 322.5 lakh tonnes of foodgrains to states under the first two phases of PMGKAY and incurred an additional expenditure of Rs 1.22 lakh crore. The overall subsidy outgo for the current phase of PMGKAY will also be less as the economic cost of foodgrains available with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has come down drastically because of the government increasing the budgetary allocation this year to the FCI and thereby reducing the interest burden. Officials also said currently the FCI has nearly 900 lakh tonnes of wheat and rice stock, which is more than double of what it needs to meet demands under NFSA and other schemes. “There is no problem with the stock and every year we are procuring more foodgrains than the previous years,” said an official. One of the main reasons why the government announced the reintroduction of PMGKAY during the second surge of Covid is the high success of the scheme last year. A study conducted across 88 districts in 18 states and UTs had shown that an average of 94% households had received the free ration every month. Moreover. about 97% of the respondents were aware of the PMGKAY distribution and their entitlements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-extends-free-foodgrain-scheme-for-80-crore-poor-till-diwali/articleshow/83321771.cms||Dipak K Dash

However, as of now this relaxation is for Covishield recipients only being WHO-approved. The Union health ministry had received several requests from such Indians who had got their first dose of Covishield and whose date of intended travel abroad was before the minimum 84-day gap for the second jab. This minimum gap will be reduced to 28 days under a special dispensation given to “students who have to undertake foreign travel for the purposes of education; persons who have to take up jobs in foreign countries and athletes, sportspersons and accompanying staff of Indian contingent attending Tokyo Olympics,” the Union health ministry said in a statement. “With a view to providing full coverage of vaccination and facilitating international travel for such genuine reasons… states/UT governments shall designate a competent authority in each district for according permission for such administration of the second dose of Covishield,” it added. The competent authority will check shall check before allowing administration of the second dose 84 days after the date of the first dose: whether 28 days have elapsed after the date of the first dose; the genuineness of purpose of travel based on documents — admission offers for education; whether a person is already studying a foreign educational institution and has to return to that institution for continuing their education; interview calls for a job or offers letters for taking up employment and nomination to participate in Tokyo Olympics. “It is advised that vaccination may be availed in cases through passport… so that passport number is printed in the certificate…. Wherever necessary, the competent authority may issue another certificate linking the vaccination certificate with the passport number of the beneficiary,” it says. This facility will be available to those who need to undertake international travel for these specified purposes up to August 31, 2021. “Covishield, produced by Serum Institute of India and approved by the DCGI is one of the vaccines (approved) by WHO for use as of June 3, 2021…. Mention of vaccine-type as ‘Covishield’ is sufficient and no other qualifying entries are required in the vaccination certificates. The CoWIN system will soon provide the facility for the administration of the second dose in such exceptional cases,” it adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/traveling-abroad-for-studies-jobs-or-tokyo-olympics-govt-reduces-covishield-second-jab-gap/articleshow/83322003.cms||Saurabh Sinha

According to an order issued by the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Co Ltd (NHIDCL) on June 2, the organization had found that some contents were circulating against its general manager posted at Mokokchung in Nagaland alleging his involvement in corrupt practices while discharging duty. Subsequently, the NHIDCL regional officer filed a complaint with the Mokokchung police under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. He was arrested by the local police. The officer was on deputation from the Border Roads Organisation. The video of the officer claiming that he takes not less than 1% commission was posted by one Yangshik Phom on a social media platform on May 30 seeking action against the officer. In the video, the officer is seen making a claim that even if one doesn’t pay him anything, he doesn’t stop their work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nhidcl-repatriates-after-officer-after-his-arrest-in-corruption-charge/articleshow/83322270.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||World||US has recovered ransom payment made after pipeline hack||WASHINGTON: The Justice Department has recovered the majority of a multimillion-dollar ransom payment to hackers after a cyberattack that caused the operator of the nation's largest fuel pipeline to halt its operations last month, officials said Monday.  The operation to recover the cryptocurrency from the Russia-based hacker group is the first undertaken by a specialized ransomware task force created by the Biden administration Justice Department, and reflects what US officials say is an increasingly aggressive approach to deal with a ransomware threat that in the last month has targeted critical industries around the world.  "By going after an entire ecosystem that fuels ransomware and digital currency, we will continue to use all of our tools and all of our resources to increase the costs and the consequences of ransomware attacks and other cyber-enabled attacks," Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Monday at a news conference announcing the operation.  Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline, which supplies roughly half the fuel consumed on the East Coast, temporarily shut down its operations on May 7 after a gang of criminal hackers known as DarkSide broke into its computer system.  Colonial officials have said they took their pipeline system offline before the attack could spread to its operating system, and decided to pay a roughly $4.4 million ransom in hopes of bringing itself back online as soon as it could.  The 63.7 bitcoin ransom - a favored currency of hackers because of the perception that it is more difficult to trace - is currently valued at $2.3 million.  "The extortionists will never see this money," said Stephanie Hinds, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California, where the seizure warrant was filed.  The FBI generally discourages the payment of ransom, fearing it could encourage additional hacks. Monaco said the takeaway for the private sector is that if companies come quickly to law enforcement, officials may be able to conduct similar seizures in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-has-recovered-ransom-payment-made-after-pipeline-hack/articleshow/83323273.cms||---

The new variant is likely to cause severe symptoms. The findings of the pathogenicity evaluation show increased disease severity and point towards the need for screening of vaccine efficacy. The findings of the pre-print study has been published online on bioRxiv. However, according to an uncorrected manuscript of a separate study by NIV, Pune, the two-dose Covaxin regimen significantly boosted antibody and neutralising efficacy against the variant. The B.1.1.28.2 variant induced body weight loss, viral replication in the respiratory tract, lung lesions and caused severe lung pathology in infected Syrian hamster model, the study said. The study pointed towards the necessity of genomic surveillance and characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 variants to understand their pathogenicity and immune escape potential for preparedness of counter measures. Genome sequencing labs are looking at mutants which have significant potential of severely affecting disease transmission. Currently, 10 national labs under INSACOG (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequencing Consortia) have sequenced around 30,000 samples. The government plans to ramp up genome sequencing and recently added 18 more labs to the consortium.

This national record is attributed to the “J&K Model”, under which the administration reached out to the people, instead of the people flooding the vaccination centres. Dr Bashir Ahmed Khan, Chief Medical Officer of Bandipora, said due to difficult terrain the vaccinators had to walk around 18km on foot to reach this village. “It’s a village of nomads having no access to internet. So, the health officials decided to take a difficult journey in this north Kashmir village and save precious lives. There is no well-defined route and it is a very dangerous trek, but we didn’t rest until the last eligible person got the vaccine dose,” Khan said. Weyan is 28km from Bandipora town and the first 10km of the journey is by road, up to a place called Athwatoo. The remaining 18km is by foot, up the hills. “Residents over 18 years, 362 in all, have been vaccinated. These nomadic people leave the village and go to the still upper reaches of the mountains, along with their cattle, during summer. So, it was important to reach out to them before they moved out,” Khan said. The “J&K Model” has adopted a 10 point strategy to vaccinate entire eligible population at accelerated pace. Despite initial vaccine hesitancy, the current vaccination rate of the UT is more than 70% for people over 45 years, which is double that of the national average. The first strategy is booth-level management involving preparation of lists of eligible population, followed by “Vaccine on Wheels” – reaching out to people in far-flung areas. State Immunization Officer, Dr Shahid Hussain, said maximum number of session sites in a day with well-coordinated vaccination efforts is also paying dividend. “We had prior micro planning and execution, a teach session site, and involved police and media in crowd management and awareness. We have constituted in every district a dedicated team of healthcare workers, who were ready to work even during holidays and weekends. Coordination between various departments, like utilization of services of teachers and booth-level officers as verifiers and their training by the health and family welfare department was another key feature of the J&K Model,” Hussain said. Hussain added that despite difficult terrain (like in Shopian, Ganderbal) and poor mobile connectivity, the teams were relentless in vaccinating people living in the far reaching corners of the district and deploying influencers like religious leaders, local elders, to counter vaccine hesitancy. Riyaz Ahmed of Weyan village said: “When health workers tried to convince me to take the Covid-19 vaccine some weeks ago, I refused, saying that the jab would kill me! My mother is 80 years old, while my father is 87. I was scared to get them vaccinated.” “Also, there hasn’t been one Covid-19 positive case in our village since the beginning of the pandemic, last year. Therefore, we did not want to risk taking the vaccine shot. It was only after some of our village residents took the shot and survived that I developed faith in vaccines,” Reyaz added. Dr Masarrat Iqbal, BDO of Bandipora, said that myths about Covid-19 vaccine were the biggest hurdle in vaccinating villagers of Weyan but, that, they succeeded in vaccinating every one in the end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/weyan-village-in-bandipora-1st-village-in-country-to-record-100-vaccination-against-covid-19/articleshow/83324074.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The rumour was first floated by a junior National Conference leader, Tanveer Sadiq, on social media that the government of India is contemplating “something big, vis-à-vis Kashmir” and also threw a question: “When is the government planning to detain politicians like in 2019?” “Some political leaders who were detained after the special status of the state was revoked have expressed apprehension that they feared they could be detained once again,” said Sadiq, who was detained last year. IGP Kumar, however, said, “The troops arriving are those who went on election duty to West Bengal and other states. They are being re-inducted. It’s not new deployment.” Some local leaders too have raise concerns, saying this is for the first time that J&K is seeing such a big build-up since August 2019, when J&K’s special status was abrogated and the state was divided into two Union Territories — Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Last year, official sources had said that 200 companies were pulled out from J&K and sent to other parts of the country after protests broke out against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/arrival-of-200-para-military-companies-in-kashmir-triggers-rumours/articleshow/83324196.cms||M Saleem Pandit

---||India||New chargesheet lists Mehbooba aide's 13-year run as Pakistan terror outfits' 'asset'||SRINAGAR: A 19-page chargesheet drawn up by CID's Counter Intelligence Kashmir wing against arrested Mehbooba Mufti aide and PDP youth wing president Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra paints him as a ruthless politician who was willing to become an "asset" of Pakistan-based terror outfits in return for help in getting his party's opponents out of the way. The chargesheet, backed by the statements of five protected witnesses and technical intelligence, includes sheaves of annexures that detail his alleged attempts to eliminate political opponents. It also mentions alleged payments to terror groups to "swing electoral battles" in PDP's favour. According to the chargesheet, which was submitted in the NIA, POTA and TADA courts in Srinagar, Parra's 13-year journey as a journalist and politician was a "saga of subterfuge, deceit and double dealing". Parra joined PDP in 2013 and, "once ensconced in the safety of a recognised political party", he "systematically went about strengthening himself by craftily deepening his roots on two sides of the divide – India and Pakistan", the document states. "Parra had the permission of the Pakistani establishment to keep throwing crumbs at India, allowing them petty tactical gains and systematically pushing the overall situation, slowly but surely, in favour of Pakistan in a strategic sense." Sources said the PDP youth wing chief had been pleading for financial support from Pakistan to fight the court cases against terrorists from that country arrested in various states. In 2007, he had visited Pakistan as a journalist and interviewed Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin for a media channel based in his native district of Pulwama in south Kashmir. The chargesheet highlights his alleged links with Pakistan-trained terrorists Abu Dujana and Abu Qasim, both of whom were killed in encounters with security forces. He would allegedly meet them frequently and maintain contact through overground workers. The CID claims Parra even endorsed the forced marriage of a Pulwama girl to Dujana. Contesting all the charges levelled against Parra during various court proceedings, his lawyer said he was being made a political scapegoat. The PDP youth president won a seat in the first District Development Council elections last year even as he was in detention. CID has sought the J&K home department's sanction for Parra's prosecution under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Based on "reliable and confidential sources", the agency's special Kashmir cell had filed a case last year against "unknown politicians and others" who were allegedly misusing their powers and helping terrorists. In March, the NIA filed a chargesheet accusing the PDP youth leader of paying Rs 5 crore to the son-in-law of hardline Hurriyat Conference functionary Syed Ali Shah Geelani for keeping Kashmir in turmoil after the killing of terrorist Burhan Wani in 2016. The NIA accused Parra, arrested last November, of being involved with banned outfits like Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba. He was granted bail by the NIA court in January this year on the ground that there was no reference to him in the original as well as the supplementary chargesheets submitted in July and October 2020 respectively. Parra was subsequently arrested by CID and has been in jail since. His last bail plea was rejected by the TADA court in Srinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-chargesheet-lists-mehbooba-aides-13-year-run-as-pakistan-terror-outfits-asset/articleshow/83324312.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Shailendra Singh, SSP of Resai, said the accused, one Mohi-ud-din, son of Samdoo, a resident of Shikari in Reasi, was on the run after he was named in an FIR under various sections of the Ranbir Penal Code for harbouring terrorists in 1999. Singh said, “The accused went underground as soon as an FIR was lodged and avoided participating in the investigation proceedings.” A warrant under Section 512 of the CrPC was issued by a court against the accused in 2002. “The accused was finally arrested by a team from Mahore police station after developing inputs and meticulously planning a coordinated operation to arrest him,” Singh said. The SSP added that the accused is the 14th absconder arrested by Reasi police, within a period of six weeks, against whom warrants under Section 512 of the CrPC were pending||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sheltering-militants-jk-man-on-the-run-arrested-after-22-years/articleshow/83324397.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Officers responded to reports of a shooting at 10:25 pm Sunday at a home in the southeastern part of the city and found the four people dead from apparent gunshot wounds, police said in a statement.  Investigators do not believe the shootings were murders and a suicide, police spokesman Lt. Greg Pashley told The Oregonian/OregonLive.  No one is in custody but police do not believe there's a risk to the public, Pashley said. He said he didn't know the relationships of the people who died.  Sonia Clark, who lives in a duplex across the street from the home where the people were killed, told the newspaper she saw workers from the medical examiner's office Monday morning remove two bodies from the home, a tan house with brown shutters shaded by a large pine tree.  Clark said a man in his late 20s to early 30s lives in the house and was often tinkering with or fixing cars.  "It's a gentleman who has a lot of friends coming and going," she said. "He works on cars. His friends come by and work on their stereos."  Clark said she and her boyfriend were watching television Sunday when she heard "a popping sound." She thought it was from a science fiction show they were watching, but learned Monday of the shooting.  The investigation is continuing and autopsies will be performed, according to police.  No other information about the shooting was immediately made public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/police-4-people-fatally-shot-in-home-in-portland-oregon/articleshow/83324422.cms||---
---||World||At least 51 killed as trains collide in Pakistan||ISLAMABAD: A collision on Monday between two passenger trains in Ghotki district of Pakistan’s southern Sindh province left at least 40 people dead and more than 120 injured. According to Pakistan Railways (PR) officials, most of the passengers were asleep when the accident occurred at 3.30 am (local time) between the Millat Express and Sir Syed Express. The Millat Express was en route from Karachi to Sargodha, in Punjab province, while the Sir Syed Express was going from Rawalpindi to Karachi. The collision took place between Raiti and Obaro railway stations. "The accident happened after the coaches of the Millat Express derailed and fell across the opposite track. The Sir Syed Express collided with it and overturned," said Nazia Jabeen, a PR spokesperson. According to Jabeen, a relief train had been dispatched to the crash site while officials, along with police and the local administration, were carrying out rescue efforts. She said helpline centres have been set up for passengers in Karachi, Sukkur, Faisalabad and Rawalpindi. Several of the injured were taken to hospitals in Rohri, Pannu Aqil and Sukkur districts, she said, fearing that the death toll was likely to rise. "Army and paramilitary troops were already at the accident site, and two army helicopters were taking part in evacuations," Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military’s media arm, said. Prime Minister Imran Khan posted on Twitter that he was "shocked by the horrific train accident" and had ordered a "comprehensive investigation into railway safety fault lines". The railway minister, Azam Khan Swati, who had visited the crash site in the morning, said a high-level inquiry has been ordered. "It is too early to say whether the accident was due to sabotage or due to the dilapidated condition of the train track," Swati said. Railway accidents frequently occur in Pakistan and are often caused by derailment and collisions at unmanned railway crossings. At least 21 people were killed last July when a train travelling from Karachi to Lahore hit a van carrying Sikh pilgrims near Sheikhupura, Punjab province. In October 2019, a fire caused by a gas cylinder left 73 passengers dead in a train from Karachi to Rawalpindi, and another 20 people were killed in a train crash a few months earlier, in July 2019. Data from Pakistan Railways shows that 757 train accidents took place between 2012 and 2017, at an average of about 125 incidents a year. According to PR authorities, the major causes of train accidents in the country are lack of track maintenance, signal issues and obsolete engines. Casualty figures in train accidents are often high because coaches are packed with far greater numbers of passengers than they were designed for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/at-least-51-killed-as-trains-collide-in-pak/articleshow/83324473.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||US Supreme Court rebuffs challenge to all-male military draft sign-up||WASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a challenge by a men's rights group to the national requirement that men, but not women, register for the military draft at age 18, focusing on whether the policy violates the US Constitution's guarantee that laws apply equally to everyone.  The justices turned away an appeal by the National Coalition for Men, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, of a lower court ruling upholding the policy. The lawsuit was aimed at invalidating a 1948 US law that compels only men to register for potential military service.  Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a statement noting that a commission established by Congress last year recommended ending the male-only status of the draft and that lawmakers could act on it.  Sotomayor wrote that the court's "longstanding deference to Congress on matters of national defense and military affairs cautions against granting review while Congress actively weighs the issue."  Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer and conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined Sotomayor's opinion.  By rebuffing the appeal, the justices left in place the lower court ruling and a 1981 Supreme Court precedent that had upheld the law in part because women at that time were prohibited from serving in combat roles in the armed forces.  The Pentagon in 2013 lifted the official ban on women in combat. ACLU lawyers had argued that it made little sense that in light of that policy shift women were not required to register for the draft alongside men.  The military draft was discontinued in 1973 amid the tumult of the Vietnam War era. But men still are required to register and can face penalties for refusing. 'Overt sex discrimination' "We're disappointed the Supreme Court allowed one of the last examples of overt sex discrimination in federal law to stand. We urge Congress to update the law either by requiring everyone to register for the draft, regardless of their gender, or by not requiring anyone to register," ACLU lawyer Ria Tabacco Mar.  Matthew Tittman, a spokesperson for the Selective Service System, said the federal agency, which administers the database, is "capable of performing whatever mission Congress should mandate" but does not comment on litigation.  The men's rights group as well as two individuals - James Lesmeister, a Texas-based graduate student, and Anthony Davis, who lives in California and is studying for a degree - in 2013 sued the Selective Service System. They argued that the male-only requirement amounted to sex discrimination in violation of the constitutional promise of equal protection under the law.  Texas-based US District Judge Gray Miller in 2019 ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and declared the law unconstitutional. The New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020 reversed that ruling, saying lower courts were bound by the Supreme Court's 1981 decision upholding the policy.  The 1948 law requires men, both US citizens and lawful permanent residents, to sign up with the Selective Service System at age 18. Under the law, if there is a draft in place the registration information would be used to summon people ages 18 to 25 for military service.  The last draft call was held by lottery in 1972. Active conscription formally ended the next year and the all-volunteer military was born.  The National Coalition For Men has said forcing men but not women to register is "an aspect of socially institutionalized male disposability" and helps to reinforce stereotypes that buttress what it called bias against men in child custody, divorce, criminal sentencing, public benefits, domestic violence services and other areas.  President Joe Biden's administration has defended the 1948 law, as did the administration of his predecessor Donald Trump.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-supreme-court-rebuffs-challenge-to-all-male-military-draft-sign-up/articleshow/83324727.cms||---
---||World||Fleeing Texas inmates outsmarted jailers by placing dummies in bed||WASHINGTON: Security at a federal prison camp in the Texas city of Beaumont was so lax that four inmates managed to escape by placing dummies in their beds or having other prisoners pose as them, the US Justice Department's internal watchdog said on Monday.  Inspector General Michael Horowitz said his office uncovered a wide range of security failures at prison camps and satellite campuses of the Bureau of Prisons, from leaving doors unlocked or using locks that were susceptible to tampering, to having limited fencing or not enough video surveillance.  Such facilities typically house inmates deemed to be low-risk, such as those convicted of minor drug crimes or white-collar offenses. Some inmates have managed to escape these facilities or bring in contraband, Horowitz said.  In a memo on security at federal prisons, Horowitz described the escape of four inmates from the Beaumont site. It said the inmates managed to escape for more than 12 hours by placing dummies in their beds to make it look like they were in their cells or by having fellow inmates pose as them. The subterfuge succeeded despite guards making three overnight inmate counts.  Bureau of Prisons spokesperson Kristie Breshears said the escape occurred on Jan. 12, 2019. Breshears said three of the inmates were returned to custody within hours, but the fourth remains at large. The bureau did not provide this inmate's identity or the crime for which he was convicted.  The disappearance of the four inmates was discovered during a morning count of inmates, the memo said. Two of the four apparently left the prison to obtain some form of contraband, it added.  "We found that the outer doors of separate buildings within the satellite prison camp at FCC (Federal Correctional Complex) Beaumont were unsecured in that they were unlocked, were unmanned, were not equipped with surveillance cameras, and had either nonfunctioning alarms or alarms that could be manipulated by inmates," Horowitz said.  "Gaps in security at federal prison camps and satellite prison camps present risks that inmates will escape and, if they return, smuggle contraband back into facilities undetected, which endangers the community," Horowitz added.  Breshears said the Beaumont facility has already begun efforts to improve security, including adding a perimeter fence, repairing door alarms and adding video surveillance.  "The vast majority of the enhancements have been completed," Breshears said. "We take seriously our duty to protect the individuals entrusted in our custody, as well as maintaining the safety of correctional staff and the community."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/fleeing-texas-inmates-outsmarted-jailers-by-placing-dummies-in-bed/articleshow/83324972.cms||---

Talking on this issue for the first time during an exclusive interview with TOI, the CM said that a few people are interpreting these visits and meetings in a different way and giving a new political spin, which is unfounded. “Also, it was the media’s professional compulsion to sensationalise and exaggerate in order to get catchy headlines and grab eyeballs,” he said. Read AlsoWhen Modiji was battling against Covid, opposition was waging war against him, says Yogi AdityanathUP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday launched a blistering attack on the opposition accusing them of weakening the country’s battle against pandemic by fanning rumours to vitiate the atmosphere and spreading fear and panic amongst the people.“These meetings are not new. BJP is a cadre-based party which does not adhere to nepotism. The party keeps its cadre active. For this, senior leaders meet every two months and hold meetings with state units. Our state in charge (BJP national vice-president Radha Mohan Singh) comes to UP twice a month. Party president JP Nadda himself visited Lucknow four months ago,” he said. “As a ruling party, we are into various services to provide relief to people. This is as per the direction by PM Narendra Modi and party president JP Nadda. Be it the first wave or the second wave, the BJP and the Sangh karyakartas have been giving their services. Other political parties were nowhere in sight," the CM added. When asked about the assembly elections next year, he said: “We are ready to face any situation. We won in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 2017 UP assembly elections and the 2019 elections. We are not only waging a battle against coronavirus but also against ‘rajnaitik sankraman’ (political infections). We will continue to battle it out under the leadership of PM Modi. BJP will win with a two-thirds majority in 2022.” To a question on Congress's UP in charge Priyanka Gandhi writing letters to him to draw his attention to various issues, he said: “They are just doing formalities to be in the limelight. Others are just tweeting to be in the media. Where were these people during the first and the second wave? They have never been into serving people. It is not in their genes.” Yogi also dispelled speculations about his ‘national ambitions'. “I had no ambitions when I was an MP. I have no ambition even today." He categorically called himself a ‘common soldier’ who is working as per BJP's vision and PM Modi’s campaign to ensure development, security and prosperity. “There cannot be a bigger reason to be happy after considering achievements of the state government in the last four years,” he said, underscoring how the state managed to register economic growth and develop robust infrastructure despite the pandemic. "It is for everyone to see. UP is no more a state which witnessed riots every week in the past. There is no room for giving priority to caste, community and language. The state will be the number one state in terms of per capita income," the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/speculation-over-change-in-up-govt-a-media-creation-up-cm-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/83325343.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Business||Europe Union’s new move may hit India, South Africa’s patent waiver plan||MUMBAI: European Union has drawn up a counter proposal which could ``undermine’’ India and South Africa’s proposed submission at the World Trade Organization seeking a waiver on intellectual property (IP) on Covid-19 drugs and vaccines. This comes ahead of the World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting slated on June 8, in the midst of stark inequities in the access to Covid-19 vaccines, globally. Opposition to the submission continues with the EU, Japan, UK and Switzerland stalling it, while importantly, the US threw its weight behind the waiver. If adopted at the WTO, the waiver would provide countries with critical policy space to address IP barriers to increase collaboration in research and development, manufacturing, scale-up, and, hence boost supply of Covid-19 medicines and vaccines. The EU proposal calls governments to ``facilitate the use of compulsory licensing within the WTO’s existing agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The Agreement already provides this flexibility, which is a legitimate tool during the pandemic that can be used swiftly where needed’’. (Compulsory licensing --used during previous public health emergencies-- is when a government grants a license to a company without the patent holder’s consent, for accessing a therapy) It also says the use of export restrictions should be limited, and supply chains be open. ``Vaccine-producing countries should be ready to export a fair share of their domestic production. Supply chains are highly interconnected and should not be disrupted’’, the statement added. The European Union counter proposal to TRIPS waiver is not fit for purpose, and nothing but a manoeuver to push for voluntary actions of pharmaceutical corporations as a solution to replace a concrete legal solution backed by over 100 countries, public health experts say. ``EU aims to disrupt the negotiations with these “new” proposal, which is nothing more than CLs as we know. We have a good momentum now with the US, along with 100 countries backing it. India and South Africa have submitted a revised proposal, and (this) should be a good start for negotiations’’, Burcu Kiliç research director at Public Citizen said. Further, international humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) denounced the EU, and countries including the UK, Switzerland and Norway for employing delay tactics, instead of agreeing to start formal negotiations on the critical waiver. ``The proposal ignores the shortcomings of existing regulations including compulsory licensing, and the impact-- decades of bilateral pressure from the EU has had on their implementation --in many countries across the world. Our analysis has shown that compulsory licenses alone would not be enough to achieve urgent access to lifesaving Covid-19 medical tools even in the EU itself during this pandemic’’, a MSF official told TOI. The EU proposal only applies to patent barriers and does not address IP barriers in the regulatory system, which are required to be waived, when countries and manufacturers are seeking expansion, and supply of Covid-19 vaccines, medicines and other health technology. It seems to focus on vaccines and to some extent therapeutics, instead of covering all Covid-19 medical technologies, the experts added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/europe-unions-new-move-may-hit-india-south-africas-patent-waiver-plan/articleshow/83325809.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||World||Canadian police say Muslim family targeted by deadly attack||TORONTO: A driver plowed a pickup truck into a family of five, killing four of them and seriously injuring the other in an attack that targeted the victims because they were Muslims, Canadian police said Monday.  Authorities said a young man was arrested in the parking lot of a nearby mall after the incident Sunday night in the Ontario city of London. Police said a black pickup truck mounted a curb and struck the victims at an intersection.  "This was an act of mass murder perpetuated against Muslims," London Mayor Ed Holder said. "It was rooted in unspeakable hatred. The magnitude of such hatred can make one question who we were as a city."  Police said the dead were a 74-year-old woman, a 46-year-old man, a 44-year-old woman and a 15-year-old girl. A nine-year-old boy was reported in serious condition. The family requested the names not be released, officials said.  Nathaniel Veltman, 20, was in custody facing four counts of first-degree murder. Police said Veltman, a resident of London, did not know the victims.  Detective Supt. Paul Waight said Veltman was wearing a vest that appeared to be like body armor.  Waight said police did not know at this point if the suspect was a member of any specific hate group. He said London police wre working with federal police and prosecutors to see about potential terrorism charges. He declined to detail evidence pointing to a possible hate crime, but said the attack was planned.  "We believe the victims were targeted because of their Islamic faith," London Police Chief Stephen Williams said. "We understand that this event may cause fear and anxiety in the community, particularly in the Muslim community, in any community targeted by hate ... There is no tolerance in this community who are motivated by hate target others with violence." Canada is generally welcoming toward immigrants and all religions, but in 2017 a French Canadian man known for far-right, nationalist views went on a shooting rampage at a Quebec City mosque that killed six people.  One woman who witnessed the aftermath of the deadly crash said she couldn't stop thinking about the victims. Paige Martin said she was stopped at a red light around 8:30 p.m. when the large pickup roared past her. She said her car shook from the force.  "I was shaken up, thinking it was an erratic driver,″ Martin said.  Minutes later, she said, she came upon a gruesome, chaotic scene at an intersection near her home, with first responders running to help, a police officer performing chest compressions on one person and three other people lying on the ground. A few dozen people stood on the sidewalk and several drivers got out of their cars to help.  "I can't get the sound of the screams out of my head," Martin said.  From her apartment, Martin said she could see the scene and watched an official drape a sheet over one body about midnight. "My heart is just so broken for them," she said.  Zahid Khan, a family friend, said the three generations among the dead were a grandmother, father, mother and teenage daughter. The family had immigrated from Pakistan 14 years ago and were dedicated, decent and generous members of the London Muslim Mosque, he said.  "They were just out for their walk that they would go out for every day," Khan said through tears near the site of the crash. "I just wanted to see."  Qazi Khalil said he saw the family on Thursday when they were out for their nightly walk. The families lived close to each other and would get together on holidays, he said.  "This has totally destroyed me from the inside," Khalil said. "I can't really come to the terms they were no longer here."  The National Council of Canadian Muslims said it was beyond horrified, saying Muslims in Canada have become all too familiar with the violence of Islamophobia.  "This is a terrorist attack on Canadian soil, and should be treated as such,″ council head Mustafa Farooq said. "We call on the government to prosecute the attacker to the fullest extent of the law, including considering terrorist charges."  About a dozen police officers combed the area around the crash site looking for evidence Monday. Blue markers on the ground dotted the intersection.  The mayor said flags would be lowered for three days.  Waight, the police detective, said he believed four dead to be the most homicide victims in a single incident in the city's history.  "Hate and Islamophobia have NO place in Ontario. Justice must be served for the horrific act of hatred that took place in London, Ontario," Ontario Premier Doug Ford tweeted. "My thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends during this difficult time. These heinous acts of violence must stop."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/canadian-police-say-muslim-family-targeted-by-deadly-attack/articleshow/83325930.cms||---

The plan was part of a review following one month of states and private hospitals being allowed to procure 25% of domestic vaccine production each when it had become clear that vaccine delivery had slowed down sharply. Government sources said the PM’s nod and groundwork began before the Supreme Court’s June 3 observations and sought to rebut the Congress claim that the change in vaccine policy was prompted by the court’s critical observations. Speaking on the new policy, sources said the private sector is an important force multiplier and a partner in the fight against Covid and it will have a significant role in the vaccination drive as states will be asked to aggregate hospitals willing to be part of the campaign. The guidelines that will be framed to implement changes in the national vaccine policy announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday will reflect efforts to ensure a wider access to anti-Covid shots and improve private sector participation. Official sources said vaccine supplies contracted by private hospitals as well as state governments under the 50+25+25 scheme that has been in force since May 1 will be fulfilled. Thereafter, government will step in to help ensure supplies to the private sector are better distributed and contribute to ramping up India’s vaccination drive. Government data show that 53 crore shots will be available for use till July and 133 crore jabs are estimated to be procured from August to December. As of now, some 6.6 crore shots were purchased from the PM Cares fund and 28 crore from the domestic budget. The current estimate of 187 crore shots is for the entire year. The production and availability of Sputnik has increased on current reckoning. The figure is less than the estimated 2 billion shots put out earlier but officials said some under trial products, including those in phase 3, had been excluded. The government also held that the pace of the vaccination drive in terms of sessions held and shots administered will relate to vaccine availability. It was argued that calculating a monthly average may not be accurate as the number of sessions will increase with availability and will also depend on how states improve access and carry out effective campaigns against vaccine hesitancy. Officials said that the policy had been altered due to demands by state governments but the situation changed once it became apparent that supplies were not easy to come by.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/groundwork-for-free-vaccination-began-before-supreme-courts-observations/articleshow/83325948.cms||---
---||India||Government's new Covid prescription drops many ‘common’ drugs||MUMBAI: The central health ministry has issued an evidence-based treatment plan for Covid-19 patients, dropping many medicines that had become household names during the course of the pandemic. Antiviral favipiravir, India’s largest selling drug in April, doesn’t find mention in the document put out on the website of the directorate general of health services (DGHS). The other antiviral remdesivir has been recommended for limited use — only on the prescription by a “senior doctor” — as it is an “experimental drug with a potential to harm”. For the past 15 months, the majority of Covid patients in India got a prescription of six to eight medicines soon after diagnosis. “The poly-pharmacy phenomenon was irrational. We are extremely happy that these guidelines have been drawn up on robust evidence,” said Dr S P Kalantri from Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha. The guidelines only mention four medicines as necessary for severe Covid patients: oxygen, steroids, tocilizumab (not all but based on certain blood parameters) and anti-coagulants for patients with comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, etc. The guidelines make it clear that medicines are meant only for those moderate or severe Covid-19 patients who need hospitalisation. For people with mild Covid, only medicines to reduce fever and cough are advised. Common antibiotics such as azithromycin and doxycycline are missing from the list. So is ivermectin, the antiparasitic drug for filariasis. Pharmacy best-sellers zinc supplement and vitamins A, B, C and D are also not mentioned. Previous protocols by the Union and state government always mentioned 15-30 day course of zinc and vitamin C and D. WHO chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan welcomed India’s “evidence-based guidelines”. A global health expert from McGill University in Canada, Dr Madhu Pai, said, “I am delighted to see these new evidence-based Covid guidelines. This will not only save lives, but also reduce costs for patients,” he added. In Mumbai, pulmonologist Dr Lancelot Pinto said he could stop being “apologetic” to his patients. “I’ve never prescribed ivermectin, doxycycline or favipiravir to my Covid patients, but had to explain why,” he said. A senior doctor from a BMC hospital said the guidelines don’t mention patients with comorbidities. Another doctor said while ICMR puts out treatment protocols (during Covid), this has come from DGHS. “A regular doctor could be confused about which agency to follow,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/governments-new-covid-prescription-drops-many-common-drugs/articleshow/83326019.cms||Malathy Iyer

The party's receipts worth Rs 682 crore in the year 2019-20 mark a significant fall from Rs 918 crore earned by the party in 2018-19, which was immediately followed by the Lok Sabha polls. Other national parties whose annual audit reports were uploaded on the EC website on Monday are CPM and CPI. While CPM's income for the year 2019-20 stood at nearly Rs 159 crore, CPI's was Rs 6.58 crore. The expenditure incurred by CPM was Rs 105.68 crore in 2019-20, and that of CPI, Rs 6.53 crore. BJP's annual audit report is not yet available. An EC notification said the last date for submission of annual audit report for 2019-20 had been extended to June 30, 2021 in view of the Covid pandemic. Both TMC and BSP had submitted their annual audit report for 2019-20 in February 2021. Congress's earnings through bonds fell to Rs 318 crore as compared to Rs 382 crore in 2018-19.

Individual donors contributed Rs 23.63 crore to Congress, down from Rs 49.46 crore in 2018-19. A big chunk of its revenue, almost Rs 192.45 crore, was from issuance of coupons, even though it was much less than Rs 322.59 crore earned through this mode in 2018-19. Congress spent Rs 864 crore on elections in 2019-20, including Rs 406 crore on election publicity and Rs 5.7 lakh on pre-poll surveys.

Sawant had earlier set July 31 as his target to administer the first dose to the 18-44 age group. “We will also administer the second (vaccine) dose as soon as possible,” Sawant said. When asked how the state would speed up vaccination, the chief minister said that through the Tika Utsav, 80% of the 45+ population has already been administered the first dose of the vaccine. “We are starting Tika Utsav for the 18-44 age group from June 21, and we will complete administering the vaccine for that age group,” he said. “We have to take precautions for two more months till we complete vaccinating 100% of the eligible population.” Sawant said that the recovery rate is now over 92%, and that the mortality rate has also come down. He also said that the positivity rate is high in Goa because the state tests all persons who have Covid symptoms. Sawant also thanked PM Narendra Modi on behalf of the people of the state for taking a decision to provide free vaccines for those in the 18-44 age group. The CM also lauded the decision to provide the second dose of the vaccine within 28 days for seafarers and students and those travelling abroad. The state government recently extended the state-level curfew till June 14. He also said that the state has already started preparation for the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-begin-process-to-unlock-from-jun-15-says-sawant/articleshow/83323195.cms||---

Official sources say that revenue from passenger services has come down drastically since the pandemic began. During the first wave, APSRTC suffered a revenue loss of Rs 2,603 crore. Bus services in Andhra Pradesh are currently operative only during non-curfew hours, that is from 6am to 12 noon. Thus, less than 20 per cent of the transport corporation’s fleet is active. “Out of a fleet of 800 buses in Kadapa, only 240 are running daily,” a senior APSRTC official said. On the other hand, the corporation is earning more from ferrying cargo than passengers. “Freight revenue has also come down. Normally, it used to be Rs 2 lakh per day, but now it stands at Rs 90,000 per day. In many depots, cargo earnings are much higher than passenger earnings,” the senior official added. With this in mind, the management is looking to increase cargo services in areas where there is high demand. Officials point out that freight revenue increases in summer at places like Anantapur, Kadapa and Tirupati. There are 13 booking points in Kadapa RTC cargo region and special RTC goods vans are currently in use. Officials said some buses would be transformed into cargo buses by removing chairs to cater to the additional demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rtc-banks-on-cargo-demand-to-stay-afloat/articleshow/83319859.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Southwesterly winds over the Arabian Sea are also likely to strengthen from June 10. Director of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Amaravati, S Stella said the southwest monsoon had covered some parts of Rayalaseema region.

North-coastal Andhra Pradesh may receive heavy rains in some parts from June 11 to 13. Parts of Andhra Pradesh may receive thundershowers or moderate rain on June 8, she added. The IMD said Andhra Pradesh, which receives over 70 per cent of its annual rainfall between June and September, is likely to receive normal to above normal rainfall this southwest monsoon. The entry of the monsoon has led to a decrease in temperature in the state with maximum temperatures not exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. On Monday, the maximum temperature hovered between 32 to 39 degrees Celsius, with the highest temperature (39.3) recorded at Kavali in Nellore. Andhra Pradesh received record rainfall during the southwest monsoon in 2020, the most in the last 32 years.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Unvaccinated get ‘jab done’ SMS, dose of doubt on district’s claim||PALANPUR: Nonagenarian Santuben Parmar, living in Deodar of Banaskantha, a remote and tribal dominant district, has hardly moved out of her house for months due to age-related complications. Her family was then surprised when her son received a message on his mobile phone that she was administered the first dose of Covid-19 vaccination. Parmar had neither gone for vaccination nor had any health worker visited her home. Parmar’s son, Thakarshi told TOI, “None of my family members have got vaccinated yet. Naturally, I was surprised when I received a message about my mother getting vaccinated at a primary health centre (PHC) in Suigam. I checked with the PHC and showed them the message, but they did not tell me anything about how this could have happened.” During a field visit to Banaskantha, TOI came across many such cases across the district where people had randomly received messages on their cell phones that they were vaccinated when in reality they had not taken the jab. In fact, such cases raise a question mark over the veracity of the district administration’s claims made on May 11 that 98% of its 45+ years population had been vaccinated against Covid-19. Officials claimed 6.04 lakh out of 6.18 lakh people in this age group were inoculated in the first two phases of vaccination drive. This was claimed to be the highest coverage in this age group. However, there are many people across villages in Amirgadh, Suigam, Vadgam, Palanpur, Deodar and Deesa talukas who were found to be vaccinated on paper only. Manjula Rathod (50) from Vadgam also got a message on June 2 that she was vaccinated. She said that she is yet to receive any dose of a Covid vaccine. Dr Bhavi Shah, a resident of Deesa and a senior resident doctor in pediatric faculty at Banas Medical college in Palanpur, took both the dose of vaccines on February 9, 2021 and March 31, 2021 respectively. So when she received two more messages about being vaccinated on April 4, she became apprehensive about possible irregularities. “The two messages received mentioned different birth years in my name. I shared the messages on social media, fearing possibility of some irregularity and around 15 friends of mine replied saying this had happened to them too,” she said. A couple from Deesa, Sanjay and Naina Darji received a message that they were vaccinated with the second dose even though they did not take the shot. "We got the first dose on April 10 under the category of frontline workers. We were scheduled to take the second dose on May 25 but could not do so due to some pressing work. On May 28, my wife and I received a message that we were vaccinated,” said Sanjay. When apprised of the cases encountered, district development officer Ajay Dahia said that he would have to look into the cases on one to one basis. He, however, stuck to the claims of successful vaccination drives and said, “If anyone from the rural areas is left out, we will cover them all.” In the hilly terrain of Amirgadh taluka, even young people were vaccinated in the category of aged above 45. On the other hand, there are tribal populated villages where people were not vaccinated and no health officer visited. Khimji Dungaisa, a sarpanch of group panchayats of six villages—Upla Khapa, Nichla Khapa, Upla Bandh, Nichla Bandh, Karamdi and Khati Sitra, said that there are around 7,000 people in all the villages and only three to four persons—Asha and Anganwadi workers, were vaccinated. “Tribals cannot skip a day’s work to get vaccines and spend Rs 30 or Rs 40 to go to a PHC to get vaccines. Government should hold a camp in our villages so that our people can be vaccinated,” said Dungaisa. A villager of Khati Sitra said that a group named Bharat Sarkar, which is active in those villages, spread rumours that people may die or become impotent after taking vaccines so many people refrain from the vaccine drive. Dudhaji Rajput, a sarpanch of Bharadwa village in Suigam taluka, said that many people in his village have received messages that they were vaccinated even though they did not take the shot. “District administration and government are making false claims of vaccination coverage. Many people have been deprived of the vaccines due to their corruption and fake vaccination drive,” said Dudhaji. A villager in Bharadwa, Ramsinh Rajput said that he has been ferrying people for vaccination, but his own aunt was not vaccinated. "But still she received a message that she was vaccinated. An officer of Banaskantha district administration said that an inquiry has been initiated to verify the claims and ascertain the complaints, but the government personnel could not find aggrieved people. A local youth Congress leader, Lalit Gadhvi said that he has come across many people who got messages of being vaccinated but were not inoculated. “People are reluctant to come forward and speak on this issue as they are scared and fear being targeted,” said Gadhvi. A corporator from Palanpur Sarfaraz Sindhi said that people also are afraid of falling ill, death and impotency. “We have been trying to mobilise people for the vaccination drive now. The claims of 98% vaccination seem to be fake as of now,” said Sindhi.

---||Business||Paytm’s IPO official, staff invited to sell their shares||MUMBAI: In its first official communication of its plans to list, Paytm has written to employees stating that its parent company One97 Communications has received an in-principle approval from its board to float an initial public offering (IPO). The mail said that the IPO would comprise a fresh issue and/or an offer for sale of shares. It has offered employees an option to sell their holdings in the issue. In what might be an indication of the time frame, the mail asks employees to transfer the shares that they propose to sell in an escrow account by June 22 this year. The company has said that it may, prior to the issue, undertake a sub-division of its authorised share capital before filing the draft red herring prospectus. The mail added that the size of the offer for sale component is subject to the final approval of the board. If the size of the issue is not enough to accommodate all the shares offered by employees, the shares will be accepted on a pro-rata basis. There has been speculation over the size of Paytm’s IPO in the media. Reports have placed the size of the offering at $3 billion, or around Rs 22,000 crore, which would make it the largest so far. One97 Communication has transferred almost its entire payments business to Paytm Payments Bank, which received an RBI licence in 2015. The bank was launched with One97 holding 39%, promoter Vijay Shekhar Sharma holding 51% and 10% held by a One97 subsidiary. Paytm Payments Bank has since made an application to convert itself into a small finance bank which will enable it to transform into a new age bank. This will enable the bank to substantially increase its earning potential through loans and credit cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytms-ipo-official-staff-invited-to-sell-their-shares/articleshow/83323733.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Delhi||In a hurry, rains may hit Delhi early||NEW DELHI: After hitting Kerala on June 3, the southwest monsoon is advancing sooner than expected, and can hit Delhi before the normal onset date of June 27, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. It added that, at this rate, the monsoon was expected to touch parts of Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand in the next two days, with a possibility of reaching parts of western Uttar Pradesh by June 13-14. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist, IMD, and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, Delhi, said the monsoon trough was currently moving in advance, having covered the northeast, parts of Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and sub-Himalayan West Bengal already. “Parts of eastern and western Uttar Pradesh may see some rain by June 13-14, meaning it could reach Delhi several days in advance. We will have to monitor its progress this week, but the current forecast for Delhi is an advanced onset of monsoon,” said Srivastava. While the normal date for onset of monsoon in Delhi earlier was June 29, it was revised to June 27 last year. Though, last year, the monsoon was declared on June 25. “A low-pressure area is likely to form over north Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood around June 11. Under its influence, the southwest monsoon is likely to advance into most parts of Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand and some parts of Bihar in the next two days,” said IMD on Monday. TOI had earlier reported how Delhi had largely seen “below normal” monsoon over the last decade. Between 2010 and 2020, Delhi only received “above normal” monsoon thrice. While the normal mark for the capital between June and September is 648.9mm, it received 576.6mm rainfall last year and only 404.3mm in 2019. Between 2010 and 2020, the highest rainfall, at 1,031.5mm, was received in 2010, while the lowest in this period was 370.8mm in 2014.

After some of the lockdown restrictions were relaxed in the state from June 1, the number of flyers departing from the airport increased considerably. According to the data provided by the airport authorities, as many as 4,084 passengers travelled from the Patna airport to other states while only 2,509 arrived here on June 6. On the same day last month, 4,028 people had flown back to the city and 1,535 left for other places. Accordingly, different airlines have increased the number of aircraft from 19-23 about a week ago to 31-32 now. Airport director Bhupesh C H Negi told this newspaper on Monday that improvement in the Covid-19 scenario in metros like Delhi and Mumbai was possibly the reason behind the rise in the number of passengers flying to other cities. “People, who had returned to their hometown during the second wave of the pandemic, are returning to their workplaces,” he said. Another airport official said the total number of flights from Patna had gone down mainly due to poor passenger traffic earlier. A senior executive of the IndiGo also claimed that the footfalls had risen at the Patna airport after many states relaxed their lockdown restrictions. “We are slowly recording an upward trend with a rise in demand for air travel,” he added. Echoing similar views, a GoAir employee said, “Long queues can be seen at the airport now. We are expect better footfalls in June as flyers have regained their confidence.” Sources claimed that only 2,189 passengers had travelled to other states from the Patna airport on May 27 and 901 people arrived here on May 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/airport-registers-more-departures-than-arrivals/articleshow/83317401.cms||Faryal Rumi

In the absence of adequate monitoring from police and civic authorities, crowds of people, mainly women above the age of 45, are gathering at the centres to complete the Aadhaar-phone number linking process and other upgrades to become eligible for various government benefits. With the state government likely to release funds to beneficiaries under the YSR Cheyutha scheme, many women are rushing to nearby Aadhaar centres, resulting in a huge rush at seeding centres, especially at Prasadampadu, Gandhinagar and Patamata. In the absence of monitoring, crowds are gathering at Aadhaar centres maintained by private persons. “We came to the Aadhaar centre at 6 am. By that time around 40 women were already waiting. Poor servers are increasing the waiting time. No one is following physical distancing norms. We are unable to wait outside in the heat,” said R Aadilakshmi, a resident of Ramavarappadu. When TOI tried to contact some Aadhaar centres about violation of Covid-19 guidelines, it was said people are ignoring protocol despite tokens being issued and attempts to maintain queues. In the meantime, many women have requested the government to extend the due date for updating Aadhaar details and to increase the number of Aadhaar centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/covid-guidelines-forgotten-as-long-queues-stretch-at-aadhaar-centres/articleshow/83319307.cms||Venu Lanka

Further, he asked the disaster management department (DMD) to constantly monitor the emerging flood situation, besides instructing the water resources department (WRD) to maintain utmost vigil through trained personnel to ensure the protection of embankments and prevention of soil erosion caused by the rivers. Similarly, Nitish also asked the departments concerned to put in place the mechanism required to conduct rescue and relief operations. He said arrangements should be made to ensure the availability of medicines for human as well as fodder for cattle. He said the coronavirus tests should be conducted on persons displaced by the floods and brought to the relief camps. Those found infected by the coronavirus should be kept in isolation at the relief camps, and arrangements should also be made for their treatment, CM added. The review meeting was conducted through videoconferencing and attended by the department heads concerned and the respective DMs. Nitish asked the officials concerned to get the damaged roads and bridges repaired by June 15. Further, he pointed to tackling the floods or the drought situation in the areas falling under the newly formed urban local bodies. At the start of the review, representatives of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) pointed out that the monsoon is expected to arrive in the state on June 13-14, while the quantum of rain to be received this month will be more than the normal. They also presented the 10-year pattern of the rainfall received in the state. DMD principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit informed the CM that all the preparations had been made to tackle the flood situation and instructions had also been issued to execute all the steps as per the special operating procedure (SOP). He also said availability of medicines for humans and cattle, fodder for the cattle, safe drinking water, polythene sheets would be ensured. Similarly, WRD secretary Sanjeev Hans also informed the CM about the steps taken by his department for the protection of embankments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-complete-preparations-by-june-13-to-tackle-flood-situation/articleshow/83318754.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Bihar: Lukewarm response to vaccination drive in Begusarai||BEGUSARAI: While the strict enforcement of lockdown seems to have halted the severity of the second wave of Covid-19 in the district, people have a lukewarm response to the ongoing vaccination drive, particularly in the rural areas. Even the launch of vaccination express, which travels to villages for the convenience of people, has so far failed to enthuse common people to get the shots. As per information available, only 165 persons turned up to take the jab during the vaccine express’ three-day run in various wards of Bihat Nagar Parishad from June 3 to 6. Similar was the case at many of the rural vaccination centres as people living in nearby villages show little interest in inoculation. Begusarai DM Arvind Kumar Verma held a videoconference on Sunday with various district and block level officials of the administration and health department and representatives of WHO and Unicef to give directions for speeding up the vaccination process. He directed the block officials to ensure that people of different areas get prior knowledge about the vaccination schedule in their localities. Besides, they should also ensure that all panchayat representatives under their areas must have taken the jab as the district administration has inputs that many of them are also averse to taking the jab due to various rumours, which causes hesitation in other people in the area for vaccination. He also asked the officials to seek help of local religious heads of various sects to motivate people to come forward for vaccination as it helps counter the Covid threat and also boosts the immune system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lukewarm-response-to-vax-drive-in-begusarai/articleshow/83317916.cms||Rajiv Kumar
---||Patna||Bihar: Vaccination up, positivity rate down in Purnia||PURNIA: There has been sharp decline in the Covid positivity rate in the district, which boasts of smooth vaccination drive. “We are leading, in comparison to neighbouring districts, in vaccinating people above 45 years of age. Till Sunday, over 3,99,000 people have been administered the vaccines, including 64,000 who received their second dose. In the 18-44 years age group, around 2,146 have been inoculated,” civil surgeon (CS) Dr S K Verma said on Monday. District magistrate (DM) Rahul Kumar along with the civil surgeon has been mobilising people to take vaccines. The DM recently asked the DEOs, BEOs, COs, CDPOs and Jeevika workers to reach out to people to inoculate at PHC level. “The immunisation process for the 45+ people has been going on at 14 primary health centres (PHCs). Our officials persuaded the panchayat and faith leaders to come forward to take vaccines. This helped others follow suit,” Dr Verma said. On positivity rate, Dr Verma said only 14 people tested positive out of the 2,142 samples tested in the district on Sunday. On June 5, 23 people had fbeen found infected out of the 2,675 samples tested. The positivity rate in June has come down to 1.24%, compared to 6.78% in May and 7.24% in April, Dr Verma said. On hospital admissions, he said 42-55 Covid patients used to be admitted at the dedicated Covid health centres. Their number has come down to 16. “We are miking, distributing pamphlets, posters and banners with phone numbers of the control room so that our team members can visit the villages for vaccination, if they are contacted for the purpose,” he said. Dr Verma claimed no shortage of vaccines in the district. “Even people from adjoining districts visit Purnia for Covid treatment. We have sufficient ventilators and work is on to set up oxygen generation plants at Sadar hospital, Dhamdaha sub-divisional health centre (SDHC) and Banmankhi SDHC,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vaccination-up-vity-rate-down-in-purnia/articleshow/83317960.cms||---

---||Varanasi||Uttar Pradesh: Negative RT-PCR report for entry to Kashi Vishwanath Temple not must now||VARANASI: The provision of carrying negative RT-PCR report for getting entry in the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, enforced from April 14, will end from Tuesday morning, although entry to the devotees will be permitted as per the Covid-19 protocol. Coincidently, after the complete closure of over 100 days during the first wave of Covid-19, the KVT had reopened on June 8 in 2020 also. The divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “The district administration had made carrying negative RT-PCR test report of past 72 hours mandatory for entry into KVT from April 14 following a massive surge in number of Covid-19 cases with the beginning of second wave of the pandemic. As the situation is now under control, we have decided to reopen the KVT with restrictions as prescribed in Covid protocol.” The officials said that SOPs for crowd management from entry of devotees into the temple till their exit has been finalised. The devotees will enter from Chhattadwar (gate 4) while maintaining social distancing for which markings have been made. Wearing mask and sanitising hands will be a must for entry, they said adding that as per the state government guidelines, more than five persons will not be allowed inside the temple at a time. The commissioner made it clear that no one will be allowed to enter Garbhgriha (sanctum sanctorum) while sparsh darshan (touching Jyotirlinga) will also not be allowed for now. Devotees will offer prayer from outside the sanctum sanctorum by darshan of the Jyotirlinga from the door, he added. Though the district administration and temple authorities had not announced closure of the temple like in 2020, making negative RT-PCR report mandatory for entry into the temple led to decrease in the number of devotees visiting the temple to almost nil in past 54 days. Before the Covid menace started in March 2020, KVT had an average footfall of over 10,000 devotees per day. After the temple reopened on June 8, 2020 devotees had started thronging in meagre numbers in Shrawan month, even on Shrawan Mondays. The arrival of devotees, including pilgrims especially from southern and western states, started in winters. The district administration then decided to restrict the entry of devotees in KVT and other prominent temples by making the provision of carrying negative RT-PCR report and also asked hoteliers to seek the same from people seeking accommodation. Amidst challenges of arranging beds in level-3 and L-2 facilities for the massively increasing critical Covid positive patients, the commissioner and the district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma had issued advisory to discourage people from gathering at prime shrines, religious and tourist sites. The district administration has also asked pilgrims and tourists from across the country to avoid visiting the holy city for pilgrimage in view of the booming figures of new Covid-19 positive cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/negative-rt-pcr-report-for-entry-to-kvt-not-must-now/articleshow/83319112.cms||---

This follows the formal approval granted by the Indian Air Force for starting this vital facility, infrastructure for, which was already installed at the Civil Enclave by Airports Authority of India (AAI). “Requisite permissions have now been granted by Indian Air Force (IAF) for starting this vital facility at the airport located at Bamrauli and airlines operating flights here would now be able to avail it,” said regional director of AAI, Prayagraj, Achal Prakash. The Prayagraj Airport Advisory Board was informed of this development by the IAF representative in a virtual meeting of the board held last week. The decision is considered to be important as once night landing of flights starts, Prayagraj airport would join the ranks of Lucknow and Varanasi airports, with more flights landing or taking off. “The permission for night landing of flights is a welcome news and now the airlines would be able to start using this facility as per their need and flight schedules,” said Prakash. This also promises operation of more flights for the city as there would not be any compulsion of operating between dawn to dusk, he added. The AAI has already installed the necessary infrastructure for starting the facility including CAT-1 (category-1) lights along the runway at a cost of around Rs 1 crore that clearly mark the runway for the approaching pilots to help them land their aircraft even in low visibility or during night hours when visibility is limited to as low as 800 metres. The airport is also equipped with instrument landing system, which is vital facility for night landing facility. Officials said IAF’s clearance for starting night landing was needed as though the airport is owned and run by the AAI, the runway is owned by IAF. Terminal manager, Prayagraj airport, Shyam Kartik Singh said the advisory board meeting chaired by Phulpur MP Keshari Devi Patel and attended by representatives of AAI, IAF, district administration, PWD, Prayagraj Nagar Nigam among others, also discussed connecting the airport with the proposed metro rail service of Sangam City in the first phase so that commuting to and from the airport became faster, easier and economical. During the meeting, ADM (city) AK Kanaujia said financial approval for providing a four-lane connectivity to the airport had been received and work in this regard would also begin soon. Work for construction of a new drainage system at the airport to prevent waterlogging would also start within the next five days. Discussions on putting in place a robust system for waste disposal as well as increasing number of security personnel at the airport too were held. The airport has a sanctioned strength of 144 workers and officials but has just 86 presently posted here. In operation since December 2019, the Civil Enclave provides direct air connectivity to number of cities including New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Raipur, Kolkata, Pune and Gorakhpur besides Bhopal, Dehradun and Bhubaneswar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/night-landing-at-civil-enclave-of-prayagraj-to-start-soon/articleshow/83318083.cms||---

---||Business||EU’s new move may hit India, S Africa’s patent waiver plan||Mumbai: The European Union (EU) has drawn up a counter proposal that could “undermine” India and South Africa’s proposed submission at the World Trade Organization (WTO) seeking a waiver on intellectual property (IP) on Covid drugs and vaccines. This comes ahead of the WTO meeting slated on June 8, amid stark inequities in access to Covid vaccines globally. Opposition to the submission continues with the EU, Japan, the UK and Switzerland stalling it, while importantly the US threw its weight behind the waiver. If adopted at the WTO, the waiver would provide countries with critical policy space to address IP barriers to increase collaboration in R&D, manufacturing, scale-up and, hence, boost supply of Covid medicines & vaccines. The EU proposal calls governments to “facilitate the use of compulsory licensing within the WTO’s existing agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)”. “The agreement already provides this flexibility, which is a legitimate tool during the pandemic that can be used swiftly where needed.” (Compulsory licensing, or CLs — used during previous public health emergencies — is when a government grants a licence to a company without the patent holder’s consent, for accessing a therapy.) It also says the use of export restrictions should be limited, and supply chains be open. “Vaccine-producing countries should be ready to export a fair share of their domestic production. Supply chains are highly interconnected and should not be disrupted,” the statement added. The EU counter proposal to a TRIPS waiver is not fit for purpose, and nothing but a manoeuvre to push for voluntary actions of pharmaceutical corporations as a solution to replace a concrete legal solution backed by over 100 countries, public health experts say. “The EU aims to disrupt the negotiations with this ‘new’ proposal, which is nothing more than CLs as we know. We have a good momentum now with the US, along with 100 countries backing it. India and South Africa have submitted a revised proposal, and (this) should be a good start for negotiations,” Public Citizen research director Burcu Kilic said. Further, international humanitarian organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) denounced the EU, and countries including the UK, Switzerland and Norway, for employing delay tactics, instead of agreeing to start formal negotiations on the critical waiver. “The proposal ignores the shortcomings of existing regulations, including compulsory licensing, and the impact of decades of bilateral pressure from the EU has had on their implementation in many countries across the world. Our analysis has shown that compulsory licences alone would not be enough to achieve urgent access to lifesaving Covid medical tools even in the EU itself during this pandemic,” an MSF official told TOI. The EU proposal only applies to patent barriers and does not address IP barriers in the regulatory system, which are required to be waived, when countries and manufacturers are seeking expansion, and supply of Covid vaccines, medicines and other health technologies. It seems to focus on vaccines and to some extent therapeutics, instead of covering all Covid medical technologies, the experts added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/eus-new-move-may-hit-india-s-africas-patent-waiver-plan/articleshow/83323671.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||Ahmedabad||Surat woman’s lungs save life of Covid survivor||Surat: A woman from Jalgaon in Maharashtra had managed to beat Covid-19 but her ordeals were far from over. Coronavirus had completely damaged her lungs. With doctors advising lung transplant as the only option to save the woman, her family was hoping against hope to get an organ donor in time. Just before midnight on Sunday their prayers were answered when the family of a 46-year-old brain-dead woman from a Surat village decided to donate her organs. Kamini Patel, a resident of Timbarva (Sankli) in Bardoli taluka, gave a new lease of life not only to the 31-year-old woman Covid-19 survivor from Maharashtra but also to six others. Apart from lungs, Patel’s heart, two kidneys, liver and corneas were also donated. The lungs were transplanted into the Covid-19 survivor woman at Hyderabad’s KIMS Hospital. A green corridor was created from Surat to Hyderabad, a distance of 940 km, and the lungs were shifted in 160 minutes. Patel was under treatment since May 17, after she was unable to get up from the bed. Her blood pressure shot up all of a sudden and doctors diagnosed that she had suffered brain-hemorrhage. She was shifted to Shalby hospital in Surat where the blood clot from her brain was removed after craniotomy surgery. But her condition did not improve and doctors declared her brain-dead on Saturday after which the Donate Life team approached the Patel family. “My wife is dead but she would give a new lease of life to seven people. Her organs would bring smiles to the faces of those patients who are in urgent need of them,” said Bharat, Patel’s husband. The heart harvested from Patel was transplanted into a 46-year-old woman from Mumbai at Mumbai-based H N Reliance Hospital. Patel’s one kidney was transplanted into a 30-year-old woman from Ahmedabad at the Sterling Hospital, Ahmedabad. Her second kidney was transplanted into a 27-year-old woman from Ahmedabad at the Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Centre (IKDRC), Ahmedabad. The liver was transplanted into a 58-year-old man from Bhavnagar at the IKDRC. The corneas were donated to Surat-based Lok Drashti Chakshu Bank (eye bank). For a grieving Bharat, a social worker, it wasn’t a tough decision to make when the Donate Life team including its founding member Nilesh Mandlewala approached him for organ donation. Bharat had helped in setting up isolation wards for Covid-19 patients and distributing medical instruments and other items to the needy in Bardoli and nearby villages. “We met the family members and they readily agreed for cadaver donations,” Mandlewala, founding member of Donate Life. Patel’s son Aniket, who is pursuing computer engineering from Charuset University in Anand, despite the personal loss, was thinking about the lives that the cadaver donations would save. “Due to Covid-19, many people including youngsters have suffered damage to their lungs and they need urgent transplants to survive. My mother’s lung would help one of the Covid-19 survivors get a new life,” Aniket said. “This was the first heart and lungs donation from Gujarat since the onset of the second wave of Covid-19,” Mandlewala added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/surat-womans-lungs-save-life-of-covid-survivor/articleshow/83321200.cms||---
---||Business||Sebi bars Franklin MF from starting debt funds for 2 years||Mumbai: Markets regulator Sebi on Monday barred Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund (FTMF) from launching new debt schemes for two years for mismanaging some of its fixed income funds. Sebi also fined FTMF Rs 5 crore for not adhering to rules relating to categorisation of MF schemes. In addition, it asked the management to refund Rs 512 crore in fees to investors in the six debt schemes which the fund house had decided to close down on April 23, 2020. In a separate order, Sebi also barred Vivek Kudva, a director at FTMF and head of its parent’s Asia-Pacific region, from the market for one year and asked him to pay Rs 4 crore as a fine. Along with Vivek, his wife Roopa, former MD & CEO of Crisil and now head of Omidyar Network, has also been barred from the market for a year and fined Rs 3 crore. Vivek, Roopa and Vasanthi Kudva (Vivek’s mother) had withdrawn money from some of FTMF’s debt funds even as negotiations were on internally within the fund house about the stress in these schemes. The fine imposed on Vivek includes the penalty that’s due to his mother, Sebi said. In April 2020, FTMF had announced closure of six of its debt funds, which then had total assets under management worth nearly Rs 25,900 crore. Following this decision, Sebi had started investigations to see how these funds were launched. It found that although these funds were sold under various names and projected to be differentiated in their management approach, in reality all were being managed as credit risk funds. This is a type of high-risk fixed income money management style. FTMF was found “seriously wanting in so far as its conduct as (a fund house) is concerned”, the Sebi report said. Investigations found that FTMF had breached mutual fund regulations. “Income derived out of wrongful conduct, which ultimately resulted in loss and caused hardship to the investors…is liable to be disgorged. For the impropriety committed while functioning as (a fund house), imposition of penalty is also justified,” Sebi said. Hence, in addition to the Rs 5-crore fine, FTMF has also been asked to refund about Rs 513 crore to investors which these six schemes had collected as fees between June 4, 2018 and April 23, 2020, the order said. In the other order relating to the closure of the six FTMF funds, Sebi barred director Kudva along with his wife for withdrawing money from some of the funds ahead of the public announcement for closure. In his capacity as a director of the fund house, Vivek was privy to information “such as concerns of redemption, concentration and liquidity risk pertaining to the stress” in the six debt schemes, “most of which was not in public domain”, Sebi said in its order. Sebi alleged that the non-public information that Vivek received was also used by his wife and mother to redeem funds from some of the FTMF schemes ahead of its announcement for closure in which investors are yet to receive their full amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-bars-franklin-mf-from-starting-debt-funds-for-2-years/articleshow/83323787.cms||---

With onboarding Asal Foods, we expect the average revenue per freezer to grow by 3x.” Milky Mist overall revenue crossed Rs 1,000 crore as of March 30, 2021, and saw a 30% year-on-year growth in FY21. “We have been growing by an average of 40% every year,” he said. Started in 2012, Asal Foods manufactues ready to cook and everyday consumption products like idly dosa batter, chapathi, vada batter, wheat parotta. Milky Mist will retain the ‘Asal’ brand. “We see synergies only in the distribution channel. The biggest challenge faced by Asal was single product distribution, especially a product like batter which is of less value. And we have a strong cold chain distribution,” he added.

The IMD forecasts that the southwest monsoon is very likely to be active along the west coast of India, including Goa, for a period of 4-5 days from June 10 onwards. The state is expected to receive very heavy rainfall of 115mm to 204mm in 24 hours from June 11 to 13. The IMD has attributed the reason for the very heavy rainfall to a low pressure area that is likely to form over the north Bay of Bengal and neighbouring areas by June 11. “Monsoon activity is going to pick up by June 9. We will start to get a slightly better distribution of rainfall from then on. We will have good spells of rain and an active monsoon from June 11 onwards,” IMD scientist Rahul M said. Strong winds with speeds reaching 40-50 kmph, gusting to 60 kmph, are likely to prevail over southwest and west central Arabian Sea till June 10. On June 8, strong winds with speed reaching 40-50 kmph are likely to prevail over the northeast Arabian Sea. On June 9 and 10, winds of the same intensity are likely to prevail over northeast Arabian Sea and adjoining the Gujarat coast. They are also likely to prevail along and off the Kerala coast and Lakshadweep islands on June 8 and 9. Fishermen are advised not to venture into these areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-to-receive-very-heavy-rain-from-jun-11-to-13/articleshow/83323113.cms||---

Despite Vijayawada GGH being a state Covid-19 hospital, lower level staff have faced criticism for switching the bodies of two Covid-19 victims and informing their families about the deaths much later. K Srinu Babu, a relative of a Covid-19 patient from Nandigama, said, “We were repeatedly calling the helpdesk at the hospital to know about the health of our family member. But they didn’t respond properly. On Sunday we received a call that the patient had died but we were shocked to know that my uncle died on Friday and we were informed about it much later.” A few attendants of patients complained that they were not given passes to meet their family members. “My father is in a critical condition as his heart rate is fluctuating. We are not sure whether he will survive. He wished to meet me once. We have purchased a PPE suit and requested the hospital authorities for a pass, but they have denied it to us,” said M Jotsna from Nuzividu. Relatives also complained about the delay in the issue of death certificates and alleged that middlemen were demanding money for issuing a certificate as per a particular insurance format to get the claim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/families-allege-staff-negligence-at-vij-ggh/articleshow/83319686.cms||Venu Lanka

In their order, H P Chaturvedi and Ravikumar Duraisamy of the tribunal’s Mumbai bench said that the approval was subject to the final judgment from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and the Supreme Court’s decision. On May 19, the NCLT had asked lenders to consider an offer made by jailed promoter Kapil Wadhawan, which lenders found ineligible to be voted on. They appealed against the order to the NCLAT, which ruled in favour of the lenders. Wadhawan has since approached the Supreme Court, which is likely to decide on Tuesday whether to admit his petition or not. On Monday, the NCLT also asked the committee of creditors (CoC) to consider giving more money to fixed deposit holders and small investors. Responding to the order, Piramal Group said, “We are pleased with the judgment today approving our resolution plan for DHFL. This follows the endorsement of 94% of lenders, and the subsequent approvals from the RBI and CCI, and reiterates the strength and quality of our bid.” DHFL is among the largest Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) proceedings with over Rs 90,000 crore of debt, and the very first in the financial sector. The RBI initiated bankruptcy proceedings against the company after it failed to meet its liabilities and promoters came under investigation for fraud. Bankers were hopeful of the resolution being completed in the first quarter, but now they expect the process to be completed only after July. “This decision paves the way for a quick resolution. Yes, there are legal challenges, and we need to wait for those decisions, but we are confident that this will happen quickly,” said Rajkiran Rai, MD & CEO of Union Bank of India, which one of the large lenders to the group. He added that the CoC will look at the court’s directions to consider giving more to fixed deposit holders. “This group of creditors has voted against the resolution and, according to NCLT mechanism, they are eligible for liquidation value. But that is a decision which the CoC needs to take, and I do not want to pre-empt the CoC,” said Rai. According to banking industry sources, the fixed deposit holders will not be stakeholders in the company after the acquisition as Piramal will be operating the company as a non-deposit taking NBFC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nclt-clears-piramal-bid-to-acquire-dhfl/articleshow/83323558.cms||---

According to the order, Vaibhav Dhadda, a trader with Fidelity Group, along with his mother Alka and sister Arushi, were front-running the exact trades that the FPI employee was putting in. The case relates to several trades carried out by these entities in 2019 using insider information passed by Vaibhav to other entities either directly or indirectly. Through an interim order, Sebi had in December 2019 banned these entities from the market. Subsequent investigations by the markets regulator found that another eight people were also involved with members of the Dhadda family in these trades and, hence, the order on disgorgements as also the bans. Sebi’s investigations showed that Vaibhav, then an employee with Fidelity, and his wife were residents in Hong Kong and the internet trading accounts for some of those charged in the case were operated out of the same island city. The trades by the Fidelity Group entities were carried out through top foreign and domestic brokerages like Goldman Sachs, UBS Securities, Citigroup and ICICI Securities, and Vaibhav was aware of these trades. On the other hand, Alka and Arushi Dhadda were aware of the trades by the FPI and took positions ahead of those, thus indulging in front-running. And after Fidelity’s trades were executed, the front-runners sold off their positions and made some quick gains. “It appeared that Vaibhav Dhadda had prima facie front-run various entities of Fidelity Group by placing orders through the trading accounts of Alka Dhadda and Arushi Dhadda,” the Sebi order said. The Sebi order showed that the entities together had made a total illegal gain of nearly Rs 3.6 crore. Of this, Rs 1.9 crore has already been impounded by the regulator. The balance amount from the illegal gains from front-running and also interest on it adds up to about Rs 2.1 crore. Sebi show-caused the entities as to why they should not be banned from the market for indulging in these illegal activities. The entities were also directed not to dispose of any assets, movable or immovable, without the prior permission of Sebi, the order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-fines-ex-fidelity-trader-10-others-for-front-running-trades/articleshow/83323855.cms||---

NTCA has on Monday asked all states to close down tiger reserves, national parks, and sanctuaries till further orders citing Covid-19 infection as reason behind death of a lioness inside a zoo in Chennai. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has decided to request the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEF) to reconsider NTCA’s order following objections raised by top wildlife and forest officers here, said sources. Principal secretary (forest department) Ashok Barnwal told TOI that the state government has initiated correspondence to get NTCA’s order revoked. “We are communicating with the Centre for reconsideration of NTCA’s order. Till that time, tourism activities in tiger reserves of Madhya Pradesh would continue,” said Barnwal. Tourism activities resumed in the national parks here on June 1 and were scheduled to continue till June 30. Hundreds of people have already reserved their hotels and safaris across tiger reserves in Kanha, Bandhavgarh, Pench, Satpura and Panna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-opposes-ntca-order-to-shut-tiger-reserves-on-covid-fears/articleshow/83320054.cms||P Naveen

Patna DM Dr Chandrasekhar Singh on Monday said all SDOs and executive officers of nagar parishads have been asked to identify the big apartments as well as slums in their areas and create makeshift vaccination sites for those who could not get the shots for various reasons. “While vaccination in some apartments in the Patna Sadar area has already begun, it would be extended to other areas, including Patna City and Danapur. The executive officers would identify the roadside slums and the number of residents there for vaccinating them as per the rules,” the DM said. While many got their first or second shots, there could be a large number of people, especially the uneducated and from deprived sections, still hesitant to get the jabs and they could become spreader of the virus if not vaccinated, he said. Meanwhile, round-the-clock immunisation would begin at Patliputra sports Complex and Hotel Patliputra Ashoka for both age groups (18 to 44 and 45 and above) from Tuesday. All arrangements have been made. Doctors, nurses and data entry operators have been assigned duties in three shifts for 24x7 drive, the DM said. While spot registration and vaccination facility would be available from 5pm to 9am the next day, pre-registration is required for taking the jabs from 9am to 5pm for 18 to 44 age group. Spot registration for both first and second doses would be made for people of 45 years and above age. The DM said over 11.55 lakh people have been inoculated in the district so far and the 24x7 centres would expedite the immunisation drive. There are thousands of highrise apartments on both sides of the Bailey Road and many of the residents had urged the chairperson of Danapur nagar parishad, Dr Anu Kumari, to arrange makeshift vaccination sites for their convenience.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/district-admn-to-make-doorstep-arrangements-for-vax-shots/articleshow/83316961.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Drug shortage delays surgeries in Patna||PATNA: The unavailability of Liposomal Amphotericin-B, the primary drug used to treat black fungus and prevent it from spreading to other organs, has delayed the number of surgeries of mucormycosis patients in the city during the last few weeks. According to Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P), mucormycosis patients can be treated if Amphotericin-B injections are in stock. “Although we are capable of operating on 10 patients a day, we are only doing four or five surgeries due to the acute shortage of the injection. Right now we are prescribing oral medications to the patients in order to postpone the surgeries,” Dr Sanjeev told this reporter and added that the hospital would also conduct mucormycosis surgeries on Saturdays and Sundays. As many as 120 mucormycosis patients have been admitted to the AIIMS-P so far. On the other hand, the number of such patients has risen to 110 at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS). A senior IGIMS doctor pointed out that 30 people infected with black fungus required debridement (medical removal of dead skin tissue to help a wound heal) because the infection had affected areas like the nose, eyes, mouth, face and even the brain. “After debridement, we need at least six vials of Amphotericin-B for each patient. However, we do not have enough injections,” he added. Of the 23 mucormycosis patients admitted to Paras HMRI, 12 have died so far. The hospital’s regional director (east), Dr Talat Halim, claimed, “We receive the anti-fungal injection only after sending the patients’ names to the government. We, however, faced its shortage on Monday because we did not get the required number of vials from the drug controller.” Doctors say proper assessment of mucormycosis patients is important because surgeons decide the line of treatment on the basis of the body part involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/drug-shortage-delays-black-fungus-surgeries/articleshow/83317481.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Distribution of herbal medicine resumes||NELLORE: Almost a week after the state government gave the green signal, Ayurvedic medicine maker Bonigi Anandaiah of Krishnapatnam in Nellore district resumed distribution of the herbal concoction on Monday. However, there were no queues in the village as the district administration had regulated the entry of visitors to Krishnapatnam. The medicine is being distributed to the locals of Sarvepalle constituency through village and ward volunteers without allowing anyone to visit the village. The Nellore district administration has barred the entry of non-locals into Krishnapatnam village by clamping Section 144 of CrPC. All roads to Krishnapatnam were barricaded for entry of non-locals. Anandaiah said the process took more than the expected time due to the non-availability of the herbal ingredients. “We appeal to people from any part of the state or other parts of the country not to visit Krishnapatnam seeking medicine. We will try to send the medicine to their addresses shortly,” said Anandaiah. The distribution of Anandaiah herbal paste, touted to be miracle cure for Covid-19, was suspended by the state government a fortnight ago following an uproar on social media and a massive turnout in Krishnapatnam village. The state government subsequently roped in experts from the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) to study the composition of the medicines being distributed by Anandaiah. After experts found the medicine has no side effects or harmful contents, the state government decided to allow its distribution. However, the government cautioned the public to not discontinue administration of other medicines for Covid-19. The government has also made it clear that there is no evidence to support that Anandaiah’s medicine is a cure for Covid-19. Meanwhile, the herbal medicine is also available in Chittoor district following the efforts of Chandragiri legislator Dr Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy. Massive arrangements were made at the Narayani Gardens near the Mukkoti temple in Chandragiri assembly constituency from where Dr Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy flagged of the distribution of the medicine on Monday. Speaking to reporters, the legislator said the medicine will be distributed free of cost to 1.6 lakh households across Chandragiri assembly constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/distribution-of-herbal-medicine-resumes/articleshow/83319794.cms||Samdani MN

He, however, questioned the prime minister’s claim that it was on states’ demand that the Centre had given the responsibility of 18+ vaccination to them. Gehlot in a series of tweets said, “I am happy that the PM had to change his decision keeping in view the public sentiments. He claimed that it was due to the campaign by the Congress that forced the central government to change its stand.” BJP leaders react“Congratulations to all the MPs, MLAs, Congress workers and general public who participated in the campaign run by the state Congress party in Rajasthan #SpeakUpForFreeUniversalVaccination.” “It is due to your sentiment that Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji had to announce free vaccination for all the countrymen. This is a victory of public sentiment,” he said. Gehlot countered the prime minister's claim that it was due to the demand of the states that the responsibility of vaccination for 18+ was given to them. “Prime Minister Modi should inform which states had demanded to buy and provide the vaccine for the age group of 18 to 44 years. To my knowledge, no state had made such a demand. The PM's advisors seem to have given him wrong information,” he said The chief minister said, “From the very beginning, our demand was that like vaccination programmes in the past, Covid vaccination should be done by the Centre free of cost.” In the video conference held on April 23, I myself requested the PM to conduct vaccination of 18+ free of cost by the Centre. He said former PM Manmohan Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and the whole opposition in raised their protest against the wrong policies of the Centre and demanded free universal vaccination. The Congress party had launched a #Speak up for free universal vaccination campaign. Many states including Rajasthan had to approach the Supreme court on the issue. The result of such a concerted campaign was that Modi had to reverse his wrong decision, claimed Gehlot. He said no state government had made any provision in the budget for vaccination of 18+ and no suggestion made to the Centre to such an effect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-pressure-forced-modi-to-make-vax-drive-free/articleshow/83324417.cms||---

The investigation had been put on hold due to the pandemic situation. Sleuths from the CBI who reached the central prison guest house in Kadapa questioned Vivekananda Reddy’s driver Dastagiri for a brief while on Monday. It may be recalled that Y S Vivekananda Reddy was found dead under mysterious circumstances at his home in Pulivendula in Kadapa district on March 15, 2019. Following a petition filed by Vivekananda Reddy’s wife Soubhagyamma and daughter Sunitha, the Andhra Pradesh high court directed the state police to hand over the high profile case to the CBI in March last year. While the CBI has already questioned several witnesses in the case last year, the investigation hit a roadblock following the outbreak of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cbi-resumes-probe-into-vivekananda-reddy-murder-case/articleshow/83319913.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

While a leather hub can be established in Kishanganj district and a leather processing unit in Muzaffarpur, Bihar has become the first state to have its ethanol production policy, as a result of which companies like JSW, Micromax and Indian Smart have submitted their project proposals, Hussain also said. At present, the state has project proposals worth Rs 6,199 crore, including Rs 4,616 crore for the establishment of food processing units, he said. Shahnawaz was speaking at a webinar organized jointly by the Press Information Bureau, Regional Outreach Bureau and the state's industries department. The theme of the webinar was the scope for food processing units in the state. S K Malviya, additional director general at PIB’s Patna branch also spoke on the occasion. Shahnawaz said Majhipada in Kishanganj is a centre from where raw leather is being sent to other states, besides being exported to other countries. The government’s plan is to create a leather hub in Kishanganj district and a leather processing unit in Muzaffarpur. As to the scope for ethanol production in Bihar, the minister said the companies have been showing active interest in establishing their units in the state, since it has become the first to have its ethanol policy. The establishment of ethanol production plant will help farmers in selling their damaged grain to the industries department at the rates fixed for fresh grains. It, in turn, will enhance the income of the farmers. The damaged grains will be used to produce ethanol fuel, which is cheaper than petrol and diesel, Hussain said. He said the companies offering to open their units in the state will be allotted land within seven days of the submission of the proposal. Besides, the state government has already transferred the land of all the closed sugar mills to the industries department. Presenting the overall scope for the food processing, leather and textile units, as well as ethanol production plants and the mega food park, Hussain said the state has improved infrastructure like road, air and waterways, while an inland container depot was under construction. Trade and commerce will be conducted smoothly with other states and neighbouring countries, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-bihar-receives-project-proposals-worth-rs-6199-crore/articleshow/83316331.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Monsoon expected to hit Bihar between June 11 & 13, says IMD||PATNA: Southwest monsoon is expected to keep its date with Bihar or even make an early onset this year. After the announcement of onset of monsoon over Kerala on June 3, India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday stated that the rain-bearing winds are likely to enter Bihar around June 11- 13. Besides, yellow code alert has been issued for thunderstorm with lightning and gusty winds at isolated places in the state Wednesday onwards and the intensity of showers is likely to intensify from Friday (June 11). The yellow code warning stipulates the authorities to be watchful for extreme weather development. “A low pressure area is likely to form over the north Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood around June 11. South-westerly (moist) winds over Arabian Sea are also likely to strengthen from June 10. The southwest monsoon is likely to advance into remaining parts of Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh by June 11; Odisha, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, East Uttar Pradesh, some parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat during June 11-13,” the IMD stated. S K Patel, an official at Patna meteorological centre, said the northern limit of the monsoon was passing through Bagdogra in West Bengal on Monday, where the normal monsoon onset date is June 10. "Monsoon onset in the region is ahead of the corresponding normal dates. Conditions are quite conducive for further advancement of southwest monsoon," he said. Monsoon is making delayed onset in the state in most years at least over the past two decades. Last year, IMD announced the onset of monsoon in Bihar on June 13, the earliest in one decade (2010-2020). Accordingly, the revised date for onset of the rain- bearing winds in Bihar has been made June 16-18 against the earlier dates of June 12 to 15. Meanwhile, weathermen said light rainfall occurred at a few places in the northeastern parts of the state in the last 24 hours. Rainfall apart, the surging mercury is giving tough time to the residents as the maximum temperature at Patna was recorded at 40.2 degrees C on Monday. The maximum temperature is hovering in the range of 37-39 degrees C at most places in the state, which is two to four notches higher than the corresponding normal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/monsoon-to-hit-bihar-around-june-11-13/articleshow/83316541.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Goa||Goa: 9 private hospitals fail to report 67 deaths, 65 of them since March||PANAJI: In a shocking revelation, the directorate of health services on Monday said nine private hospitals under-reported 67 Covid deaths in nine months— between August 5, 2020 and May 22, 2021—of which 65 deaths occurred during the past three months. The 67 deaths were added to the cumulative tally, taking Goa’s fatality count to 2,841 that includes 13 deaths reported on Monday. The state government has said that it will take strict action against the erring hospitals and will write to each hospital separately seeking an explanation as to why they “indulged in late reporting” of deaths under the Goa Public Health Act. “We really don’t know the reasons for their doing so, but we don’t want a repeat of this,” state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betokdar said. He said only two deaths were under-reported from the previous year. “The rest of the deaths reported late pertains to the past three months when more private hospitals started admitting Covid patients,” Betodkar told TOI. “It is up to the government as to what action to take against the erring hospitals. Ideally, hospitals have to report mortalities in time as Covid-19 is a notifiable disease. Late reporting for 24-48 hours is understandable, but not for months,” he said. On allegations that some private hospitals had initially under-reported deaths to show mortality count low, he said it didn’t appear that it was done purposely with mala fide intentions. “Everybody was busy treating patients and slips must have happened,” he said. The mortality bulletin is released by Goa Medical College (GMC) after collating death figures received from South Goa District Hospital and the DHS. Private hospitals submit its data to the DHS, which submits it to GMC. “The mortality bulletin contains deaths recorded during that day as well some from a previous day—comprising 24 hours period—and in a rare case, one or two deaths that may have happened a couple of days ago. This delay could be because the case warranted a post-mortem and could not be added to the count on the same day as the death was recorded,” Betodkar said. When any hospital reports a case a week or two after the actual date of death, or even a month later, that data cannot be forwarded to the GMC, asking it to include in mortality bulletin for that day, he said. When DHS noted that the total of late reported fatalities was 67, the matter was reported to the government asking what’s to be done next. “The government decided that those figures have to be included in the Covid cumulative count in the mortality bulletin and reason would be given for action taken. It is done so that the public knows that these are previous deaths, but they are included in the total. We want to report all cases, and nothing is hidden. You can’t hide either cases or deaths in the pandemic because anything which you hide, will trouble you later,” Betodkar said. But for evaluation and epidemiological purposes, the deaths will be shown on actual dates, he said. “We would like to know the break-up of 67 deaths and how many of them occurred in private hospitals that are our members. Almost all our member-hospitals started Covid treatment facilities only in the latter half of the second wave of the pandemic,” Association of Private Nursing Home (APNH) secretary Ajit Mopkar said. He said except Healthway Hospital, none of the other corporate or big hospitals are its members. Mopkar said APNH is rarely invited for any important meetings, and it is also not part of the taskforce appointed to prepare for the third wave. During the first wave, only four corporate hospitals in the state were admitting Covid patients and with the health infrastructure coming under severe strain during the second wave, other private hospitals started reserving beds for Covid patients only after the government issued an order in late April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/9-pvt-hosps-fail-to-report-67-deaths-65-of-them-since-mar/articleshow/83322975.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Patna||Patna University to get 4 research centres soon||PATNA: Research activities are likely to get a fillip in Patna University (PU) soon with the establishment of as many as four ambitious research centres on its campus. Necessary groundwork for establishing these centres has already been completed and the construction work would start as soon as the situation created due to the current pandemic eases. PU development officer Parimal Kumar Khan said Union minister of state for health and family welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey is likely to lay the foundation stone of Population Research Centre (PRC) building at Rani Ghat in July. An MoU between the Union health ministry and PU with regard to the construction and functioning of the centre is likely to be signed next week. According to the plan already approved by the ministry, an administrative block and classrooms would be constructed in the first phase at an estimated cost of Rs 8.5 crore. In the second phase, a guesthouse and a data centre would be constructed at a cost of Rs4.5 crore. The funds for construction work on a plot of about 1 acre of land would be made available to PU by the ministry, said Khan. Presently functioning from an annexe of PU statistics department, PRC will start advanced courses and training centres in Big Data Statistics and Biostatistics besides carrying out its population research activities. Another research centre of national importance to be set up in PU is the much-publicised Dolphin Research Centre. The hurdles in establishing this centre have already been removed with PU granting permission for registration of the proposed centre under the Societies’ Registration Act. A plot of 2.5 acres of land at Rani Ghat in front of Patna Law College has already been earmarked for the centre to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs32 crore. CM Nitish Kumar is expected to lay its foundation stone soon, said Khan. The third one is the Centre for Advanced Seismological Research. The building for housing the centre has almost been completed on Patna Science College grounds. Bihar State Disaster Management Authority (BSDMA)is likely to appoint the personnel required for running the centre. Necessary instruments would be purchased only after the appointment of personnel, said BSDMA sources.

The vans plying across different wards of the city in both north and south municipal corporations for the past one week under this drive have succeeded in reaching out to those who have been reluctant to get the jab or were left out. The initiative has not only been instrumental in breaking the prevalent myths associated with vaccines among the reluctant ones but has also been able to provide an opportunity to the targeted people to get the jab near their houses. Commissioner (north) R S Tomar said that each van is vaccinating about 80-100 persons per day and in some wards, they are close to achieving 100% vaccination. “We had started with two vans on last Monday and the number gradually reached to six now, considering the response to the initiative,” he said. Of these, two vans are covering Pratap Nagar area while other two are covering Udaimandir. Rest one each is covering Mahamandir and Walled City area. “This has done away with the compulsion for the elderly especially, to find the place of vaccination and availability of vaccine,” he said. He said that the major success of the drive was that they have succeeded in breaking the resistance to vaccines in many areas, like the ‘kacchi bastis’ (slums) and those inhabited by illiterate and daily wage earning population. “We have been taking area councillors with these vans and also roping in influential persons of the community, locality or religion to not only break the myths but convince the people to get the vaccine as the only way to curb the Covid infection,” he said. Areas of south municipal corporation have also received a positive response to the drive. With five vans for five zones of south, on an average, 800 vaccines are being recorded per day. Commissioner (south) Amit Yadav said that the drive has been able to reach out to the pending cases, who were either reluctant or lethargic. “Most of the resistance came from those who have tested positive and recovered. Such persons were under the myth that since they had tested positive, they did not need the vaccine anymore,” said Yadav. He said that the drive will continue for some more days until 100% target is achieved and this would be followed by a drive for the younger group. With the experience till now, they have been targeting the areas with high resistance. The areas have been largely covered but still a few are left out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/door-to-door-drive-for-45-shuns-vax-resistance-in-jodhpur/articleshow/83324437.cms||---

The certificate reads, “For service towards the nation in fight against Covid-19, this is to certify that you have participated in Covishield trial and have been vaccinated with both doses of Covishield vaccine at GMCH, Nagpur.” The beneficiary has filed an appeal on the previous complaint with PMO requesting government to issue certificate having date and all details. “I have donated blood many times. I risked my life for a good cause. I never expected such bad treatment,” he said.

---||Patna||Statewide lockdown likely to be extended by one week in Bihar||PATNA: The statewide lockdown is likely to be extended by a week with more concessions to the people. The final decision is to taken at a review meeting to be chaired by CM Nitish Kumar on Tuesday. The duration of the ongoing lockdown is to end on Tuesday. According to reliable sources, the government would not take any risk by lifting the lockdown at the moment. "The Covid-19 positivity rate has been declining and the number of deaths falling. But it is yet not over. People are still getting infected and dying due to the virus. Hence, all precautions would have to be followed until the situation becomes almost normal," sources said. The sources, however, asserted that people would get further relaxations with the reopening of some more windows keeping in view the people’s inconveniences. Health experts also favour the idea of extending the lockdown for some time more in larger interest of the masses. IMA state’s acting president Dr Ajay Kumar said the lockdown must continue further in the larger interest of the state. Some office and business activities may be resumed for limited hours, but public gatherings should be completely avoided. In fact, the lockdown is an extended form of social distancing and it immensely helps in reducing the rate of infections. Social rituals and public meetings besides mass gathering at sabzi mandis and shopping malls would reverse the declining graph of infections and deaths immediately. Dr Kumar pointed out that if people in a particular area of the country are suffering from the disease and there is no restriction on movement of people from other places, the pandemic would never end. Hence, the lockdown must be enforced effectively and the people should follow the Covid protocol sincerely, he added. Aryabhatta Knowledge University’s dean of health and medicine, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, said the lockdown should be relaxed in phases. "People should be granted some more concessions and the office and shopping hours may be extended by a few hours. Educational institutions must not reopen at the moment and all places of mass gatherings should remain shut. However, medical colleges may be allowed to reopen for academics with full protective measures," he added. Principal of Government Ayurvedic College, Patna, Dr Dineshwar Prasad, said the declining trend of infections does not indicate the end of the virus. Its transmission rate has slowed down only due to the strict adherence of Covid protocols due to the lockdown. The people would again become carefree and ignore the protective measures once the lockdown is lifted, he said. Dr Prasad further said the third wave is likely to hit the state in near future and, hence, the government should not take any risk by unlocking its control in utter haste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lockdown-likely-to-be-extended-by-one-week/articleshow/83317005.cms||B K Mishra

Dr Sankhvar said that KMC had received complaints that some vendors in the name of mineral water were selling water in pouches and cans taken from submersible pumps or from direct supply of the jalkal department. “Some vendors are selling water taken from contaminated sources which is consumed by people unknowingly”, he said. “KMC is going to identify the illegal plants and take action against them. Teams will be formed at the zonal level to identify the illegal plants and vendors. Once they are identified, KMC will take action against them”, the health officer further said.  As per rules, the licensed plants too are required to get the water sample of their pants tested every six months. They can get the samples of the water source tested either at the KMC lab or at any other government lab, he added. The health officer has appealed to the people to consume only tested water to protect them from water borne diseases. “Water borne diseases are quite common during the rainy season when the underground gets polluted. The people, therefore, should avoid consuming water sold by pettu vendors and by illegal plants”, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kmc-to-take-action-against-illegal-plants-vendors-selling-contaminated-water/articleshow/83319003.cms||---

In Sriganganagar district, diesel prices rose to Rs 99.24, while petrol went up to Rs 106.39 a litre. In Jaipur, petrol because costlier by 29 paisa to cost Rs 101.88, while diesel also crossed Rs 95 mark. Sunit Bagai, president of Rajasthan Petroleum Dealers’ Association, said the increase in diesel prices would hit the farming community. “Input cost will rise significantly as farmers have to pay extra money to buy diesel for their tractors and transporting agriculture produce and vegetables to mandis, mills and markets,” said Bagai. Bagai said diesel is a poor man’s fuel and the rise in the prices will reduce their incomes and increase hardship. Higher vegetable prices are already reflecting the impact. Like petrol, diesel in Rajasthan attracts highest VAT in the country at 26% even after reducing the tax burden by 2% in February this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-petrol-diesel-cruising-towards-rs-100/litre-mark/articleshow/83324485.cms||---

Trying to tackle the menace and also bust the myths regarding the jabs, the district administration roped in psychologists of Saurashtra University (SU) to convince villagers to get their vaccines. However, on Sunday the team was left awestruck by the weird replies and excuses the villagers defended themselves with. Among the many rumours that buzz around village corridors, the one about leaving women infertile is the most common. While visiting the villages of Upleta taluka like Gadha, Harfodi, Hariyasan, Moti Paneli and Kolki, many women from these villages told the team of psychologists that taking the vaccine will offend their gods and they will be cursed with infertility and would be left barren! Misinformation spread across villagers in Rajkot districtAssistant professor of psychology department SU Dhara Doshi said, “There were a few villages where we were told specifically not to enter into these village with the purpose of vaccination.

While some resistance to inoculating themselves was expressed by these persons initially, they finally agreed after counselling by officials of the health and social justice departments. The four homes are Sarthak Manav Kushthashram, Navjeevan Kushthashram, Gareebdas Kushthashram and Gandhi Kushthashram. “They (leprosy-affected persons) were initially reluctant to get themselves vaccinated. They somehow came to know about an incident through WhatsApp messages in Madhubani (Bihar), where a leprosy-affected person died after a vaccination drive. This made them skeptical about the vaccine and they were not ready to get vaccinated. Finally, they agreed after we counselled them and explained to them about the efficacy of the vaccines. Now, we will be vaccinating 100 more leprosy-affected persons who are below 45 years,” said Amitabh Kaushik, advisor (disability), Rajasthan government. The state’s social justice department and the district administration had on Sunday organised a special vaccination camp to inoculate 92 beggars at a home in Mansarovar, Jaipur. The department also vaccinated 90 people at a home for intellectual disability and an old-age home at Jamdoli on Saturday. Earlier, after state’s human rights commission took cognizance of the matter, the state’s health department had issued an order to vaccinate persons with disabilities (PwDs) above 18 years at the centres run by NGOs/private organisations, on registration of 100 or more disabled persons, by organising special vaccination camps. It also stated that the rest - an NGO/private organization where less than 100 PwDs are registered - will be vaccinated at the nearest Covid vaccination centres by giving them special priority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-initial-reluctance-leprosy-affected-persons-agree-to-get-vaccinated/articleshow/83324484.cms||---

Rajnikant Bondre, president of Association of Coaching Institutes, said, “Schools and colleges are run by societies/trusts which get multiple benefits in taxation, utility bills and other government schemes. Coaching institutes are run as private enterprises which pay taxes at commercial rate and are ineligible for any government benefit (education related).” He added there is no logic to keep coaching institutes closed. “Students can go to movie theatres, restaurants, gyms, spas, salons, water parks and even attend weddings. But authorities seem to be convinced that the chances of getting infected are more at a coaching institute,” said Bondre. At the national level it’s the Coaching Federation of India (CFI) which wields the maximum influence. Krishna Chaitanya Kasula, general secretary of CFI, says monitoring at their institutes is always at the highest level. Kasula said, “First, we need to understand that going to a coaching institute is not mandatory, unlike attending Std X or XII. It’s a choice which a parent makes for their child. This in effect makes the parent our ‘supervising authority’. If at anytime parents feel that their child is not safe here, or that the quality of education is not good, they will pull out and go somewhere else. So, we are always at the mercy of the parents and hence highest safety protocols are always in place.” “Our parents cough up 18% GST while paying fees. We pay commercial rate for utilities and on top of that also pay corporate tax for our firm. We will ask the government to consider our case because coaching institutes can operate very well with limited seating capacity,” said Bondre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coaching-insts-demand-proper-norms-to-unlock/articleshow/83322454.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: In losses, school bus, van drivers to protest today||NAGPUR: With drivers of school buses and vans ferrying students facing the brunt of Covid-induced lockdown, members of Shalya Vidyarthi Vahatuk Vyavasay Bachav Sangharsh Samiti will stage a ‘rasta roko’ protest on Tuesday to draw attention of both the central and state governments. For more than a year, the drivers of these vehicles are barely managing to sustain, and many are on the verge of mortgaging or selling their vehicles with reportedly no help from the state government. Chandrakant Jangle, coordinator of the association, said that not only elected representatives but the administration, too, had ignored the plight of bus and van drivers. “Hence, the association decided to launch rasta roko of MP and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, district guardian minister Nitin Raut and district collector Ravindra Thakare from June 8,” he added. Another association member Ajay Chaure pointed out that the state government had considered many lockdown-affected people and announced relief packages, but nothing for them. The association demanded that the state announce a relief package of Rs10,000 for each driver’s family. They also appealed to the administration to direct financial institutions to give them relaxations in paying EMIs of their vehicles during the lockdown. Financial institutions should not charge EMIs until the government allows educational institutions to start physical classes, they stated. As the vans and buses were stranded for the last one year, the association has also demanded that the government enhance the life span of their vehicles by five years from the existing 15 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-losses-school-bus-van-drivers-to-protest-today/articleshow/83322445.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Goa||Goa: Lockdown snatched their jobs, turned them ‘ agriculture’entrepreneurs||MARGAO: Having realised the importance of sustainable living during Lockdown 1.0, two young entrepreneurs from Salcete have taken to agriculture, and scripted success stories within a short time. Significantly, both these agripreneurs were remotely connected with agriculture before the lockdown. Nitin Naik from Seraulim, who was working in Kuwait for the preceding 10 years, returned to Goa in February 2020 on his annual vacation. The extended nation-wide lockdown that followed cost him his job. Loss of livelihood forced him to explore other options and ultimately, he decided to make his living from the agricultural land he had inherited that was lying barren for the last 30 years. Naik is thankful to the agriculture department for providing him with the right guidance and technical inputs that has turned him into a successful first-generation organic farmer. “There were many hurdles, but with the help and support of my family and the zonal agriculture office, Margao, I took up organic farming. The first challenge I faced was choosing the right type of farming. I opted for cultivation of vegetables and pulses. The next challenge was to grow the veggies organically. With no usage of chemical fertilisers, the yield gets comparatively less, which I learnt from hands-on experience, but I persevered and succeeded,” Naik told TOI. Naik grows lady’s fingers, brinjals, watermelons, green chillies, moong, cow peas, etc. Though he is yet to break even, he says the pleasure he derives from “sustainable farming” is immense. “It’s a great feeling to know that my efforts go into providing a healthy product to the society.” Orlim resident Keith Gracias took to organic farming after he suddenly found himself jobless after the multinational firm he was employed with closed down the branch in mid-2020. “I had a piece of ancestral agricultural land, and I started with paddy farming in July 2020, but soon decided to try out other agro avenues. I happened to read about Cassava, a tuber, did some research and spoke to an exporter who was into exporting this product to the Netherlands,” Gracias said. In October 2020, Gracias, with technical guidance from Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), began Cassava cultivation. The 6,000 plants of Cassava he cultivated yielded a harvest of 2-3 tonnes, which was processed for export. The next harvest will be ready by June-end, he said. Gracias has also grown nutmeg and areca plants in his farm, and plans to go in for integrated farming, a piggery being his next project. “I may not have started earning as much as I would in my previous job, but it definitely is a great feeling to be your own boss. Long-term profitability is guaranteed here,” he said, his voice brimming with optimism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lockdown-snatched-their-jobs-turned-them-agripreneurs/articleshow/83323475.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

Bohra was dismissed from service after complaints of seeking sexual favours from a rape survivor came to the fore. The state government in March this year had given him compulsory retirement from service. RPS Kailash Bohra was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in a compromising position with the complainant woman in his government office located in DCP East's office premises in Jaipur. On March 15, the ACB court sent Bohra to judicial custody. Following the ACB court rejecting his bail, he filed a petition in the high court. AAG Vibhuti Bhushan Sharma, opposing the bail to Bohra, said the dismissed RPS officer had other criminal complaint pending against him. He said there were proofs from bank statements that the officer had received money from the complainant as well apart from seeking sexual favours, which is a serious offence.

A health department official said, “The treatment protocol for children has been sent to all principals and controllers of medical colleges, superintendents of hospitals, chief medical health officers and principal medical officer of district hospitals.” In the order, it has been mentioned that doctors should ensure that treatment of Covid positive children according to the protocol. Tablet HCQ is part of Covid treatment protocol for adults but not advised for children. “The paediatric population is different from adults and they require different medicines, which is why you cannot translate what you are given to adults tochildren,” said Dr Ashok Gupta, professor (paediatrics) and former superintendent, JK Lon Hospital. The protocol for children stated, “There is no role of HCQ, favipiravir, ivermectin, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, umifenovir, immunomodulators including tocilizumab, interferon B 1 a, convalescent plasma infusion or dexamethasone in children with mild symptoms.” In severe cases, the protocol says there is no role of HCQ, favipiravir, Ivermectin, lopinavir/ritonavir, umifenovir. Among adults, doctors prescribe medicines such as HCQ, favipiravir and ivermectin among mild patients. But, in children, these drugs have no role. For treatment of children with mild symptoms, the protocol says for fever, children should be given paracetamol 10-15 mg/kg/dose, which may repeat every 4-6 hours. For cough, throat soothing agents like warm saline gargles should be given. In older children and adolescents, fluids and feeds to ensure oral fluids to be given maintain hydration and nutritious diet should be given and no antibiotics are indicated in mild cases. Remdesivir, which is an anti-viral drug widely used for Covid treatment among adults, is not to be given to children below 19 years of age. “An emergency use authorisation for children has been granted. Till more data is available, it should be used in restricted manner in children with severe illness within three days of onset of symptoms and after ascertaining that child’s renal and liver functions are normal,” the protocol says. NOT A CHILD’S PLAY Covid treatment protocol divides children into three categories and suggest different treatment protocols Mild illness: Sore throat, rhinorrhea, cough.

---||Delhi||Supreme Court orders demolition of 10,000 houses in Aravali forest land||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday ordered Faridabad Municipal Corporation to clear eco-sensitive Aravali forest land of encroachments within six weeks by demolish around 10,000 houses unauthorisedly built in Lakkarpur-Khori village and put the onus of compliance on Haryana forest secretary and civic body commissioner. Appearing for a village resident facing imminent demolition, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves pleaded for mercy and said most inhabitants of the village could be given house at alternative sites if the Haryana government rehabilitation policy cut-off was advanced from the year 2003 to 2015. "Most of them have been living there since the 1980s when the mining was carried on in Aravali. But, they don't have documents to prove it. They have proof of residence since 2010," he said. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said it is surprising that the authorities have not carried out the demolition of unauthorised houses on forest land despite repeated orders from the SC had passed orders in February last year and in April this year. The civic body through senior advocate Arun Bharadwaj said that the villagers were resorting to stone pelting when the corporation officials attempted a demolition drive. When Gonsalves said that the residents are willing to vacate the houses on forest land if they were provided alternative accommodation by the government under a rehabilitation plan, the bench said, "Who is arguing this, land grabbers? It is forest land. So, there can be no compromise in restoring and maintaining its character. You vacate, or we direct eviction." When Gonsalves pressed further for mercy, the bench told the senior advocate, "You often come to the court with cases for protection of forest land and protection of environment. Now you say that on humanitarian ground allow destruction of forest. You cannot wear two hats alternatively as and when it suits you. Next time you come with a petition for protection of environment, we will show you this argument of yours in the present case." The SC had stopped mining activities by several orders since 2001. But, the area in Lakkarpur-Khori saw thousands of families settle down and build houses right under the nose of police and civic authority officials till the SC intervened and sought removal of encroachments from Aravali forest land, termed eco-fragile by most environmentalists. The bench of Justices Khanwilkar and Maheshwari reiterated its directions of February 19, 2020 and April 5, 2021 and directed the municipal corporation and state government to remove all encroachments from the forest land within six weeks. It asked the municipal commissioner and the forest secretary of the state to file affidavits of compliance and said their reports about removal of unauthorised houses on forest land would be verified by an independent team. It told counsel for Haryana government, Ruchi Kohli, that the state must take appropriate steps to implement SC orders failing which the state chief secretary would be made answerable, if necessary. It said Faridabad SP will be personally responsible for providing adequate forces to facilitate corporation officials carry out the demolition drive. The SC posted the matter for further hearing on July 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-orders-razing-of-10k-houses-on-aravali-land/articleshow/83322473.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Goa||Goa: Closed government school buildings turn anganwadis and police stations||PANAJI: Over the past decade or so, hundreds of government primary schools have either shut down for want of students, or are grappling with enrolment in single digits. This has left the directorate of education (DoE) with ample vacant space, with questions over the maintenance of these premises. Now, the DoE has allotted over 30 of such school buildings or vacant rooms in low-enrolment schools to the directorate of women and child development to run anganwadis. The only condition set by the DoE is that the premises should be made available during poll time, wherever the school building is traditionally used as a polling booth. Similarly, the government primary school building at Socorro has been allotted to the Goa Urban Development Agency to house the ‘urban homeless’. Some years ago, a government report had shown that DoE had allotted the premises of shut government primary schools to private parties to operate gymnasiums, sports clubs, NGOs, etc, for non-educational activities. The buildings were also allotted for nominal or no fees at all. This move had come under criticism, and the government had gone slow since. However, DoE was left to deal with the issue of maintenance of such premises when not in use. Now, the directorate has allotted 47 such vacant school buildings to either run angawadis or other welfare activities. While no rent is being charged to the directorate of women and child welfare to operate anganwadis, a nominal rent of Rs 2 per sqm is being charged to two educational trusts to run their private primary schools from the government premises. In many places, Bal Bhavan activities are now being carried out from the schools. In Velguem, Bicholim, a health centre of the directorate of health services is operating, while at Ghongre-Maina, an incubation centre is being run by the handicrafts corporation. At Harijanwada in Sattari, an open library of the directorate of art and culture functions from the school building. The biodiversity management committee for Curtorim has set up a herbal garden in the school premises. In the government primary school building at Manora, Salcete, a police station has been established at the vacant premises, as per DoE’s records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/closed-govt-school-bldgs-turn-anganwadis-and-police-stations/articleshow/83323818.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Without naming them, the CM also hit out at a few organisations accusing them of engaging in irresponsible activities which dented government efforts in controlling the pandemic. “They should also introspect about their actions,” he said, adding that it was the duty of every individual to lend a helping hand to the government in the time of crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-when-modiji-was-battling-against-covid-oppn-was-waging-war-against-him/articleshow/83324563.cms||Pankaj Shah

Villagers are forced to feed people on a family member’s death called ‘mrityu bhoj’. The village panchayat punishes them if they refuse to do so, what’s more, there is always the fear of being ostracised. Most do not have the courage to stand up to this evil. However, A BSF officer set an example by not giving in to this ritual on his mother’s death. He, instead, persuaded the village elders of Jalela under Sheo police station and gave Rs 2 lakh to a school for promoting education.BSF officer Kamal Singh Rathore’s mother Harkanwar Singh Rathore died of Covid-19 at the Barmer government hospital recently.

This was the third sex racket busted by the city police in a week, while many more such rackets were busted in a month. The DCP Kashi Amit Kumar termed the frequent police action against the sex rackets as a result of improved network of intelligence collection by increasing communication between police and public. According to inspector Bhelupur Amit Mishra, acting on a tip-off, his team raided a flat in Kabir Nagar area on Sunday night and caught some women and men caught in objectionable condition. Police arrested five women including the flat owner and their customers, he said adding that, they all were booked under sections of immoral trafficking act and sent to jail on Monday During initial investigation of police it surfaced that the elderly flat owner had been operating the sex racket with the help of women from different localities of the city, neighbouring districts and also other states. The arrested men belonged to Varanasi and Chandauli. Earlier, the Chetganj police had raided Kailgadh Colony and Pishachmochan areas finding sex rackets operating there on May 31 and June 5 while more such rackets operating in Jaitpura were also busted. DCP Kashi claimed that improved communication between people and police has now started yielding positive results as people have started alerting the police against illegal activities taking place anywhere in the city and men in khaki are also acting promptly on such information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cops-bust-third-sex-racket-in-city-in-a-week/articleshow/83319143.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC to decide if LSD weight must include paper’s too||MUMBAI: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has moved the Bombay high court to take a decision on whether the weight of paper should be included while weighing Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), a hallucinogenic drug, for prosecution under the Narcotic Drugs And Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The NCB moved HC against a special trial court order that directed it on April 30 to send a sample of purported LSD drug seized from accused Anuj Keshwani, 30, to Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in Gandhinagar and verify if the weight mentioned excluded the weight of the paper it was on. On Monday, Bombay HC single judge bench of Justice A S Gadkari asked both sides to provide records of earlier judgments taken in similar cases. Advocate Taraq Sayed, representing Keshwani, said that re-weighing of the sample on directions of the Special NDPS court in Mumbai would cause no prejudice to the investigation by the NCB. Keshwani had questioned the silence of the FSL report about ‘weight of paper’ in April and sought a fresh forensic report, which the trial court directed. The NCB had searched Keshwani’s house in Mumbai on September 6, 2020, and seized 585 gms of charas, 270 gms of Marijuana (ganja) and 0.62gms (31 blot papers) of LSD (commercial quantity under NDPS Act of 0.1 is large quantity). The NCB booked and chargesheeted him, along with several others, including late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s girl friend Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik in a case registered in August 2020 by the agency. Offences and punishment under NDPS depend on weight of drugs and are categorised on the basis of small, intermediate and large (commercial quantities). The NCB, represented by advocate Shriram Shirsat, is relying on a Supreme Court ruling to argue its case that paper weight has to be factored in. The SC had in the case of Hira Singh analysed the NDPS Act, and held that intention of the legislature could not have been to consider only the weight of the ‘drug’ to determine whether it was ‘small’ or ‘commercial’ quantity. Keshwani had relied on a Bombay HC judgment which had held otherwise. The NCB’s appeal is whether the trial court judge was justified in passing its order. The matter will be heard on June 9 next.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-to-decide-if-lsd-weight-must-include-papers-too/articleshow/83322640.cms||Swati Deshpande

In this regard, the VDA is going to float a tender process in the next 10 days for selecting a company, which will assess 20 new development projects in 10 sectors and prepare their pre-feasibility report. After the company’s proposals are found feasible, further process for their launch and execution will be initiated. Talking to TOI on Tuesday, divisional commissioner and chairman of VDA board Deepak Agrawal said, “In Ayodhya, getting pre-feasibility report of any proposal for development project being planned for the city has been made mandatory. During last week’s meeting of the VDA board, it was decided to adopt the same Ayodhya model for approving any new development project in Varanasi.” Perhaps, VDA failure in actualising projects of Transport Nagar, comprehensive mobility plan, which included proposals of Metro rail and ropeways, in the past two decades despite spending crores of rupees on land acquisition and preparation of detailed project reports compelled the officials to adopt the Ayodhya model. VDA vice-chairperson Isha Duhan said, “The basic objective behind this decision is to ensure that only those plans are finalised in future which are feasible and could be executed practically. The company which would be engaged through a tender process for preparing a pre-feasibility report in the next 10 days will identify 20 new projects for 10 sectors, including civil infrastructure, transport infrastructure, tourism, disaster management, security, greenfield township, sewage, solid waste management, water supply and groundwater harvesting.” “While selecting new projects, the company will choose only those projects which have neither been proposed nor executed in the city in the past,” she said adding, “the company will select development projects in these sectors and submit a pre-feasibility report after conducting through study. Only after the VDA board approves the pre-feasibility report, further action like preparing their DPRs and launching would be done.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/vda-to-replicate-ayodhya-model-of-devpt-in-kashi/articleshow/83319050.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

A prohibitory order against consumption of all forms of tobacco products and also spitting after consuming tobacco on the campus was issued by the TMBU vice-chancellor Prof Neelima Gupta on Monday. “We have issued orders concerning a ban on tobacco and tobacco products on university premises including colleges, postgraduate departments and other institutions. Teaching or non-teaching personnel as well as students consuming paan (betel), paan masala, gutka and cigarette will not be allowed on the premises,” the VC said. She added: “A penalty of Rs100 with a note of warning on the first defiance of orders will be made by the university; subsequently suitable legal action will be taken. We have also asked the university officials to inform the shop and kiosk owners in the vicinity of colleges and educational institutions to stop selling tobacco and tobacco products.” The VC also said that an official complaint will be lodged with the district administration and legal action as per the provisions of Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act 2003, will be initiated against the shops or kiosks selling tobacco or tobacco products within 200 metres vicinity of the educational institution. “A circular has been issued to college principals, head of postgraduate departments and other university offices on Monday,” Prof Gupta said. The VC said that the objective to undertake such actions are for the benefit of teaching and non-teaching staff and their family members and the student community. "Consumption of tobacco and tobacco products is a threat to one’s own health as well as public health. Similarly, spitting after using tobacco and tobacco products may lead to diseases like Covid-19 and other deadly communicable diseases,” Prof Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tmbu-to-become-tobacco-free-campus/articleshow/83318094.cms||Kumar Rajesh

---||Mumbai||HC junks Maha Ind MP’s caste cert as ‘fraud’, fines her Rs 2L||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Tuesday cancelled and confiscated the caste certificate of Navneet Rana, independent MP from Amravati, ruling that it was “fraudulently obtained”. It also imposed a cost of Rs 2 lakh on her. It must be paid to the Maharashtra Legal Services Authority within 2 weeks, reports Swati Deshpande. Rana (36) was elected in the May 2019 LS elections from a reserved seat. A former model and actress, she won as an independent supported by the Congress-NCP and RPI against Shiv Sena leader Anandrao Adsul. The ruling came on a batch of three petitions, two by her opponents in 2018 and 2019, and one filed by Rana in 2020. Alleging “political kichdi’ for the row over her SC certificate, Rana said she will move the top court. Setting aside Rana’s caste certificate and a 2017 order validating her certificate that she belonged to the “‘Mochi’ Scheduled Caste”, the HC directed her to surrender the caste certificate within six weeks. Dismissing her plea, the court observed that she had “committed a fraud on the Constitution”. The HC bench of Justices R D Dhanuka and V G Bisht said, “In our view, the caste claim made by (her) for obtaining a caste certificate as Scheduled Caste itself was fraudulent and was made with the intention to obtain various benefits available to a candidate from such Scheduled Caste category knowing well that she does not belong to that caste… (and) made intentionally to make a fraudulent claim to enable (her) to contest an election for member of Parliament on the seat reserved for an SC candidate.” The HC, in its 108-page judgment, said, “Fraudulent acts are not encouraged by the courts. The Constitution does not postulate conferment of any special benefit on those who do not belong to the category of SC/ST people for whom the provision was made.” The scrutiny committee’s order in accepting her claim on the basis of two “fabricated” documents—a rent agreement of 1932 of her great-grandfather and a 2014 college certificate—is “totally perverse”, the HC held. “In our view, there were two sets of documents produced which were contradictory,” it said. She had claimed to be ‘Sikh Chamar’ as well as ‘Ravidasiya Mochi’, said the HC, adding, “In our view, the term ‘Chamar’ and ‘Mochi’ are not synonymous and are different identity.” “Her original birth certificate did not mention the caste Mochi,” said the HC, and the committee had accepted a 2014 certificate recording her caste as ‘Sikh Chamar,’ issued by a college, as admissible evidence. Rana “failed to discharge her burden by producing authentic and clear evidence” under the Caste Certificate Act, the court held. It added that though she claims to have a big family, she “failed to produce any caste validity certificate in favour of any member of her family or relative certifying their caste as Mochi since 1950 in support of her claim”. “Abdicating its responsibility and duty, the scrutiny committee chose to remain discreet,” the HC said, adding that it was “aghast at the eerie silence” of the committee at certain questions and that such committees have to be independent. The bench also said the scrutiny committee’s functioning was “abysmal,” lacking in “judicious approach”, and it seemed to be “swayed by extenuating circumstances”. The committee has the “trappings of judicial function and therefore requires a high degree of sensible approach with all circumspection,” the HC said, cautioning the committee to be careful in its “solemn duty”. The two petitions filed by Rana’s political opponents, Adsul and Raju Mankar, challenged the November 2017 order of a Mumbai suburban district caste certificate scrutiny committee validating Rana’s caste claim as a ‘Mochi’ and an SC. Through their counsel C M Korde and Pramod Patil, they also sought orders to quash her caste certificate issued by a Mumbai deputy collector on August 30, 2013. Rana, through her counsel Prasad Dhakephalkar, sought a declaration that her documents dating back to 1894-1895, 1920 and her school leaving certificate from Kartika high school in Kurla establish her as being an SC member as a ‘Mochi’. Her petition also challenged a part of the 2017 finding of the district caste scrutiny committee in Mumbai which negated these ‘oldest’ documents. The HC judgment said though the caste Chamar is included, admittedly “Sikh Chamar is not included in entry 11” of the Schedule II of the Constitution of India (Scheduled Caste). It said, “Under Section 7 of the Caste Certificate Act, it is mandatory duty of the Caste Scrutiny Committee to cancel and confiscate caste certificate suo motu or otherwise by calling for the record and after enquiry to the correctness of such certificate, if it is of the opinion that the certificate was obtained fraudulently by a person not belonging to any of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, De-notified Tribes (Vimukta Jatis), Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classes or Special Backward Category.” The committee has to hear the person who holds the certificate. In this case, the HC said, the committee failed in its duty to cancel her caste certificate though complaints against Rana had “demonstrated” she had been issued a caste certificate fraudulently. The HC also observed that “all the consequences in law provided upon cancellation of such fraudulently obtained caste certificate and caste validity certificate shall follow”. There is an election petition against Rana’s 2019 victory pending before the HC’s Nagpur bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-junks-maha-ind-mps-caste-cert-as-fraud-fines-her-rs-2l/articleshow/83353265.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Udaipur||Rajasthan: Stepmom drowns 2 children in Dungarpur village, arrested||UDAIPUR: In a gruesome incident, a step-mother killed two children by submerging them in a tub and convinced the family that they were bitten by a poisonous reptile before burying their bodies. Three days later, the guilt-ridden woman confessed before the family. Upon complaint by the victims’ grandfather, police took the woman in custody and exhumed the bodies that have been sent for autopsy to Dungarpur civil hospital. “The incident happened on June 3, however, we got the report on Monday by the kids’ grandfather Chhagan who said his daughter-in-law killed his grandchildren by drowning them. The bodies were exhumed in the presence of the SDM and sent for autopsy. The FSL team has also been called to collect samples, an investigation is under way. The accused has been detained for interrogation,” DySP Rameshwar Lal said. The incident took place in Sharam village under Ramsagda police station of Dungarpur. Badri Fera’s first wife had left him to live with another man under the tribe’s Nata system. Badri also brought another woman Durga under the tribal custom two years ago. Badri had a 5-year-old daughter Nisha and 3-year-old son Vishal from his first wife. The children were left to Durga’s care after Badri went to Gujarat to work. On June 3, the stepmom drowned the kids in a plastic tub inside the bathroom. Later she told Badri’s father who lived nearby, that the children were bitten by some poisonous reptile and had a natural death. The family members believed her and buried the kids. Two days later, on June 5, Durga left the home and returned next day. Badri’s father was suspicious of Durga's behaviour and when he pressurised her, the woman told them the truth behind the kids death. She said she did not wanted to raise the children and hence killed them. Meanwhile, family sources said that Durga had been married to Badri for two years and was concerned that when she would have her own kids, they would not get much importance because of the victims. Limited land assets, too, is believed as another reason behind the brutal murders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/stepmom-drowns-2-childrenin-dungarpur-village-arrested/articleshow/83324556.cms||---

The move appears to be a snub for BJP as the ruling Congress had not only suspended its elected mayor but has now given officiating charge to Dhabhai, a former mayor who claims to be a loyalist of BJP ex-chief minister Vasundhara Raje. The BJP party had secured a comfortable victory in municipal corporation polls in November 2020. On Sunday, the directorate of local bodies (DLB) had suspended Somya Gurjar and three BJP councillors for allegedly misbehaving with the JMC commissioner on Friday. It has now issued an order and appointed Dhabhai to perform the duties of the mayor. The JMC post is reserved for a woman in the other backward class (OBC) category. In the municipal elections, Dhabhai was among the front-runners for the mayor’s post as she was the first woman mayor of Jaipur city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-throws-a-surprise-appoints-raje-loyalist-as-officiating-mayor/articleshow/83324614.cms||Ajay Singh

---||Mumbai||Tug Varaprada found in sea between Dadar & Worli||MUMBAI: Even as tug Varaprada was located in the sea between Dadar and Worli on Monday, Director-General of Shipping has instructed vessel company Durmast, which owned the ill-fated barge Papaa (P-305), to create a “navigational marking” around the mishap location which is 200 metres away from Heera Oil Field platform and around 70km off Mumbai. The officials have also instructed the vessel company to appoint a “salvor” to clear the path for the safe passage of other vessels from the spot where P-305 had sunk. The mishap occured allegedly because barge P-305 captain Rakesh Ballav (52) did not follow standard operating procedures despite repeated warnings by the Indian Coast Guard ahead of cyclone Tauktae. Ballav and others were booked under IPC after 75 personnel onboard P-305 drowned. Incidentally, Tugboat Varaprada that sank around 20 km off Palghar on May 17, was located in the sea between Dadar and Worli. “It was located 21 nautical miles south from Pawan helicopter base,” said the officer. The city police had used an ONGC helicopter to make aerial panchnama of the spots where P305 and Varaprada sank. A source from the DG Shipping told TOI, “The instruction for salvaging barge P-305 was given to owners immediately after the mishap because the location where the wreck is lying at present is unsafe for other vessels sailing through that path. ” Meanwhile, Ballav’s family has claimed his body after a DNA test at JJ Hospital. “Ballav’s family members are in Mumbai. They have claimed the body based on the DNA report,” said Yellow Gate police senior inspector Suhas Hemade. A family member told TOI that they will perform Ballav’s last rites in Mumbai. The Search and Rescue Operation by the Indian Coast Guard ships is still on. Till now, 64 bodies have been handed over to families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-varaprada-located-in-sea-between-dadar-worli/articleshow/83324696.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath makes light of talks about changes in government, says BJP will win 2/3 seats||LUCKNOW: Making light of the speculation about changes in his government in view of the recent visits of the senior BJP and RSS leaders to Lucknow, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said BJP would win with two-thirds majority in the 2022 assembly elections. Talking about the issue for the first time during an exclusive interview with TOI, the CM said that a few people are interpreting these visits and meetings in a different way and giving new political spin, which are unfounded. “Ismein (BJP meetings) mein kuch naya nahi hai. Usko naya arth diya ja raha hai. Kuch khabarchi is tarah ki khabarein chalate hain aur aap logon ko bhi usmein namak mirch masala laga kar likhne mein maza aata hai. (There is nothing new in these meetings. Some newshounds twists it and you (media) like to spice it up),” he said. “BJP is a cadre-based party which does not adhere to nepotism. The party keeps its cadre active. For this, senior leaders meet every two months and hold meetings with state units. Our state in charge (Radha Mohan Singh) comes to UP twice a month. Party president JP Nadda himself visited Lucknow four months ago,” he said. “As a ruling party, we are into various services to provide relief to people. This is as per the direction by PM Modi and Party president JP Nadda. Be it the first wave or the second wave, the BJP and the Sangh karyakartas have been giving their services. Other political parties were nowhere in sight,” the CM added. When asked about the next assembly elections, which are likely to be held under the shadow of Covid, he said: “We are ready to face any situation. We won in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 2017 UP assembly elections and recently 2019 elections. We are not only waging a battle against Corona but also against ‘Rajnaitik Sankraman’ (political infections). We will continue to battle it out under the leadership of PM Modi. BJP will win with 2/3rd majority in 2022. Take a note. We will meet again later this year and after the elections.” Gearing up for the state polls, Yogi came across confident and battle-ready and he dismissed the viability of SP’s challenge and dubbed Cong as inconsequential. Talking about Congress’s UP in charge Priyanka Gandhi’s writing letters to him to drag his attention to various issues, he said: “They are just doing formalities to be in the limelight. Others (SP netas) are just tweeting to be in the media. Where were these people during the first and the second wave? They have never been into service. It is not in their genes.” Yogi also dispelled speculations about his ‘national ambitions’. “I had no ambitions when I was an MP. I have no ambition even today.” He categorically termed himself a `common soldier’ who is working as per BJP’s vision and campaign of PM Narendra Modi’s to ensure development, security and prosperity. “There cannot be a bigger reason to be happy after considering achievements of the state government in the last four years,” he said, underscoring how the state managed to register an economic growth and robust infrastructure development, despite the pandemic. “It is before everyone to see. UP is no more a state which witnessed riots every week in the past. There is no room for giving priority to caste, community and language. The state will be the number one state in terms of per capita income,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-makes-light-of-talks-about-changes-in-govt-says-bjp-will-win-2/3-seats/articleshow/83324620.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Drunk woman left on road after party raped by 2 near Bhankrota||JAIPUR: A 23-year-old girl was gang-raped allegedly by two people after she was left on the road after a fight with a friend near Bhankrota police station area in the city during early hours on Monday. Police have lodged a case of rape and assault and detained a few in this connection. The crime has exposed the claims made by the police of keeping vigil during lockdown. According to the police, two friends in a car came to restaurant bar in C-Scheme late on Sunday evening. They were joined by the rape survivor and her male companion, Deepu, who came in a scooter. “One of the boys who knew the guard of the restaurant paid him some money and arranged for some drinks. All the four, including the girl, consumed alcohol. Later, the girl's friend Deepu and one of the boys decided to go back home in the scooter, while Rakshit, the owner of the car, agreed to drop the girl home,” said deputy commissioner of police (west) Pradeep Mohan Sharma. The girl then asked Rakshit to take her on a long drive. The girl was changing her statements: Police “They were both in an inebriated condition and allegedly had a verbal fight when they reached the 200-feet bypass. Rakshit dropped her near the Kamla Nehru Nagar flyover and left the place. While she was walking in a lane near Bhankrota, two men overpowered her and raped her. The girl also said that she was drunk and was unable to recall many things,” Sharma said. Police said that the girl was changing her statements every now and then. “So far, it is clear that none of the boys who were with the girl are responsible for the rape. While she was walking in a lane near Bhankrota, two others picked her and raped her. We have detained a few persons, including the three who were with the girl on Sunday evening, and are questioning them. Hopefully, the accused will be arrested,” said additional commissioner of police Ajay Pal Lamba. After the crime, the girl was left near the 200-feet bypass by the assailants and she went to the police station. “She was not in a condition to speak. With the help of women police officers her statements were recorded,” Lamba said. The case has exposed hollow claims made by the police of strict patrolling as four people could have a party at a prominent place and then roam free in the city during lockdown.

In an email to the clubs late on Monday, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) said the ban is a result of the decision taken by Fifa’s Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) and will be effective from the start of the next registration period, which starts on Wednesday. A ban from registering new players internationally has already been implemented by Fifa, while it asked AIFF to ensure “a ban from registering new players at national level.” While Kerala Blasters have been punished following a complaint from Slovenian forward Matej Poplatnik, SC East Bengal have been pulled up for their failure to clear the dues of Costa Rican World Cupper Johnny Acosta. According to the order, the bans will be lifted immediately and prior to its complete serving, once the due amount is paid. According to documents seen by TOI, the Dispute Resolution Chamber passed an order dated November 13, 2020 and asked Kerala to clear the pending dues of Poplantik, who left the club and joined Scottish top division club Livingston FC last season, despite having a year left on his contract. Kerala then filed an appeal against the decision, but on May 25, 2021, the president of the appeals arbitration division of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) pronounced that the “procedure is terminated” and removed from the CAS roll. On May 31, 2021, Poplantic’s representatives informed Fifa that “we have sent our client's payment references via email of 23 November 2020 but until today we have not received neither the answer or the payment.” Disciplinary action was initiated within 24 hours. “All necessary actions have been taken to clear pending obligations with respect to the transfer ban. The club expects to have the required clearance in due time,” the club said in a statement on Tuesday. In the case of East Bengal, Fifa Dispute Resolution Chamber passed an order on November 18, 2020, asking East Bengal to clear Acosta’s outstanding remuneration and also pay compensation for breach of contract. Fifa said the amount should be paid by the club within 45 days, failing which the club “shall be banned from registering any new players, either nationally or internationally, up until the due amount is paid and for the maximum duration of three entire and consecutive registration periods.” With no payment being made to the player, his representatives wrote to Fifa on May 31 seeking disciplinary action. Acosta still had a month left on his contract when the club cited ‘Force Majeure’ due to the Covid-19 pandemic and terminated his contract on April 30, 2020. “No salary would be paid for May, 2020,” the club told the Costa Rican defender in an email.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fifa-bans-east-bengal-kerala-blasters-from-registering-new-players/articleshow/83350207.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Mumbai||In a 1st, IIT-Bombay sets up chair only for women faculty||MUMBAI: In a move aimed at recognising women leaders in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education, the premier IIT-Bombay instituted a chair exclusively for women faculty. The chair is sponsored by the institute’s alumnus from the Class of 1995. While women faculty members do occupy institutional chairs, this is the first at IIT-Bombay meant only for women. The chair will be open to faculty from across branches. The institute’s alumnus from the civil engineering department, Amit Dixit, Blackstone’s Head of Asia for Private Equity, has not only sponsored the chair, but will also be supporting the student mentorship programme’s recruiting initiatives to attract more girls to the institute. The contribution was made in his personal capacity and the chair will be named after him. Director Subhasis Chaudhuri, in a statement, said that the occupant of the chair will be a role model for female students and younger faculty. “Gender diversity in the campus is one of the key areas where we are constantly working. I am sure this will help in achieving better gender equity at IIT-B. This is possibly one of the first and unique efforts in the Indian university system,” said the director. The faculty on the chair will be appointed after a selection process. The institute currently has 34 chairs sponsored by donors, of these two are occupied by women. Of the 38-chair professorships established by the institute, two are occupied by women. Dixit told TOI that his own personal and professional experiences in India and the US prompted him to focus on the issue. “Under-representation of women is highly visible. We rarely see women holding CEO positions in most tech companies. I am now in a position to bring a change,” he said. Dixit wants to set up a ‘conversion cell’ at the institute to help girls who apply for JEE and even clear it, but do not join owing to family pressures and concerns. The cell will help allay fears of parents from the tier 2 and tier 3 cities about sending daughters to big cities and improve the gender ratio on the campus. The government’s decision to have a supernumerary quota for girls has helped increase their admission from just 8% in 2016 to 18% in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-a-1st-iit-bombay-sets-up-chair-only-for-women-faculty/articleshow/83322752.cms||---

Police said that the victim was identified as Madhuben Vaghela, a resident of Chhela Bedi village of Kalavad. She was living with her relative Ramji Manjariya. She was killed by the accused Bhura Vejariya and Rasik Vaghela — both in their 50s — for refusing their demands of sexual favours. “Manjariya saw the photo of the dead body and recognised her as Madhuben who had left for a pilgrimage to a nearby temple a few days ago and never returned. Manjariya, suspecting an untoward incident, searched for Vejariya and Vaghela as the victim had told him that the two were harassing her. With both of them missing from their homes, Manjariya approached police. Police detained both of them and they confessed to have murdered her,” a police official said. A post-mortem report confirmed that the woman was strangled to death. Vejariya is an agricultural labourer and lives in Laloyi village in Kalavad taluka of Jamnagar while Vaghela is a resident of Nani Bhalsan village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/two-held-for-murdering-50-yr-old-woman/articleshow/83318284.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Airlines pin hopes on jab certification as ‘ticket to fly’||KOLKATA: The airport operator, airlines and the travel trade fraternity have their hopes pinned on the government’s proposal for unfettered travel for fully vaccinated individuals to revive the industry that has crash-landed following restrictions imposed by various state governments to control the surge in Covid cases in the second wave. At present, several states have made it mandatory for fliers coming in from places with high infection numbers to undergo RT-PCR test before travel and fly only if they test negative. Bengal and some other states have imposed the condition on all travellers from outside the state, pushing down the daily passenger count to 4,000-5,000 from 20,000-25,000 a month ago. What has added to the problem is the varying conditions for the test set by different governments. For instance, Pune and Aurangabad in Maharashtra and Port Blair in Andaman & Nicobar Islands demand an RT-PCR test done not more than 48 hours before flying, while most other states allow it within 72 hours. “The RT-PCR test demand has affected air travel big time as getting reports within 24-36 hours is still a challenge in many cities. The priority in testing facilities is for those suspected to have contracted the virus, rather than travellers. If fully vaccinated people are allowed to travel without testing, it will not only resolve a major hassle, it will also drive people to get vaccinated at the earliest,” an airline official pointed out. Travel agents believe the timing was just right to push through the proposal and get all state governments on board as new as well as active Covid cases have declined significantly. Pointing out that states could still veto such a proposal as health was a state subject, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said a joint team from several ministries and stakeholders, including the health department, were currently in discussion to take a final decision on allowing travelling by air without an RT-PCR test for fully vaccinated people. “This will be a shot in the arm for the domestic tourism industry,” said Travel Agents’ Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni. “This is the most logical move,” said Travel Agents’ Federation of India (east) Anil Punjabi, adding it would also prevent wastage of RT-PCR tests on healthy people. Though the proposal of treating the vaccine certificate as a passport for inter-state travel is being considered, India is opposed to the concept of a vaccine passport for international travel. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had told the G7 countries that with vaccine coverage in developing countries still low compared to developed countries, such an initiative could be discriminatory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/airlines-pin-hopes-on-jab-cert-as-ticket-to-fly/articleshow/83320433.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Vikhe-Patil, who was in Nashik, appealed to all the members of the Maratha community to come on a single platform. “I will meet Sambhajiraje and request him to join a common platform of 22 various organisations fighting for the Maratha reservation,” he said. Asked if he would call for the postponement of the agitation called by the MP, the BJP leader said, “Our request is to have a common fight for which we would require some time. Hence, we will request Sambhajiraje to postpone the date of his agitation so that all the organisations can be accommodated.” The Sakal Maratha Samaj leaders from Nashik convened a meeting at the Government Rest House to decide on the future course of action after the MP’s call for starting the quota agitation. “All of us are undivided about the agitation to be carried out on June 16. The agitation will be carried out across all the districts of the state and we all will be standing by Sambhajiraje who has given a call for the last fight,” the members said. The village-level committees are being formed to spread awareness about the reservation among the masses and the agitation as well. The members have also called upon various leaders and factions, claiming to start agitations for the reservation for the community, to join the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vikhe-patil-for-common-quota-fight/articleshow/83315879.cms||---

The department is going to present the proposal to the central government in a meeting scheduled to be held later this month where the latter will ultimately decide on the amount of budget to be released for the scheme. Last year, the state government had presented a budget proposal of Rs 1,500 crore to the Centre, following which, a budget of Rs 900 crore was approved for the scheme by the central government. According to the Union ministry of education website, SSA is an integrated scheme for school education extending from pre-school to Class XII to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. Meanwhile, several job aspirants hope that the state starts recruitment on the vacant posts of BRP (Block Resource Person) and CRP (Cluster Resource Person) after the Centre releases the budget for the scheme. It is estimated that there are around 900 vacant positions of BRP and CRP in Uttarakhand. Notably, a budget of Rs 208 crore has already been approved for the mid-day meal scheme in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/education-dept-clears-rs-1-8k-crore-budget-for-ssa/articleshow/83318297.cms||Mohammad Anab

Clubs can now field a maximum of four foreign players – from the existing five – and leave seven spots in the team for Indian players. The inaugural season in 2014 had witnessed a playing composition of six foreigners and five Indian players. “Since the inception of ISL, there has been constant progression, innovation, and focus to develop Indian football. The latest changes in player guidelines are incorporated with the league’s philosophy of bringing constant improvement to India’s premier football event,” the organisers said in a statement on Tuesday. Interestingly, while the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) implements the three plus one foreign player rule for its tournaments, it’s not mandatory for ISL clubs to have an Asian player among the four foreigners on the field. The clubs can sign a maximum of six foreign players of which one is required to be from an AFC member nation. ISL has also mandated clubs to increase their development player signing from minimum two to four, while continuing to have two of such development players be part of the match-day squad. Last season, there were impressive performances from young players with the likes of Akash Mishra, Apuia, Jeakson Singh, Rahul KP and Ashish Rai all catching the eye.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/isl-reduces-foreign-players/articleshow/83350353.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 16-year-old ‘injected with aphrodisiacs’ and raped by neighbour, 4 arrested||MUMBAI: Four people have been arrested in connection with the rape and kidnap of a minor from Andheri. The 16-year-old junior college student is the daughter of a businessman. She has alleged that a couple from the neighbourhood had forced her to consume aphrodisiacs in the form of tablets and injection.

The other two arrested in the case are the teenage girl’s cousin – her paternal uncle’s 19-year-old son – who allegedly “got into a relationship” with the minor after she got in touch with him for help, the police complaint states. The boy’s father – her paternal uncle – also took her to Uttar Pradesh and planned to get her married eventually with the intention of extracting money from the girl’s family, the complaint states. An official from Amboli police station said they have found a 27-page note purportedly written by the girl to her parents. “The note written by the survivor narrates that she got addicted to the tablets. It also mentions that the neighbour threatened her by telling her that he had a video clip of the sexual act and started blackmailing her… She eventually went into depression,” said a police official. “She then contacted the cousin from Uttar Pradesh and sought his help,” said a police officer. In her statement to the police, the girl has alleged that she was taken to Uttar Pradesh where the cousin got into a relationship with her which lasted over a month. “My uncle told me that my cousin would marry me.” Based on a kidnap case filed by the girl’s father, deputy commissioner of police Abhishek Trimukhe and his team comprising senior inspector Someshwar Kamte, inspector Abdul Rauf Shaikh pored travelled to Delhi and Uttar Pradesh and rescued the girl from Amethi.

According to local police, Vijay Ankush Vhanmane (17), Ananda Ankush Vhanmane (16) and their cousin Vaibhav Lahu Vhanmane (14) had gone to catch fish at the check dam near their farm at Ghanand village on Sunday afternoon. The water level at the check dam had risen to around 10 feet following the release of water from the irrigation scheme. In the evening, when none of the three teens had returned home, the relatives, with the help of local authorities, began the search. They found the body of the pet dog floating downstream of the dam. The rescue team was called from Sangli. However, the search operation was stopped at night. Sachin Mulik told TOI over phone said, “We resumed rescue operations on Monday morning. In the first couple of hours, the rescuers found the body of one of three teens and then by 10.30 am, they found bodies of the other two. We suspect that the dog got caught in the whirlpool in the gushing water. Then, the teens might have jumped in to save the dog, but got caught in the whirlpool themselves.” Mulik said all three knew how to swim, however, the water level and the speed of the water was such that they might not have succeeded. “We stopped the water release. The water level was bought down to 20%, only then the rescuers were able to find the bodies,” said Mulik. The irrigation department releases water into canals twice a month for irrigating the farms in the arid regions of the district. The check dams are built to arrest the water so that the farmers nearby can get consistent supply by pumping.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/three-teenagers-drown-in-sangli-trying-to-save-pet-dog/articleshow/83315962.cms||---

The NTCA’s move came after a lion at Vandalur zoo in Chennai died of suspected Covid-19. A few other lions at the zoo have also tested positive, said the letter issued by NTCA on Monday. While parks in north Bengal usually shut down in mid-June due to monsoon, Sunderbans Tiger Reserve in south Bengal remains open throughout the year. Tourism is a key livelihood option for villagers living near the tiger reserve. “Since the state government’s restrictions are in place, tiger reserves here are already closed. Before the second wave, when the parks were open, we were not allowing visitors to any watchtower or units inside the tourism zone,” said state’s chief wildlife warden V K Yadav. “The latest instance of zoo animals getting infected of Covid-19 again indicates the high likelihood of disease transmission from affected human beings to animals. A similar transmission may also happen in tiger reserves,” the NTCA letter stated. A K Samanta, director of Alipore zoo, which is also closed now, said that all safety protocols were in place and that they were keeping a watch on all animals for any symptom.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chennai-lion-death-cloud-over-tourism/articleshow/83320488.cms||---

---||Meerut||Meerut: Uprooting of hand pump creates rift among shopkeepers in Saharanpur market||MEERUT: For over 40 years, a lone hand pump stood as a symbol of communal harmony in Saharanpur’s Maniharan market. Traders from both communities drew and drank water from it. But it is now at the centre of the communal discord with leaders of parties and activists of outfits trying to score political points. It was uprooted by the authorities on the request of a shopkeeper belonging to the Brahmin community. Most shopkeepers, who are from the minority community, want it back now. Recently, local SP and Congress MLAs staged a protest after which the administration agreed to the demand and decided to re-install it. But it retracted its statement when right wing organizations too reached at the spot in Behar region and staged a protest against the administration. They also recited Hanuman Chalisa. Now the administration has decided to maintain the status quo, which means no re-installation. The pump was uprooted on the request of Pandit Murari Jha, who wanted to re-open a shop shut for the last four years. The pump was exactly in front of it. According to Jha, the owner of the shop, “They have created a mountain out of molehill. The hand pump was blocking the entrance to our shop which we were planning to open now. So removal of the pump was necessary. When they created a ruckus we were compelled to involve our supporters.” Nadeem Khan, who has given the application to reinstall the water source, said, “The hand pump was the source of water for so many shop owners, including Hindus. They just made it a prestige issue. We had even changed the direction of the water outlet so that Jha doesn’t find it difficult to manage his shop. Yet he got it removed. Hundreds of policemen reached the spot and we were not even allowed to protest when it was removed.” Additional district magistrate (Behat), Dipti Dev, said, “We conducted an inquiry into the issue through Behat police station in-charge. It was found that the hand pump was really creating problem for the shop and hence it was ordered to be removed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/uprooting-of-hand-pump-creates-rift-among-shopkeepers-in-saharanpur-market/articleshow/83318414.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Kolkata||Priyanka VB||Priyanka Dasgupta Kolkata: As part of Visva-Bharati University’s centenary celebrations, a select group of intellectuals, scholars and academics from across the globe have come together to be a part of a video documentation titled ‘Shikkhateertho’. This documentation, which will be online on June 12, is an attempt to archive memories of the participants and present their re-assessment of how the institute has evolved with time. Recording the video interviews of the participants including Supriyo Thakur, Pramita Mallick, Pabitra Sarkar, Manabendra Mukhopadhyay, Martin Kempchen, Bashabi Fraser and Mighmed Dorji Lama are already over. Helmed by inter-disciplinary artiste Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee’s art collective SPCkraft and Mohor Bithika Angan, a heritage space for multi-disciplinary art, ‘Shikkhateertho’ will also feature vocal performances by Priyam Mukhopadhyay, Ritapa Bhattacharya, Srikanto Acharya, Sasha Ghoshal and Sromona Chakraborty among others. According to Chatterjee, this blend of personal recollections and the analysis of how the institute has held on to Tagore’s vision has added a new dimension to the project. If Australia-based octogenarian danseuse Diyali Lahiri has relived the centenary birth celebration of Tagore across the country and the joy of taking part in it as a dancer, Hispanic scholar and professor of Spanish Malabika Bhattacharya has spoken about the contribution of husband Sabyasachi Bhattacharya as the university’s vice chancellor when he got the copyright on Tagore’s books renewed and extended for 10 years in 1991. Vocalist Pramita Mallick recalled how Tagore had felt a dire need to protect nature and had introduced ‘Brikhhoropon’ to celebrate nature. Bangalore-based folk-vocalist Tamojit Ray has gone down memory lane to talk about “weekly literary meets” that “culturally” shaped their lives. One interesting video has been recorded by Gautam Bhattacharya. An author, proponent of Tagore studies and an ex-teacher of Pathabhavan in Shantiniketan, he recalled how the students of Visva-Bharati were initially not charged for their boarding and education. Later when Tagore confronted financial distress, he took his students across the country to perform dance dramas to collect fund for the university. What makes this project more interesting is the re-assessment of the university by the likes of Tagore scholars and academics Pabitra Sarkar, Supriyo Thakur and Manabendra Mukhopadhyay. While Sarkar has spoken about Tagore’s vision of uniting the nation with the rest of the world and his opposition towards ‘Shallow Nationalism’, Thakur has deeply regretted that the university has currently taken on the colour of an ordinary institution. According to Mukhopadhyay, it is a matter of serious concern that in future, along with the increase in corporate culture, the university might become a subject for a museum if not protected with the ideals it was built with. “Listening to these luminaries almost makes me feel like watching reels of a film that was long hibernated. Personally, I feel inspired to know how contemporary Tagore was in his ways of the world,” Chatterjee said. ---- Caption: A file photo of Tagore with the students and children of Santiniketan||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/priyanka-vb/articleshow/83320586.cms||---

These rankings are the only global performance tables that assess universities against the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Carefully calibrated indicators are used to provide comprehensive and balanced comparison across four broad areas: research, stewardship, outreach and teaching while deciding the ranking. The 2021 Impact Rankings is the third edition and the overall ranking includes 1,117 universities from 94 countries/regions. “We have transdisciplinary centres of excellence, such as eco-campus, collaborative centre the with integrated environmental services, WILO-VU water quality centre of excellence and an ecosystem to create a synergy between industry, students, faculty, and stakeholders. These centres aim to provide a sustainable solution for real-life problems. We are playing our role to facilitate the government’s target to achieve energy security, energy access and reduction of the carbon footprints,” Bharat Agarwal, president of Vishwakarma University, said. Vice-Chancellor Siddharth Jabade said they have strategically integrated the SDG mission in teaching-learning, student projects, internships and thoughtfully calibrated national and international collaborations. “Students are sensitized to SDGs goals and they take it forward in personal and professional lives. Our efforts are in consonance with India’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity and achieve high electric power capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vu-among-top-200-global-universities/articleshow/83322867.cms||---

Veteran leader, Rajya Sabha member Captain V Lakshmikantha Rao’s and former minister E Peddi Reddy’s names are also doing the rounds for the bypoll. Since Eatala has been representing the constituency since 2009 and established a good following, the ruling party is leaving no stone unturned to not only snatch a victory but also win the seat with a sizeable majority as and when the bypoll is held. No wonder, the party is looking for a strong candidate though several local leaders are aspiring for the party ticket. Vinod represented as Karimnagar Lok Sabha MP between 2014 and 2019, but lost the election to BJP state president Bandi Sanjay in 2019 general elections. He served as party deputy floor leader in Lok Sabha. Sources said the TRS leadership is considering his candidature in the bypoll as Huzurabad constituency falls under Karimnagar LS seat and the TRS had secured more than 50,000 votes in the LS elections. Vinod has already been made one of the incharges of the party to the constituency. On the other hand, 81-year-old Lakshmikantha Rao, who is considered to be very close to TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao, is also fancying his chances although his advanced age could go against him. He was party MLA between 2004 and 2008 before delimitation of constituencies. Another factor which could spoil his chances is that his son V Satish is an MLA from Husnabad and the leadership may not give a second ticket from the same family, sources said. Peddi Reddy, who is with BJP now, may join the TRS and may get an opportunity to take on Eatala. Sources said Reddy is not happy with the BJP leadership as he was not consulted by the party before inviting Eatala into the party. Local leader and BC Commission member Vakulabharanam Krishna Mohan, TRS vidyarthi wing president Gellu Srinivas, former TTD member Dontha Ramesh and a businessman are also trying their luck. Eatala, who quit the TRS a couple of days ago, is likely to submit his resignation to the speaker in a day or two and join the BJP later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vinod-is-trs-first-choice-to-take-on-eatala-in-huzurabad/articleshow/83322856.cms||Koride Mahesh

A proposal is being prepared and it will be forwarded to the chief minister’s office for the final nod, officials said. It is estimated that around 1.36 lakh students will receive the tablets. An official in the education department told TOI, “We have started creating a proposal for this scheme, as tablets will help students continue with their studies even if schools are closed indefinitely again in the future. In regions with poor internet connectivity, offline study material which will already have been uploaded on the device, will ensure the students’ studies are not hampered.” “The state government is working on several other schemes as well for the welfare of the students of Uttarakhand,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/edu-dept-plans-tablets-for-students/articleshow/83318458.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Aurangabad||63% Maharashtra farmers who wiped debt with loan waiver borrow afresh||AURANGABAD: The Maharashtra government’s farm loan waiver scheme helped farmers wipe their slate clean, but 63% of them have again taken loans till May 31 this year. According to a report from the State Level Bankers’ Committee, which has been submitted to the state agriculture minister, crop loans of 31.51 lakh farmers from across Maharashtra were waived off under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Karj Mukti Yojana. Of these, 19.68 lakh or 63% farmers have availed of fresh crop loans. The total amount of fresh crop loans issued this year to these farmers till May 31 is Rs 13,152 crores. Most of these loans are in the range of Rs 25,000 to Rs 75,000 per farmer. State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said, “Our priority while introducing this loan waiver scheme was not only to repay the crop loans, but also to ensure that the farmers are not treated as defaulters. Their CIBIL records should also be good to get new loans.” Bhuse said instructions have been given to the banks to ensure that all needy farmers readily get farm and crop loans, irrespective of whether they have benefited from farm loan waiver schemes. Under the scheme floated by the MVA government, crop loan waiver has been given up to Rs 2 lakh for the amount obtained between April 1, 2015 and March 31, 2019. Eligible farmers with loan amounts of over Rs 2 lakh will have to pay the remaining amount as a one-time settlement. Officials said that loans totalling Rs 20,109 crore have been waived off in the state so far. The scheme has benefited a large number of farmers from the Marathwada region who had faced crop failures due to drought, excess rainfall and even hailstorms. Despite the lockdown, for the fiscal ending March 31, 2021, the state, cooperative as well as private banks have together achieved 77% of the given target by disbursing Rs 47,972 crore crop loans. They had a target of Rs 62,459 crore. For the financial year 2021-22, the annual credit plan (ACP) for crop loans is Rs 55,560 crore, while the potential linked credit plan (PLP) for crop loans has been set at Rs 79,190 crore. Those privy to the development maintained that this year’s ACP is 3% less than last year’s ACP and 22% less as compared to PLP prepared by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/63-maha-farmers-who-got-loan-waiver-borrow-afresh/articleshow/83320532.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 712 acres of Aarey forest land handed over to SGNP||MUMBAI: Aarey Colony land declared as a forest last year was formally handed over to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) authorities on Monday. The newly appointed chief executive officer of Aarey Colony formally handed over a total 712 acres to the SGNP director. In 2019, the state government had handed over 100 acres for a zoo. This is now part of the Aarey forest. An additional 90 acres in possession of the SGNP is reserved for relief and rehabilitation of tribals and slum dwellers. The long overdue handover is a significant victory for the citizens’ movement in the city. The Save Aarey Movement, which began in 2015 to protest the cutting of trees for the Metro Line 3 car shed, saw the Uddhav Thackeray government formally declare 800 acres as a forest. However, the uncertainty over the shifting of the metro car shed continues. The SGNP will now be responsible for conservation and protection of the new forest land. G Mallikarjun, director SGNP, said the state revenue and forest department has sanctioned the post of a forester and four forest guards for the additional forest area which made the takeover possible. While 800 acres were declared as forest last year, five acres will be returned to the dairy development department as it was earlier earmarked for a police station. “The five acres will be returned in due course before the final notification declaring the area as forest is issued,” he said. The government had been keen to hand over the land to SGNP as frequent fires in Aarey “were maligning the government’s image”. Amrita Bhattacharjee, member of the Aarey Conservation group, said the handover was good news. “The government must now remove the barricades around the Metro car shed so that the public can see what has been done at the site,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-712-acres-of-aarey-forest-land-handed-over-to-sgnp/articleshow/83322887.cms||Clara Lewis

A contractor has been finalized by the city police for resuming the towing van operation in the city. On May 21, the police had sought suggestions and objections from citizens and set a two-week deadline. However, only two suggestions have been received by police from citizens. The suggestions are of general nature advising to not spare illegally parked vehicles belonging to anyone — police personnel or politicians. Owing to the indiscriminate parking all over the city, the police have initiated the process of resuming the towing van system. The system was already in the city earlier. But its closed down as the contractor concerned failed to meet the terms and conditions of the contract along with large number of complaints from the citizens. Now, haphazard parking has become a major issue all over the city. On this backdrop, towing vans are needed to be back as motorists will think twice before parking their vehicles. If a vehicle is towed away, the motorist concerned not only has to pay the fine for illegal parking, but also the towing charges. “Once the necessary contract procedures are complete, towing vans would start operating in the city,” an official from the traffic branch said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/poor-response-for-suggestions-sought-by-police/articleshow/83316246.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Police said the trio confessed to being part of the same gang. The total arrests in the case now stands at seven. “Through technical surveillance input, suspicious bank transactions during the last seven days were traced in respect of a few accounts and three persons were arrested from Kaikhali on Monday evening, including Md Vakil, the first one to be identified through CCTV footage,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar City Police. The two other accused were Sandeep Gupta alias Sonu and Amit Gupta alias Amrit, the officer added. The Kolkata Police said they had almost unravelled the method in which this gang worked. At the helm of the affairs was Naveen Gupta (30), a resident of south Delhi’s Fatehpur Beri. He was arrested from Surat on Saturday along with Manoj Gupta (40). Cops claimed that Naveen had come to Kolkata multiple times to carry out the recce and target ATMs. The two accused from Kolkata — Biswadeep Routh and Abdul Saiful Mondal — acted as mules for the gang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/atm-fraud-3-from-kaikhali-in-cop-net/articleshow/83320644.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

He also said Telangana has not only achieved food security but also become a source of food security for the country. KCR said even during the pandemic, the crops cultivated by Telangana farmers have provided food security to the country. Greeting people on the occasion of World Food Safety Day, the CM said within a short span of time, Telangana was able to create fertile land in two crore acres which is yielding two crops. He said the government is making efforts to turn Telangana into a ‘rice bowl of the country’ (Annapurna). He said fine quality rice is given to students and ration card portability is created so that ration cardholders can draw their ration anywhere in the state. “This has provided total food security to the needy,” he pointed out. He said the state government has introduced several welfare schemes by spending Rs 45,000 crore to provide food, social and life security to people. He said the region faced famine and starvation when rulers of united AP governed. He also said measures were being taken by the government to supply meat, eggs and fish to people. “The state government has been implementing the sheep rearing scheme and encouraging fruit and vegetable production. Thanks to the efforts, people in the state are getting food, which is safe and secured. The government is waging a war against adulteration of food items and dealing with an iron hand on spurious seeds, fertilisers and pesticides manufacturers and sellers,” the CM said. The CM said Telangana was able to become number one state in paddy production in the country by completing all major irrigation projects like Kaleshwaram and reviving and restoring tanks under Mission Kakatiya programme. The CM said in the state, each person is being given 6 kg of rice through a food security card (Ration Card). Of the total 87,41,000 ration card-holding families, 2,79,27,000 (72 per cent of the state’s population) are given 20 lakh metric tonnes of rice at Re 1 per kg per year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-provided-food-security-to-india-even-in-pandemic-cm/articleshow/83322875.cms||---

---||Surat||Surat woman’s lungs save life of Covid survivor||SURAT: A woman from Jalgaon in Maharashtra had managed to beat Covid-19 but her ordeals were far from over. Coronavirus had completely damaged her lungs. With doctors advising lung transplant as the only option to save the woman, her family was hoping against hope to get an organ donor in time. Just before midnight on Sunday their prayers were answered when the family of a 46-year-old brain-dead woman from a Surat village decided to donate her organs. Kamini Patel, a resident of Timbarva (Sankli) in Bardoli taluka, gave a new lease of life not only to the 31-year-old woman Covid-19 survivor from Maharashtra but also to six others. Apart from lungs, Patel’s heart, two kidneys, liver and corneas were also donated. The lungs were transplanted into the Covid-19 survivor woman at Hyderabad’s KIMS Hospital. A green corridor was created from Surat to Hyderabad, a distance of 940 km, and the lungs were shifted in 160 minutes. Patel was under treatment since May 17, after she was unable to get up from the bed. Her blood pressure shot up all of a sudden and doctors diagnosed that she had suffered brain-hemorrhage. She was shifted to Shalby hospital in Surat where the blood clot from her brain was removed after craniotomy surgery. But her condition did not improve and doctors declared her brain-dead on Saturday after which the Donate Life team approached the Patel family. “My wife is dead but she would give a new lease of life to seven people. Her organs would bring smiles to the faces of those patients who are in urgent need of them,” said Bharat, Patel’s husband. The heart harvested from Patel was transplanted into a 46-year-old woman from Mumbai at Mumbai-based H N Reliance Hospital. Patel’s one kidney was transplanted into a 30-year-old woman from Ahmedabad at the Sterling Hospital, Ahmedabad. Her second kidney was transplanted into a 27-year-old woman from Ahmedabad at the Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Centre (IKDRC), Ahmedabad. The liver was transplanted into a 58-year-old man from Bhavnagar at the IKDRC. The corneas were donated to Surat-based Lok Drashti Chakshu Bank (eye bank). For a grieving Bharat, a social worker, it wasn’t a tough decision to make when the Donate Life team including its founding member Nilesh Mandlewala approached him for organ donation. Bharat had helped in setting up isolation wards for Covid-19 patients and distributing medical instruments and other items to the needy in Bardoli and nearby villages. “We met the family members and they readily agreed for cadaver donations,” Mandlewala, founding member of Donate Life. Patel’s son Aniket, who is pursuing computer engineering from Charuset University in Anand, despite the personal loss, was thinking about the lives that the cadaver donations would save. “Due to Covid-19, many people including youngsters have suffered damage to their lungs and they need urgent transplants to survive. My mother’s lung would help one of the Covid-19 survivors get a new life,” Aniket said. “This was the first heart and lungs donation from Gujarat since the onset of the second wave of Covid-19,” Mandlewala added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-womans-lungs-save-life-of-covid-survivor/articleshow/83318561.cms||---
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Construction firm posts 50 traffic wardens at Dwarka||NASHIK: As many as 50 traffic wardens have been deployed by the construction company, which has constructed the new flyover on the Mumbai-Agra highway. The work of constructing the flyover from K K Wagh College to Jatra restaurant has been underway for more than two years. Now, the work of linking this flyover to the existing flyover is underway for the past one month. Since the vehicular traffic on the existing flyover from Dwarka to Adgaon has been closed, the rush of vehicles is more on the road beneath the flyover and the twin service roads. Meanwhile, before granting permission of work of linking the Dwarka flyover to the new flyover, the city police had instructed to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to ensure that it should deploy 100 traffic wardens to assist the city police in streamlining the vehicular traffic at various points right from Pathardi Phata to Jatra restaurant. Inspector Bharat Suryawanshi of the City Traffic Branch said that initially the construction company had deployed only 30 traffic wardens and subsequently, it removed 11 of them leaving only 19 traffic wardens on the road to assist the traffic police. Suryawanshi said that though he pointed out the issue to the construction company, no heed was paid. Later, he brought the matter to the notice of commissioner of police Deepak Pandey, who immediately dispatched a notice to NHAI over the less number of traffic wardens deployed by it. Taking note of the notice, the construction company on Saturday deployed 50 traffic wardens and the remaining traffic wardens would soon be deployed, said Suraywanshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/construction-firm-posts-50-traffic-wardens-at-dwarka/articleshow/83316260.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Chennai||Pandemic puts at stake survival of craft of handloom||Coimbatore: Fifty-year-old T Kumar and his wife K Saroja have been weaving handloom saris for the past 25 years. Though the income is limited, they stuck to the ancestral trade, making do with what they earned by weaving around three saris a week at their home in Negamam, Pollachi. But the pandemic has hit them hard this time. For almost three weeks now, the couple have been without work.With no source of income, they are completely dependent on the state government’s Covid-19 cash relief and ration products for their survival. Kumar, a father of two, said, "Around the same time last year, as the government had announced some lockdown relaxations, my wife and I had been doing odd jobs, working in a poultry farm, at a construction site and at a garment factory. As a complete lockdown was imposed this time, we could not get any kind of work."Kumar, who is looking for odd jobs, is unsure if he can continue with his traditional weaving work. The economic after effect of the pandemic has changed the future of his family. His daughter is in Class XII, but as the family is unable to pay her academic expenses, Kumar has been forced to ask her to take a break from her studies for a year.General secretary of the Coimbatore district handloom weavers’ association E N Rajagopal, said this is the condition of most weavers in the district. "Most of us are dependent on the traders. As all the shops are shut and business has taken a huge hit, we are not getting any orders," he said.As the cost to procure raw material like thread and zari is high, the weaver used to get them from traders and handover the final product after obtaining weaving charges. Depending upon the design, their wage would vary from `500 to `1,000 for a sari.Thousands of weavers are functioning from several parts of Coimbatore district including Sirumugai, Ondipudur, Negamam, Annur and Vellalore. "Traders continued to give us orders even after one week into the lockdown. But as the saris could not be sold, and so the payment had stopped and then the orders dried up," said Kumar.There is also a shortage of raw material such as zari and silk that would be purchased from other states due to lockdown rules in different states. "While some have obtained loans, others have pledged their assets to meet the expenses. What other option do we have?" said Rajagopal.Handloom, already faces stiff competition from powerlooms, involves investment of capital and resources, both of which are scarce during the pandemic. In this situation, the handloom weavers can survive only with the state’s help, feels P Parameshwaran, president of the handloom weavers’ association. "The financial assistance of `4,000 is not sufficient. We request the government to take necessary steps to ensure uninterrupted supply of raw material to us," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pandemic-puts-at-stake-survival-of-craft-of-handloom/articleshow/83320654.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: College admission policy to be framed only after HSC results||MUMBAI: A decision on criteria for college admissions for non-professional courses will be taken only after HSC results are announced in the state. In a preliminary meeting held between the vice-chancellors of state universities and the department of higher and technical education on Monday, many agreed if the evaluation model is fair and comprehensive, students should not be put through any hardships, said an official. Discussions on a common entrance test (CET) for admissions to traditional non-professional courses—if necessary—will be considered after the results, he added. Vice-chancellors and department officials deliberated over various case scenarios that could arise this year due to the cancellation of Class XII exams. “Some are expecting the success rate to go up. There may be several students scoring similar marks. Even if we get to know the evaluation method, it will be difficult to predict how the results will turn out. There is no point in framing an admission policy without understanding how the results will be,” said a vice-chancellor. Officials unanimously agreed to wait till the board announces the results. A meeting can be held the very next day and a policy can be drawn, added an official. Officials also agreed while admissions to top-rung degree colleges, especially in the cities, could be challenging, those for more than 80% of the colleges in the state can be conducted smoothly based on Class II scores. Colleges, too, are awaiting the state board decision. “While autonomous colleges can decide their syllabi and other academic-related matters, admissions to aided courses are bound by state government rules,” said the principal of a suburban college. Mumbai University alone has 42 autonomous colleges. “If colleges conduct their own screening process, there will be clashes in schedules. Parents and students may oppose it too. For traditional arts, science and commerce courses, the majority of seats will go to in-house students but for self-financed courses, we will need some process,” said the principal. Hemlata Bagla, principal of K C College and senior dean of HSNC University, said for courses with more demand, colleges can hold interviews or look at the overall performance of students in academics and co-curricular activities for three years. For professional courses, the state’s CET cell will conduct entrance tests online like last year. The application process is likely to start soon and test dates will be scheduled once the Covid situation stabilises across districts, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-college-admission-policy-to-be-framed-only-after-hsc-results/articleshow/83320698.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Delhi||As Delhi starts to unlock, gaps in Covid-appropriate behaviour||NEW DELHI: Nearly a month after it was shut down and 48 days since its doors were closed for passengers not engaged in essential services, the capital’s lifeline, Delhi Metro, resumed operations from Monday with restrictions in place. Monday also witnessed the maximum number of buses of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and the Cluster Scheme hitting the roads. With Delhi Metro allowed to operate with 50% seating capacity and no standing passengers, it witnessed around 4.5 lakh ‘passenger journeys’ till around 8.30 pm on Monday. Before lockdown was imposed on April 19, Delhi Metro witnessed 20 lakh passenger journeys on average daily. “Metro services again resumed today after a gap of 28 days amid the ongoing pandemic with the provision of travel with 50% seating only for the containment of Covid. To ensure compliance to Covid-appropriate behaviour on Metro premises, around 15 stations were intermittently closed during morning and evening peak hours,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). Dayal said approximate passenger journeys till 8.30pm were around 4.5 lakh, which he said was in view of the drastically reduced capacity owing to the adherence to the guidelines issued by the government on June 5. Even though Delhi Metro didn’t see much of a rush even during the peak hours on Monday, the stringent restrictions on carrying capacity was not completely adhered to by the commuters. During the morning peak hour, it was not unusual to see commuters occupying seats that were clearly marked vacant. Many passengers could be seen standing inside the coaches too. Dayal said that nine special flying squads were deployed to randomly check inside trains for any kind of violations and counsel people to refrain from doing so for their own and everyone’s safety. “Till 8 pm, 84 passengers were advised to get down from the coach for travelling in standing position, 73 were penalised for not wearing masks and 106 were counselled to follow social distancing and wear masks properly,” he said. Although Monday didn’t see much rush, it is likely that commuters would have to wait for a long period before boarding a train in the coming days if the rush increases. An eight-coach train that can comfortably accommodate 2,400 passengers will now operate with around 240. While on Monday DMRC deployed only half of its 336 trains, it said more will be inducted in in a graded manner. While public transport buses have been operational throughout the lockdown with 50% seating capacity for those engaged in essential services, the frequency was low due to decreased demand. The Cluster Scheme, which has a fleet of 2,990, was operating 1,655 cluster buses till Friday, but on Monday, all its buses were on the roads. DTC, which has a fleet of 3,762, was ‘outshedding’ 2,802 buses till Friday, but on Monday, 3,428 of its buses were deployed. Sources said that ridership of buses, even at off-peak hours, was much better compared with the previous week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-delhi-starts-to-unlock-gaps-in-covid-appropriate-behaviour/articleshow/83320681.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||Experts stress on the need for periodic sero-surveys||PUNE: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) will start its second Covid-19 sero-survey this week with a sample size of over 10,000 people. Experts said periodic sero-surveys, with substantial sample sizes, will be an important tool for more insights into areas and populations affected by the spread. If one region or section of population shows higher antibody levels, resources can be diverted to protect areas that are still vulnerable, the experts added. Experts said sero-surveys were important than ever now because people were being administered vaccines across the country. In such a scenario, the spread of the infection among vaccinated and non-vaccinated people could also be studied to make better administrative decisions to tackle future surges. Clinical epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee said, “Sero-surveys will not only predict the fury of future waves, but also guide vaccination strategy. We are facing an acute crisis of vaccine supplies. Natural infection gives robust immunity. Excluding those who have Covid-19 antibodies or have had a positive RT-PCR test in the past will save a lot of resources and enable vaccination of all those who are vulnerable.” Om Srivastava, member of the state Covid task force told TOI, “The biggest importance of sero-survey now was to match the Covid numbers in the respective areas. If you see Covid numbers falling in one area and increasing in others, then this survey becomes quite important as it gives an idea of what is happening in a particular area in terms of infection spread.” Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state government on Covid-19 and former director-general of health services (Maharashtra), felt that considering the current scenario and the looming threat of another wave, the sero-surveys could play a key role in the fight against the contagion. “We had suggested the state government initiate at least a district-level sero-survey as an indicator of what the contagion situation was in the respective region. But, not many districts showed much enthusiasm,” he said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s hospital board of India, told TOI that their earlier studies in Pune were conducted in a limited area. “In general, sero surveys are recommended by medical science experts. A structured sero survey could give us an idea of how many people were affected by the contagion. Now that almost 37% of our target population has been vaccinated with the first dose, it could give us a better idea,” he said. Atul Desale, the assistant professor of the department of community medicine at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital, who will also lead the sero survey investigation, said that the upcoming sero survey would be more extensive and would include more research activities. Results from Pune’s first sero survey, released in August last year, showed seropositivity rates nearing 60% in some slum pockets, with overall 50% positivity. But that sero survey, experts said, was inadequate as it was limited to only 1,644 citizens across five high-incidence zones within Pune Municipal Corporation limits. The first sero survey by the PCMC carried out from October 7 to 17 involved 5,000 people, which found that 34% of the surveyed people had antibodies, suggesting extensive spread across slums, tenements and large housing societies. But, the proposed survey in PCMC limits later this month, is expected to cover residents of slums and large housing societies across areas that have recorded high, medium, and low transmission and people who have been vaccinated.

This is the second time that the team has been granted extension. Suspended motor vehicle inspector of Nashik RTO Gajendra Patil has made allegations against the minister and others. Patil has alleged corruption in transfers and postings in the regional transport officer department. In a statement issued by Pandey, he said that five more days have been given to the team as the enquiry is still in progress. Earlier, the team was given extension of five days on May 27. Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Sanjay Barkund, who is conducting the probe, said they were still taking statements of various people and therefore had requested an extension. Pandey had issued orders to complete the enquiry and submit report within five days, the enquiry could not be complete by June 1, following which, Barkund had requested extension by a week for the inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-police-chief-gives-5-more-days-to-probe-team/articleshow/83316265.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Delhi||Unlock phase-2: On Day 1, air quality takes a hit as Delhi reclaims roads||NEW DELHI: On day 1 of the partial unlock, parts of the capital reported traffic snarls. Busy intersections saw a return to the usual rush, with real-time pollution levels shooting up as peak traffic was reported in the morning and the evening. While Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) on Sunday stood at 134, it slumped to 180 on Monday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily air bulletin. Track the pollution level in your cityA combination of dust uplift, winds and an increase in traffic is likely to lead to a further spike in pollution in the next 24 hours, experts say. Data from CPCB’s central control room showed the 24-hour average PM10 levels for NCR at 180 micrograms per cubic metre at 9 am on Monday compared with an average of 126 micrograms per cubic metre at the same time on Sunday. The standard for PM10 is 100 micrograms per cubic metre. Similarly, the average PM2.5 levels also showed an increase on Monday (56 micrograms per cubic metre at 9am against 44 micrograms per cubic metre a day earlier). Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) data showed a spike in pollutants at busy traffic intersections, such as RK Puram, Anand Vihar and Punjabi Bagh at 9am, but these dropped by 6pm. At RK Puram, the hourly PM10 readings touched 208 micrograms at 9 am before dropping to 128 micrograms per cubic metre at 6 pm. The PM2.5 readings dropped from 86 micrograms per cubic metre at 9 am to 39 micrograms per cubic metre at 6 pm. At Anand Vihar, the PM readings touched 305 micrograms per cubic metre at 9 am and the PM 2.5 reading at the same time was 130 micrograms per cubic metre — two to three times above the standard. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a body under the central government, says AQI is expected to deteriorate further in the next three days. “The overall Delhi air is in the higher end of the moderate category as forecast. Surface winds are strong and westerly. A sharp increase in wind speed is forecast for the next two days. However, at the same time, an increase in local dust emission and long-range transport of dust from the arid regions are likely as the transporting winds are becoming favourable, leading to higher coarser dust concentration (PM10) in the next three days. AQI is, therefore, likely to deteriorate and will be in the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category,” SAFAR stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-quality-takes-a-hit-as-city-reclaims-roads/articleshow/83320712.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Kolkata||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee forms team to help reinforce embankments||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday announced a 24-member expert committee headed by river expert and West Bengal Pollution Control Board chairman Kalyan Rudra, to decide how to reinforce the embankments in an eco-friendly and sustainable manner. “We have coined a slogan: Prakitik Durjoge Prakiti Sahai (Nature mitigates natural calamities). This is to see how we can make these embankments strong using natural resources,” said the chief minister at an administrative meeting at Nabanna. The state government spends thousands of crores to rebuild embankments, but they get breached every year, leaving thousands of acres inundated. The concrete embankment is capital intensive. “But we can make sure that embankments can sustain the onslaughts of the cyclonic storms. Mangroves can play a huge role in withstanding storms,” said chief minister. The committee will have expert members from Calcutta University, Jadavpur University, Kalyani University and Bidhan Chandra Krish Viswavidyalaya. “The entire work of mangrove plantation will be funded by the environment department,” she added. At the Sundarbans, the forest and environment department planted 5 crore mangrove saplings. The same model will now be replicated in three districts — Sunderbans and riverine zone in North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas and Digha. “Mangrove plantation is fine, but we are seeking expert opinion on vetiver grass. If vetiver grass is an invasive species, it can invade farm fields and destroy our crops. So, we are maintaining extreme caution before choosing species for the plantation,” said a senior environment and forest department officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/krish-expert-committee-on-disaster/articleshow/83320718.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Farmer’s ‘apple’ experiment bears fruit in Vadodara village||VADODARA: People visiting the farm of Girish Patel in Vemar village near Vadodara rub their eyes in disbelief. For, Patel asserts that small green fruits they see growing on a number of trees are actually apples. In blistering hot Gujarat, this stationery seller-turned-experimental farmer has succeeded in growing the fruit that’s a native of cold places, mostly Himachal Pradesh. Patel’s orchard has 220 apple trees and each can bear 30-40 kg apples. “I handed over my thriving stationery business in Karjan to my son and took up farming. While searching for something new, I got to know about Hariman 99 variety of apples and got the saplings delivered from Jaipur,” Patel told TOI. “This variety has been tried in other states too quite successfully,” added Patel, who also has mango and guava plantations. The saplings are not difficult to maintain. “One has to ensure that the land where they are sown has a slope and water does not get accumulated around the saplings. I learnt this the hard way after losing some plants,” Patel said. He added that the routine regime of manure, pesticides and watering is sufficient for the plants. The orchard bore fruits for the first time last year, but Patel had to remove the flowers and fruits as the plants were too young. This time too he has done the same thing, but is allowing a few apples to grow as a samples. A farmer in Kutch had also tried, but failed in the first trial. “He is trying again and some other farmers from Kutch have also contacted me,” said Patel. In fact, when horticulture department officials were keen to give subsidy to a farmer in Vadodara, they were in for a surprise as the crop did not exist on their list. Patel pointed out that while he had not applied for any aid, the horticulture department offered him subsidy. “I said I was not keen if it involved lots of efforts. I was assured that there would be no hassles,” he said. But then a strange situation emerged when the officials got back to him saying apples were not on their list. “This was expected as no one grew them and it was not a local crop too. I told them it was fine if I did not get the subsidy, but they have assured that they will ensure that I get it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/farmers-apple-experiment-bears-fruit-in-vadodara-village/articleshow/83318655.cms||Sachin Sharma

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Hospitality sector plans shots for 6 lakh employees before reopening||KOLKATA: Mamata Banerjee government has set a target to vaccinate six lakh people from the hospitality sector in phases in order to reopen the industry. Initially, it has set a target for inoculating 1.8 lakh people from the sector as soon as possible. This was announced by state tourism minister Indranil Sen while inaugurating the vaccination drive for the hospitality sector organized by the Hotel and Restaurant Association of India (HRAEI) in association with health and family welfare department, tourism department and KMC. Chief minister Banerjee last week had assured the industry that restaurants and bars would be allowed to open from 5pm to 8pm after their employees are vaccinated. Sen said, “The state government led by Mamata Banerjee is a pioneer to take up the initiative to vaccinate hospitality industry workers. There will be camps across the state for vaccination.” The programme was also attended by state tourism secretary Nandini Chakravorty. HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar appealed to the association members as well as restaurant and bar owners not to reopen before any state notification. “Honorable CM has been gracious enough to allow bars and restaurants to operate from 5pm to 8pm but we are waiting for the notification so that we can reopen our establishment. In the mean-time we shall speed up the vaccination process of our employees,” he added. Poddar also said that the camps will be held initially in Kolkata and then districts will come under them. The former president of FHRAI, TS Walia said that there will be 10 centres in the city. The state government is providing vaccines while the association would provide venue, doctor, support staff, ambulance and other logistics to carry out the drive. According to Walia, Park Hotel will be the venue of such vaccination camp for a week. Besides, Holiday Inn, Westin, Gateway have offered space for vaccination. Restaurant owners have welcomed the vaccination move. The owner of Peter Cat and Mocambo, Nitin Kothari said that it has already sent requisitions for vaccines. “Our cooks are here but a lot of staff members are not in the city. We have told them to return,” he said. Pradip Rozario, owner of KK’s Fusion and Mio Amore, said that it has asked their staff to bring their documents so that he can move forward with the vaccination at the earliest. The director of Aminia Kabir Azhar and director of Chowman, Chapter 2 and Oudh Debaditya Chowdhury also added that it has started the process of inoculating their employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hospitality-sector-plans-shots-for-6l-employees-before-reopening/articleshow/83320762.cms||---
---||Delhi||AAP government to vaccinate 45+ at polling booths in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday launched a special campaign, “Jahan Vote, Wahan Vaccination”, which seeks to inoculate people at polling booths. Delhi government is carrying out door-to-door surveys to identify individuals above 45 years who haven’t got vaccinated yet. These people will be urged to visit their designated polling stations for the jab. The state government aims to vaccinate all individuals above 45 years within four weeks, subject to the availability of doses. Of the 57 lakh people above 45 in Delhi, 27 lakh have been vaccinated so far. A similar campaign will be run for the 18-44 age group when the government gets sufficient vaccines. Extensive vaccination coverage is considered crucial to warding off the next Covid-19 wave. At a press conference, Kejriwal expressed the hope that there would not be any shortage of vaccines for people above 45. “The vaccination centres that we have opened up remain mostly empty, and very few people (45+) turn up because of which the vaccines remain un-administered. Without waiting for the people to come to us, we have to go to them. Under this scheme, we will go to the houses of the people,” the chief minister said. He said the polling centres were usually located close to residential areas. “The scheme has been initiated in the 70 civic wards of Delhi from today. Every week, this campaign will cover 70 wards.” The government has trained booth-level officers who, for the next two days, will go to every house and carry out the survey. “Even people whose names aren’t on the voters’ list will be covered. People who haven’t got the jab will be given a slot at the closest polling booth,” Kejriwal said. The government has asked BLOs to encourage people to come forward to get the jabs. “The BLOs will try to convince people that vaccination is the only effective way of fighting coronavirus,” the CM said. A team of civil defence volunteers is also being readied for this purpose. Delhi government will ply special e-rickshaws for the vaccines beneficiaries. Depending on the success of the scheme, it may be repeated after 2-3 months. “The second dose will be administered at the polling booths in a similar manner,” Kejriwal said. The CM appealed to everyone to cooperate with the BLOs in the survey. “This is the only way that we can save our Delhi from the coronavirus,” he reiterated. Meanwhile, AAP MLA Atishi said that 40,000 doses of Covaxin had arrived for the 18-44 age group on Sunday and these would be used to administer the second dose only. Delhi currently has 27 days’ stock remaining for 45+ age group, which includes 5.6 lakh doses of Covishield and 21,350 of Covaxin. More than 56.6 lakh individuals have got the jab in Delhi, but only 12.8 lakh have got both the doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-govt-to-vaccinate-45-at-polling-booths/articleshow/83320748.cms||AlokKNMishra

On June 1, with 981 new cases of Covid-19 and 30,624 samples sent for testing, the positivity rate was 32%. On June 7, with 395 cases and 23,271 samples sent for testing, the positivity rate now stands at 1.7%. In the last one week (May 31 to June 6), the state has maintained a positivity rate below 5%. The number of Covid-19 deaths and cases have also declined. While cases have declined by 59.7%, deaths have declined from 36 on June 1 to 21 on June 7 (41.7%). The least average positivity rate of the past week was recorded in Haridwar (1.56%), followed by Udham Singh Nagar (1.88%) and Tehri (2.19%). The two districts that recorded an average positivity rate above 5% (considered the safe limit), were Almora (8.15%) and Nainital (5.40%). Meanwhile, testing numbers in the state have also reduced. From June 2 to 7, the state has been conducting less than 30,000 Covid-19 tests daily. Health department authorities attributed this to a lack of manpower. “The National Health Mission employees went on a strike from May 28, which could have led to reduced sampling. Their matter has been resolved now, and they will be back to work from Tuesday. As it is, the number of Covid-19 cases has reduced significantly in Uttarakhand,” said Abhishek Tripathi from the Covid-19 state control room. Health watchers while expressing satisfaction at positivity rates declining, said that the testing pace should not be allowed to slacken. They also advocated easing of restrictions. “Now is the time for the government to offer some relaxation in the curfew in order to kickstart the economy. However, citizens need to do their part and adhere religiously to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Anoop Nautiyal of Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 situation in the Himalayan state. Meanwhile, on Monday, the state’s Covid tally reached 3,34,419 and death toll 6,731. The state currently has 14,122 active cases. Results of 7,871 samples are awaited. Also, 2,235 people recovered from the infection on Monday. Also, the state registered five cases and one death of mucormycosis (black fungus) on Monday, taking the tally to 304 and the death toll to 48. To recall, black fungus has been declared an epidemic in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/positivity-rate-dips-in-ukhand-so-does-number-of-covid-tests/articleshow/83318635.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Nagpur||MP Rana to move Supreme Court against High Court cancelling her caste certificate||NAGPUR: The Bombay high court on Tuesday cancelled the caste certificate issued to Amravati Lok Sabha member Navneet Rana, saying it was obtained fraudulently using fabricated documents, and directed her to surrender it within six weeks. The court also slapped a fine of Rs2 lakh on the MP. The HC noted that the claim of belonging to ‘Mochi’ caste made by Navneet for obtaining the scheduled caste certificate was fraudulent and made with an intention to obtain benefits available to a candidate from such category. Upset over the judgment, Navneet said she would challenge the verdict in the Supreme Court. Terming the HC verdict unexpected, Navneet, wife of Badnera MLA Ravi Rana, alleged “political khichadi” behind the controversy over her caste certificate. “Like a responsible citizen of India, I respect the HC verdict and through my lawyers I would be filing an appeal in the apex court seeking a stay on the HC order. The HC has also granted me six weeks to move to the top court, which is currently on vacation,” the MP told TOI from New Delhi. Navneet Rana, a former model and actress, contested 2019 Lok Sabha election from Amravati (SC-reserved) constituency as an independent supported by Congress-NCP and RPI and defeated veteran Shiv Sena leader Anandrao Adsul. Adsul had later filed a petition in the HC seeking cancellation of the caste certificate dated August 30, 2013 issued by Mumbai deputy collector, identifying Navneet as belonging to ‘Mochi’ caste. Calling herself a “fighter”, Navneet said she was working for the people of Amravati for the last nine years without any godfather and would challenge the case in SC too. “The district committee, which was formed as per the Supreme Court guidelines, had issued me the caste validity certificate twice after thoroughly scrutinizing all documents. Voters have democratically elected me as an MP and my public service will continue uninterrupted,” she said. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena workers in Amravati celebrated the high court decision cancelling Navneet Rana’s caste certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mp-rana-to-move-sc-against-hc-cancelling-her-caste-cert/articleshow/83340682.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kochi||Kerala government can go ahead with GIFT City: Report||KOCHI: The social impact assessment (SIA) report, prepared by the Rajagiri OutReach, a non-governmental organization, has confirmed the fears of residents of Ayyampuzha, where the proposed Global Industrial Finance and Trade (GIFT) City is coming up. However, the report suggests the government to go ahead with the project by recommending compensation, rehabilitation and employment opportunities for members of the affected families. The report inadvertently admits that there is heavy tree cover in the proposed project site as it is part of the Western Ghats and calls ‘for the protection of the environment, perpetuate the trees in the affected areas as far as possible and measures should be taken for replantation in lieu of the destroyed trees.’ The proposed project is coming up in 220 hectares in 59 resurvey numbers in Ayyampuzha village. The 76-page report has been prepared as part of the land acquisition for the project. Opinion of 90 landowners were taken as part of preparing the assessment. Of the 90, 53 people have expressed their willingness to give the land for the project, while 21 were not ready to give their land and 13 took a neutral stand. Rubber, coconut, tapioca, plantain and vegetable cultivation are in most of the land to be acquired for the project. Of the 90 people surveyed, the report admits that 76 are doing cultivation and in most land, there are wells, ponds, sheds etc. It also says that not only the landowners but also labourers will lose their means of livelihood when the land is acquired for the project. The report further suggests the government to consider 171.4700 hectares of the government land, near the proposed area, to be utilized for the GIFT City project, if there is any practical difficulty in acquiring the identified land. However, the landowners TOI spoke to, raised their reservation against the report. They fear that the environment impact assessment would also favour the project discarding their fears regarding their loss of livelihood and ecological impact. “We are living peacefully with nature. Why are the authorities hell bent on implementing the project on our agricultural land by dislodging us from our houses.We are not against development. But they can utilize the government land situated near the proposed area. Two hills, which are a source of drinking water for the panchayat, at the project site will be destroyed leading to water shortage in future. They eye red earth and rocks in the area. Only a few people with vested interests want the project to come up in our area as they bought vast stretches of land at throwaway prices years ago from poor farmers,” said Jose Chullikkaran, convener of the protest committee against the project. Fearing that the trees in the project site would be axed to pave way for the project, a group of youngsters in the area planted saplings on World Environment Day, outside the project site. “More than one lakh trees, including rubber and nutmeg, are in the project site. How the compensation and rehabilitation give back livelihood for the rest of our life?” asks Nibin Kallarackal, who makes a living from nutmeg and areca nuts from 35 cents of land. Those who expressed willingness to part their land for the project are the ones currently living outside the project area, said Kallarackal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-can-go-ahead-with-gift-city-report/articleshow/83318746.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Delhi||Covaxin only for those who got it as first dose, Delhi HC told||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Monday asked the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi to inform the high court if it plans to ensure second dose Covaxin vaccination for those beneficiaries due to receive the jab on June 14. The high court also advised Delhi government to examine how the number of slots for the second dose can be increased. Justice Rekha Palli expressed satisfaction and appreciated the proactive steps taken by AAP government and the Centre, after being informed that an additional 40,000 vials of Covaxin have been provided to capital on June 6 to tide over the current situation. Appearing for the Delhi government, standing counsel Anuj Aggarwal informed the court that the state government had directed all government centres, private hospitals and nursing homes in the capital to administer Covaxin only to those in the age group of 18-44 years, who have received the same vaccine as their first dose. The high court was hearing a clutch of petitions filed by those who are unable to get their second dose of the shot. The state government submitted that Delhi Disaster Management Authority had directed all private hospitals and nursing homes functioning as Covid vaccination centres for Covaxin to ensure that it shall be used for vaccination for only those people (of age group 18-44 years) who are eligible for receiving it as their second dose in June or till further orders. Delhi government added that health department had earlier already issued similar directions for all government-run vaccination centres. However, the petitioners pointed out that for some people, who have completed the six weeks gap after their first dose by June 14 and are due for second shot, would be unable to get the dose on time. The court then sought the government’s plan by June 11 on vaccinating such people, and asked both governments to examine the issue of utilising the data bank and messaging people whose second dose was due. Meanwhile, the Centre in an affidavit, said the Co-Win system provides the list of beneficiaries due for the second dose on a given day, containing the name and contact details of the persons to enable the state and district officials to actively track the beneficiaries due for the second dose. The central government also informed the high court that the system sends SMS alerts to beneficiaries from time to time so that she can book another slot and get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covaxin-only-for-those-who-got-it-as-first-dose-hc-told/articleshow/83320901.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Kochi||Kochi police warn of social media impersonators||KOCHI: Kochi city police have issued an advisory urging residents to be wary of a ‘social media impersonation scam’ in which cybercriminals create fake accounts on social media sites using the profile pictures and details of a person’s real account. The scamsters then befriend the social media friends of the person through this fake profile and later demand money from them, police said. City police commissionerate explained the tactics of these cybercriminals in a detailed post made through their social media handles. Police said that the fraudsters will message the people in the friend list of the person whose fake profile have been made, asking them to transfer money to them, citing a medical or some other personal emergency. “They will claim that they could not speak over the phone and request the victims to send money through UPI or other means to some UPI ID or bank account. The account details will be different from that of your friend, but the cybercriminals will claim that a person is waiting in an ATM and to send the amount soon,” police said. “Even after getting the amount, the cybercriminals may try to get more money from the victim till things become suspicious. The fraudsters may also send messages from apps like WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal by impersonating your friends,” police said. Police urged residents to be wary as scamsters may also create fake accounts of famous people or respected individuals in society. Fake profiles of even senior police officers were created in the past. Police also suggested a set of precautions. “Never transfer money without verifying the recipient. Always confirm through phone call or another medium that the request from the person is valid. Before accepting a friend request, always check the account creation date since most fake accounts will be created just before the scam,” police said. City police also suggested residents to always lock social media profiles through privacy settings to prevent impersonation of accounts. “If you see a fake account of someone you know, immediately notify the person and report the profile to the social media platform. If you are a victim of such scams, file a complaint,” city police said in the advisory issued online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-warn-of-social-media-impersonators/articleshow/83318775.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: New prescription based on evidence makes docs happy||For the past 15 months, most Covid-19 patients in India, no sooner than they were diagnosed, have got a prescription of six to eight medicines. “The poly-pharmacy phenomenon was irrational. We are extremely happy that these guidelines have been drawn up on robust evidence,” said Dr S P Kalantri from Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha, referring to the central health ministry’s new treatment plan.Guidelines mention, in all, four medicines as necessary for severe Covid patients: Oxygen, steroids, tocilizumab (not all but based on certain blood parameters) and anti-coagulants for those with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, etc. The guidelines make it clear that medicines are meant only for moderately or severely ill Covid-19 patients who need hospitalisation. For those with mild Covid, only medicines to reduce fever and cough are advised.Commonly prescribed antibiotics like azithromycin and doxycycline are missing from the list. Ditto with ivermectin, the antiparasitic drug meant to control filariasis or elephant's foot. Best-sellers like zinc supplements and vitamins A, B, C and D are also not mentioned. Previous protocols by Union and state governments always mentioned a 15-day or month-long course of zinc and vitamin C and D.World Health Organisation chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan welcomed the “evidence-based guidelines”. She said they were “simple, rational” and would serve as a clear guide for physicians. A global health expert from McGill University in Canada, Dr Madhu Pai, said, “Rational, scientific guidelines are critical for saving lives, and I am delighted to see these new evidence-based Covid guidelines by DGHS, MOHFW.” He said they are backed by science and avoid irrational and unproven medicines. “This will not only save lives, but also reduce costs for patients.” Pulmonologist Dr Lancelot Pinto said he could stop being “apologetic’’ to his Covid-19 patients. “I have never prescribed ivermectin, doxycycline or favipiravir to my Covid patients, but I have had to explain to many why I wasn’t prescribing these drugs. Some would be jittery about it, but now I can show them these guidelines,” he said.On the negative side, a senior doctor at a BMC hospital said the guidelines don’t include advisories for patients with comorbidities. Another doctor said it isthe Indian Council of Medical Research which usually puts out treatment protocols, not the DGHS. “A regular doctor could be confused about which governmental agency to follow,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-new-prescription-based-on-evidence-makes-docs-happy/articleshow/83322992.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Delhi||Delhi: AIIMS screens around 30 kids for Covaxin trials||NEW DELHI: The All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi on Monday started the screening for clinical trials of Covaxin, India’s indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine, in children. Nearly 20 to 30 teens aged between 12 and 18 years participated in it. They underwent tests to rule out Covid-19 and presence of antibodies against the virus. Also, the parents of these kids who were accompanying them were asked to sign a consent form for participation of their wards in the trials, Dr Sanjay Rai, in-charge of the vaccine trial at AIIMS told TOI. “We will administer the first dose of Covaxin to children who clear the screening on Tuesday itself,” he added. India has approved three vaccines for immunisation of adults aged 18 years and above against Covid-19: Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik. However, there are no vaccines approved for use in children at present. US and UK have approved the Pfizer vaccine for use in children who are above 12 years old. Bharat Biotech, the company that is manufacturing Covaxin, was given approval by the drug regulatory body for clinical trials of their vaccine on May 12 following which phase II/III trials were started at multiple centers including AIIMS Delhi. “The trial will involve more than 500 children aged between 2-18 years. It will be divided in three phases: the first phase will involve the older children aged between 12-18 years followed by 6-12 years and 2-6 years,” Dr Rai said. “Mass immunisation against Covid-19 is the only solution to end this pandemic. Eventually, everyone will have to get the vaccine to safeguard from the infection,” one of the participants (identity withheld), said. AIIMS had also conducted phase I, II and III trials of Covaxin in adults. The hospital doctors said they had received 4,000 requests for participation when the requirement was for only about 100 adults. “This time, we didn’t advertise much for participation but there are enough requests already from parents keen to get their children vaccinated as a part of the trial,” said one of the doctors. He added that the clinical trials of the vaccine for children may take around six to nine months to complete. The clinical trials are significant given the apprehension of an impending third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic which, many experts say, may affect the children more. There is no evidence to support the claim though.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aiims-screens-around-30-kids-for-covaxin-trials/articleshow/83320986.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

He demanded that the AAP government immediately provide this relief to the ration card holders announced by the PM. Meanwhile, AAP MLA Raghav Chadha also welcomed the decision on vaccination but stated that after being pulled up by the Supreme Court, the Centre took this decision. “We thank the Supreme Court. After constant grilling by the SC, the Centre has finally woken up. It was after the SC’s rap that the Centre accepted the demands of the states. We have long been demanding a national immunisation drive,” the AAP MLA added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-welcomes-centre-move-to-procure-vax-for-states/articleshow/83320966.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal concern over temporary glut after new vaccine regime||KOLKATA: Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced free vaccines to the states from June 21, state health department officials pointed out that it could actually lead to a problem of plenty for Bengal since the state has already ordered a huge consignment of doses that is due to start arriving from June 11. The central government on Monday also capped the service charges at Rs 150 per dose for private vaccination centres. While the state government has already procured close to 21 lakh doses of vaccines since early May for inoculating people in 18-44 age group, payment has also been made for about 19 lakh more doses. “Though the shift in policy change is welcome, this has come at a time when payment has already been made for about 40 lakh doses by the state government. We are yet to get about 19 lakh more doses,” said a senior health department official. He added that if more vaccines are sent by the Centre, they may not serve any purpose immediately. “Their timing has turned out to be wrong. We needed the vaccine early last month and will need them once we have exhausted the stocks that are now in transit,” an official said. Since May beginning, the state governments have been mandated to buy vaccines on their own to inoculate the 18-44 age group while doses for people above 45 are being sent by the central government. Even as everyone above 18 years of age are getting the doses for free from government centres, the state had to purchase them. “This vaccination drive is for a national cause and hence regulating the service charge is fair enough,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. At present, majority of private hospitals across the city are charging between Rs 220 and Rs 300 as service charge for a dose. “Capping the service charge is alright. But why doesn’t the central government cap the vaccine price for manufacturers or subsidize it so that people have to pay less for it?” questioned Alok Roy, chairman of Medica Group of Hospitals. Rupak Barua, group CEO, AMRI Hospitals also cited the inequality in vaccine pricing between what the government pays and private hospitals have to pay. While the central government is procuring a dose of either Covishield of Covaxin at Rs150, privates hospitals are procuring a Covaxin dose for Rs 1,200 and Covishield for Rs 630 a dose. “The inequality in vaccine pricing is too vast. We hope something is done on this front and also private hospitals are assured of seamless supply,” said Barua. “It is the objective of Narayana Health to vaccinate maximum people at affordable price. We are already vaccinating on site at our procurement cost —Covishield at Rs 630 per dose,” said R Venkatesh, zonal director (east) Narayana Health. Rupali Basu managing director at Woodlands welcomed the need-of-the-hour free vaccination drive announced by GOI. “Vaccination remains a clinical process, and for private hospitals, the cost of vaccination not only includes the establishment cost, but cost of doctors and staff, logistics and cold chain. Therefore, Rs 150 may not be enough; we commit to work seamlessly with the government in this urgent and important initiative of vaccinating India,” said Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-concern-over-temporary-glut-after-new-vaccine-regime/articleshow/83321012.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Mughal-era garden cries for attention||AURANGABAD: Entry of unruly people, unauthorised vehicles along with illegal tree felling and encroachment have posed survival challenges before Himayat Baugh — a Mughal-era garden located in Aurangabad. As official apathy on part of different authorities, including Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, continues to take toll on Himayat Baugh, eminent historians and environmentalists have now joined hands to protect the heritage site which is a biodiversity hotspot. United under the banner ‘Himayat Baugh Conservation Action Committee’, the people have demanded slew of quick measures in order to avoid further damage being inflicted to different parts of the historic structure. Advocate Swapnil Joshi, one of the committee members, on Sunday said unwanted footfall at Himayat Baugh needs to be controlled by introducing visiting fee. “The unwanted crowd of unruly and errant visitors is hazardous to the monuments and biodiversity situated at Himayat Baugh. The crowd leave behind plenty of garbage, including plastic. Besides, free flow of two-wheelers and four-wheelers pose threat to the ecology of Himayag Baugh,” he said. Senior historian Dulari Quershi said private security guards as well as police need to have proper vigil at Himayat Baugh. “The boundary wall and other structures of Himayat Baugh have already received irreparable damage. The authorities should take collective action, failing to which future generations will not able to see Himayat Baugh,” she said. When contacted, A K Dhawan , vice-chancellor of Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University that largely covers Himayat Baugh, said he was facing limitations in ensuring proper vigil. “We do not have sufficient staff, including at Himayag Baugh. Besides, our staff faced threats in the past when they tried to prevent unwanted footfall,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mughal-era-garden-cries-for-attention/articleshow/83316305.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Delhi||HC refuses to stay order allowing pvt schools to collect annual fees||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday refused to stay a single-judge order permitting private unaided schools to collect annual and development charges from students for the period after the lockdown ended in 2020. While hearing contentions of the AAP government, the court said, “Don’t be a populist government, how will the schools run without funds? They have to pay taxes.” A bench of justices Rekha Palli and Amit Bansal said, “We are not inclined to stay the order... It needs to be first examined if the Supreme Court ruling on Rajasthan schools could be applied to Delhi schools or not.” It, however, issued notice and sought response of the Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, which represents over 450 schools, on the appeals of the AAP government, students and an NGO challenging the single judge’s May 31 order. The court listed the appeals before the roster bench on July 12. At the end of the hearing, the court recorded the statement made by senior advocate Shyam Divan, representing the action committee, that till the next date of hearing, they will continue to follow the existing principles in relation to collection of fees from students. Delhi government, along with some students and an NGO ‘Justice for All’, contended that the single judge’s decision was based on incorrect facts. The May 31 verdict had quashed two office orders of April and August last year issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE) of Delhi government forbidding and postponing collection of annual charges and development fees, saying they were ”illegal” and “ultra vires” the powers of DoE stipulated under the Delhi School Education (DSE) Act and the Rules. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing Delhi government, argued that the single judge gravely erred in passing the directions on the basis of a Supreme Court order relating to collection of school fees. Singh said the order overlooked the fact the Supreme Court judgment was for Rajasthan and imposition of tuition fee was for a time when schools had physically reopened there, which is not the case in Delhi. He further maintained that as per an earlier finding, 60% of tuition fees was sufficient for discharging their liabilities towards teachers’ salaries and the remaining amount could take care of other expenditures, including development charges. However, the association argued that Delhi government had no power to interfere in private contracts between schools and students’ parents as long as there was no allegation of schools indulging in profiteering. The bench seemed to agree, pointing out that if parents were unhappy, they could shift wards to Delhi government schools, which the latter claims are better than private ones. Advocates Khagesh Jha and Shikha Sharma Bagga, representing NGO Justice for All and various parents, urged the court for a stay arguing that the private schools were asking for paying charges for something, which is not being provided to the students, and the schools have started harassing the parents by asking to deposit money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-refuses-to-stay-order-allowing-pvt-schools-to-collect-annual-fees/articleshow/83321088.cms||Abhinav Garg

Considering the demand for oxygen concentrators for Covid patients being treated at home, the Gurudwara Singh Sabha (GSS), Kochi, and Khalsa Aid International together have mobilized 40 oxygen concentrators to be distributed to those in need. The Khalsa Aid International, which works with its international chapters to assist people across India, had sourced oxygen equipment from outside the country and distributed in many cities across the nation. Volunteers of GSS said that they looked at what was the immediate need of the hour as the second wave of Covid-19 has left many hospitals without oxygen or available beds. “Hospitals and health centres across India are struggling to cope with the sheer numbers of new cases. Patients in critical condition are being turned away, many dying at home without access to medical help. Though we did not have such a scenario in Kerala, we decided that we could reach out to people in a different way,” said Baljit Singh, GSS-Thevara general secretary. When Khalsa Aid international had sent oxygen concentrators to different organizations in the country, GSS also decided to acquire some and donate. “We had 40 oxygen concentrators to be distributed to those in need. We are handing over 10 to IMA Kochi and another 10 to national health mission (Arogyakeralam),” he said. “We have 20 more, which we are ready to give to people in need. Once the use is over, we take it back, get it sanitized and pass it to other people who badly needs it,” said Singh. GSS had distributed food packed to migrants who were leaving for home town during the lockdown. More than 500 food packets were distributed every day last year. People looking for an oxygen concentrator can contact these WhatsApp numbers - 7736001600/9447091773/9387178927.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gurudwara-singh-sabha-provides-o2-concentrators/articleshow/83318800.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Delhi||Gangsters shifted to keep Sushil Kumar safe in prison||NEW DELHI: Dubai-based gangster Kala Jathedi is learnt to have approached jailed crime lord Lawrence Bishnoi through his henchmen to help him seek revenge from arrested wrestler Sushil Kumar. Sources said Jathedi had sent out messages to Bishnoi and his aide, Sampat Nehra, for the task. Nehra was earlier held for allegedly plotting to kill actor Salman Khan. Intelligence inputs suggests there may be a bid on Kumar’s life during a staged brawl in jail. Inputs also indicated that organised gangs affiliated to Kumar or his rivals might try to target the witnesses in the case, sources said. Amid these reports, the Delhi Prison administration has shifted Bishnoi and Nehra to Tihar Jail from the Mandoli campus. While officials termed it as a routine reshuffle, sources said this had been done to ensure the arrested Olympian’s safety. Kumar has been in Mandoli’s jail number 15 ever since he was sent to judicial remand. Bishnoi was in Ajmer jail, but the special cell had recently interrogated him and associates after taking them on remand. Bishnoi and Nehra, now arrested under MCOCA, were recently shifted to ward number 4 of Mandoli Jail number 1. Bishnoi, it is learnt, was shifted two days ago while Nehra was moved on Monday. They are in the high-security ward of Tihar Jail No. 1, sources said. Tihar is making foolproof arrangements for their lodging. A special security apparatus has also been put in place for Kumar at Mandoli. Kala Jathedi and his Man Friday, Sonu Mahaal, seem in no mood to mend bridges with Kumar, it appears. Mahaal, who was among those assaulted by Sushil on the night of May 4, has been nurturing a grudge against him and his aide, Ajay, since March. The investigation has revealed that the two factions had clashed two month ago over a girl. Sonu Mahaal, who is Jathedi’s nephew, had celebrated his girlfriend's birthday at the flat in Model Town during which Kumar’s best friend, Ajay — who was also arrested last month — had allegedly misbehaved with her and also clicked her pictures. This had outraged Mahaal who then, along with Sagar Dhankad, got into a verbal spat with Ajay and Kumar. Taking advantage of the situation, Kumar allegedly asked Mahaal and Sagar to vacate the flat. This had angered Jathedi even more because he had allegedly helped Kumar usurp that disputed flat and wanted a share. Sources said that the assault was the second blow to the Jathedi gang that had been wanting to avenge the “ill-treatment” meted out to Mahaal's girlfriend. This was why Jathedi had refused to strike a compromise with Kumar when he was on the run. Jathedi has a reward of Rs 7 lakh on him. He has been indulging in large-scale grabbing of disputed properties in Delhi through Mahaal and others, police say. Kumar allegedly joined hands with Jathedi and landed on a property in Model Town. This flat was being used to shelter criminals belonging to Jathedi-Lawrence Bishnoi gang and many crime plots were hatched there, said an officer. Kumar later joined hands with gangster Neeraj Bawana and Naveen Bali and fell out with Jathedi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gangsters-shifted-to-keep-sushil-safe-in-prison/articleshow/83321031.cms||Raj Shekhar

---||Mumbai||Healthcare company owner and pharma lab employee held in inter-state fake Favipravir racket||MUMBAI: The owner of a Himachal Pradesh-based “healthcare company” and the employee of a pharma lab in Meerut have been arrested for links to an inter-state ring selling spurious Favipravir tablets. The drug has been widely used for Covid-19 treatment in the country. The case has sparked concern among activists on spurious drugs that have reached patients. The drugs are believed to have been sold in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Acting on a tip-off, the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) had raided three wholesale drug dealers, two of them in the suburbs of Kandivali East and Goregaon East. Stocks of Favimax 400 and 200 (Favipravir tablets) and hydroxychloroquine tablets collectively worth Rs 1.5 crore were seized. Cartons in which the tablets were packed named the manufacturer as Max Relief Healthcare from Solan in HP. Times ViewA scam linked to the sale of spurious drugs on a large scale is always alarming. In the midst of a pandemic, the human cost of such criminal enterprises can be staggering. Constant checks must be carried out by the FDA and police to tackle this menace as numerous patients can be at risk. Government must do its bit and plug the gaps in staffing at senior levels in the FDA, which TOI has written about in the past.The FDA then dashed an email to the drugs controller in HP who clarified that no such company existed. “A further inquiry revealed that Max Relief Healthcare’s Noida establishment was selling drugs to wholesalers in the state when it did not have a licence to do so. All states were immediately alerted to stop using this drug,” an FDA officer said. On May 30, the Max Relief owner, Sudip Mukherjee, appeared before the FDA but carried no documents linked to production and sale of drugs. “He could not provide any information about drug production and sale licences either. At first glance, the photocopy of a licence that he produced appeared fake. He was handed over to the Samta Nagar police station where an FIR was registered the same day and Mukherjee was arrested,” said the FDA officer. Another FIR was registered at Vanrai police station in Goregaon East. Inquiries took a police team to Meerut in UP where they zeroed in on Sandeep Mishra, an employee of a pharma lab, who was allegedly manufacturing spurious Favipravir tablets, and his associate who was helping to pack them. “A sample was tested and they were confirmed to be fake,” said senior inspector Anand Hake, Samta Nagar police. Mishra and Mukherjee have been booked under the Indian Penal Code and the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. More arrests are likely. Earlier this month, Gujarat FDA had seized fake Favipravir tablets that had even been listed on an online pharmacy store and were being sold for Rs 1,096 per strip. The fake drug was found to be nothing but starch after tests were conducted. A number of local stores in three Gujarat cities were selling the tablets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pharma-wholesalers-in-mumbai-suburbs-raided-fake-covid-drug-scam-busted/articleshow/83323081.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Tuskers spotted, foresters tell farmers not to visit farms at night||KOLHAPUR: Farmers in the Shivdav village in Bhudargad have stopped going to their farms though it is time to do sowing and other pre-monsoon activities. Reason: An elephant has prolonged his stay in the Rede Ohol forest area in the village. Several acres of farmlands have been destroyed due to the march of this animal. Kerba Chougale, age 65, a farmer from Shivdav, said, “The tusker has been seen at night in the farms of Shivdav for the last five days. The elephant stays in the forest during the day time and comes to the villages at night to visit the sugar cane farms. We haven't yet completed our monsoon farming activities and even our farm workers are not ready to come.” The foresters are trying to trace the tusker but haven't yet been able to trace it. The gram samiti of Shivdav has advised farmers not to go to the farms at night. Whereas, in Gudwale village in Chandgad taluka, a tusker family comprising one male, one female and two calves have been spotted. It has created panic among the villagers in Chandgad. Dnyaneshwar Rakshe, range forest officer for Chandgad, said, “These tuskers had shifted to Dodamarg in Konkan region in February month and were expected to return back to Chandgad in September. This time may be due to unavailability of nutrient food, they have returned back early in the Chandgad forest region.” Rakshe added that the current location is around the Khalsa Gudwale village and the farmers and villagers have been advised not to go out in farms at night time and also not to woo the animals. A forest department patrolling vehicle has been alerting the villagers via audible warnings about the return of the animal in advance. “The male tusker might get aggressive if they are disturbed as he is with his family,” he said. Availability of good farm food like sugar cane, paddy, banana and coconut in the Chandgad region makes it a good habitat for the elephants. The wild tuskers keep moving between Dodamarg and Chandgad forest region, added Rakshe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/tuskers-spotted-foresters-tell-farmers-not-to-visit-farms-at-night/articleshow/83316323.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Kochi||Corp goes slow on agency selection||Thiruvananthapuram: The delay in selection of agencies for the collection and transportation of dry waste in the city has hindered the prompt management of waste being accumulated in various recovery facilities.  The city corporation had received two bids for the collection and transportation of unsorted plastic and other kinds of dry waste. The health wing had forwarded the file for the approval of the council. However, city-based scrap merchants have now approached the corporation with an offer to collect glass waste at a price higher than that was quoted by the two firms. In addition, another firm in the state has come up with a proposal to collect all the waste. The corporation health committee which found itself in a fix over the issues related to Attukal pongala waste management has been overly cautious in processing the bids and finalising the agencies, it is learnt. Health committee chairperson Jameela Sreedharan, talking in the council meeting held to approve the cleaning campaign, had hinted about practical difficulties in clearing the waste being piled up in material recovery facilities. “Although plans are afoot to clear the waste, we have to be mindful of the associated challenges,” she told the council meeting. She said that all procedures will be strictly followed while processing the bids and considering the new offers. “We have received bids as well as offers, however norms do not allow us to encourage offers when the bids have already been received. Whether we should go for a retender or should we accept the present bids are factors which are being deliberated. We plan to make it as transparent as possible,” said Jameela Sreedharan. Before the new council came to power, former secretary of Trivandrum corporation had withheld the bills to be paid to collection agencies and this led to an accumulation of waste in the facilities. The collection agents had refused to transport the waste if the dues are not cleared. The bills of a contractor engaged in plastic and cloth waste collection were also pending. One of the bills of a drive held in 2019 was cleared only in January 2021. Meanwhile, considering the situation, the health wing has extended the contracts of the current collection agencies till March 31. The contracts had expired in January. The corporation now gives unusable plastic to private contractors at Rs 4 per kg. Cleaned plastic is being given to Clean Kerala company. Till 2020, 543.6 tonnes of plastic was collected through collection drives in the city. As per the statistics, 491 tonnes of glass, 155 tonnes of sandals and 25 tonnes of e-waste were collected and transported from the city in the last three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-goes-slow-on-agency-selection/articleshow/83318829.cms||Aswin J Kumar

NKDA authorities were receiving complaints that the relatives often do not get information on the health condition of Covid patient at CNCI. During the pandemic, it’s difficult for a patient party to come to CNCI for getting daily briefing on the condition of a patient. “Communication between the patient party and the patient inside Covid facility is often very difficult due to the safety protocols. Two assistants have been provided at the HDU wards of CNCI who will be present when a doctor will do a round of the unit. Through the WhatsApp live video call, the relatives will be able to get to know the status of the health condition of the patient from the doctor directly,” said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen. At present, this facility is available for HDU patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/doc-kin-video-call-for-health-update-of-cov-patients/articleshow/83321080.cms||Suman Chakraborti

At a news conference the national vice-president of the BJP, DK Aruna questioned why industries minister KTR did not do anything about the vaccine despite the vaccine being manufactured in Hyderabad. BJP national spokesperson K Krishna Sagar Rao said KTR is an escapist and puts the blame on the Centre though health is a state subject.  In a press statement, he said, “Telangana State has zero policy on Covid-19 management, zero competence in implementing ICMR guidelines to test, trace and isolate since March 2020, and zero accountability on public health amidst this massive global pandemic. It had completely failed on all fronts in reference to Covid-19 pandemic related public health challenge.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-lashes-out-against-ktr-vax-talk/articleshow/83323055.cms||---
---||India||Home minister Amit Shah, BJP hail PM Modi, say announcement will put to rest fears, disinformation||MUMBAI: Minutes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement on the Centre’s takeover of free anti-Covid vaccination, social media handles of senior BJP functionaries were in an overdrive."The Modi government has always worked with determination towards the safety and health of the people. Today, the Prime Minister took a historic decision to provide free corona vaccine to all citizens above the age of 18 years across the country,” Home minister Amit Shah said soon after the PM made the announcement. He said the PM's decision will quash the disinformation campaign regarding vaccination. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also shot off a tweet along similar lines. “By announcing free vaccine from the central government to all the countrymen above the age of 18, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given great relief to the public and a new strength to fight against coronavirus," the defence minister tweeted. Party chief Jagat Prakash Nadda and other senior saffron figures, including Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, were also quickly off the block, in what marked an end of the spell where depredations of the "second wave", highlighted by the desperate scramble for oxygen cylinders, appeared to have pushed the party on the backfoot. Stunned by the ferocious second strike of the virus just after it had claimed success for tackling the first wave, BJP had instructed its leaders not to respond to the volley of criticism that was trained against them. However, steady decline, the dip looks dramatic if not sheer miracle when juxtaposed against the scary models drawn by biostatisticians, and the rapid augmentation of anti-Covid weaponry- from oxygen to drugs— appear to have helped the party regain its nerve. The switch of gears was evident last week itself when Shah praised the PM for stemming the second wave. The Prime Minister's retaking the control of vaccination appeared to have come as the second shot of morale-booster. Nadda said Prime Minister Modi has always led the nation from the front and the decision has once again shown that the country will progress and thrive under his guidance. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has once again demonstrated statesmanship. Those making critical remarks against the vaccination should take a lesson and contribute positively,” he said. Petroleum minister Pradhan called the Centre's decision to supply free Covid vaccines to states 'historic' and said the PM had acted according to the citizens' desire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/home-minister-amit-shah-bjp-hail-pm-modi-say-announcement-will-put-to-rest-fears-disinformation/articleshow/83326578.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Police accused of mistreating students||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Parents of four school students have filed a complaint against cops of Kattakada police station accusing them of misbehaviour towards the students, here on Monday. According to the parents, the police personnel, reportedly acting on a false information, mistreated the students who were studying together near a temple at Anchuthenginmoodu near Thoongampara around 1pm on Sunday. The parents alleged that the students were beaten by the police using a network cable and were taken to the police station. “When we tried to intervene, they threatened us and asked us to come to police station. We then reached the station and we were asked to give our details and then leave with the children. By evening the children complained of pain and uneasiness and we took them to Kattakada community health centre,” said Santosh Kumar, a parent of one of the children said. The parents said that police was misinformed by a family residing near the temple. The Rural SP has entrusted the Kattakada DSP with the probe into the incident. Police officials said that they received a call regarding gathering of anti-social elements near the temple. A police team that went there was reportedly confronted by the students when they were asked why they had assembled at the temple during the lockdown. The cops then took them to station without knowing that they were minors. When the cops learnt that they were Plus One students, they summoned the parents and sent them home. No case of lockdown violation was registered by the police against the students. On Monday, the parents met Kattakada DSP and filed four separate complaints against the SI, CI and other cops of Kattakada police station. Senior police officers said that a department level probe is on and a report will be submitted soon. Child rights commission chairman K V Manoj Kumar visited the children and took their statements. A cable wire was also reportedly recovered from the police vehicle. The commission has registered a case against the cops. The parents said the boys had gone to the spot to attend online classes due to poor connectivity at their homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/police-accused-of-mistreating-students/articleshow/83318863.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Fuel should come under GST, says Union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan||GANDHINAGAR: Stating that he was of the opinion that petrol and diesel should be brought under the GST regime, Union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan said it is up to the GST Council to decide whether these fuels should be brought under the Goods and Services Tax, which, many believe, would substantially bring down the prices.  The Union minister, who was in Gandhinagar on Monday, blamed the recent surge in global crude oil prices for the fuel price hike in India. Congress party staged a protest againt the Modi Government for its failure to control the fuel prices at Wardhaman Nagar Square on Central Avenue Nagpur on Monday June 07th 2021Asked about his stand to include fuel in the GST regime as a measure to give respite to citizens from the price rise, Pradhan said he agrees with the idea. “The price of this commodity is regulated by the global market. As a sector in-charge, I am of the opinion that fuel should be brought under the GST. But, it will be done only when members of the GST Council reach a consensus on it. It is the GST Council which will take a collective decision about it,” he said. “The prices of petroleum products have gone up. The main reason is that the price of crude oil has gone over USD 70 (per barrel) in the international market. This negatively impacts consumers here, as India imports 80% of its oil requirement,” he said. The minister was responding to a query raised by reporters about the recent fuel price hike. Petrol and diesel prices have witnessed a steady rise over the past few months. In Ahmedabad, petrol price rose from Rs 81.05 on January 1 this year to Rs 92.28 per litre on Monday, June 7. In the past one month, petrol price in Ahmedabad has risen by Rs 3.91. Similarly, diesel price rose from Rs 79.55 on January 1 this year to Rs 92.84 on Monday, June7. In the past one month, diesel price has risen by Rs 4.84.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fuel-should-come-under-gst-min/articleshow/83325209.cms||---

We have suggested to double the testing being carried out. Currently, around 9,000 swab samples are collected and tested every day. Doubling the tests may lead to increase in number of cases for few days, but it will certainly help in bringing down the mortality and positivity rates in the long run. All residents of hotspot villages should be tested as well,” Pawar said.With over 40% positive patients living under home isolation, the deputy chief minister said time has come to put them under institutional quarantine. “The isolation quarantine centres should be set up at schools. Those who run educational institutes, sugar mills have agreed to set up such isolation centres,” he said.Over the issue of traders demanding to allow them to open their shops, Pawar said, “The district is under level 4 of Covid restrictions. There will be no relaxation on restrictions imposed in the district.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/home-isolated-patients-must-be-moved-to-covid-units-dy-cm/articleshow/83518721.cms||---
---||Meerut||Get the jabs & reach Delhi borders, farmer leaders tell Uttar Pradesh cadres as stir against farm laws renews||BAREILLY/AGRA: With the plunge in Covid-19 cases, farmers in western Uttar Pradesh have decided to pick up where they had left off by renewing their fight against the three agriculture laws brought by the central government. The widespread protests had died down in March after the second wave of the pandemic took the country in its grips. The protest on the other side of Delhi, where farmers from Punjab are holding up, was still on -- although with lesser numbers. But the protest site at Ghazipur border was almost empty for the last two months due to Covid-19 and the restrictions imposed by the state. Two months on, the union leaders have asked the cadres and farmers of UP to reach the Delhi border points after getting Covid-19 vaccines. UP’s most prominent farmer leader Rakesh Tikait is also likely to meet West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday to discuss strategy to intensify the agitation. Farmer leaders are busy conducting meetings at several parts of the state. To begin with they want to ensure a presence of minimum 1,500 farmers at each gate of Delhi border. Bharatiya Kisan Union’s national president Naresh Tikait said, “Heatwave will not derail our resolve. After a few weeks, the monsoon will also hit the area. We have weathered bitter cold as well. So there is nothing that can deter us. We have stood against the injustice and we will continue to fight it.” National president of BKU (Swaraj), Kuldeep Pandey, said, “I don’t know why the government is not able to gauge the discontent among farmers. Now the Covid-19 cases are decreasing and farmers do not have much work in fields. In the next few days, mass movement from Agra region to Delhi borders will take place. Besides, protests will also take place at the local levels. We are conducting regular meetings to prepare an action plan. The central government has to take back the three farm laws and guarantee MSP to the farmers.” BKU has assigned targets to their district presidents to mobilize farmers. BKU leadership is holding meetings with district and divisional presidents. Besides the Delhi borders, protests are also planned at the local level. BKU’s Agra district president Rajveer Lawaniya said, “As the Covid-19 cases are on decrease, we are going to strengthen the stir against the three farm laws enforced by the central government and attempt to abolish the minimum support price. Around 5,000 BKU workers and young farmers from Agra region will be reaching UP Gate in the next few days. The protest will continue till the government does not give us our rights.” Another prominent farmer union leader Jasbir Singh Virk has called a meeting in Lakhimpur Kheri on Tuesday to discuss the next plan of action. Virk told TOI, “The Covid-19 is almost over for now. And, fortunately, it didn’t have any effect on the farmers protesting at the Delhi border. We are conducting meetings to raise voice against atrocities on farmers. We are telling them that strength lies in our unity and our presence at the protest site is important. Farmers who are vaccinated should ensure their presence on priority and ensure that a minimum 1,500 farmers are present at the protest site.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/get-the-jabs-reach-delhi-borders-farmer-leaders-tell-up-cadres-as-stir-against-farm-laws-renews/articleshow/83316355.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The group included persons who were looking to go to countries in Persian Gulf to work there as well as those related to them. The residents of Sagwada in Dungarpur district of Rajasthan had to come to Sanjeli looking for Covishield as that would ensure that they are able to go abroad. Hospital superintendent U C Lohra said that the group included eight males and 21 women. “They said that Covaxin was being used in their area. Looking for Covishield, they were able to schedule a vaccine at our hospital,” said Lohra. Lohra added that seeing others getting vaccinated, the driver of one of the vehicles used by the group to come to Sanjeli was also motivated to get a jab. According to Lohra, it is possible to book a vaccine at any vaccination centre in the country over the portal. “We also ensured that there were no hurdles in their vaccination,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/rajasthan-residents-get-vaccinated-at-sanjeli/articleshow/83318920.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra paediatric task force prepares chart, with 5 parameters to check||MUMBAI: With the focus shifting to children in the anticipated third wave of coronavirus, the state’s paediatric task force has stressed on the strengthening of two aspects mainly— effective home monitoring and timely referral to a hospital. During a virtual meet chaired by CM Uddhav Thackeray with members of the paediatric task force on Monday, it was discussed that home monitoring must be at the heart of the strategy to curtail severe cases or deaths among children due to Covid. To implement it, the experts suggested that ASHAs (accredited social health activists) and parents of affected children should be acquainted with tools such as a ‘monitoring chart’. Data from first and second waves in the state has shown than over 90% children don’t require hospitalisation and remain either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Paediatrician Dr Vijay Yewale, a member of the task force, said that a patient monitoring chart has been designed for parents and ASHAs to monitor five key parameters: temperature, pulse, respiration, oxygen saturation and urine output. The chart would have columns where caregivers or ASHAs (where a caregiver is not able to do the monitoring) will fill up twice or thrice a day. “This will help them to pick up signs of deterioration swiftly,” he said. “For instance, if the child’s oxygen saturation or urine output drops, it will be visible in the chart,” he said. Thackeray emphasised ASHA workers will have a key role to play at the time of referrals too. He said fever clinics too will have a crucial role to play. Dr Suhas Prabhu, head of the task force, said that doctors at the fever clinics could be the first point of contact for Asha workers. Depending on the child’s condition, the doctor could decide if he/she needs a paediatric Covid care hospital (PCCH) or paediatric high dependency units (HDU). The task force has suggested that the monitoring chart should be printed and distributed at all district levels. The doctors also said that it was important for children to complete 14 days in isolation even if their symptoms of fever, cold, cough subside after a few days. “As far as possible, children above the age of 2 years should be made to wear a mask and kept away from senior citizens in the house,” Dr Yewale said.  As part of its preparedness for the projected third wave, the state plans to increase the number of paediatric Covid beds to nearly 2,300 from the existing around 600. It is also creating graded healthcare facilities for management of moderate and severe Covid cases. N Ramaswami, commissioner, National Health Mission, said that the state has around 68,000 ASHA workers, who are generally acquainted with the health conditions of children in areas within their jurisdiction. Despite fears of children getting hit in the third wave, the state has maintained that the proportion of those affected below 5 years and below 18 years was in the range of 6% to 8.5% in the last six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-paediatric-task-force-prepares-chart-with-5-parameters-to-check/articleshow/83323122.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Thackeray on Monday was addressing ASHA workers, foot-soldiers of the state’s health infrastructure. Thackeray praised them for their services during the pandemic and said he was aware their issues and difficulties were yet to be resolved. “Let me assure you I have not forgotten about your issues and the government is still trying to work out a solution. The state owes you all a lot, and we will do our best for you all,” he said. Raising the issue of poor pay, Sunita Kurvade, an ASHA worker from Hingoli, who was one of the four who virtually interacted with the CM, said while they continued to work risking their lives, the Rs 2,000 honorarium they get per month should be regularised. ASHA workers said they still face hesitancy from villagers to get vaccinated and were taking steps to create awareness. Thackeray said their work has been of great value, and while they are tracing Covid-19 patients, other ailments like malnourishment should not be left undiagnosed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/asha-workers-raise-issue-of-poor-pay-in-maharashtra-cms-meet/articleshow/83323188.cms||---

It was almost a year ago when the new police station was constructed, assistant sub-inspector Jayaprasad B, who also holds the charges of PRO and Janamaithri beat officer, had the idea of initiating cultivation in the 10-15 cents of wasteland covered with weeds adjacent to the station. With an aim to utilize the land for some good cause by removing the weeds and to provide fresh and organic vegetables to the public, Jayaprasad and his colleagues set up an organic vegetable garden on the premises of the station. During their first harvest itself, they could reap vegetables much to their satisfaction. The harvest was distributed among the police officers, locals and even the complainants. Interestingly, people who visit the station to lodge complaints were given a vegetable kit along with the receipt. Over seven to ten varieties of vegetables, including chilly, tomato, cabbage, spinach, palak, ladies finger are being cultivated in this police vegetable garden with bamboo fence. For the purpose of easy irrigation, drip irrigation system has been employed. Police have also set up a fish pond on the premises of the station. “Varkala station has become the first police station to have a fish pond on its premises. Fish farming was very successful and we could cultivate and harvest ‘Silopi’ fish,” said Jayaprasad. Apart from keeping the station eco-friendly, the police station has an attractive children’s park. The compound walls of the station are filled with nearly 100 pictures carrying social awareness messages on varied issues like child labour, dowry, etc. On June 5, in connection with the World Environment Day observance the police team also set up a ‘Pachathuruthu’. As part of it, saplings of varied indigenous plants have been planted in the new green space. “Amid the tension of our job, this garden gives us great solace. All police officers in the station have joined with me in the process of cultivation. And our yields are not meant for commercial sale rather we happily give them away to the public. We too take it to our homes. We also receive support from officials of Varkala Krishi Bhavan,” said Jayaprasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cops-try-their-hand-at-organic-farming/articleshow/83318993.cms||---

The hospital is one of the oldest charitable hospitals in Vidarbha where thousands of cancer patients not only from the city, but also from the periphery are treated every year. “Although the patient turn out has reduced due to the pandemic, the cancer survival rate has increased,” said Dr BK Sharma, an honorary consultant. “Nearly 60% of the oral cancer cases used to survive for more than 5 years after treatment. This has gone up to 90% in the last few years, especially if detected early at stage one or stage 2,” said Dr Sharma. On Monday, the hospital celebrated ‘Cancer Survivors’ Day’ with 13 survivors who shared their experiences with journalists. “I was diagnosed with prostate cancer five years ago. Since then, I’m taking medicines and injections regularly and living a normal life,” said Anand Kelkar, who is in his seventies. Kavita Padole, a breast cancer survivor since six years, said many of her family members opposed her decision to opt for chemotherapy. “There are many misconceptions among people about chemotherapy and radiation. If I had gone by my family and avoided radiotherapy, I would have died in the next two years,” said Kavita. Girdhar Abarte, who had skin cancer, considers doctors like gods. Survivors from up to 4 to 10 years appealed to cancer patients to not hesitate to get treatment. “If detected early, there are chances of a cure from any kind of cancer,” said Dr Kartar Singh, director in-charge of the hospital. The hospital has several government schemes which make cancer treatment affordable to needy patients. Special vaccination camp for cancer patients A special vaccination camp has been launched at the Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj Cancer Hospital for cancer patients. Vaccination will be from 10am to 5 pm. Online registration is not needed. Immediate vaccination will be done if a cancer survivor or patient comes with the Aadhar card and medical certificate. Initially, cancer patients above 45 years of age will be administered the vaccine. In the next two weeks, all cancer patients above 18 years will get vaccines. For more information, call 0712-2744441 or 0712-2748995.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cancer-survival-rate-is-rising-in-city-experts/articleshow/83321201.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

In the last three weeks, TPR has not gone below 15% in the district. While TPR dipped slightly from 19.46% to 17.12% between June 3 and 4, it again climbed to 17.6% the next day. TPR in the district for the last two days has been 16.6% and 16.67%. In the last 14 days, the highest daily number of tests was recorded on May 26 and TPR stood above 21% that day. The number of tests dropped to 9,390 by June 1 and by Monday, it came down even further to 8,829. Officials with the district health office confounded statistics to maintain that there was no dip in number of daily tests in the district. The district did 79,909 tests in the last seven days and TPR has been 18%. With the government extending the lockdown aiming at a TPR below 10%, chances are bleak for the district to bring down the TPR any time sooner. Even with lesser number of tests, TPR remains above 15% in the district. The ICU occupancy in the Medical College, general hospital and SAT is 241 as on Monday whereas ventilator occupancy in the three hospitals is 116. Meanwhile, the district reported 1,481 positive cases on Monday. As many as 2,275 people recovered from the virus. Currently, 12,703 people are under treatment for Covid-19 in the district.

In the initial stage, the databank will contain details of all trees in the public place. The project is initiated as part of Green Vibe, a programme led by Youth Brigade that aims at protecting environment. The databank will include details of trees like its name (both in English and Malayalam), scientific name, age, geo location, picture, social and historical relevance of the tree. All kinds of information regarding the tree will be made available on the MLA’s website. Officials will also update information at regular intervals. Apart from this, without causing any harm to the tree, a QR code will be placed on trees or on objects adjacent to the trees. By scanning this QR code, the public can access information regarding the particular tree. The project will be carried out with the aid of non-governmental organizations, environmental organizations, volunteers and botany students in the constituency. Also, the team will have an expert from the expert committee formulated by the MLA during his last tenure to guide the entire developmental activities of the constituency. The authorities expect to turn this into assignments for final-year botany students. Besides, the intention to protect trees, the project also aims at ensuring an efficient disaster management system in the constituency. According to sources, the project will be completed in two to three years. In the future, to ensure more public participation, the information regarding all trees in the private properties will also be included in the databank. “To ensure that all tree saplings that we planted, including the old ones, are looked after properly, we have decided to launch this project,” said Prasanth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/plan-to-prepare-databank-of-trees-in-vattiyoorkavu/articleshow/83319020.cms||---

---||Nagpur||HC notice to Centre Point School on ousting student for fees||Nagpur: After parents moved court against a leading school that handed over a transfer certificate (TC) to their child for failure to pay the fees, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court issued notices to the school along with central and state governments.While keeping the petition for final disposal, justice Avinash Gharote directed the respondents, including secretaries of union education ministry and state school education department, besides Centre Point School (CPS) Katol Road branch, to reply within two weeks. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) secretary, deputy director of education in the city and Zilla Parishad’s (ZP) primary education officer are other respondents.Petitioners – Deepti and Sandip Agrawal -- also the president of Vidarbha Parents Association – prayed for directives to hold the school’s action in issuing TC to their son Sarthak as illegal and violative of provisions of Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, and Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011.Through their counsel Ashwin Ingole, the petitioners further demanded an inquiry into allegations against the school for recovering excess fees from all parents and also to impose costs on management for depriving the child of his education.“The contention is that the school issued TC on May 28 thereby discontinuing the petitioners’ son education without they applying for it on the ground that the fees for the session of 2020-21 were pending. A plea has been taken by their counsel that they are ready and willing to deposit the fees within a month,” justice Gharote said before adjourning the hearing.According to Agrawal, he had earlier filed a PIL in HC against all private CBSE schools for charging excess fees during Covid-19 lockdown period from last year and for discontinuing online classes of students who failed to pay them.The school told the petitioners to deposit the fees by April 23 and their son was asked to appear for the exams on April 24. Even a notice was issued to them through Google Meet that if they failed, the child’s education would be discontinued.The petitioners lodged a complaint with the deputy director on the grounds that CPS was governed by the Fee Regulation Act and can’t charge exorbitant fees. Moreover, the school didn’t allow the couple to become a member of their Parents Teachers Association (PTA) and that existing one is ‘bogus’. They also questioned the school’s move to hold exam of their son when the government had promoted all the students to next class without exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-notice-to-centre-point-school-on-ousting-student-for-fees/articleshow/83318966.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Saurabh Vijay, secretary, medical education and drugs department said the MOU will pave the way for technology transfer and several other steps in the vaccine manufacturing process. The science and technology ministry had said last week things have been set in motion for technology transfer that will allow Haffkine Biopharma to produce 22.8 crore doses of Covaxin in a year. “We are hoping to start production in eight months. Priority will be to build the biosafety level-III facility in Parel,” Vijay said, adding that Haffkine was also seeking the help of IIT-Bombay, TIFR and ICT in Matunga to build a strong technical team. Haffkine has been given a grant of Rs 65crore by the Centre and Rs 94 crore by the state for Covaxin production. Vijay said teams would travel to Hyderabad to get trained, while experts from Hyderabad and the department of biotechnology will also handhold the institute. Haffkine BioPharmaceutical is an offshoot of the 122-year-old Haffkine Institute, one of the oldest biomedical research institutes in the country. The Centre has said the current production capacity of indigenously developed Covaxin vaccine will be increased nearly six-fold by July-August 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-haffkine-inks-mou-with-bharat-biotech-to-produce-covaxin/articleshow/83323226.cms||---

According to sources, a part of the highway got blocked when huge boulders and a large amount of debris suddenly fell on the road after an overnight spell of rain, cutting off Gangotri shrine and nearly one dozen villages from the district headquarters. Soon after the landslide, the teams of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) reached the spot and launched efforts to re-open the stretch for vehicular movements. Devendra Patwal, district disaster management officer, said, “BRO workers are clearing debris from the route.

---||Nagpur||Kids and teens to be largely safe in 3rd wave?||Nagpur: Ten out of 50 children in 12-18 age group who were selected after tough scrutiny for the paediatric trial of Covaxin were found positive in antibody tests conducted hours before their vaccination. Though the sample size is very small, the high seropositivity rate indicates many children in the city might have developed the disease and recovered without experiencing any symptom. “This is an interesting indicator and needs to be studied further,” said Dr Vasant Khalatkar, principal investigator of the Covaxin paediatric trial underway at Nagpur’s Meditrina Institute of Medical Sciences. “We were surprised to find 10 teenagers out of 50 already having antibodies. That too when they were specifically selected through tough exclusion criteria,” said Dr Khalatkar. None of them had ever experienced any symptom of Covid-19. They had never stayed with a Covid-19 positive family member or elder in the last one year. “Yet, 20% of them had Covid-19 sometime in last one year without even realizing it. There could be many such children. Some might have experienced symptoms but did not get tested. We can say a considerable population in the 12-18 age group may have Covid-19 antibodies,” said Dr Sameer Paltewar, director of the Meditrina Institute. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said children must have got infection from some adult. “Children are always collateral transmission. There must be somebody who was positive in or around their family. Children generally don’t transmit amongst themselves,” he said. The only serosurvey of Nagpur district was conducted in October 2020. Children were not included in it. The district thus doesn’t have specific seropositivity data about children. It’s a well-established fact that kids under 10 are largely safe as they don’t have enough viral receptors to take the disease to a serious level. Now, with a considerable population of kids having antibodies, we can conclude that they will largely be safe, even if the projected third wave materializes. Experts agree, but have asked for further studies. “The sample is very small. But the result is definitely worth studying. We can start a serosurvey of the paediatric population on this basis,” said epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte. Doctors also said the danger of third wave and potential threat to the children can be reduced if the vaccine is made available to them and adults eligible for vaccination are immunized on a war footing in the next two months.Analysis of early trend in the city * Near 20% of teenagers from 12-18 age groups may have Covid-19 antibodies* Means, they would be safe from Covid-19 in case the third wave comes * Children in 0-10 age group have limited chance of serious/critical disease even if infected* If a vaccine for 12-18 comes in the next few days, kids may even start going to schools||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kids-and-teens-to-be-largely-safe-in-3rd-wave/articleshow/83319055.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Gujarat accounts for almost 70% of the groundnuts exported from India. The groundnut exports from the state stood at Rs 3,505 crore during the period from April 2020 to February 2021. The exports, in value terms, was up 3% from Rs 3,405 crore during the same period last year. Gujarat’s total groundnut export for the entire fiscal 2019-20 was reported at Rs 3,600 crore. The exporters received an average price of $ 1,139 per tonne for groundnuts in fiscal 2021 — which was 6% higher than $1,071 per tonne price fetched in 2019-20, the APEDA data further shows. The exports, however, was down in volume terms with India exporting 6.38 lakh tonnes as compared to 6.64 lakh tonnes in the previous financial year. As far as Gujarat is concerned, the groundnut exports in volume terms remained lower at 4.2 lakh tonne during April 2020 to February 2021 as compared to 4.5 lakh tonne during the same period last year, according to APEDA. “There was record export of groundnut oil in fiscal 2021, given an unprecedented demand for groundnut oil. As a result, peanut exports remained low,” said Sameer Shah, president, Gujarat State Edible Oils and Oil Seeds Association. The groundnut oil export from India is estimated to reach 2.25 lakh tonne in 2020-21 due to high demand from China. Gujarat accounts for almost 85% of India’s groundnut oil exports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/groundnut-exports-up-6-in-fiscal-2021/articleshow/83325265.cms||---
---||Mumbai||With nearly 95,000 jabs, Mumbai records highest single-day coverage||MUMBAI: The city recorded the highest number of vaccinations in a single day on Monday at nearly 95,000, although 75% of the doses were administered in private centres. In the past 10 days, barely 1.8 lakh people have got vaccinated at public centres compared to nearly 4.5 lakh vaccinations at private hospitals. Of the 94,941 vaccinations on Monday, only 23,418 were at civic or state-run centres. The private sector, however, grew anxious after PM Narendra Modi announced that the Centre would be procuring 75% of doses from manufacturers. He also said that hospitals can charge a maximum service fee of Rs 150. Recipients in the city are paying anywhere in the range of Rs 900 to Rs 1,200 for a shot of Covishield and Rs 1,250-Rs 1,500 for Covaxin. A hospital head said most are charging Rs 300 to Rs 600 in addition to the vaccine cost (Rs 650 for Covishield, Rs 1,200 for Covaxin) to afford logistics and manpower. “We hope there is more clarity on what he meant by that charge and whether it would apply to vaccination outside hospital premises,” he said. Joy Chakraborty, COO of PD Hinduja, said the supply in the private sector is yet to be streamlined completely. “A capping could demotivate some since it could make it unfeasible, but let’s wait for details,” he said. Another hospital head said there is no transparency on distribution in the private sector too. Maharashtra has paid over Rs 65 crore to procure 25.1 lakh vaccine doses. N Ramaswami, commissioner of National Health Mission, said the state has been supplied almost all the doses that it had paid for. BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the city has 300 public vaccination centres now, but due to shortage, most are able to inoculate only 100 people daily. “With adequate doses, we can double or triple that number and vaccinate upto a lakh a day,” he said. Thane Municipal Corporation has arranged a special ino-culation drive for Thane jail and mental hospital inmates above 45 years of age on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/with-nearly-95k-jabs-mumbai-records-highest-single-day-coverage/articleshow/83323263.cms||---
---||Kochi||Lakshadweep residents sit on hunger strike||KOCHI: Thousands of families in Lakshadweep converted the porticos of their homes into protest camps as Save Lakshadweep Forum (SLF) — formed to protest against administrator Praful K Patel and his policies in the islands — led almost the entire population of the Union territory to observe a hunger strike from 6am to 6pm on Monday. Following Covid protocols, islanders protested at their homes and images of families holding protest placards were widely circulated on social media. From children to the elderly, islanders held banners with slogans such as ‘Understand Lakshadweep’, ‘Land Owners Not Tenants’, ‘Call back Administrator’ and ‘Revoke Orders against Lakshadweep.’ The hunger strike called by SLF turned into a hartal-like situation as shops remained shut and vehicles stayed off the road. Unions of shopkeepers and auto drivers offered support for the hunger strike. Other than an argument with the police over Kavaratti Village Dweep Panchayat (VDP) members staging a dharna outside VDP office, there were no untoward incidents. SLF campaigners said there was a provocation from the police at Amini Island as some black flags were taken away by personnel. “We have done something historic today. Lakshadweep is a peaceful society and never have we conducted such a mass protest in our history. Other than little children and the elderly, who are afflicted with illnesses, everyone participated in the hunger strike. Covid patients were exempted. Other than health emergencies, no one took to the streets. The island literally came to a standstill on Monday,” said SLF convener UCK Thangal. He added that the hunger strike was a warning and next steps would be decided based on the response from the Centre. “We have, through various modes, informed the Centre about our situation. We want the administrator to be called back and another capable person posted in his place. Also, these new laws which are obviously anti-people must be revoked. A core committee meeting of SLF will be held soon and a decision will be taken on next steps,” he said. SLF was formed at an all-party meet on March 29. Over the past few days, all-party meetings were held in each island of Lakshadweep, which formed island-level branches of SLF. The proposed laws, which islanders allege are anti-people, include Draft Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Act (which envisages a ban on the sale of beef), Draft Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation 2021 (which links the decision to have more than two children with the eligibility to run in elections), the Draft Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (which is alleged to be a draconian Goonda Act in an land with low crime rate) and Draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (which gives sweeping powers to the administration over land in the islands). Meanwhile, 10 UDF MPs protested outside the Lakshadweep administration’s office in Kochi, offering solidarity with protests of the islanders. MPs, including Rajmohan Unnithan, M K Raghavan, Ramya Haridas, T N Prathapan, Hibi Eden, Dean Kuriakose, Benny Behanan, Abdussamad Samadani, E T Mohammed Basheer and Anto Antony, took part in the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dweep-residents-sit-on-hunger-strike/articleshow/83316475.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Zero Covid-19 deaths in 5 districts, 690 positive, lowest after Feb 20||NAGPUR: For the first time during Covid second wave, Vidarbha reported significantly less cases than 1,000 on Monday. Though, reduced number of tests — under 30,000 due to Sunday on June 6 — could be the major reason for this, test positivity under 2.5% is a strong indicator that conditions are improving rapidly in the region. Barring Nagpur and Amravati, all Vidarbha districts reported less than 100 cases. Six districts reported below 50 cases, including Gondia’s record drop to only 5 new cases out of more than 1,500 tests done in the last 24 hours. Also 2,173 — nearly three times of the day’s 690 new cases — recovered on Monday. Now, out of 10,89,455 total cases reported till date in Vidarbha, 10,52,918 have recovered. Overall recovery rate is 96.6%, which is higher than state and national average. Almost every district in Vidarbha has 95% and more recovery rate now. The number of Covid deaths on Monday was 27, one more than yesterday’s lowest 26. However, five districts — Bhandara, Gondia, Gadchiroli, Yavatmal and Washim — reported zero Covid casualties on Monday, which could be considered as a great relief factor because these districts are rural dominated. Nagpur district registered 8 Covid deaths, 5 of them from city, and 3 of the patients coming from other states. Nagpur rural reported zero deaths once again. With more patients recovering daily, the number of under-treatment patients has gone down to 15,157 now. This comes to less than 1.5% of the total cases reported till date. Overall, less patients are hospitalized and most districts in the region have enough vacant beds, which is an important parameter to decide the further unlock level. Bhandara: The district conducted 1,256 tests in the last 24 hours and only 14 of them tested positive. While 100 patients recovered in the day, no Covid death was reported in Bhandara for the 3rd consecutive day. Now, the district has total 59,212 cases, 57,423 recoveries, 1,055 deaths and 734 patients under treatment. The recovery rate of Bhandara is 97%. Gondia: Only 5 out of 1,542 samples tested in Gondia in the last 24 hours were positive, which indicates near zero test positivity in the district, which is already in level 1 of unlock policy. No Covid death was reported in Gondia too. 12 patients recovered in the day. Now, out of total 40,947 patients, 39,921 have recovered at 97.5% recovery rate. Total 333 patients are under treatment, with 271 of them in home isolation. Chandrapur: There were 63 new detections and 171 recoveries on Monday, leaving 1,460 patients under treatment. The day also witnessed six deaths lifting the Covid toll to 1,485. Covid caseload has now climbed to 83,649, whereas total recoveries to 80,704. Amravati: With just 208 new cases and five deaths, the district posted a reassuring picture on Monday. The Covid caseload is now 94,289, while the toll 1,506. With 439 persons getting discharge, total recoveries have went up to 89,599 for a recovery rate of 95.03%. The number of patients under treatment is now 3,184. Yavatmal: The district reported zero Covid casualty on Monday, which also marked the first day of the unlock from the prolonged Covid restrictions. Another highlight of the day was 27 new cases were detected against 81 recoveries. Of the 2,963 test reports received in the day, 27 (18 men and 9 women) were found positive. Currently there are 763 patients — 313 in hospitals and 450 in home quarantine — under treatment. Of the 72,419 total patients, 69,877 including 81 reported on Monday have recovered. The test positivity rate is 11.13% and the death rate is at 2.46%. The daily positivity rate has dipped to 0.91%. Wardha: The district registered 20 Covid cases on Monday out of 1,049 test reports. The caseload thus reached 48,828 and recoveries to 46,753 after 189 were discharged. Currently, 770 patients are under treatment. Three men (aged 54, 68 and 74) from Wardha died due to coronavirus during treatment, taking the Covid toll to 1,305. The new cases reported include Hinganghat 9, Wardha 6, Arvi and Karanja 1 each and 3 from other districts. Gadchiroli: As the number of patients is reducing, contact tracing has also got limited in districts like Gadchiroli. Only 221 tests were done in the last 24 hours. Out of them, 24 tested positive. On the other hand, 95 patients recovered. No death was reported in Gadchiroli too. Now, the district has 422 patients under treatment. The district’s Covid caseload has reached 29,664 and recoveries to 28,515. Akola: Only 42 new cases were detected in Akola on Monday, lowest in the second wave, so far, despite conducting over 1,300 tests. Akola’s test positivity is also reducing now. On the other hand, 308 patients recovered. Two deaths were reported in the day. Now, Akola has 56,704 total cases, 53,092 recoveries and 1,104 deaths. Total 2,508 patients are under treatment. Buldhana: The district reported 97 new cases after conducting 2,208 tests on Monday. This took total cases in Buldhana to 85,619. With 190 patients recovered in the day, total 84,113 have defeated the virus. Three deaths were reported, taking the Covid toll to 633. Now, 865 patients are under treatment in Buldhana. Washim: The district reported 56 new cases out of nearly 2,000 tests conducted in the last 24 hours. Now, Washim has total 40,672 cases of Covid-19.

---||Delhi||CBSE asks schools to complete XII practicals via online mode only||New Delhi: The schools that have Class XII practicals and internal assessment pending have been asked to complete them only through the online mode. The Central Board of Secondary Education has also extended the time for these institutions to upload the marks to June 28. The circular issued by the board on Monday said, “It has been observed that some schools have not been able to complete the school-based assessment in various subjects due to the pandemic. Those schools will be allowed to complete the pending practicals and internal assessment now only in the online mode.” Many schools in different cities are reported to have been calling children to the schools for the completion of the practical assignments. The government schools in the city haven’t yet completed the practical assignments. Most private schools, in contrast, completed the practicals in the offline mode before the schools closed again. For the conduct of practical exams or project evaluation where the external examiner is appointed by CBSE, such a person nominated as external examiner will decide the date of examination in consultation with internal examiners and conduct it online. In the subjects where the external examiner isn’t appointed, the school’s subject teacher will conduct the internal assessment in online mode, based on the instructions given in the curriculum and will upload the marks awarded to the link provided by CBSE. It will be a viva voce. “The internal examiners will share the date of examination with students, preferably well in advance, and on the day of exam share the link of the online meeting with the external examiner and students. The conduct of assessment will be as per the norms given in the curriculum,” the circular added. CBSE has also instructed the internal examiner to take an on-screen photograph of each student during the viva voce and maintain it for the school records. “This photograph should have the picture of the external examiner and the student or be a recording of the entire session. However, the policy of uploading the group photo has been suspended due to the pandemic,” the circular said. No extension of the last date for providing marks beyond June 28 will be allowed. The schools have been strictly advised to complete the evaluation process by that date. With the Class XII board exams being cancelled, the marks of the internal assessment and practicals will probably play an important part in the eventual assessment that is being decided by a CBSE committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cbse-asks-schools-to-complete-xii-practicals-via-online-mode-only/articleshow/83321526.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||NMC: Fortnightly testing must for ‘superspreaders’ like delivery boys, shop staff||Nagpur: To ensure continuation of unlock regulations, and prevent rise in Covid-19 positive cases and deaths, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has come up with an action plan. The civic body has made Covid-19 testing mandatory for all ‘possible superspreaders’ — owners, staffers of essential, non-essential shops, restaurants, hotels, lawns, hawkers, vendors, home delivery boys etc once every fortnight.The state government had allowed total normalcy in cities and districts with weekly test positivity rate (TPR) below 5% and less than 25% occupancy of oxygen beds. Accordingly, the district has resumed various activities from Monday and increased timings of essential and non-essential shops till 5pm, and allowed restaurants, hotels, and bars up to 10pm. NMC and Zilla Parishad (ZP) will have to maintain both these parameters for continuation of relaxations. The government will calculate parameters every Thursday and decision on relaxation or restrictions will be taken on Friday.Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “Testing of staffers of commercial establishments has been made must once in 15 days. We will help them in testing. We have allowed their testing at our centres free of cost. This will ensure continuation of high number of tests and contain any outbreak before it spreads.”Apart from fewer positive cases, high number of tests is required to keep weekly TPR low.Radhakrishnan said special testing camps will be continued at housing societies, flat schemes and residential areas where cases come to fore. “I held a meeting with officials of all ten zones on Monday and directed to expedite tracing and testing of all contacts of positive patients,” he said.Guardian minister Nitin Raut on Monday held a meeting with representatives of associations related to shops, markets, restaurants, hotels, industries etc.“Hotels, restaurants, marriage lawns, halls, resort, farm houses etc should not turn into hotspots. Therefore, all these establishments should resume only after vaccination of all staffers. All owners should ensure compliance of all guidelines by staffers and consumers at these establishments,” he said.Raut added, “Marriage ceremonies turned into hotspots last year. We lost many people in second wave. We should not forget second wave. We should ensure all follow guidelines to prevent third wave. Entry of staffers and consumers should be restricted if they have any symptoms.”Raut added, “The administration is doing its job. Cooperation of all people in the district is must. We have to keep cases low to ensure continuation of unlocking period. People in large numbers are facing financial crisis due to lockdown and restrictions. Therefore, we all should not let situation deteriorate from here.”Sportsperson Jitesh Sedani said, “The authorities have allowed saloons, spas, gyms, restaurants, hotels, bars etc, which operate indoors. When it comes to sports, only outdoor activities have been permitted. Outdoor sports, especially badminton, has been restricted as per orders issued a day ago. Already, the players missed regular practice and fitness since long. Therefore, NMC and ZP should also allow indoor sports activities.”Gathering of five or more people has been restricted after 5pm. But the police are reportedly finding it difficult to implement it with opening of restaurants, bars etc till 10pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-fortnightly-testing-must-for-superspreaders-like-delivery-boys-shop-staff/articleshow/83319127.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Data shows nearly 8,800 beneficiaries in the 18-44 group got their first doses of Covaxin between May 6 and 8. But their second-dose coverage has been slow, with an average of 1,500 shots daily over the last few days. Overall, between May 5 and 11, nearly 17,000 adults were given their first Covaxin doses. Many of them have now completed the four-week interval between doses and as per guidelines, a Covaxin second shot should come four to six weeks after the first. The civic bodies here had recently restarted vaccinations for the 18-44 group, after stopping drives at their centres in mid-May due to shortages. The restarted drives were only for second Covaxin doses. The PMC had said 60% of second Covaxin doses for the 18-44 group would be set aside for those booking slots online. The rest would be for walk-ins. But citizens said the number of centres offering second Covaxin doses for the 18-44 group is limited. On Monday, the PMC had 16 centres (for 18-44s) offering 100 Covaxin second doses each. In Pimpri Chinchwad, the PCMC had none. Paresh Joglekar, who completed his interval along with his wife a few days ago, said they have been trying to find a slot on CoWIN. “On Monday, I tried to walk into a couple of civic-run sites in Aundh. But they were teeming with people — all walk-ins for a Covaxin second shot. At one of the units, there were nearly 200 people in the queue before me. I didn’t stand a chance,” Joglekar said, adding the line had formed as early as 5.30am. Neeraj Shinde (39), who got his first Covaxin dose a month ago, said he can no longer rely on CoWIN to find a slot. He said, “Even when slots show green, I get a pop-up saying the centre is booked. When I go back to the list of centres, some centres show as green, but I’m still not able to book a slot. It has been an extremely frustrating experience.” Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said vaccine supply to the region is likely to improve from June 21 as per Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on Monday. “Those who took their first Covaxin shot on May 1 will be eligible for their second dose up to June 15. So they need not worry even if the 28-day period after the first has passed. We got ample Covaxin doses recently. Most of them are being used for second doses,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/thousands-await-covaxin-2nd-shot-amid-slow-coverage/articleshow/83323297.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Mumbai||100th hike in price of fuels in Mumbai since lockdowns began||MUMBAI: The metropolis on Monday experienced its 100th incremental hike in fuel prices since April 2020 when the first lockdown began, sources in the oil industry said. Petrol in Mumbai is now inching closer to Rs 102 while diesel is nearing Rs 94, both the highest rates recorded ever. The maximum hikes over the last 14 months came in June 2020 when prices went up 19 times, sources said. Despite sales dipping as demand weakened during lockdowns, prices have stayed high on the back of repeated hikes in central excise and state’s value added tax (VAT). Nearly 70% of the retail price comprises taxes. With global crude prices climbing in the same period due to cuts in production by oil-producing nations, the central government has blamed international trends for the domestic surge. Motorists and transporters of essential and non-essential goods have borne the brunt. Cost per km for a petrol driven car has gone up 31.5% in a year, from around Rs 4.75 to over Rs 6.25. "You are now paying Rs 25 more for a litre of petrol now then in May last year. So for a full tank, you are paying Rs 875 more this June than what you paid last year," said a Petrol Dealers Association member. Price of petrol in Mumbai was hiked on Monday to Rs 101.57 while diesel rose to a new all-time high of Rs 93.64 a litre. Prices in Thane and Navi Mumbai were Rs 101.66 and Rs 93.72 for petrol and diesel respectively. Parbhani is where it is costliest in Maharashtra at Rs 103.88 while diesel has peaked in Amravati at Rs 95.10. Across the state, all pumps sell petrol at over Rs 100 and diesel over Rs 90. Transporters say the cascading inflationary impact on essentials cannot be understated. Ravi Shinde of the Petrol Dealers Association said: “The ever increasing burden of working capital without increase in dealer margin for the last four years has literally broken our back. Any hike in petrol or diesel does not benefit pump owners significantly.” In Maharashtra, VAT and surcharge on petrol rose Rs 11.20 per litre between August 2014 and now. Central excise duty rose by Rs 24.32 per litre between 2014 and 2021. Maharashtra earns over Rs 25,000 crore annually from VAT on fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/100th-hike-in-price-of-fuels-in-mumbai-city-since-lockdowns-began/articleshow/83323362.cms||Somit Sen

As many as 429 devices like mobile phones, modems, hard disks, memory cards, laptops and computers were seized. ADGP (headquarters) and nodal officer for Cyberdome Manoj Abraham said that many of the videos and pictures –– child sex abusive material (CSAM) –– in the devices appear to be of local children between five and 16 years of age. He said that among the arrested are tech-savvy youths with good jobs who could use all kinds of encrypted handles to upload and download the materials. Some are suspected to be involved in the trafficking of children also as there are many chats to this effect in their devices, he said. As many as 477 locations were identified throughout the state after constant electronic surveillance, and a covert operation named P-HUNT_21.1, was planned. The information collected was passed on to 310 teams under the district police chiefs. The teams comprised of cyber cell members, technical experts and women police. The raids were carried out under the supervision of the district police chiefs. The CCSE team had been identifying the persons downloading and uploading CSAMs from the internet. The IP addresses were collected using specialized software and persons sharing such pictures on social media handles were traced using different tools. Reports received from other specialised agencies were also analysed. Many Telegram and WhatsApp groups such as Kids Videos, Adholokam, Anikhafans, Incesto 17, Real Girls, Girls and Boys chat group, Only kids videos, Teenporn, Ammayi, Sukhalokam, Bigmelon etc, with more than 500 members each, were identified and listed out. ADGP Manoj Abraham said that details of others involved in circulating these images and videos are being collected. “Strong action will be taken against them, continuing with our policy of zero tolerance in these matters,” he said. The India Child Protection Fund (ICPF) also had provided the technical expertise and resources to detect these online crimes. The state police’s CCSE unit, focusing on preventing online child exploitation and child pornography on the net, constituted in January 2019. Viewing, distributing or storing any child pornographic content is a criminal offense and can result in imprisonment up to five years and a fine up to Rs 10 lakh. The state police have urged the public who comes across any channels or groups that spread child sex-related content, to inform Hi Tech Crime Enquiry Cell, Cyberdome or cyber cells at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/28-arrested-in-crackdown-against-child-pornography/articleshow/83316521.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Vidarbha’s first black fungus patient spent Rs 1.5 crore for new life||NAGPUR: What began with contracting Covid ended up with a permanent scar on their minds and faces. TOI talked to four patients of mucormycocis or the black fungus whose eyes or facial bones were removed. Some of them tried to put up a brave face as they await reconstructive surgery to be done in the coming days to remove disfigurement. For patients whose eyes were removed, the loss is permanent and all they can get is just an artificial eye. Navin Paul, 46, is perhaps the first patient of mucormycosis in Vidarbha or even Central India, say doctors. Paul, a state government employee, had contracted Covid in September and soon had problems in his teeth and eye. Read AlsoBlack fungus: Patna hospitals run short of beds, injectionWith a significant rise in the number of mucormycosis or black fungus cases in the state, it has become a nightmare for patients to find beds in hospitals. Despite the allotment of additional beds in government-run hospitals and private health facilities, many patients are being turned away.At that time the black fungus was new to the doctors. Paul began complaining of the symptoms in October. In February, he was operated upon and an eye was removed. In all, Paul spent Rs 1.48 crore for his treatment. He was treated at six hospitals and underwent nearly 13 surgical procedures before his left eye was removed. Paul got Rs 1 crore from the Railways where his wife is an employee. He had to make arrangements for the remaining Rs 48 lakh. “I was prepared for it. I told the doctors that they can remove my eye if it saves my life,” Paul told TOI. He was detected with Covid in September but returned from the hospital in a few days. Soon, he developed problems in his teeth and eye. “I was first admitted to a neurology hospital in the city. From there I was referred to an eye hospital in Hyderabad. After brief stays in both the places, I was back to another hospital in Nagpur. From there I was asked to go to a corporate hospital in Mumbai,” says Paul. He ran out of funds at the Mumbai hospital where he was charged Rs19 lakh. He sought discharge and came back to Nagpur where finally, his one eye was removed at a private hospital. Read AlsoSeven of 26 mucormycosis patients in Ghaziabad have white fungus tooWhite fungus was detected in the patients — aged 30-50 years — after their nasal tissues were sent for histo-pathological examination. While four of them are admitted to the clinic, three are being treated through OPD checkups. Officials in the clinic said they had informed the health departmentPaul says he’s happy that his life was saved. The operation has left a hollow in his face and eye. “Sometimes, while eating, the food enters the hole where I used to have my eye,” he says. The problem will be eventually solved with a prosthetic, say doctors. “At that time, mucormycosis had not come into the limelight and even doctors did not have much experience. Since it was a rare disorder which occurred in persons with severely suppressed immunity, initially, none thought that it could be the fungus and continued with the line of treatment according to best of the judgment,” said Dr Ashish Kamble, one of the eye surgeons treating mucor patients. “He was perhaps the first patient of mucormycosis in the region and I was the last doctor to have operated him. The patient had undergone a number of procedures before,” says Dr Vipin Dehane, who has performed a number of surgeries after Paul’s. “He is inconsolable. Suddenly in the afternoon he started weeping and said he was better dead. I told him that his family needs him. We are happy your life has been saved even if your eyes have gone,” says Vaishali, wife of Nilesh Bende from Darwa in Yavatmal. In his late thirties, Nilesh, father of a seven-year-old, had got a job as a private security guard at the women and child development department. His wife Vaishali is a central government employee. “The loss of his eyes has left him broken. He can no longer go back to his job, even his salary for the previous months has not been paid,’ says Vaishali. First, Nilesh’s one eye was removed and 10 days later, the other one. Tears started rolling from his one eye when doctors said even that will have to be removed,” she says. “I have told him that the vision of one of the eyes can be restored in the coming days as technology advances. I know he is not going to see again but I had to lie to keep his hopes alive.” says Vaishali. Read AlsoRajasthan: 27% of black fungus patients were Covid positive at time of diagnosisMucormycosis, also known as black fungus, is not a post-Covid complication completely. At least 27% admitted patients diagnosed with mucormycosis were Covid positive and hadn’t recovered when they contracted the ailment.Nilesh was operated by Dr Kamble and others. He was struck by Covid in March. With no symptoms, he remained quarantined at home. After a couple of weeks, he felt discomfort and got a RTPCR done again, and was tested positive. He was put up at a Covid Care Centre in Yavatmal where he lost vision in one eye. The family has spent Rs 20 lakh, part of which was funded by selling a house. Nilesh was not in a position to talk. Akola’s Ajay Shimpikar and Subodh Kasulkar were both operated by Dr Dehane for removal of facial bones. Very little can be known about the jaw bones that were removed from the pictures shared. “That was due to deft surgery. The inner part of the face was operated, it does not leave any impression externally,” said Dr Dehane. Both patients can undergo reconstructive surgeries to regain their normal looks. “Please tell me if it’s not clear. My speech has been hampered due to the operation,” says Kasulkar, a lawyer from Chandrapur. He sounded normal on phone. “It’s worse than cancer. I’m looking like an old man,” he says as he waits for the reconstructive surgery. Kasulkar tested Covid positive in October and while undergoing treatment, his sugar levels shot up to 500. He finally ended up with the fungal infection. He thanks the doctors for saving his eyes. Ajay’s brother, who received the call, said he was prepared for the surgery and has remained strong ever since. He had Covid in March which was followed by murcormycosis. Ajay works in Mahagenco. The family has spent Rs 20 lakh for the treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/black-fungus-brings-dark-future-for-some/articleshow/83319103.cms||Shishir Arya

The involvement of Jaish Ul Hind and its involvement in demand of money needs deeper probe regarding terrorist involvement,” the NIA said in its plea. Among grounds to seek the extension, the agency cited delays in investigation and recording statements of witnesses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown and extensive electronic data that needs to be analysed by experts. The NIA’s deadline to file the chargesheet comes to an end on June 10. If a chargesheet is not submitted within the stipulated period, the accused can be granted bail. The accused in the case are likely to be produced on Tuesday and arguments will subsequently be made on the plea. Waze was arrested on March 13 in connection with probe into the recovery of explosives from an SUV parked near Ambani’s south Mumbai residence on February 25. The murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran is alleged to be connected to the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bomb-scare-case-nia-seeks-90-more-days-to-file-chargesheet-in-mumbai/articleshow/83319178.cms||---

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting convened by forests and wildlife minister A K Saseendran here on Monday. The probe will be conducted by the principal chief conservator of forests (vigilance). The mass felling of rosewood trees worth crores of rupees had taken place by misinterpreting a government order that was issued on October 24, 2020, which allowed farmers to fell the trees which they had planted in land assigned to them under the Kerala Land Assignment Rules, 1964, and those which have naturally grown in the land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-to-probe-into-illegal-tree-felling-in-wayanad/articleshow/83316551.cms||---

By 2pm, officials of the water resources department (WRD) and fire and emergency services personnel managed to control the situation and clear the road. WRD officials said that the breach in the canal will be repaired within a week’s time. Further, they said that water supply to the water treatment plant at Chandel will be unaffected. Locals claimed that due to the breach in the canal, the main Kasarvarne-Chandel road was blocked from 10am to 2pm. “Officials came to inspect the situation, but left without putting any concrete measures in place. There has been damage to cashew plantations,” said one local. But officials said they received information about the incident only between 12-12.15pm. Fire and emergency services personnel rushed to the spot and managed to clear the road within one-and-a-half-hours. All debris was completely cleared by 6pm. Officials assured that an earthmoving machine would be deployed during a dry spell to clear any debris left in the affected cashew plantations. The canal is located around 15m away from the road. Due to the breach, water gushed on to the road through the plantations, but no damage to the trees was witnessed, WRD executive engineer MK Prasad said. He said that as part of the pre-monsoon works, debris from the canals is cleared annually. But a small hole appears to have occurred, which went unnoticed. “There is a culvert at this spot below the canal and water entered the culvert through a small hole. As water started following through this hole, it took away earth with it and the hole got bigger. This breach occurred in the right bank main canal of Tillari. We will be taking up repair work immediately,” said Prasad. “The breach won’t affect supply to the Chandel water treatment plant and there is no irrigation demand at present. The reinstatement will be complete within six to seven days,” Prasad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tillari-canal-breach-leaves-road-plantations-flooded-in-kasarvarne/articleshow/83323299.cms||---

The five-year-old trees had been planted on both sides of the highway in lieu of compensatory tree plantation during road widening. NHAI project director NL Yeotkar said, “Instead of chopping dangerous branches, trees were cut outright near Gumthala section. The trees were felled on June 4 by MSEDCL contractor, and we have also lodged a police complaint with Kamptee police, who reluctantly accepted our complaint.” NC Amzare, superintending engineer, MSEDCL (Rural), said, “I had visited the spot after the complaint and not all trees have been chopped. Only branches of most trees falling on the power lines were cut, as they trip power supply during monsoons.” Amzare said, “The trees that have been affected were planted just below the power lines. These trees should have been planted at least 10 feet away from the power lines. Yet, we will compensate all the damaged trees by planting double the number of trees felled.” Earlier, on May 8, over 100 trees were turned into stumps on NH-7 Kamptee Road under the garb of cutting branches. Prior to that, several trees were chopped mercilessly on NH-69 near Saoner. “NHAI is always criticized for not planting trees in lieu of felled ones for road widening. Now, when the tree plantation is being taken seriously, MSEDCL is pouring cold water on the efforts of highway authority,” said Yeotkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/instead-of-branches-msedcl-fells-more-nhai-trees/articleshow/83290090.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The ‘dip’ is possibly due to the ‘Sunday effect’ of fewer workforce resulting in fewer tests; only 1.8 lakh tests were conducted on Sunday as against 2.5 lakh plus conducted on weekdays. The state added 154 deaths, the lowest in 69 days since March 30 (139), and 186 old deaths were added to the cumulative toll. With this, the total caseload of the state rose to 58.4 lakh and fatalities touched 1,00,470. In Mumbai, however, the weekend for the first time had no effect on the testing numbers as 28,076 tests were carried out as is usually done on weekdays. The daily detections (730) were below 800 for the second day in a row. The daily test positivity, for the first time in the second wave, dropped to 2.6%. BMC officials said more tests were conducted this Sund-ay as many people in the service sector got themselves tested ahead of the unlocking on Monday. “Many shopkeers called th-eir staff to clean the premises and may have got them tested too,” said a BMC doctor. “Also, due to the relaxation of restrictions, there were more crowds and we were able to conduct our rapid testing programme.” Dr Shashank Joshi of the state Covid task force said it is reassuring that the second wave has declined in Mumbai, but there is still a need for caution. “If we are reckless in not following Covid-appropriate behaviour this time too, the third wave will inevitably follow. While it is most likely in September, failure to adhere to the norms could hasten its arrival,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtras-daily-cases-fall-to-90-day-low-city-detections-below-800-for-2nd-day-in-row/articleshow/83323339.cms||Malathy Iyer

However, Meerut, Lucknow and Gorakhpur continue to face lockdown with 898, 777 and 623 active cases, respectively. The relaxed norms came into effect in Saharanpur, which witnessed a decline in active cases to 537, on Monday. Of the three districts still under lockdown, Meerut registered the highest number of cases. But health officials here believe that lockdown will be lifted within a day or so. District surveillance officer, Meerut, Dr Ashok Talyan said, “The new cases have come down drastically. There are only 31 new cases now and recovery rates are good. On Monday, there were 300 recoveries which means one more day for the lockdown to be relaxed, when the number of active cases will fall below 600 from the current 898.” On May 30, the UP government had relaxed the Covid-19 lockdown in 55 of the total 75 districts in the state. Since then, it has been extended to other districts with the number of active cases falling below 600. According to state government directions, in the districts below 600 active cases, the curbs will be eased - allowing shops and markets to remain open for five days (Monday to Friday) from 7 am to 7 pm. But malls, clubs, gyms will remain closed. Besides, the night curfew and weekend curfew will continue to be in force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/with-898-active-cases-lockdown-to-continue-in-meerut/articleshow/83316587.cms||---

Apart from this, the ‘auspicious dates’ window is due to end in mid-June and the proverbial final nail in the coffin will be the onset of monsoons which play spoilsport for open-air events. Technically, all banquet halls and lawns can operate at full capacity under level one of the unlocking guidelines which is a huge respite to the severely-hit wedding celebrations industry.Dilip Kamdar, director of Naveidhyam Hospitality, which manages a couple of banquet halls, said, “June 15 is the last day for ‘auspicious’ dates, so there will be a massive fall in the number of weddings. With just 100 people being allowed, it will be very difficult for all stakeholders to manage as fixed expenses remain the same.”Nitin Gopalani, director of Ramesons Hotel, said the weather for the next two months is not favourable for their business. “Large guest bookings are usually done for open lawns but no one will risk it with monsoons just round the corner. So one section (lawns) of the hotels is already out of contention for any business. And we can’t even cover the area up with some temporary shed because then it’s counted as a banquet hall,” said Gopalani.Vinod Kanakdande, secretary of Nagpur Halls and Lawns’ Association, said while the government’s decision to unlock is welcome, it has come pretty late in the day. Kanakdande said, “Frankly, this year’s wedding season is gone and so, for us the government’s decision has come too late in the day. The benefits of this decision will be visible only from September onwards when monsoons recede and the wedding season again starts to come back. Our lawn owner members hardly do any business during monsoon so now they have to hold on for a few more months. The worst part is that there will always be anxiety that after three months of unlocking, we might again see restrictions being put.”At the same time, hospitality industry can’t afford to outright refuse any booking. Micky Arora, director of Hotel Centre Point said “For the last one year the hospitality industry has suffered the most, so the point of view will be that ‘something is better than nothing’. Many weddings had been put on hold due to the restrictions since March and auspicious dates are running out fast. So they will obviously try to get over the ceremony, with reduced guests, as early as possible. And our industry does take all safety measures, hence I am confident that from the current 100 we will be bumped up to 200 or so soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-unlocking-cheers-for-lawn-owners-as-monsoon-weddings-are-not-viable/articleshow/83319154.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: ‘Diabetes, steroids, ICU stay might not be reason for mucor’||HYDERABAD: A cursory analysis of mucormycosis cases landing up at Telangana’s nodal centres, has put a question mark on previous theories floated around the ailment. While it had so far been believed that mucormycosis has a strong link to long-term steroid use, ICU stay and oxygen treatment, doctors at the Government ENT Hospital, Koti, say that a sizeable number of patients do not fall under this category. “Nearly 30% of them that we have treated have not undergone oxygen therapy, ICU stay or taken steroids. In fact, most of them recovered from Covid-19 through home quarantine,” said Dr Manish Gupta, resident medical officer at the hospital adding that a detailed analysis of cases is currently underway. As part of it, factors like diabetes, use of steroids, duration of hospital stay, other co-morbidities and vaccination status, among patients at the hospital, are being studied thoroughly. At present, doctors say, nearly 50% of the patients suffering from mucormycosis have denovo diabetes (new diabetes) which sets in during the treatment of Covid-19. This junks the theory which suggests that patients with high uncontrolled diabetes, prior to Covid-19, are found developing the fungal infection. “We have also seen cases where the patient had no previous history of diabetes, hospital stay or any other comorbidity. There are many cases among 30 to 40-year-olds who are otherwise healthy. It is possible that these factors don’t have a major role to play in this disease,” said a senior doctor from the Gandhi Hospital. In fact, while the advisory of the Centre as well as state, stressing the need for sterilised water in flow meters used in oxygen beds, stems from the understanding that this water used is responsible for the spread of the virus, doctors feel otherwise. Many believe that it is the mutant variant of the Covid-19 virus that’s responsible for mucormycosis. “Rather than factors like diabetes, ICU stay etc, it is the mutation of the virus and the circulating variant during the second wave that is causing these cases,” said Dr Gupta — a theory seconded by others dealing with these cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/diabetes-steroids-icu-stay-might-not-be-reason-for-mucor/articleshow/83321810.cms||Amrita Didyala

The children’s father had died a year ago. Forty-year-old Laxmi, who tested positive some time ago, died in Sirigiripally village on Sunday. Soon after the death of her husband Yadaiah, Laxmi was working as a daily wage labourer to make ends meet. Her son Satish chips in with meagre earnings after joining as a helper to a mechanic. Sathish has four sisters — Anusha (17), Ashwini (16), Spandana (13) and Menaka (11). While Anusha has completed her class 10, Aswini is now in 10th standard. The other girls are in different classes. A teacher from Hanamkonda has come forward to take care of the education of one of the girls. A pall of gloom descended on the village following the death of Laxmi. Village sarpanch C Chandramohan Reddy, former sarpanch Satyanarayana and leaders in the village urged the government to come to the children’s aid. “The entire village is saddened and concerned for the family,” Chandramohan, who brought the matter to the notice of finance minister T Harish Rao, told TOI. On Monday, Gajwel Area Development Authority special officer A Muthyam Reddy visited the family and handed over financial assistance to them. “We have represented that the orphaned children be allotted a 2bhk house by the government. We also want their education to be taken care of in the KG to PG government institutions,” Chandramohan said. Meanwhile, two other children who were orphaned, got help from Medak MP Kotha Prabhakar Reddy who met them on Sunday at the instance of ministers KT Rama Rao and Harish Rao. The boy and his sister lost their parents who were unwell. A local from Siddipet Chenna Raju tweeted about the plight of two children of Deepayampally village in Doultabad mandal in Medak district. The children set up a tent with a tarpaulin sheet and were staying in it after the demise of their parents. Apart from handing over financial help, the MP promised to fund their education and help construct a house for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/woman-falls-victim-to-virus-help-sought-for-5-orphaned-children/articleshow/83321934.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Hyderabad||Covid-19: In third wave preparation, Telangana govt ramps up health infra for children||HYDERABAD: With reports emerging of a possible Covid-19 third wave impacting children, health officials have started preparation to tackle the surge by increasing bed capacity and oxygen supply as they estimate 10,000 young people may need active treatment. All district hospitals will have separate paediatric wards. The officials have reportedly prepared a 15-point agenda on the possible third wave scenario. According to estimates, there are 40 lakh children below five years of age in the state. Under the pulse polio programme, 36 lakh children were covered recently. There are another 90 lakh children below 14 years. For paediatric care, children up to 14 years would be considered. Though there is no clear estimate on how many children might be impacted, government sources said it would be better to prepare facilities to handle 0.02% of the paediatric population. The sources said they don’t have any model, but expect that if third wave happens and hits children, then 10,000 young ones might need active treatment and among them 5,000 oxygen-based treatment. The state government has also constituted an expert committee, with doctors drawn from Niloufer Hospital and Gandhi Hospital, to suggest and prepare for the treatment of the paediatric population. Increasing bed and oxygen supply capacity would be the main focus for the third wave. Children’s hospital Niloufer has 1,000 beds now, in addition another 1,500 beds would be created. There is also a proposal to use paediatric beds available in neighbouring MNJ Cancer Hospital. In addition to these facilities, district hospitals would have paediatric wards with oxygen beds. There is also a proposal to run integrated call centre for parents in the state apart from the existing one. When contacted, director of medical education (DME) Dr K Ramesh Reddy said: “The government is focusing on improving paediatric care in the state. There is no need to panic. Limited percentage of the infected children may need hospitalisation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-3rd-wave-prep-t-ramps-up-health-infra-for-children/articleshow/83321902.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

He also said that GHRDC will become one of the biggest corporations in the next five years in terms of generating employment opportunities. Security guards should study further and improve on their level of education, the chief minister said at the passing out ceremony of GHRDC security personnel. “If someone is SSCE pass, then he can complete HSSCE and even they can do graduation externally. We have Goa board, Goa University and there are also universities outside the state to improve on the level of education,” he said. Sawant said that if the security guards maintain their physical fitness, then they can even join Goa police. The chief minister said that the corporation’s aim was to provide regular jobs for those who have not been able to get education. He told the security personnel to work with dedication and sincerity for progress. “After probation, they will be regularised in service. Most of the people think that this is a temporary post,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hr-corp-staff-may-get-jobs-in-police-cm/articleshow/83323368.cms||---

After witnessing the tragedy, the family members moved to a house in neighbourhood to avoid falling prey to the disease. Those who died of Covid included 67-year-old Nirmal Singh, who ran a utensils’ shop near Kamal Chowk, 36-year-old Balwinder Singh, who was the youngest of the three sons of Nirmal and ran a tyre shop in Rumi village, and Nirmal’s daughter-in-law Manpreet Kaur (wife of his son Harwinder Singh). Nirmal died on May 20 at a private hospital in Jagraon, his son died two days prior on May 18 at home and his daughter-in-law on May 16 at a private hospital in Ludhiana. “We don’t know how our family members contracted the disease, but they died in quick succession. It is shocking to lose three of my family suddenly. After we came to know that they had Covid, we vacated the house, got it sanitised and shifted to a vacant house. All our family members later got themselves tested twice, but no one was positive. No one from the government came to see us,” said Kulwinder Singh, son of Nirmal Singh and elder brother of Balwinder. “Even now we don’t meet people and those whom we meet we advise them to take extra care as Covid is a serious disease,” he added. Manpreet Singh, nephew of Nirmal Singh, said, “Balwinder, who was unmarried, was obese and had breathing problem. Others didn’t have major health issues. The loss of my uncle is a big one. Manpreet Kaur leaves behind a two-month-old son and two daughters aged five and seven. After this traumatising experience, the family refused to leave home. The government should communicate with them and help them.” Social groups also demand that the government should compensate such families. “The government should help families that have lost their members to Covid. It is devastating for them,” said Sanjeev Kumar Bansal, secretary of a social organization.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/dont-lower-your-guard-says-family-that-lost-three-members/articleshow/83319164.cms||Shariq Majeed

Medical experts said that there has been a significant rise in the number of cases where both motor and non-motor symptoms of such diseases become worse after the patients recover from Covid-19. Attributing the problem to a negative change in physical and social activities of these patients after contracting Covid-19, Dr H V Srinivas, a consultant neurologist and member of Indian Epilepsy Association, said, “Parkinson’s disease and paralytic stroke are the two common existing neurological illnesses in the community. Patients who have been suffering from these neurological conditions and were able to perform most physical activities after treatment are again becoming bedridden after Covid-19 infection.” “Most people who were able to walk with minimal or no support because of physiotherapy and other activities are not able to move on their own after recovering from Covid-19. This is happening because most of these patients were bed bound when they contracted Covid-19 infection. Patients with neurological conditions require everyday physical activity, either on their own or via physiotherapy, after they recover from Covid-19 to regain what they have lost,” Dr Srinivas told TOI. While there is still a lot that is not known about exactly how Covid-19 affects people with existing neurological conditions, experts said that worsening of motor symptoms like muscular coordination, tremors, shaking and non-motor symptoms like fatigue, depression and anxiety have been observed during the pandemic. “While Covid-19 will not worsen the condition of patients with existing neurological conditions directly, it is the indirect factor which is contributing to the disability. Consistent physical activity is crucial to arrest the disease progression for people with existing neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s and stroke. Apart from that, alteration in medications while suffering from Covid-19 can also be a contributing factor,” said Dr Lalitha Pidaparthi, consultant neurologist, CARE Hospitals. “It is also important to ensure that the patients with existing neurological conditions are vaccinated at the earliest. No adverse effect of vaccination on patients with Parkinson’s disease or stroke have been reported so far,” Dr Pidaparthi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-hampers-recovery-treatment-of-neurological-patients/articleshow/83322022.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Hyderabad||Pandemic-hit water board staring at huge revenue loss||Hyderabad: The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB), a crucial utility department in the city, has been hit hard by the pandemic. The water board is facing problems ranging from many employees testing positive for Covid-19, to consumers not paying bills, and prospects of a big drop in revenue. “The water board’s monthly revenue is around Rs 120 crore per month and may likely dip to nearly Rs 30 crore,” said a senior water board official. Authorities have been worried since the onset of the pandemic as, apart their from regular staff, a large number of meter readers who go out on the field and bill consumers, have been affected with Covid-19. The water board had hired outsourcing meter readers through private manpower agencies. Currently, more than 500 meter readers are working with the water board. “Over 40% meter readers were affected by the pandemic over the past year,” a board official said. “They got affected while contacting consumers at the time of issuing water bills and collecting the amounts. As a result, the readers are now hesitant to go out on the field to issue bills.” The water board used to earn nearly Rs 120 crore revenue every month through water bills. A lion’s share came from monthly bills, with the rest coming from new connections charges and other customer services. While the board sends SMSs to consumers alerting them of bill payment, board employees still have to go on field to take meter reading, address maintenance issues, and check illegal connections, which puts them at the risk of contracting Covid-19. The water board has over the past few months vaccinated meter readers as well as regular and outsourcing employees, the water board official said. However, despite the vaccination drive, the board is still facing revenue loss. While the board’s records say that more than 9.2 lakh consumers get monthly water bills, and only six lakh pay bills regularly. The board is appealing to consumers to pay the bills on time, and that counters have been kept open during ssworking hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pandemic-hit-water-board-staring-at-huge-revenue-loss/articleshow/83321976.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Need landmark court order to curb defection of MLAs’||Panaji: Science and technology minister Michael Lobo on Monday said that there should be a landmark judgment on defection of MLAs from one party to another so that it will desist such moves in future. He was reacting to Congress approaching the high court challenging the order by Goa legislative assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar who had dismissed the disqualification petition against 10 congress MLAs who joined BJP. Lobo told reporters that the 2/3rd split in the legislature party is valid. “We may be wrong, court may have a different interpretation. We had passed the order at that time (merger of 10 Congress MLAs into BJP) as per constitution,” the former deputy speaker said. “We have to see what the court’s interpretation is, whether they should have resigned and joined, or what we have done is right. The decision will come, and it should come before the next assembly elections,” the Calangute MLA said. “People vote for a particular candidate, and then all of a sudden, the MLA joins another party with a reason that there is a 2/3rd split in the legislature party. This should not happen in future, and for that a landmark judgment should come,” he said. The minister also said that the people of the country are awaiting this judgment. “This judgment will be beneficial to all political parties,” he said. Lobo said that the reason for such defections is that at times, certain MLAs feel they are not being treated properly in their party, or perhaps there are hurdles in carrying out their work, or maybe the organisation is not proper, and hence they decide to move to another party. “If the Supreme Court and high court’s interpretations are on the same lines as that of ours, then what we had done is correct,” Lobo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/need-landmark-court-order-to-curb-defection-of-mlas/articleshow/83323336.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Uttam demanded that the state government implement the high court order on recovering excess charges collected by private hospitals and return it to patients. Highlighting the state’s spend on irrigation projects, he said, “Can’t the government spend a few hundred crores to provide free treatment to Covid-19 and black fungus infected patients by including its treatment in the Aarogyasri scheme?” he asked. “If the Covid-19 treatment is added to Aarogyasri, it will benefit 85% of the population of the state,” the TPCC president added. Except for knee-jerk measures, the TRS government has not taken any stringent action on the private hospitals, which have been fleecing the Covid-hit patients, he alleged and claimed the BJP government at the Centre and TRS government in the state have failed to control the spread of Covid-19. Though 15 months have passed after the first wave of Covid-19, the government failed to improve medical infrastructure in the state, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-brought-under-aarogyasri-will-benefit-85-people-cong/articleshow/83322077.cms||---

Replying to a leave for adjournment motion by opposition MLA Shafi Prambil regarding the ongoing investigation into the hawala case involving BJP sympathisers, the chief minister said that all those arrested are in judicial custody and the police have already recorded the statements of 96 witnesses. He said that the probe by the special investigation team is progressing very well and the government had also given the details of the probe to the enforcement directorate (ED) on June 1. The matter also led to some political mudslinging between the ruling front and opposition. The chief minister said that the UPA and NDA governments at the Centre have never been transparent about hawala or black money in the country. None of the three reports prepared by three different agencies engaged by the Centre have seen the light of the day, he said. He added that under the smokescreen of probes by central agencies, and supported by the BJP and Congress, hawala transactions were carried out during the election time. However, opposition leader V D Satheesan took strong exception to the CM’s statement. Referring to the gold smuggling case that had put the government in a fix in its previous tenure, he said now that since both the CPM and BJP have cases against each other, the investigation should not be compromised. He said that the complaint into the robbing of money from Kodakara at 4.30am on April 4 was filed only on April 7. Also, a pro-CPM media is giving out in advance details like which all witnesses would be summoned by the probe team. This is giving the BJP leaders enough time to prepare while facing the SIT, he said. Later, speaker M B Rajesh denied permission for the adjournment motion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/probe-in-kodakara-case-progressing-well-pinarayi/articleshow/83319225.cms||---

To check it, Division 3 police will establish a checkpost in the market daily. Besides, the police also plan to access the private CCTVs installed in the area for surveillance. On Monday, Division 3 SHO sub-inspector Madhu Bala, along with her team, was present at a checkpost set up near the market. Additional deputy commissioner-I Pragya Jain said, “For the past few days, miscreants have been creating nuisance and disturbing law and order in the area by indulging in scuffles. We have lodged FIRs and arrested nine accused, including three minors. However, this is not enough to maintain peace here. We have to work proactively to prevent such scuffles.” “I have received feedback from residents that there is a street vendors’ market near Hargobind Nagar where several youngsters gather every evening. Almost every day, they indulge in fights that often snowball. For at least 10 to 15 days, cops will be deployed near the market in the evening,” she added. “We also want to ensure CCTV surveillance in the area. Until we get CCTVs installed there under the safe city project, we urge residents to provide access to their private CCTVs installed outside their houses to the police. I also urge people to WhatsApp me any suggestion or complaint related to law and order in their locality on 7837018503. They can send me audios, videos or locations where they find anything suspicious,” said the ADCP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/after-series-of-scuffles-cops-to-set-up-checkpost-in-old-city-market/articleshow/83319175.cms||Payal Dhawan

But in Pimpri Chinchwad, the number has gone up due to the stress on institutional quarantine of all patients. “We have decided to reduce the number of CCCs as there has been a decline in the number of new patients," said Rajendra Muthe, head of the PMC’s establishment department. Muthe said while some centres have been shut completely, the number of beds in others have been reduced. According to data provided by the PMC, there are only five operational CCCs in its jurisdiction with a total capacity of 1707 beds. From this number, only 211 are currently occupied. Covid care centres and quarantine facilities are units in which positive patients with mild to no symptoms are asked to isolate. Most of the occupants in these facilities have been residents of densely populated neighbourhoods where homes have limited space for patient isolation. For home isolation, patients will need access to separate rooms and toilets. They will also need a round-the-clock caretaker. Data also shows nearly 75% of total positive cases are in home quarantine. During the second wave this year, many were able to isolate at home because surges were reported more in housing societies than crowded slums. Last year, many patients were from densely populated slums. In Pimpri Chinchwad, PCMC chief Rajesh Patil said they will now focus on setting up small Covid centres of 50-bed capacities. "We are going to set up four such centres in each of our eight zones. So, there should be 32 of these centres across the twin towns. Except for a few exceptions, stress will be on institutional quarantine to reduce the chain of transmission.” Officials with the PCMC said the civic body currently has three operational CCCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-reduces-number-of-covid-care-centres-while-pcmc-plans-more/articleshow/83323375.cms||---

Officials said the resupply will allow civic-run vaccination centres to continue with their drives. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “Of the 25,500 doses that we received for Pune district, around 11,000 doses have been given to Pune rural. The PMC has been given 9,000 and 5,500 have been distributed to PCMC areas. We are expecting more vaccine batches later in the week. Deshmukar said overall supply is expected to pick up pace after June 21. “We have enough CVCs — Covid vaccination centres — in place. There are more than 600 CVCs and we can really speed up coverage if we are given more doses,” he said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India, said the Centre should consider drives out of smaller clinics to reach more. For Tuesday, PMC will have drives for both Covaxin and Covishield. Around 60 centres will conduct Covishield sessions while 16 will offer Covaxin.

Officials said the Hadapsar drive-in site — started a week ago — has been seeing good turnouts with at least 40 daily vaccinations. Requests have come in for more such sites, the officials added. “More drive-in sites will be allowed based on the location. The PMC will check if potential locations have enough parking space,” Suryakant Deokar, the PMC's immunization officer, said. Drive-in vaccination centres have been picking up in other major cities too, with beneficiaries saying these centres don't see crowding. Beneficiaries are administered jabs while seated in their cars.  People also have to wait in their cars for 30 minutes after the jab for observation. “It is very easy to get a jab at the Hadapsar drive-in centre,” said Snehal Kale, medical officer with the PMC’s Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward office. “Many beneficiaries from nearby locations are now coming to get their jabs at the centre,” she added. Kale said the Hadapsar drive-in site also has a regular vaccination centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-likely-to-set-up-more-drive-in-sites/articleshow/83323381.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Indian Oil Corporation Limited to invest Rs 24,000 crore in Gujarat||GANDHINAGAR: Public sector undertaking Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) signed six memorandum of understanding (MoUs) with the Gujarat government in Gandhinagar on Monday to invest a sum of Rs 24,000 crore in expanding refining capacity at its Koyali refinery in Vadodara, and adding plants to produce polypropelene and lube oil base stock. The ventures are likely to create direct and indirect employment opportunities for 25,000 persons. Union minister for petroleum, natural gas and steel, Dharmendra Pradhan and chief minister Vijay Rupani presided over the ceremony of ‘Investment Promotion’ between the state government and Indian Oil for setting up a petrochemical and lube integration (LuPech) project and acrylics/oxo alcohol project along with other infrastructure projects at Gujarat Refinery,” a statement said on Monday. Expanding refining capacity by 4.3 million tonnes per annum to 18 million tonnes and adding plants to produce 500,000 tonnes per annum of polypropylene and 2,35,000 tonnes of lube oil base stock at the site would see a total investment of about Rs 24,000 crore. The LuPech project will produce import substitutes like Lube Oil Base Stock (LOBS) and polypropylene. The acrylics/oxo alcohol project at Dumad and Gujarat Refinery will manufacture value-added Butyl Acrylate, a key ingredient for paints, coatings, adhesives, textile chemicals, plasticizer industry, and other similar products. MoUs were also signed for infrastructure facilities at Dumad for Koyali-Ahmednagar-Solapur pipeline and tank truck loading facility for linear alkyl benzene (LAB) — a feed-stock for detergent industries. The other infrastructure projects envisaged are a new flare system at the Gujarat refinery and a hydrogen-dispensing facility for Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV). IOC Chairman S M Vaidya said, “Gujarat refinery is now poised to grow to 18 MMTPA capacity. New units for the production of polypropylene, butylacrylate and lube oil base stocks will also be added to the refinery’s portfolio”. These projects, he said, will enable large-scale direct and indirect employment opportunities during the peak construction period and later for the operation of these facilities. CM Vijay Rupani said Gujarat is a leader in the country in gas and petrochemicals sector and investments in this sector will assist “downstream industries” as well. He added that while big investments were welcome, the state is also ensuring that a conducive environment is created for small and medium enterprises to thrive. Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, while congratulating IOC and the state government for the investment pact, said that Gujarat has led the way in use of natural gas to reduce pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/iocl-to-invest-rs-24k-crore-in-gujarat/articleshow/83325380.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Police file case against K Surendran for bribery||KOZHIKODE: Badiadka police registered a case against BJP state president K Surendran for allegedly bribing K Sundara, a namesake candidate who had filed nomination papers in the recent assembly polls from Manjeswaram, to withdraw his candidature. On Monday, police registered a case under IPC Sections 171 (B) (bribery involving giving a gratification to any person with the object of inducing him or any other person to exercise any electoral right or of rewarding any person for having exercised any such right) and 171 (E) (punishment for bribery). Police registered the case after Kasaragod JFCM court gave its nod after considering the petition filed by LDF candidate in Manjeswaram VV Rameshan seeking the registering of a case against Surendran who was the BJP candidate. Kasaragod deputy SP Sadanandan PP said that more persons would be included as accused in the case on the basis of the statements given by Sundara during the preliminary enquiry (PE). Sundara, who filed nomination as BSP’s candidate and later pulled out of the fray, had told the police that he was given Rs 2.5 lakh and a smartphone by BJP leaders to withdraw his nomination. He also told the police that he was initially threatened and kept in wrongful confinement for withdrawing his candidature. As per Sundara’s statement, the money was given to him by Suresh Naik, Ashok Shetty and Sunil Naik, a former Yuva Morcha state treasurer and Surendran’s close associate. “We have filed a case against Surendran as money was given to Sundara on his behalf. More sections will be added based on the statement of Sundara that he was threatened and kept in wrongful confinement,” said the police. Rameshan, who had filed the complaint with Kasaragod police chief, said the fight was against the moves by BJP to scuttle democracy using money power. The court also directed the police not to make any arrest without obtaining a warrant from it. Meanwhile, police sources said that if cognizable offences are included in the case, as per the statement of Sundara, police can proceed with arrests, if needed. Sundara had contested as independent candidate in 2016 assembly elections and secured 467 votes which saw Surendran losing the polls by 89 votes. Surendran is also facing an allegation of paying Rs 10 lakh to JRP leader CK Janu for her return to NDA before the recent elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/police-file-case-against-k-surendran-for-bribery/articleshow/83319272.cms||---

Principal scientist at the ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute, AR Desai said that change in weather patterns, the extended rain last year and the lack of availability of good quality grafts for the propagation of the crop has led to poor production of the king of fruits. “At our farm there was an almost 80% decrease in crop. There is only 20% crop production reported this time. It was a totally abnormal season and there was very scattered and late flowering-fruiting process in only a few trees,” Desai said. People’s favourite – the Mancurad and Hilario varieties – arrived very late and were not of a very good quality according to the expert. Other mango varieties like Salcette Mussahrat and Bardez Mussahrat were not seen much in the markets this season. Even the late variety, Amarapali had staggered flowering and immature fruit-drops due to heavy rain. For the flowers to bloom the mango trees require sufficient heat and a dry period post-monsoon is a must. Only when there is enough heat in October and November, flowering of the fruit takes place in December. This time due to extended rains the flowering was badly affected, with some crops even experiencing late blooming. However this time around the delayed mango crop was also hit due to cyclone Tauktae. “The delayed mango crop which was supposed to be harvested in May faced premature falling due to cyclonic winds. Mango trees were even uprooted in some places. The decrease in production this time was not only due to erratic weather but also due to crop loss because of cyclone Tauktae,” director of agriculture, Nevil Alphonso told TOI. The mango production data compiled by the directorate of agriculture is expected to arrive by June-end. According to the experts if the erratic weather continues this year as well, the upcoming mango crop could be affected as well leading to yet another poor productive season. “Late monsoon would translate into a delayed mango season. If the erratic weather continues then it will definitely it will have repercussions,” Desai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/weather-change-unseasonal-rainfall-ruin-mango-season/articleshow/83323391.cms||Nida Sayed

However, the data with the state panchayat department says that 1.3 lakh people returned to the state between April 21 and June 1. Both sets of data were collected over roughly a month’s time, but the panchayat department’s numbers are more than double the commission’s data. When queried on the difference in figures, vice chairman of the Migration Commission SS Negi told TOI, “The panchayat department’s data completely relies on the Smart City Portal registrations. Anyone who leaves or enters the state registers on the portal. Even those who travel to the state’s hill districts from its plain districts do it. Not everyone is a returnee. Even a team from our commission had travelled out of Dehradun and had to register on the portal. Will it be right to call them returnees?” Negi added that the commission compiles data from collecting details at the block level and from gram pradhans. “While the migration commission data was compiled from April 1 to May 5, the panchayat department collected details on the basis of registration done from April 21 to June 1. There are even instances of people registering and not returning,” he said. According to data collected by the Migration Commission, between April 1 and May 5, most migrants — 14,850 — returned to Almora, followed by 9,473 to Pauri, 8,087 to Tehri, 4,713 to Champawat, 4,105 to Bageshwar, 3,083 to Chamoli, 2,990 to Nainital, 2,450 to Pithoragarh, 1,474 to Rudraprayag, 1,308 to Pauri, 349 to Udham Singh Nagar, 152 to Dehradun and 58 to Haridwar. The maximum returnees, 34,360, were from Delhi. Others were from Gurgaon, Chandigarh and Mumbai. According to the panchayat department, 36,640 people returned to Almora, 3,555 to Bageshwar, 3,270 to Chamoli, 3,657 to Champawat, 11,686 to Dehradun, 7,088 to Haridwar, 12,219 to Nainital, 26,633 to Pauri, 4,352 to Pithoragarh, 2,345 to Rudraprayag, 8,588 to Tehri, 8,687 to Udham Singh Nagar and 1,288 to other places, taking the total to 1.30 lakh. State government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal also confirmed that both bodies have a different way of calculating adding that “if any discrepancy is found, it will be sorted out.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/how-many-migrants-came-back-to-state-in-second-wave/articleshow/83319236.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Hyderabad||Uranium Corporation of India Limited wastewater floods fields in Kadapa, farmers fear pollution||HYDERABAD: The tail pond storing slurry and wastewater generated from the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) mine in Kadapa district has been overflowing into the agricultural fields damaging crops and raising fears of contamination. With heavy pre-monsoon showers inundating large areas, local farmers and environmentalists are protesting against UCIL for crop loss and alleged damage to the soil and water in the area. UCIL plant at Thummalapalle is India’s biggest uranium single processing plant. “On Saturday night it rained heavily and the gates of the dam located after the tail pond were damaged and water overflowed into our fields. I have six acres of land, and in three acres, I am raising plantain and black-eyed beans in the rest. The UCIL slurry mixed water flooded my entire crop. The standing crop is lost,” a local farmer Akula Lokesh said. Two senior officials of UCIL said they have been facing heavy rains for the past few days, but added there has been no contamination. “Due to muddy water, locals are claiming the water from tailing pond entered their field. We took samples and analysed them. The PH value inside our plant jurisdiction is more than 12 but outside the area is 7.8. Uranium levels in the water outside our plant are 0.24 parts per million. Around less than 1 ppm is permissible. It is a normal level completely diluted. We have collected further samples from the fields and analyzing them,” UCIL general manager (engineering services) M S Rao told TOI. From May 8, UCIL was shut due to Covid-19 outbreak and from May 22 to June 3, they ran the plant partially due to poor oxygen supply issues as oxygen in the country is being diverted to hospitals. Normally tailings that contain Uranium host rock residue are discharged into the tailing pond, another official explained. “The pond is located in the valley with hills on three sides and a dam on the other side. Whatever settled goes into the bottom of the tailing pond. Clearwater goes into the spillway and then decantation pond located in between tailing pond and dam. The clear water in decantation ponds are recycled back into the plant,” the official said. “As it rained, tailing and decantation ponds also got filled up. Recycling of entire water couldn’t be done, so it overflowed into the nearby fields. We took samples and found low levels of uranium, and they are in permissible limits,” he said, promising to further assess the issue. “We will assess the damage if any to crops and do the needful as per the rules,” the official added. Retired scientist of Icrisat, K Babu Rao, pointed out that earlier a ministry of environment-appointed committee found nine violations and they have not been addressed them yet. “The tailing pond has no proper lining due to which seepage is happening. They are claiming clay lining which is also a questionable one. For plant expansion, PCB is yet to conduct a public hearing,” Rao said, adding, “The tailing pond is in 250 acres and overflowing of uranium residue water in surroundings will cause environmental damage.” Local activist Kakumanu Jayashree said that locals were suffering health issues for long due to uranium-polluted groundwater use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ucil-wastewater-floods-fields-in-kadapa-farmers-fear-pollution/articleshow/83325411.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

SKMCH deputy superintendent and head of paediatrics department, Dr Gopal Shankar Sahni, said the child was brought in a very serious condition around 1:30pm on Saturday and died within four hours. It was the fifth AES death in the state till June 5. Altogether 26 AES cases have been reported this year so far. Of the five deaths, one each was from Muzaffarpur, Sheohar, Vaishali, East Champaran and West Champaran. Out of the total 26 cases, Muzaffarpur had the maximum 13, followed by Sitamarhi (4), Vaishali (3), East Champaran (3), Sheohar (2) and West Champaran (1). However, compared to previous year, there has been a drop in the number of AES cases registered. The death toll this year is also low. For instance, six deaths and 39 AES cases were reported till June 5 last year. Muzaffarpur district magistrate Pranav Kumar said there has been reduction in the number of AES cases and deaths in the state for the last two years. In 2019, total 431 cases were reported. The number came down to 43 in 2020. The maximum number of AES cases and deaths were reported in June. Pranav cited various reasons behind the drop in AES cases and deaths dueing the past two years. He said preventive measures were being taken against the disease. He appreciated the village model, in which one official has been made the in-charge to create awareness and hold regular meetings with the villagers. Pranav said they have also emphasised on awareness campaign, capacity building of frontline workers and distribution of ORS and food material in the areas affected by AES. Parents have been cautioned not to let their kids sleep empty stomach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aes-cases-drop-this-year-five-children-die-in-state/articleshow/83319238.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Yerawada jail superintendent U T Pawar told TOI, “More returned on his own after realising that he had been wrongly released by the prison authorities. However, the ongoing inquiry into how he was released despite a Pimpri sessions court having rejected his bail plea on June 2 will continue.” Pawar said, “We had contacted More’s residence and his lawyers. The lawyers and his relatives got in touch with him following which he returned to the prison”. On Saturday, the state prison department ordered an inquiry into his release from prison. “Somebody at our end might have misinterpreted the bail order, which was rejected, following which he was released,” Pawar said. More, a native of Nasik, was arrested in February by the Pimpri Police’s Economic Offences’ Wing (EOW) in a fraud case registered with the Pimpri police in 2019. He was in judicial custody.

Locals said that it could impact the water reservoir nearby and may also cause landslides during monsoon. The hill-cutting was in full swing on Saturday and Sunday at Tanki. General secretary of South Goa Congress block Shaikh Ali and a local, Guru Gauns informed Quepem police on Saturday after they noticed the activity. On Sunday morning, when the hill-cutting was in progress by using earth moving machinery, Gauns called the police at the site. However, before police reached the site, the owner sent back the machinery engaged in hill-cutting. PSI Mayur Sawant, while at the hill-cutting site, told the complainant that police are not authorised to take action against the hill-cutting and directed them to approach the flying squad. “I had tried to inform the flying squad, but their phone was not reachable,” Gauns said. The property owner claimed to have the permission from TCP department to carry out the hill-cutting but failed to produce the letter. When the issue was brought before the Xeldem panchayat sarpanch Caetan Lima, he said that no complaint had been lodged in the panchayat office. Panchayat secretary Ravindra Wadekar said the panchayat has no power to stop the hill-cutting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/xeldem-locals-cry-foul-over-hill-cutting-near-reservoir/articleshow/83323431.cms||---

Just a year before the target of doubling farmers’ income, India recorded 165 major protests across 22 states/UTs in 2020, up from only 34 major protests witnessed in 15 states in 2017. In 2020, 96 protests were related to economic/farm policies (including against three contentious farm laws), 38 related to procurement, fair price of crops, four to farm infrastructure, 17 against land acquisition, seven related to insurance and loan waivers, three for other reasons, says the statistical data analysed by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). CSE has also analysed that as per National Crime Record Bureau(NCRB) every day 28 cultivators and farm labourers committed suicide in the country in 2019 as 5,957 farmers and 4324 labourers committed suicides. Now situation has come to such a pass that in 52 per cent of the country’s districts, the population of farm labourers has outstripped that of farmers and cultivators. Bihar, Kerala and Puducherry have more farm labourers than farmers in all their districts. While studying the statistics, CSE points that the country is sitting atop a massive time-bomb of agrarian crisis and disquiet. CSE director general Sunita Narain said: “The numbers point towards a trend. The trend points towards impending crisis, and the challenge ahead. In the case of agriculture and land, things seem to be certainly on the downslide”. “This is evident all the more when you see the condition of land records and their maintenance in the country,” says Richard Mahapatra, managing editor of Down To Earth. “Our analysis shows that 14 states in India have witnessed a deterioration in the quality of their land records.” Narain said, “At a time when the quality of data available is usually poor — it is either missing, unavailable publicly or of questionable quality but the correct data like this can be immensely helpful. Improving the quality of data can only happen when we use it for policy. Just consider how we have suffered in this past year due to Covid pandemic because we do not have sufficient or accurate data on tests, or the number of deaths, or serological surveys, or genomic sequencing of the variants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fivefold-rise-in-farmer-protests-since-2017-cse/articleshow/83326041.cms||Neel Kamal

Therefore, I have lodged a fresh complaint with the police and also given names of both the accused. The police have also written to the Facebook headquarters to remove the video, but have not got any response so far.” Assistant commissioner of police (east) Devinder Chaudhary said the police were verifying the names of the accused and then would add them, but as of now a case has been registered under sections 499 (defamation), 500 (punishment for defamation) of the IPC and under the IT Act. Talwar said his wife Meenu Talwar died of cancer. On February 10, when her bhog ceremony was scheduled, an unidentified person uploaded the video. “The accused deliberately uploaded it on that day to attack me personally and emotionally,” he said. On February 13, a letter was found at the office of his personal assistant in which the accused had allegedly threatened him to pay Rs 50 lakh or he would upload more such videos to defame him, he claimed. In another case, the Tibba police had, on February 15, arrested a worker of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Paramjeet Singh Pamma, for defaming Meenu Talwar by uploading defamatory remarks on his Facebook profile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/obscene-video-on-social-media-4-months-on-mla-lodges-another-plaint/articleshow/83319249.cms||Payal Dhawan

The 42-year-old man had suffered recent financial losses and was repeatedly harassed by a money lender, police said. Akhilesh Gupta, a wholesale supplier of medicines, used the same rope to hang himself, his wife and kids, the cops said, adding that a suicide note was found in the room. Shahjahanpur SSP S Anand, circle officer Praveen Yadav and a team of forensic experts visited the house to start a probe. A money lender has been blamed in the suicide note, the police said. An FIR has been registered against the man at Kotwali police station. Gupta was a resident of Faridpur area of Bareilly district and had settled in Shahjahanpur to expand his business. He moved into his own house from a rented one and was settling down when he met Avinash Vajpai, the money lender. According to Gupta's father, his son was "disturbed for a few days and on Monday, he along with his wife Reshu, son Shivang and daughter Abhijeeta, was found hanging inside their room". Vajpai, who lives in the Kaanth area of the district, had lent a high interest loan and was harassing Gupta all the time, he alleged. Early on Monday, neighbours saw Reshu for the last time when she opened the door for the milkman. Then till 1.15pm, the main door remained shut and the neighbours began to worry. When a neighbour managed to unlock one of the doors and enter the house, he found all four of them hanging from a rope. Police said the couple may have consumed poison before hanging. When contacted, Shahjahanpur SSP told TOI, “This is a tragic incident. We have sent the bodies for autopsy. A note left behind suggests that the family was being regularly harassed by a money lender. An FIR has been registered against him on the complaint of Dr Ashok Gupta, the trader's father. We will arrest the man soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-bizman-42-found-hanging-with-wife-2-kids-after-suffering-financial-losses/articleshow/83316706.cms||---

---||Pune||Restos take cautious steps to resume dine-in services||Pune: Barely 2% of the 300-odd fine-dine restaurants in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad restarted dine-ins on Monday following the recent unlock order issued by the state government. Many of the bigger restaurants have decided to wait for a further extension in the operation deadline , because the 4 pm deadline is unviable, restaurants told TOI. Ganesh Shetty, president of Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association told TOI, “Only 30% or about 150-200 of Pune’s smaller restaurants (not fine dining) restarted dine-ins. However, many small fast food joints and snack centres resumed dining. Such joints mostly cater to takeaways.”Shetty said over 50% of the staffers in a majority of restaurants had gone back home. “Many restaurants are still waiting for them to return. While several restaurants in market areas will restart dine-ins during the next few days, those in other localities may wait till the deadline is further extended to 8pm or beyond. Several popular restaurants on Fergusson College Road did not start dine-ins on Day One of the relaxations. The first day being Monday, restaurants that started the dining service saw a tepid business, around 20% footfalls,” said Shetty. Sources said big eateries, such as Vaishali, Rupali or Goodluck Cafe, on F C Road did not start dine-ins on Monday.Clubs and pubs in the city are also opting for the wait-and-watch route. Shetty said as the maximum business for liquor serving establishments happens in the night, reopening dine-ins at these joints with the 4pm deadline was unlikely as of now. Praful Chandawarkar, director, Malaka Spice, told TOI that the first day at his restaurants in Koregaon Park and Kharadi saw a tepid response. We expect footfalls to pick up during the next few days.” Ravish Arora, director, Incognito Restaurant, Bar & Cafe on Balewadi High street, did not restart dine-ins on Monday. “We would not start it till the 4 pm deadline is further relaxed. One of the reasons why we do not want to start dine-ins as of now is the weekend curbs on this service. Dining in restaurants has not been allowed during the weekends, when most business happens.”He said, “Four to five hours of dine-in operations on weekdays will not be good enough to recover costs and make it viable. The unlock announcement came recently and it will take time for the restos to organise the staff, because over 50% of them have gone back to their home towns.” Shashindra Shetty, coordinator, Rupali restaurant on F C Road, told TOI, “We would start dine-ins from Wednesday, as 10 out of our 12 servers have gone back home. They would return by Wednesday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/restos-take-cautious-steps-to-resume-dine-in-services/articleshow/83323468.cms||Neha Madaan

The university has announced the second phase of PET, which involves the registration of qualified candidates till June 30. During the first phase of PET, 4,299 candidates had cracked the entrance, which was a gateway to PhD admissions in 45 subjects. While the necessary test was conducted online due to the Covid situation, alleged malpractices had taken place during the conduct of paper-one of the online PET. A section of candidates had demanded cancellation of the online test due to unethical practices, Bamu has decided to go ahead with it. Later, Bamu decided not to allow candidates to take second-paper from their home or any other private places, unlike paper-one. The decision, however, was reversed due to technical issues associated to conduct the tests amid the Covid outbreak. “The candidates registered for PET are requested to follow the official website for a detailed timetable for different subjects. Those who have any query can contact the PhD section of the university during office hours,” he said. As Bamu has been conducting PET after four years, it was flooded with applications from students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bamu-to-go-ahead-with-phd-entrance-test-despite-opposition/articleshow/83316732.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Weekly review of Covid scenario in Aurangabad on Thursdays||AURANGABAD: The civic administration said the review of the Covid situation would take place every Thursday and the citizens have been warned that Covid-related curbs can be reintroduced if Covid-appropriate behaviour is ignored. In his public message, Astik Kumar Pandey, the administrator of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said around 800 oxygen beds will be added to Covid healthcare facilities. “The disregard to Covid appropriate behaviour can increase the positivity rate again and lead to more occupancy of oxygen beds. Such a situation would lead to more curbs being introduced so nobody should lower their guard,” he said. AMC would further increase RT-PCR testing to keep an effective check on the Covid situation, Pandey said. During the latest review, the municipal limits of Aurangabad have a Covid positivity rate of 2.24% and 22.19% occupancy of oxygen beds. The relatively better pandemic situation has put the city in ‘level 1’ defined in the latest Break The Chain order of the state government. Aurangabad district collector, who held a review meeting on Monday, said the administration will focus on rapid vaccination to increase immunity. “The curbs lifted partially or fully within urban and rural areas are not permanent. The Covid situation will be review weekly before taking an official call,” he said. Amid the lifting of curbs, the local civic body has also announced the start of its public transport service from Tuesday. To begin with, buses will ply on routes, including CIDCO- Railway station, Aurangpura- Ranjangaon, Aurangabad- Chattrapati Shivaji Nagar, CIDCO- Ghanegao and CIDCO- Jogeshwari. “A total of 16 buses will make 241 daily trips. All the buses have been sanitised before pressing into the service of citizens,” an official release said. Aurangabad district reported 295 fresh cases on Sunday, taking a total number of active cases to 2,400.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/weekly-review-of-covid-scenario-in-aurangabad-city-on-thursdays/articleshow/83316755.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Margao fish vendors carry out illegal business, but still pay sopo||COLVA: Fish vendors are finding new locations to carry out business in the wake of the closure of the South Goa Planning and Development Authority (SGPDA) markets, both wholesale and retail, due to the pandemic-related curfew. The unauthorised fish vendors have shifted base to ring road near the old market circle which now resembles a makeshift fish market complete with the vendors seated on their small stools trying to attract customers with their baskets of fish. They had earlier set up shop along the western bypass, near the wholesale fish market in Fatorda, a local said. However, in the last week of May, reacting to media reports, Fatorda police had cracked down on the illegal vendors. Questioned about why police have not similarly stopped the makeshift market near the ring road, Fatorda police inspector Kapil Naik said that it was impossible to deploy his personnel at every site. “If we stop them at one place they move to another, and it is not possible to maintain a 24-hour vigil on them,” he said. In the midst of all this, sopo collector Alam Sayeed continues to collect taxes from the vendors. “Since they are doing business, I am collecting sopo. It does not matter to me whether they are legally or illegally doing business. My job is to collect sopo from whoever is doing business within the jurisdiction of the town. Paying this tax does not give fish vendors legality to conduct their business along the roadside,” Sayeed said. People flock to buy fish anywhere it is sold, and then all Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is thrown to the wind, said a motorist who was trying to manoeuvre his vehicle through one such crowd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-fish-vendors-carry-out-illegal-biz-but-still-pay-sopo/articleshow/83323470.cms||Nisser Dias

The residents reached the police station after one of them tried to nab a suspected drug peddler and a clash ensued. The residents said earlier, too, they had complained against drug peddlers in their locality, but the police took no action. Rohit Sikka, husband of councillor Annie Sikka, said, “Residents suspect some people of peddling drugs in the locality. Earlier, several complaints were given to Haibowal police, but to no avail. On Sunday evening, area resident Kulwinder Singh nabbed a man who he suspected to be a drug peddler. However, the man thrashed him and escaped. Thereafter, the residents gathered at the spot and reached Haibowal police station.” “We had called the police to the spot, but they did not reach there in time. Therefore, we decided to stage a protest. We want the Haibowal police to establish a permanent checkpost in the locality to keep a check on peddlers,” added Sikka. Haibowal police station SHO sub-inspector Neeraj Chaudhary said, “There are about 15 families that relocated to Ajit Nagar from Gurdaspur a few years ago. These 15 houses are on one side and the rest of the locality is on the other. The two groups don’t get along. A man from one group had stopped another and tried to frisk him, suspecting him to be a drug peddler. After nothing was found on him, the two thrashed each other. However, none of them lodged a complaint of fighting against each other.” On Sunday evening, the police received information that some residents were fighting. “The residents claimed that a drug racket was being run from a house in their locality. The house was searched and nothing was found. PCR surveillance has been increased in the locality,” the SHO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/haibowal-residents-protest-police-inaction-against-drug-peddlers/articleshow/83319277.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: City up and running, not breathless on unlock Day 1||NAGPUR: On the first day of relaxations for non-essential shops, all popular markets in the city saw a huge rush of people. Even the number of vehicles on city roads increased manifold, with many busy squares and roads reporting traffic jams. On Sunday, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had extended the timing of non-essential shops to 5pm. On Monday, TOI visited commercial hubs such as Gandhibagh, Itwari, Mahal, Sakkardara, and Jaripatka, and saw crowds at most places. Covid appropriate behaviour, including maintaining physical distancing and wearing a mask, went for a toss in almost all commercial areas in the city. The traders found it difficult to maintain safety norms. Traders admitted this, but said they cannot stop people from coming into their shops. With the opening of markets and relaxation of rules, many busy roads in the city like Central Avenue, Wardha Road, Kamptee Road, Residency Road, and Amravati Road witnessed a huge number of vehicles. Internal roads in both Gandhibagh and Itwari remained chock-a-block with traffic due to haphazard parking of vehicles on either side. Eating stalls and vendors returned to footpaths and added to the woes. People hardly maintained social distance inside shops or while walking in the market like Sitabuldi main road, Kelibagh Road or in internal lanes of Gandhibagh and Itwari markets. “As shop owners, we are constantly sanitising our shops, providing sanitisers to those entering the shops. But then it is up to the people to adhere to Covid-19 guidelines,” said Kishore Makode, owner of an electric equipment shop, in Gandhibagh. There was a rush at salons too across the city. “Eating joints did not witness many customers. It may take some more days for us to rebound due to the fluctuation of Covid-19 cases in the city,” said Prakash Gupta, an eating joint owner. TOI also spotted many gyms across the city carrying out sanitization drive and are all set to start functioning from Tuesday. The city traffic police and NMC’s nuisance detection squad remained on their toes to ensure citizens and shopkeepers follow all Covid-19 guidelines. The traffic police penalized 73 people for violating physical distancing norms and also caught 157 Nagpurians for venturing out without face masks. The traffic police have detained 35 vehicles as drivers violated Covid protocol. The traffic zone of Cotton Market booked highest number of cases of both social distancing and masks, revealed statistics procured from DCP (traffic) Sarang Awad. The NDS team focused on implementing Covid-19 protocol among shoppers and shopkeepers. The NDS team led by commandant Virsen Tambe penalized 14 shopkeepers across the city for disobeying Covid-19 guidelines and recovered Rs1.01 lakh fine from them. The civic cops also caught 15 citizens without masks and recovered Rs7,500 fine from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-up-and-running-not-breathless-on-unlock-day-1/articleshow/83321492.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The ADCP has further marked the probe to ACP (central) Waryam Singh. Five days ago, Sunny Nai, a key accused, had released a video, saying he murdered Rinkle on the orders of Congress councillor Gurdeep Singh Neetu. Since then, Rinkle’s family has been demanding a probe by an IPS officer. On June 1, Sunny had released his videos on social media, narrating the incident and claiming he was roped in to execute the murder at the behest of the Congress coucillor. Sunny had also questioned the SIT that gave a clean chit to Neetu. The next day, Rinkle’s brother Mani Khehra gave a complaint to Agarwal, seeking probe by an IPS officer. Jain said, “I have asked ACP (central) Waryam Singh to investigate the case.” Mani said, “We had demanded investigation by an IPS officer so that we could get justice. But now the inquiry has been marked to ACP Waryam, whom we do not trust. Earlier, too, ACP Waryam had conducted a biased probe due to which Neetu got a clean chit. I will meet the ADCP and request her to probe the case.” In September 2018, Rinkle was assaulted to death at his house in Amarpura by a group of miscreants. Rinkle’s family had alleged that he had a rivalry with Neetu, who got him killed. In the case, Neetu’s son was also arrested. He is out on bail now. Neetu, who has been denying his involvement in the case, said, “As the matter is in court, I do not want to give any statement.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/no-faith-in-officer-to-whom-probe-marked-rinkles-kin/articleshow/83319287.cms||Payal Dhawan

As per the norms, each bus must not exceed 50% of passenger occupancy. Accordingly, every bus can have 25 passengers. The KMT buses made 70 trips in a day. Sanjay Inamdar, the public relations officer of KMT said, “The response of passengers remained bleak on the first day. On average around Rs, 14,000 have been collected from passenger tickets, which is not even 50% of the daily expenses made on the fuel. However, making profits is not our priority, but to provide safe service to those who cannot afford private transport .” The buses ran late as against the schedule fixed, mainly due to long wait to get at least 50% passengers in. The long route buses had passengers mainly from rural areas who travel to Kolhapur city regularly. These passengers were mainly vegetable vendors, workers of shops and other establishments and construction workers. Meanwhile, the Kolhapur division of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) ran 50 buses along few routes. The same routes will continue till June 14 and based on the response the number of buses will be added or reduced. Rohan Palange, the divisional controller of MSRTC said, “Since Kolhapur district is in level 4 of Covid restrictions, we have taken all precautions. Only one passenger is allowed on one seat. Since many of our staff tested positive for Covid, we have kept the trips limited.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/over-1400-passengers-travel-by-kmt-buses-on-first-day/articleshow/83316802.cms||---

According to sources, the central BJP leadership has asked reports from former civil servant C V Ananda Bose, Rajya Sabha MP Suresh Gopi, former DGP Jacob Thomas and Metroman E Sreedharan to present their independent observations on the state of affairs in the BJP state unit as well as the hawala deal allegations against the party. It is reliably learnt that Bose, known to be closer to the Prime Minister than most Kerala leaders, has already submitted his reflections on the predicament the party state unit has landed in. Thomas who contested as a BJP candidate from Irinjalakuda is learnt to have been asked to submit a report on why BJP failed to poll only 26 lakh votes in the assembly elections while it has over 31 lakh registered members from the state. Apart from this, Thomas has been asked to give a report on the influence of black money in various segments of Kerala economy. The modus operandi of black money dealers and their network, cutting across religious and political barriers, would be the main focus of his report. Sources say that Thomas has already submitted an interim report to the central leadership and is expected to soon submit a detailed report on the black money mafia in Kerala. Gopi has been asked to file his own views and understanding on the reasons for the huge debacle the party faced in the assembly elections and also the internal bickering in the state unit. He is yet to submit his report. Sources said Sreedharan, who joined the party recently and fought the election from Palakkad constituency, has been asked to put on record his views on BJP’s electoral debacle in the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/independent-reports-sought-on-issues-in-state-bjp-unit/articleshow/83319304.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Goa: Funnel-shaped whitish formation surprises beach-goers at Baga||CALANGUTE: In an unusual and interesting weather phenomenon, some persons on Baga-Calangute beach witnessed a “minor whirlwind” swirl towards the beach and dissipate near a resort on Monday evening. A vertical whitish column was seen rising up into the sky and advancing slowly. “We first saw this between 6.15pm and 6.30pm, advancing slowly about 300m from the beach, churning the water as it came,” said John Lobo, secretary of Shack Owners Welfare Society (SOWS). As the column came closer, Lobo started recording a video of it till it made landfall near a resort at Khobravaddo. It then blew away a storage hut on the beach before dissipating around 30m on the landward side, but caused no other damage or hurt to anyone. “We were about to run when it came on the beach, barely 50m away from where we were standing, but it moved slightly away from us before dissipating,” Lobo said. “This is a localised phenomenon which may have lasted a few minutes,” said M R Ramesh Kumar, National Institute of Oceanogrpahy meteorologist and retired chief scientist. He said that it was an intense columnar vortex appearing as a funnel shaped cloud over a water body. “After watching the video, it appears to be a minor whirlwind or a waterspout at Baga-Calangute beach. The exact details couldn’t be ascertained for want of atmospheric data over that region at that particular time.” He said that this type of phenomena may be occurring and may have gone unnoticed. Appreciating the recording of the weather event, he said that similar videos recorded of hailstorms in Shiroda and other places, a few month ago, had helped in better understanding of that particular phenomenon.  “These are the type of occurrences which should be reported to IMD,” he said. “This is a waterspout which forms over water bodies because of highly localised atmospheric instability. They usually dissipate when moved on to land. They are much weaker than a tornado and less lasting,” said Rahul M, IMD scientist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/funnel-shaped-whitish-formation-surprises-beach-goers-at-baga/articleshow/83323512.cms||---

But a senior official from the district administration, told TOI on the condition of anonymity, “The decision on trekking and reopening of forts is likely to be taken this week. A set of guidelines would be issued keeping in mind the Covid situation in rural areas, which still have a significant number of cases.”About 60 forts, such as the famous Rajgad, Torna in Velhe and Bhor tehsil, Tungi in Maval and Shivneri in Junnar, are favourites among trekkers. Umesh Zirpe, president of Akhil Maharashtra Giryarohan Mahasangh, said, “The district administration should permit trekking because monsoon is its prime season. Most importantly, people who set up food stalls at trekking points have been facing financial losses because of the closure of activities.” “We trek every year in Sahyadri ranges. Several forts and hills have historical significance. Visiting them at least once a year makes me feel positive,” said Rohini Kitture, an avid trekker. Ankur Mehta, a traveller from Talegaon Dhabade, said, “We couldn’t even do a small trek on a hill because of curbs for the last-one-and-a-half years. The district administration should permit trekking in Pune.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/adventure-sport-bodies-want-activities-to-resume/articleshow/83323499.cms||Sandip Dighe

The MoEFCC has asked the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) and the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) to submit a report on the violations. TOI had reported on Monday that the state government had ordered a fresh probe into the alleged violations related to the land deal involving Parab. This comes after 3 LS MPs of BJP, Gopal Shetty, Girish Bapat and Manoj Kotak, asked union environment minister Prakash Javadekar to order a probe into construction of a resort and road in alleged violation of CRZ/ESZ rules at Murud village by Parab, who belongs to Shiv Sena. “No road or building was constructed over the sea-facing barren agricultural plot measuring about 4,250 square metres when sold to Anil Parab. However, Parab had taken a consent letter from me for converting the plot to non-agriculture and also for re-purposing use of the land as part of the legal compliance,” said Vibhas Sathe, former owner of the land. “A report on the resort land has been sought from MCZMA into the CRZ land and construction violations. The NCSCM, Chennai has been asked to assist technically on the allegations through its report,” said a scientist in the Union MoEFCC. “Our office has asked the Ratnagiri collector to submit a report on the violations based on the MoEFCC directions and a report is awaited,” said Narendra Toke, director, MCZMA. Responding to this correspondent’s queries on mail, Deepak Samuel V, scientist at the NCSCM stated “the director will reply to your queries.” “The NCSCM team site visit as per MoEFCC directive is delayed due to Covid,” said BJP’s Kirit Somaiya. “State forest department has asked chief conservator of forests, Kolhapur, to launch a probe, but no action has been taken,” said another complainant, Prasad Karve. “No communication has been received from CCF office, but our staffers will inspect and submit a report,” said Vaibhav Borate, range forest officer, Dapoli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-now-central-moef-to-probe-sena-mins-land-deal-in-rgiri/articleshow/83323514.cms||Umesh K Parida

The court also directed National Medical Commission, Indian Psychiatric Society and Rehabilitation Council of India to take action, including withdrawal of licence to practice, against professionals involved in any form or method of conversion “therapy” to LGBTQA+ community members. TimesviewThose in same sex or LGBTQ relationships often are socially discriminated against.Sensitising the judiciary goes a long way in more empathetic and understanding treatment of them in courts. The initiative taken by the judge must be lauded.Justice N Anand Venkatesh laid down a slew of guidelines covering issues ranging from gender-neutral restrooms for gender-nonconforming students and help to change name/gender on academic records for transgender people, besides suggesting separate jails for transsexuals. Justice Anand Venkatesh had chosen to undergo ‘psycho-education’ under qualified counsellors to understand same-sex relationship issues, before writing the 125-page verdict. The case relates to a Madurai-based lesbian couple, aged 23 and 20, who chose to live as married couple. Facing resistance from their families, they fled to Chennai and took refuge under an NGO. As police continued to visit them following complaints lodged by their parents, the two had moved the high court to restrain police from harassing them. Tracing the constitutional rights and guarantees available to all those belonging to the LGBTQA+ community, Justice Anand Venkatesh said: “The voice of this community is now getting louder and stronger and society can no more turn a deaf ear and time has come to make that change.” He said police probing man/girl missing complaints should close them without harassing the members, if they find that the person concerned is a consenting individual in the company of LGBTQA+. He also suggested that the Union and the state governments effect changes in curricula of schools and universities to educate students on understanding the LGBTQA+ community. The court has also directed the Union government to devise policies to eliminate prejudices against LGBTQA+ people and organize sensitization programmes for the judiciary, police, public servants, health professionals and parents of LGBTQA+ people. Justice Anand Venkatesh said the union government to enlist Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) including community-based groups which have sufficient expertise in handling the issues faced by the LGBTQIA+ community. “Any person who faces an issue for the reason of their belongingness to the LGBTQIA+ community may approach any of the enlisted NGOs for safeguarding and protecting their rights,” the judge said. Highlighting the need to create awareness in the judiciary as well, the court has suggested the legal services authority concerned and the law ministry to conduct awareness programmes for judicial officers at all levels in coordination with the enlisted NGOs and community support and to provide suggestions/ recommendations to ensure non-discrimination of persons belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community. Noting that he himself was ‘pulled out of darkness (ignorance)’ by two counsellors he had interacted with, the judge said: “The society and my upbringing have always treated the terms “homosexual”, “gay”, “lesbian” as anathema. A majority of the society would stand in the same position of ignorance and preconceived notions.” He said: “I have no hesitation in accepting that I too belong to the majority of commoners who are yet to comprehend homosexuality completely. Ignorance is no justification for normalizing any form of discrimination. Therefore, I took upon myself, the vested responsibility and the duty to deliver justice in all its forms and spirit, of cutting across personal prejudices and notions and setting forth to, at the least, educate myself lest my ignorance interfere with in guiding homosexuality and the LGBTQIA+ community towards social justice.” “Through Parents-Teacher Association (PTA) meetings, sensitize parents on issues of LGBTQIA+ community and gender nonconforming students, to ensure supportive families,” the court said. Asserting that the issue involved requires regular monitoring and follow up, the court decided to keep the petition pending and adjourned the matter to August 31 for passing further orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dont-try-to-change-sexual-orientation-of-lgbtqa-hc/articleshow/83321571.cms||Suresh Kumar

The restaurant where I work starts dine-in service and I cannot wait to work again. The last two months were terrifying and I hope this is and to it,” Pawgi, who works as a server at a restaurant in Shivajinagar, told TOI. Sashvat Vinze was headed for Mumbai to resume work. “I feel even trains should have started. Trains are more economical means of transport,” Vinze said. As reported by TOI, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) and Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) had started operations on Sunday, though to a cold response, after a gap of over two months. Officials of both the transport utilities said the response to their service was much better on Monday. Though the usual crowd at the Swargate bus terminus was missing, an official of the state transport body told TOI that the overall passenger traffic on Monday was decent. The authorities expect the number of passengers and buses on roads to go above 50% by the end of the week. “Buses from Pune are transporting passengers to all districts. From Tuesday, the advance booking system will also start. The maximum number of buses are plying on the Mumbai-Solapur routes,” an MSRTC official said. The PMPML operated 416 buses across 179 routes in the city on Monday. “The passengers’ response was good and we expect it to improve in the days to come. By next week, there will be more buses on the roads,” a senior PMPML official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/buses-start-rolling-again-msrtc-advance-booking-from-today/articleshow/83323581.cms||Joy Sengupta

A senior official with the Central Railway said, “One can expect two trains — Deccan Queen and the Deccan Express — to start this month. After assessing the response, the number of trains will be increased.” The recent relaxations announced by the state government has allowed public transport, like buses, to operate. The inter-city trains were suspended last month because of low passenger traffic. The senior railway official said, “The passenger traffic on inter-city trains was disappointing and so they were suspended. The trains would resume if the passenger traffic is good.” Atish Golwarkar, a private firm employee, “My office is in Mumbai and I have been called to work from next week. In the absence of trains, I shall have to travel either by MSRTC bus or my own car. Both options are expensive.” Jagdish Natare, a regular Pune-Mumbai commuter, said, “The rail authorities should seriously consider starting the inter-city train services.” An official from the Pune railway division said, “As far as local trains from Pune are concerned, the government needs to give permission.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Young professionals raise over Rs 2 crore for Covid-hit||HYDERABAD: A casual online discussion among 17 young professionals, who incidentally did not meet one another in person, to help Covid-19 patients and their families has led to mobilisation of Rs 2.17 crore in just 40 days. This is perhaps the highest-ever Covid-19 fund facilitated by a small group of IT and start-up professionals in Hyderabad. The professionals, who hail from different strata of society but are joined together through their start-up ecosystem, created an online Covid-19 fund on April 22 linking donors directly with those in need of help. The team facilitates donors a platform to deposit money directly into the accounts of individual patients who do not have funds to meet the exorbitant hospitalisation costs. As on June 7, as many as 4,254 donors have contributed Rs 2,17,30,571 to 312 Covid-19 patients and their families. Even as the funds pour in, new requests keep piling up. Still, 31 requests for help are pending. About 750 families received groceries and essentials as their incomes suffered a dent due to lockdown. The online platform works in such a way that no third party, including the team members, is involved. Once a person in need of funds makes a request on the online platform, the team verifies it with hospital. Once satisfied that the person seeking help is genuine and has no money to pay hospital bills, the request is made live on the portal. The donors have the choice to select anyone from the list of people seeking help and directly deposit money into their account. Once the target money required for a patient is met, the link is deactivated. Donors have the choice to fund NGOs too. The team comprises Ibrahim Khan, Shazad Ahmad, Arunima, Inthiyaz, Vibha, Udaya, Afzal, Sivaji, Shruti, Vivekananda HR, Aditya Kothari, Archana, Diwakar, Jelam B, Madhavan, Harshbir and Shivangi. “It all started from a WhatsApp group. Now, the campaign has reached a scalable stage,” said Shazad, adding that it was an incredible journey. Vivekananda told TOI that when they launched it, he was worried. “I felt very helpless initially. There may be many who want to do something but don’t know how to. We set up a simple WhatsApp group for getting people to come together and help. This soon became a platform for many to help those in distress,” he said. Explaining the reason behind the campaign, Ibrahim said due to financial constraints and the high costs of private medical care, a lot of people are struggling to pay their hospital bills. “The idea of ‘by the people, for the people’ worked well for the initiative. We are common people who have come together to provide financial aid for others when they need it the most,” Ibrahim said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/young-pros-raise-over-rs-2-cr-for-covid-hit/articleshow/83325494.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Saket school shows door to EWS students, cites fund crunch||NEW DELHI: Stating that the “unprecedented situation of Covid-19 has caused financial stress and lack of funds,” a private school has asked children studying under the economically weaker section (EWS) to take admission in a government school. Gyan Bharti School in Saket has sent emails to around 19 students who were promoted from Class X to Class XI. With the school being built on government land, it is their duty to provide free education to the children till they complete class XII, claim parents. TimesViewSchools, like most other concerns, have suffered due to Covid-19. But that does not give them the right to break rules and throw out EWS category students, who would have suffered as much if not more. In any case, how would the fees of 11 students help the fortunes of the school? Such insensitive measures must be immediately stopped. Authorities should take action against the school for profiting from govt largesse, then failing to keep their part of the deal.All India Parents’ Association (AIPA) has written a complaint to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asking him to take action. One of the parents told TOI, “I would have understood if the child was not doing well or causing problems in the school. But my child is on par with the other children. He wants to study science and clear his NEET. As the entire family was affected by Covid, we could not check the email. We got to know about it when one of my son’s friends called and told him that streams had been allotted. We tried logging in the portal but couldn’t. We thought there must have been some mistake, but we later got to know that they were planning this.” Section 12 (1)(C) of the Right to Education Act reserves 25% of the seat for children belonging to the EWS/DG category. The parent has submitted an application to the school but is yet to hear anything from them. “My child is now in stress, he has been asking me if they will ever reply. I don’t know what to tell him. They have studied in the school for long and now, it will be difficult to change their environment all of a sudden,” she said. These children have been studying in the school since nursery class. The school did not respond to the email sent by TOI. However, one of its senior officials requesting anonymity said that these matters should not be sensationalised. “We have to find a way to help the students. We are ready to help them and are not playing with their careers. The issue is in the purview of discussion,” the official said. Meanwhile, a letter by AIPA president, Ashok Agarwal, stated, “It is submitted that the rules framed by Delhi government and the RTE Act 2009 also provide that all schools, which are on DDA allotted land, should provide free education to all the EWS children up to Class 12. But action by the school in not allowing admission in Class 11 and providing free education up to class 12 is not just illegal and arbitrary but also discriminatory and tantamount to contempt of Delhi High Court order.” Agarwal, an advocate, said that both students and parents were worried and not in a position to pay fees and hence, the government should intervene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/school-shows-door-to-ews-students-cites-fund-crunch/articleshow/83321580.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Property owners move HC over Attapur land sale deeds||HYDERABAD: Over 70 petitions have been filed in the high court from Attapur property owners questioning the action of the state in cancelling sale deeds of small house plots, which people had bought two decades ago. According to them, the state and the waqf board are trying to harm them by declaring these areas as waqf land in a clandestine manner without any notice. The HC asked the authorities not to take any coercive action for four weeks. “The state made unlawful amendments to the Registrations Act and brought in Rule 261 K and Rule 243 through its GO MS No 121 on June 1, 2016, and equipped itself with powers to be used against poor people behind their backs,” claimed A Kumar Goud and B Lavanya, whose petitions have come up before a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, on Monday. Their counsel Amancharla V Gopal Rao argued that the Registrations Act was a central law and the state cannot bring in unilateral changes this way. “If a state wants to amend this central Act, there are only two ways. Either Parliament has to amend the Act or the President has to accord assent to the changes,” the counsel said. He revealed interesting things about the land whose total extent was a little more than seven acres. The state and waqf board were claiming this land. But more than 70 persons had bought tiny extents ranging from 75 square yards to 100 yards from one S Hanumanth Reddy, the counsel said. “The state and the waqf had lost their cases in civil courts, high court, and even the Supreme Court. And now they chose this deceitful way after they lost their case in the Supreme Court in 2019,” the counsel contended. Suddenly on March 19, 2021, the waqf and registration department officials had executed a cancellation deed in respect of all plots declaring the registrations made in favour of the 70 plot owners as invalid. And, none of the plot owners were notified about this change. “What is more interesting is the fact that the registrations in favour of these plot owners were approved by the same waqf board officials and registered by the registration officials all these years,” Gopal Rao said. “We have made the central government also a respondent because the Centre has to come on record and inform this court whether the action of the state in bringing in such unilateral changes to a Central Act is a valid exercise of power,” he said. The bench issued notices to the state, the waqf board, the registrations department, and the central government and asked them to file their counters within four weeks. “Till then, do not take any coercive action against the petitioners,” the bench said. Waqf board counsel Abu Akram too assured the court that they would not take any coercive action till then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/property-owners-move-hc-over-attapur-land-sale-deeds/articleshow/83325557.cms||---

Most shops had sanitisers in place at entry points, with staffers telling customers to wear masks and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Manjitsingh Ajwani, who runs a shop in Ravivar Peth, fixed a plastic sheet at the counter to avoid direct contact with customers. Ajwani said, “I tell customers to wear mask and avoid crowding at the counter. It is essential that every person follows the measures to minimise the possibility of spread of the virus,” he added. Sanjay Talegaonkar, who runs a jewellery shop near Sonya Maruti Chowk, said, “We have kept hand sanitizers at the entrance and have told our employees to wear masks at all times. We have kept adequate distance between two counters so as to ensure social distancing. The footfall is increasing, which is a good sign as the shops were closed for almost for two months. We are telling customers to visit the shop within the stipulated time so as to avoid rush.” Sohil Memon, who runs a hardware shop near Bohari Ali, has tied a rope at the entrance to prevent customers from reaching the counters directly. “We are telling customers to enter the shop after temperature checks,” Memon said. The traders’ associations said that they have told their members to prevent crowding inside the shops and, if possible, provide time slots to customers. Sachin Nivangune, president, Pune District Retailers Association, said, “We are thankful to the administration for increasing business timings, but at same time we have cautioned shopkeepers about possible increase in footfall and have told them to take appropriate measures. The shops should be shut strictly at 4pm. The shopkeepers must initiate steps to prevent unnecessary crowding and avoid entertaining customers not wearing masks,” he said. Meanwhile, local civic ward offices have formed social media groups of traders to create awareness about Covid norms. “We have initially started with creating awareness, which will continue for the next two-three days. Shopkeepers flouting Covid norms will face action,” said an official attached to the Dhankwadi-Sahakarnagar civic ward office. Official from the anti-encroachment department of the PMC said, “The squads will conduct surprise visits in the markets to check whether the traders are following norms and adhering to social distancing. People should also continue to wear face cover,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/buzz-returns-to-markets-with-extended-timings/articleshow/83323609.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Kochi||Kerala: Plea in high court seeks efficient probe||KOCHI: A petition has been filed before the high court seeking a probe into Kodakara black money case by crime branch or a special investigation team (SIT) headed by an ADGP of Kerala Police. The petition was filed by Isacc Varghese, president of Palakkad-based All Kerala Anti-Corruption and Human Rights Protection Council, through advocate BH Mansoor. Seeking a detailed probe, the petitioner contends that there is no progress in the police investigation with regard to the source of the hawala money, allegedly around Rs 3.5 crore, and the persons behind the transactions. Though BJP state organizing secretary M Ganesh and other local leaders were questioned, no arrests have been made yet, the petition said while stating that the money was allegedly brought from Karnataka and transported to candidates during election campaign. Even though an FIR was registered, police have so far not conducted any investigation to unearth the entire racket behind the black money transactions, the petitioner has alleged. Persons involved in these transactions are highly influential and police has not conducted any scientific investigation, including polygraph or narcoanalysis of suspected persons, nor collected call details of the arrested persons, the petition said. There are interstate ramifications in the black money transactions and it is alleged that the transactions were carried out using a helicopter used for election campaigning of BJP by its state president, argues the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/plea-in-hc-seeks-efficient-probe/articleshow/83319354.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: ‘Severe Covid can hit gray matter volume in the brain’||HYDERABAD: Severe Covid-19 can reduce the gray matter volume of the brain, warn city neurologists. While mild to moderate cases do not have impact on the brain, those admitted to hospital and on mechanical ventilation have developed neuro problems, including reduction in the volume of gray matter, which is vital for processing information in the brain. Neurologists say that the volume of the gray matter in the frontal lobe of the brain is reduced when severe Covid-19 patients are kept on ventilation support to supply oxygen to the body. In patients without supplemental oxygen, there is no change in the volume of the gray matter. Referring to an international study on how reduction in gray matter causes severe disability post discharge, Dr P Ranganadham, senior consultant neurosurgeon at Sunshine hospitals, Gachibowli, told TOI that gray matter abnormalities will affect the function of neurons and communication. “Covid-19 is found to have impact on gray matter volume in important brain locations. This reduction is noticed particularly in patients with fever. In patients with no symptoms, the volume is not affected at all,” he said adding that those with neurological complications triggered by Covid-19 should take follow-up medical advice for at least six months. Dr Ranganadham said in some patients, high levels of disability is noticed at discharge or even at six months after discharge. This is because the frontal lobe of the brain is involved. “As smell and taste are often affected before the Covid-19 turns full bloom, a particular part of the brain called olfactory gyrus gets affected first. Covid-19 patients particularly those recovered after ventilation support should be careful and watch out for post-Covid-19 symptoms if any,” he warned. According to Dr Varun Reddy Gundluru, consultant neurologist, Yashoda hospitals, Malakpet, Covid-19 infection has gone far from becoming an isolated respiratory infection to a disorder with varied systemic manifestations. Long-term effects are being seen on the brain and other organs. “Patients, who have been admitted with moderate to severe Covid-19, can continue to have problems in memory, concentrating on tasks given to them, and slowness in their activities. We have seen patients presenting with mood disturbances, hallucinations, and other cognitive issues,” he said adding that this may be be linked to changes in the brain at the level of gray matter volume. City neurologists point out that one in eight severe Covid-19 cases undergo complications of the brain and the central nervous system, leading to mood swings and anger in the recovered patients. The problem is further complicated in overweight or obese patients. In some cases, reduction in gray matter can cause temporary disability..

Accordingly, the bail plea of Ankit Chaudhary, accused in a murder case related to the violence, was dismissed by additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav. The matter pertained the alleged murder of Aamin, whose body was found at a nullah in north-east Delhi. Chaudhary through his counsel argued that he had been implicated by the investigating agency merely to hide the “administrative failure of the state in preventing/controlling the communal riots” that took place in Delhi between February 24, 2020 and February 26, 2020. The additional public prosecutor, however, contended that his location was traced to the scene of crime on the date of incident on February 25, 2020. The prosecution further submitted that the accused was in touch with other co-accused persons, including the members of a WhatsApp group called “Kattar Hindu Etka”. The order noted that though he might not have been a member of the group, he had admitted that he had telephonic interactions with the co-accused persons. “Whether the interaction over the phone was incidental or otherwise cannot be decided at this stage. A perusal of the location of deceased prior to his death and the location of applicant at that time is found to be at the same spot,” it added. The court, therefore, considered the facts and circumstances of the case in totality and gravity of offence. “And the fact that the same witnesses were residents of the same locality and if released on bail at this stage, he can threaten or intimidate the witnesses. As such, I am not inclined to admit the applicant on bail at this stage,” it held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/allegations-extremely-grave-court-denies-bail-to-man-in-riot-case/articleshow/83321638.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kerala: BJP to take to the streets to counter allegations||THRISSUR: BJP state unit on Monday announced its decision to take to the streets to counter a series of allegations that several party leaders are facing in connection with the recent highway heist case at Kodakara, and in reported attempts to influence a political candidate at Manjeswaram and tribal leader C K Janu. Addressing media persons, BJP state vice-president A N Radhakrishnan said blatant efforts were going on in the state to make a complainant into an accused and the party would launch agitations from Thursday against the LDF government’s alleged attempts to destroy BJP. He asserted that the party would not allow plans to attack party state president K Surendran by isolating him. Police are conducting probes in a totally unilateral manner and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan was acting like the head of a ‘quotation gang’ engaged in operations to destroy BJP in the state, Radhakrishnan alleged. The chief minister appears to be drunk on power and was violating all democratic principles, he said. Sympathizers of Communist parties have been posted as officers in the special investigating team probing the highway robbery case, Radhakrishnan alleged. Replying to questions, he said that the money reported to have been looted from the car at Kodakara does not belong to BJP, and the party did not have complaints about the money loss. He said that party funds changed hands only through digital transactions and BJP never used black money. If police feel that the money looted at Kodakara was hawala money, why are they not entrusting the probe to agencies like the Enforcement Directorate, he asked.  Leaders, including the chief minister, should divulge the amounts they spent during the elections before hurling allegations against BJP, he said. Radhakrishnan said that the party had assigned Dharmarajan only to bring election materials, and not any cash. He demanded that police divulge details of the accused in Dharmarajan’s complaint, and their political affiliations. Reports suggest that some of the accused had links with CPM and CPI, he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bjp-to-take-to-the-streets-to-counter-allegations/articleshow/83319380.cms||---

---||Lucknow||‘Long Covid’ stretches beyond negative test||Lucknow: Many people are visiting hospitals with complaints that even after recovering from Covid-19 and testing negative for infection, they continue to have symptoms of the disease. According to doctors, this condition is called ‘long Covid’ or ‘post-Covid syndrome’ in which a person continues to suffer from one or more symptoms associated with Covid-19. These symptoms may include moderate fever, body ache, breathlessness, cough, chest congestion, chronic fatigue, joint pain, headache or insomnia. At least two such cases are coming to King George’s Medical University, Era’s Lucknow Medical College and Hospitals, Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences and Civil Hospital daily. Head of medicine department at KGMU, Prof Virendra Atam, said: “Covid-19 mainly affects the respiratory system but also causes damage to liver, heart, nervous system and kidneys. Long Covid means that a person no longer has novel coronavirus infection but continues to suffer from the impact on other organs. These ailments take 4-12 weeks to heal, which depends on lifestyle, diet, age and comorbidity.” Pulmonologist at Balrampur Hospital, Dr Anad Gupta, said, “These patients should take vaccine after 6-8 weeks after recovery and do breathing exercises regularly. They should take short or long walk to increase lung capacity and physical strength. It also encourages blood flow to organs, resulting in quick recovery.” Dietician at RMLIMS, Dr Poonam Tiwari, said people should include green vegetables and seasonal fruits in diet. “Keep away from junk and oily food. In case of cough, one should avoid sour fruits and curd at night.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/long-covid-stretches-beyond-negative-test/articleshow/83323663.cms||---

Reacting to this during the team-nine meeting here on Monday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on said that the effort will be helpful in speeding up vaccination in UP and directed officials to provide all the possible help to the groups and follow up their case with the central government. Meanwhile, as many as 4.5 lakh vaccinations on Monday took the total number of Covid-19 doses administered in the state to 2.07 crore according to data from the Cowin Portal updated till 9 pm. This is the highest number of vaccinations recorded since the launch of the Mission June on Tuesday last. The day was also marked by Pink Booths getting functional in the state. As many as 150 pink booths dedicated only for women have been set up across districts. An official spokesperson revealed that more than 30 lakh persons in the 18-44 age group have taken the coronavirus vaccine since jabs for this category opened on May 1. Expressing satisfaction over the numbers, CM Yogi said, “Vaccination is the only Raksha Kavach to prevent coronavirus infection. The Government of Uttar Pradesh, in collaboration with the Central Government, is determined to provide vaccine-cover to all citizens at the earliest.” Officials said that vaccination for the economically weaker sections is in final states and the drive will begin after June 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/help-industry-join-mission-june-yogi/articleshow/83323714.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur salons open without meeting staff-client vaccine clause||KOLHAPUR: Barber shops and salons in Kolhapur city have started operations without waiting for their employees to get vaccinated. They are not even checking if the customers have taken the vaccine jabs yet. The gym operators, meanwhile, have decided to keep their establishments shut till all their staffers get the jabs. As per the Level 4 criteria, gyms, spas and salons can operate till 4pm every weekday with not more than 50% occupancy. The employees and the clients at these establishments must be vaccinated — though it has not been specified if they need to be fully or partially vaccinated. It is understood that at least the first jab is mandatory. The establishment owners, however, are finding it difficult to get the vaccines for their employees mainly because only one private hospital is conducting the vaccination for the 18-44 age group. This hospital is facing a shortage of doses. Vinod Sonawane, the manager of a Tarabai Park-based gym, said, “We have asked our staff to get the shots from the private hospital. The hospital charges Rs 850 per dose. Many of our employees have been out of work as the gyms were closed. Currently, we cannot afford to bear the cost of the vaccine. Moreover, the vaccination schedule is booked for the next six to 10 days.” Farukh Desai, district vaccination officer, said, “Once we get more doses, we can declare the staff of the establishments that are allowed to open as a priority group. Currently, there is a shortage.” Salons were seen operating without taking proper precautions as customers were made to wait, the staffers hardly used masks and sanitised the chairs and equipment. Pandit Pawar, the head of the anti-encroachment department, said, “Since we are yet to get the orders, we have not started taking action against violators. As per the earlier guidelines, the salons must operate on an appointment basis. Also, as per new rules, at least the staff must be vaccinated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-salons-open-without-meeting-staff-client-vax-clause/articleshow/83316973.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||To India via Africa: Drug cartels chart new route||HYDERABAD: In the past one month, 10 peddlers from African nations were caught in Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru airports trying to smuggle in 53 kilos of heroin worth over Rs 300 crore. Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sleuths, who played a key role in a majority of these arrests, believe that disruption of peddling network in Afghanistan-Pakistan-India border areas due to pandemic and lockdown in India have forced the gangs to opt for a circuitous smuggling route from Afghanistan to India via Africa. Two women peddlers from Uganda and Zambia, who were caught by DRI sleuths at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport on Saturday and Sunday in possession of 12 kilos of heroin, arrived on a week-long business visa to Hyderabad. While it was first trip to India for one of them, the second peddler had visited Mumbai in the last week of April for a week which the enforcement agencies now believe was a trip for a similar purpose. “The two women are mules. Their stay was booked in small hotels in the city for less than a week and the handover of heroin is supposed to happen at these hotels. One of the peddlers said she came on a business visa to see Charminar,” a DRI official said. Since May first week, eight peddlers from Africa were caught trying to smuggle 41 kilos of heroin in Chennai, Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai airports. Customs Overseas Intelligence Network and DRI officials noticed the activity of heroin smuggling through passenger flights via Doha from Johannesburg in late April after a majority of the states in India started imposing lockdown to control the spread of the pandemic. “We suspect that pandemic has adversely affected the Afghan-Pak-India across the border land route heroin smuggling activity and the lockdown has made it difficult to ship the contraband to metro cities. So to cash in on the demand, some gangs operating from either Delhi or Mumbai took the longer route involving air travel,” said a senior customs official. A Chennai customs official said the contraband is suspected to have been made in Africa after receiving opium from Afghanistan via Iran, Iraq and East African nations with the help of Somalian pirates. “We suspect that heroin seized from all African peddlers at various international airports in the past one month was made at the same place,” a DRI official said. The agencies are now trying to zero in on Indian gang members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/to-india-via-africa-drug-cartels-chart-new-route/articleshow/83325600.cms||Mahesh Buddi

We will start the bus service whenever the orders come,” Shubhangi Shirsath, MSRTC depot manager at Panchavati, said. The MSRTC handles the bus service in Nashik city, but has been claiming that the city transportation is burdening the coffers of the cash-starved public transport utility. The MSRTC is hoping the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) takes over the city bus service, but the latter is yet to do the needful. Now, when all the markets have opened up, the situation for the common man is quite difficult. “The price of petrol is high and there are no jobs due to Covid situation. In such case when the markets and trade has opened up, the MSRTC should start the city bus service to help us,” Sanjay Patil, a garment shop worker from Eklahara colony, said, The shops and establishments have opened up for the first time after the second wave of Covid has come under control. “I have a job to do in Ambad. When restrictions were on I used tocommute by autorickshaw and they charged exponentially. The MSRTC is the only solution for us.

---||Mumbai||MVA govt forms 13-member panel to look into NDA’s cooperative bank move||MUMBAI: The state government on Monday set up a 13-member committee headed by cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil to study the impact of the amendment to the Banking Regulation Act on urban cooperative banks in the state. The move came a week after NCP president Sharad Pawar’s suggestion in this regard. Besides Patil, cabinet members Balasaheb Thorat, Rajendra Shingane, Hasan Mushriff, Amit Deshmukh, Gulabrao Patil, Sandipan Bhumre, Shankarrao Gadakh, Vishwajee Kadam, cooperation secretary Arvind Kumar, MSC bank administrator Vidyadhar Anaskar, Vishwas Thakur and cooperation commissioner Anil Kawade will be on committee which has been asked to submit its report within three months. A week ago, Pawar had, expressed the fear that following the amendment to the act, the RBI would have greater control over urban cooperative banks. While there are 2.5 lakh cooperative societies in the state, 458 are urban cooperative banks. Last year, the NDA government amended the Act to protect the interest of depositors, giving the RBI more supervisory powers and powers to initiate schemes for reconstruction and amalgamation of ailing banks so that depositors do not lose their money. Maharashtra has seen rampant irregularities in more than half a dozen urban cooperative banks, including Mumbai’s PMC bank. The NCP has alleged that the Central government wants to gain control over urban cooperation banks. The amended act prohibits released of unsecured loans or advances to the directors and private companies, where either the chairman or directors are interested parties. It also provides for better and professional management of cooperative banks in order to protect the interests of depositors. A senior NCP leader claimed the amendment has been made to weaken the NCP, as most of the urban cooperative banks in the state are directly or indirectly controlled by the party. “Over the last six decades, Sharad Pawar has spread the network of cooperative banks across the state. These banks are supporting farmers and small businesses,” he said. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik condemned the amendment, saying it would destroy the entire cooperative movement, particularly in Maharashtra. “We built the cooperative movement in Maharashtra for strengthening the rural economy. By the new amendment, the RBI will gain more control over cooperative banks,” Malik alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-mva-govt-forms-13-member-panel-to-look-into-ndas-co-op-bank-move/articleshow/83323858.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

He added that Surendran’s son may be innocent in Kodakara case and that he doesn’t know the truth about the case. If his son is innocent, I can understand the mental trauma of his son, Surendran will also be realizing it, he wrote. Arjun said he too had faced a similar situation when Surendran hurled baseless allegations against him in 2013 when Thiruvanchoor was the home minister. “He alleged that I had some business interests in Gujarat and had talks with some ministers there. He knew there was not an iota of truth in the allegations he raised against me. Despite that he wanted to put me under suspicion to force my father into a defensive position. He may not know how many people were mentally depressed by his crookedness,” said Arjun. Arjun also quoted from the Ramayana ‘everyone reaps the outcome of good deeds and bad deeds’ to describe Surendran’s current situation. Arjun claimed that Surendran takes on political leaders by cooking up stories about their children and casting aspersions on them before society. Nobody thinks about the mental trauma of their family members, he wrote. He wished that Surendran may succeed in chucking this bad habit that he uses for temporary benefits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/surendran-reaping-rewards-of-karma/articleshow/83319401.cms||---

The shops opened their shutters after 7 am and even citizens made the most of the opportunity. Some feared that a future rise in the number of cases could again make the administration impose the restrictions. As the day progressed, the many city streets got choked with bumper-to-bumper traffic on several occasions. Barricades erected at several places to restrict the movement of the vehicles — in order to decongest the space — did not help. Many were seen making purchases in utensil stores, cloth shops as well as stationery shops. Rush was also seen at electronics stores where people wanted to buy new cellphones and accessories for work/study from home. Some just wanted to get their devices repaired. “We were waiting for more than a month to make some important garment purchases. We chose to do it on Monday as the uncertainty of a third Covid wave looms large. We did not want to get stuck again,” said Netra Joshi, a homemaker. “The schools have begun and I was in need of an additional device for my child. Now we will be able to do our work independently,” said Ramesh Sharma, who works for a company in Ambad. Social distancing norms were disregarded though people did not fail to wear masks to avoid penalties. Sharp at 4pm, the shops downed the shutters. Police and the Nashik Municipal Corporation officials were seen ensuring that establishments closed on time. There was also a good presence of the passengers at the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus terminals at Old CBS, New CBS and even the Mahamarg bus stand. “We deployed buses to Pune, Aurangabad, Mumbai, Borivali, Nandurbar, Dhule, Jalgaon and many other locations. A large number of people took the buses,” said KS Patil, the divisional traffic officer of the MSRTC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-citys-markets-bustle-with-activity-on-unlock-day-1/articleshow/83317068.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||T falls behind most in school education grading||Hyderabad: Telangana fell behind most others in the recently released Performance Grading Index (PGI) report, curated to assess the school education system across India’s states and union territories (UTs). While several states registered a 10% to 20% improvement in their annual grades, Telangana’s score saw only a marginal 1.98% jump — from 757 in 2018-19 to 772 in 2019-20. The PGI scores for 2019-20 were approved and released by the Union education minister, Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, on June 6. Standing behind 20 states and UTs across Grade I++, Grade I+ and Grade I categories, Telangana was clubbed with Goa, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Lakshadweep, Manipur and Sikkim in Grade II (score range of 751 to 800 points) — states that saw their PGI scores improve by 0.1% to 5% in 2019-20. Teachers attributed this poor show to the state’s failure to improve infrastructure and facilities in government schools and fill vacant teacher posts, among other things. “Over the past few years, the government made no effort to improve infrastructure and facilities in government schools, which accommodates majority of the students. Only residential schools were paid attention. Similarly, the state also failed to fill vacant teacher posts. How will its grade improve without teachers and infrastructure,” asked Chava Ravi, a government teacher and general secretary of the United Teachers Federation. The first PGI report, introduced by the central government, was published for 2017-18 in the year 2019. Schools are judged against a set of 70 parameters that are assigned a weightage of either 10 or 20 points.  The recent report shows that that Telangana stands at 21st position in the country in creating infrastructure and facilities for school education (it scored 113 out of 150 points), 26th in equity, including the provision of girl’s toilets (210 points out of 230), 26th in governance processes with 238 points, 19th in access to education with 69 points, and 12th in learning outcomes with142 points. “At least for the next year, the state should aim to perform better by improving infrastructure. It should concentrate more on government schools as lakhs of students study there,” said M Srinivas, a government teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-falls-behind-most-in-school-education-grading/articleshow/83321778.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Reconsider plan to post MBAs on admin posts: Docs to CM||Lucknow: Days after Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that the government doctors should be posted on clinical and patientcare duty and management graduates should be appointed on administrative posts, the doctors’ association has urged the CM to reconsider the announcement. While the Provincial Medical Services Association (PMSA) has convened meetings of its state and district executive bodies, it has written a 10-point letter to the government on why the proposed move could be a bad idea. “Doctors have proved they can fight under all circumstances to weed out polio, Japanese Encephalitis and even Covid. Many doctors lost their lives in fight against Covid. In such a situation, roping in management graduates to manage medical facilities will demoralise doctors,” PMSA general secretary Dr Amit Singh and president Dr Sachin Vaish said in the letter. “It has been found that despite working to the best of their abilities, administrative officials in districts have been exploiting and humiliating doctors and even taking credit for their efforts. In Covid pandemic, data management done by doctors made assessment easy,” said Dr Vaish. “Management consultants are already being deployed under the national health mission at chief medical officers’ office in districts. But deploying them on technical posts will disturb the entire healthcare system which is against the public interest. I am sure even the CM will not want that to happen,” said Dr Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/reconsider-plan-to-post-mbas-on-admin-posts-docs-to-cm/articleshow/83323783.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Govt ditches most popular drugs in new treatment plan||MUMBAI: The central health ministry has issued an evidence-based treatment plan for Covid-19 patients, junking many medicines that had during the course of the pandemic become household names and achieved record sales. Antiviral favipiravir, which was India’s largest selling drug in April, does not find a mention in the nine-page document put out on the website of the directorate general of health services (DGHS). The other antiviral, remdesivir, has been recommended for limited use—only on prescription by a “senior doctor”—it is described as an “experimental drug with a potential to harm”. New prescription based on evidence makes doctors happyFor the past 15 months, most Covid-19 patients in India, no sooner than they were diagnosed, have got a prescription of six to eight medicines. “The poly-pharmacy phenomenon was irrational. We are extremely happy that these guidelines have been drawn up on robust evidence,” said Dr S P Kalantri from Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha. The guidelines mention, in all, four medicines as necessary for severe Covid patients: Oxygen, steroids, tocilizumab (not all but based on certain blood parameters) and anti-coagulants for patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, etc. The guidelines make it clear that medicines are meant only for moderately or severely ill Covid-19 patients who need hospitalisation. For those with mild Covid, only medicines to reduce fever and cough are advised. Commonly prescribed antibiotics such as azithromycin and doxycycline are missing from the list. Ditto with ivermectin, the antiparasitic drug meant to control filariasis or elephant's foot. Pharmacy best-sellers like zinc supplements and vitamins A, B, C and D are also not mentioned. Previous protocols by both Union and state governments always mentioned a 15-day or month-long course of zinc and vitamin C and D. World Health Organisation chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan welcomed India’s “evidence-based guidelines”. She said they were “simple, rational” and would serve as a clear guide for physicians. A global health expert from McGill University in Canada, Dr Madhu Pai, said, “Rational, scientific guidelines are critical for saving lives, and I am delighted to see these new evidence-based Covid guidelines by DGHS, MOHFW.” He said they are backed by science and avoid irrational and unproven medicines. “This will not only save lives, but also reduce costs for patients,” he added. In Mumbai, pulmonologist Dr Lancelot Pinto said he could stop being “apologetic’’ to his Covid-19 patients. “I have never prescribed ivermectin, doxycycline or favipiravir to my Covid patients, but I have had to explain to many of them why I wasn’t prescribing these drugs. Some would be jittery about it, but now I can show them these guidelines,” he said. On the negative side, a senior doctor from a BMC hospital said the guidelines don’t include advisories for patients with comorbidities. Another doctor said while the Indian Council of Medical Research usually puts out treatment protocols (during Covid), this has come from the DGHS. “A regular doctor could be confused about which governmental agency to follow,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/govt-ditches-most-popular-drugs-in-new-treatment-plan/articleshow/83323822.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Dehradun||Pandemic, 2 cyclones & summit, team makes 'toughest' Everest climb||UTTARKASHI: Braving looming threat of Covid and adverse weather conditions brought by cyclones Tauktae and Yaas, climbers from Uttarkashi’s Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) and Pahalgam’s Jawahar Institute of Mountaineering (JIM) scaled Mount Everest on June 1, barely a couple of days before the limited climbing window for summit attempts was closed by Nepal. Members of the team -- who reached Kathmandu from the Everest base camp on Sunday evening -- recounted to TOI the drama at the top of the world, saying this season had to be the toughest time to climb the mountain. Talking about the challenges faced by them, Colonel Amit Bisht, principal of NIM, who was part of the seven-member joint expedition, said, “This year, 408 permits were issued by Nepal for climbing the Everest. Each climber is usually accompanied by at least one guide or Sherpa, which made the total number of eligible summiteers more than 800. But Covid cases at the Everest base camp and terrible weather conditions caused due to back-to-back cyclones Tauktae and Yaas made the situation far more difficult than previous years. As a result only half of the climbers succeeded in reaching the summit.” Bisht said quite a few climbers had to go back after being detected Covid-positive. "And the emergence of the two cyclones right at the best summiting time -- which is usually from May 20 to May 31 -- upset the plans of many others.” To add to the woes, there were severe snow storms, blinding the team and uprooting their tents. "Progress towards the summit was impacted by the snow storms triggered by the cyclones," Bisht added. “Our aim was to summit the peak around May 24 but we were stopped in our tracks by the cyclones. Winds blowing on the route were very strong and at one point, our tents were blown away.” A big setback came when they had almost reached Camp 3 from where the final ascent begins but the weather had become so bad that they were forced to retreat to Camp 2 and wait for almost 10 days till the weather cleared. In view of the bad weather and the Covid situation, Nepalese authorities in a rare move extended the climbing season – which traditionally ends on May 31 – till June 3. “It was the extension of the climbing window by 3 more days that enabled us to push ahead and reach the peak,” Bisht said, adding that there were many moments of apprehension and doubt – especially while waiting for the weather to clear up – whether they would be able to achieve their goal. “It was deeply satisfying to plant the Indian flag on top of the world's highest mountain amidst such challenging times,” Bisht said.

There are 15 talukas in Nashik district. Nandgaon, Deola and Niphad talukas do not have a single village that had managed to remain Covid free. The twelve other talukas have had at least one village that has remained Covid-free so far. While the majority of the villages are in remote or tribal areas, some villages have ensured best practices to reduce the chances of people contracting the infection. “There are 168 villages that did not have a single Covid patient. Each of these villages has a population of about 3,500 on an average,” said Dr Kapil Aher, the district health officer (DHO).  Across the district, the Peth taluka has the highest number of villages (35) that have remained Covid-free so far. Nashik taluka, the district headquarter, has two villages in this category. “Being in the tribal areas, the residents have very few requirements. They can usually manage from their own resources. So they are not dependent on others — barring medical help,” said Aher. “We carried out disinfectant spraying across the village in 10 days. Some non-governmental organisations helped us by providing soaps, oil, and other items to the residents,” said Ramesh Darode, the sarpanch of Dhanpada in Peth taluka. “All the residents, who came home after working in other areas, were quarantined in small huts in the village for several days. After ensuring that they were in good health, they were allowed into their homes,” Darode said. Aher also said the administration was considering completing vaccination in these villages. Meanwhile. chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a dialogue on Monday with the villagers of Nashik division that have made their villages Covid-free. Ghanshyam Pawar, the sarpanch of Navi Bej village, in tribal-dominated Kalwan taluka, talked of his experience in the village through video conference. Pawar said all villagers stuck together for a common cause of containing the spread of Covid. “In March 2021, when 74 cases were detected in the village, we decided to observe a lockdown. Those returning to the village were quarantined in a school. We continued to test people, especially the ones who have to move out for jobs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-dist-168-villages-have-stayed-free-of-covid-so-far/articleshow/83317053.cms||Abhilash Botekar

With the speaker deciding to allow the member to raise the question on the floor of the House, the opposition members boycotted the question hour in protest. Prasenan had said in the question that “the opposition had scuttled the flood relief and Covid prevention activities of the government”. When the question hour began, opposition leader V D Satheesan had raised an objection on the question which was listed in the schedule as the third question. He said the question has been allowed to target the opposition and it should not be allowed. However, the opposition leader was pacified by the speaker with an assurance that it would be looked into. After taking up the two first questions, the speaker allowed the third question which was objected to by the opposition members. Satheesan sought a ruling from the speaker whether such a question can be raised in the House. Satheesan said a wrong precedence is being created in the House. However, the speaker denied the opposition members’ demand and called the chief minister for giving the reply to the member.

The Nashik district, as a whole, has had 3.88 lakh Covid patients. Of them, 3.77 lakh have been cured and the district’s recovery rate is pegged at 94.1%. The state recovery average is pegged at 95%. On April 3, the average recovery rate of Nashik district was about 83.8% as the Covid cases had been rising since March. Nashik rural had 82.7% recovery rate then while in the city areas it was 84.7%. In Malegaon it was only 76.6%. Following intense testing and other measures, the recovery rate picked up. By May 5, the recovery rate in the city had risen to 91% and in Malegaon corporation it was 83.6%. The recovery rate in the rural areas was 86.3% then. “There were various issues in providing beds in the city to the patients coming from the rural areas. At times, the patients were forced to prolong their stay in the Covid health centres. Longer time in the Covid facilities automatically affected the recovery figures,” said Dr Ashok Thorat, civil surgeon of Nashik Civil Hospital. However, after the strict restrictions helped contain the disease spread. The recovery rate of Nashik Rural between May 5 and June 6 jumped from 86% to 96.2%. The city’s rate improved to 97.8%. Malegaon corporation recovery rate rose to 95.9% during the same period. District collector Suraj Mandhare cautioned: “While the recovery and positivity rates have improved and the oxygen bed availability has also increased, there are still around 4,00 active cases in the district. Given the multiplying effect of the virus, the numbers could increase rapidly in no time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-dists-recovery-rate-on-a-par-with-state-average/articleshow/83317104.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The forensic experts were collecting samples for DNA analysis, wherever required, the police said. Besides, the company officials had provided with a list of the deceased people, an officer said. “We are in the process of verifying a name and have the remaining 17 names, but identification of the bodies will take some time,” said superintendent of police (SP), Pune rural, Abhinav Deshmukh. Sachin Narayan Borade (36) of Urawade told TOI, “My wife was working in the company’s packaging department. I haven’t heard anything from her since afternoon.” He said, “I work as a helper in another company at Pirangut. I received a call around 4.30pm, saying that there was a fire in the company. I rushed to my wife’s company. I was not allowed to go inside as the fire was raging. The rescue teams took out the bodies in the evening and I was told to visit the Sassoon hospital.” Borade said, “We have our roots in Beed and came to Pune in search of work four years ago.

---||Aurangabad||63% Maha farmers who got loan waiver borrow afresh||Aurangabad: The Maharashtra government’s farm loan waiver scheme helped farmers wipe their slate clean, but 63% of them have again taken loans till May 31 this year. According to a report from the State Level Bankers’ Committee, which has been submitted to the state agriculture minister, crop loans of 31.51 lakh farmers from across Maharashtra were waived off under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Karj Mukti Yojana. Of these, 19.68 lakh or 63% farmers have availed of fresh crop loans. The total amount of fresh crop loans issued this year to these farmers till May 31 is Rs 13,152 crores. Most of these loans are in the range of Rs 25,000 to Rs 75,000 per farmer. State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said, “Our priority while introducing this loan waiver scheme was not only to repay the crop loans, but also to ensure that the farmers are not treated as defaulters. Their CIBIL records should also be good to get new loans.” Bhuse said instructions have been given to the banks to ensure that all needy farmers readily get farm and crop loans, irrespective of whether they have benefited from farm loan waiver schemes. Under the scheme floated by the MVA government, crop loan waiver has been given up to Rs 2 lakh for the amount obtained between April 1, 2015 and March 31, 2019. Eligible farmers with loan amounts of over Rs 2 lakh will have to pay the remaining amount as a one-time settlement. Officials said that loans totalling Rs 20,109 crore have been waived off in the state so far. The scheme has benefited a large number of farmers from the Marathwada region who had faced crop failures due to drought, excess rainfall and even hailstorms. Despite the lockdown, for the fiscal ending March 31, 2021, the state, cooperative as well as private banks have together achieved 77% of the given target by disbursing Rs 47,972 crore crop loans. They had a target of Rs 62,459 crore. For the financial year 2021-22, the annual credit plan (ACP) for crop loans is Rs 55,560 crore, while the potential linked credit plan (PLP) for crop loans has been set at Rs 79,190 crore. Those privy to the development maintained that this year’s ACP is 3% less than last year’s ACP and 22% less as compared to PLP prepared by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/63-maha-farmers-who-got-loan-waiver-borrow-afresh/articleshow/83317166.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Mumbai||Pali Hill residents hire event company to give 1,000 jabs||MUMBAI: In the past, people would hire event managers to organise weddings, birthdays and corporate events. Recently, Pali Hill Residents Association (PHRA) hired one Bandra-based organiser to plan out its vaccination drive over the weekend. Sudhir Mehra, a member of the PHRA, said, “We had planned to vaccinate 1,000 people over a span of two days, which is a large number. If even 200 were to be vaccinated in a day, we would have managed it ourselves. But then we wanted to ensure it was all well planned out and hence had a team of event organisers help out. Even the hospital that was to vaccinate our residents had certain requirements such as setting up tents and booths for vaccination and separate areas for observation, which was all taken care of.” Mehra further said the support staff such as house help, cooks and drivers who wished to be vaccinated needed help with registration on CoWin. Event managers helped them out as well. PHRA paid close to Rs 36,000 to the organisers for two days. Madhu Poplai, secretary of PHRA, said the association collected money for the vaccine—Rs 1,400 per dose—from residents. “Once the money was collected, the organisers were asked to take over. They prepared Excel sheets with names and addresses of the residents to be vaccinated, then worked out slots when each resident would come to take their jab. We had planned it in a way that 50 residents would be vaccinated every hour, so managing them at the spot, checking their details and providing them with water or a snack during the observation period after the jab was all taken care off by the organisers,” said Poplai, adding the area where the vaccine was administered was sanitised well after each person was administered the jab, ensuring all safety protocols were followed. Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray was also seen visiting the venue on Saturday morning. Sonu Chagti, another PHRA member, said as the city has started experiencing pre-monsoon showers, they also had to ensure the seating area created was covered well. “As we held the drive in the premises of Hilltop building at Pali Hill, all the setting up needed to be done systematically with seating for 80 persons, marking out entry-exit points and ensuring everyone stepped out only in the time slot that was given to them,” said Chagti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pali-hill-residents-hire-event-co-to-give-1k-jabs/articleshow/83323894.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||Neighbourhood Vax For 45-Plus: AAP MLAs Take To The Streets||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party’s MLAs took Delhi government’s neighbourhood vaccination campaign across the capital on Tuesday to encourage people aged 45 years and above to get the jab. The government has made arrangements for vaccination at polling booths in 70 wards under this campaign. Cabinet minister Imran Hussain, MLAs Atishi, Dilip Pandey, Sanjeev Jha and others launched the campaign in their constituencies and appealed to residents’ welfare associations, market bodies, NGOs and religious organisations to spread awareness and encourage citizens to get the jab at local polling booths in their assembly constituencies. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday unveiled the special campaign, Jahan Booth, Wahin Vaccine. Hussain went door to door in his Ballimaran constituency, encouraging people to visit the polling booths. “Booth-level officers have begun visiting houses and different teams are encouraging citizens. E-rickshaws have been arranged to carry people to polling booths,” he said, adding that those above 45 years should be vaccinated in four weeks and Delhi government would do the same for those aged 18-44 years. The minister also interacted with vaccine recipients. “This campaign will achieve the goal of 100% vaccination in Delhi. The polling centres are usually near home, which makes walking to these places convenient,” he said. Kalkaji MLA Atishi has started going from house to house to ensure that all 45+ people get the Covid vaccines under this initiative. Besides booth-level officers, a civil defence volunteer and AAP workers will visit houses to encourage people. They will also help people with the registration process. At Kalkaji’s ward number 91, 44 booths are there and 44 AAP teams will visit all homes. Meanwhile, Atishi said no Covaxin shot would be possible from Wednesday in government hospitals and centres for 45+ group because the stock was almost over. Delhi had around 5.5 lakh vaccine doses available for 45+ group until this morning, including 5.5 lakh Covishield and 8,000 Covaxin. Covaxin doses are available for 18-44 years, while the stock of Covishield is yet to be supplied by the Centre. The MLA appealed to the Centre to provide vaccine for the youths as soon as possible. On Monday, 66,082 people were vaccinated — 33,696 got the first dose and 32,386 the second. “So far, 57,33,418 people have been vaccinated, out of which more than 13 lakh have got both doses,” she stated. Atishi said that about 50% of the population above the age of 45 had been vaccinated. But the drive has slowed down and the count is not increasing, she pointed out. “One reason for this is that many people recently had Covid and are not eligible to get the vaccine. Secondly, many people also have a misconception that there can be some harm for getting the vaccine and it should not be administered,” she stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/neighbourhood-vax-for-45-plus-aap-mlas-take-to-the-streets/articleshow/83351703.cms||AlokKNMishra

The speaker ruled that Raja has to remit fine at a rate of Rs 500 per day for five days when he attended the session — May 24, 25, 28, 30 and June 1— as he had to be sworn in again on June 2, after finding that his oath on May 24 was not in accordance to the provisions laid out in the third schedule of the Constitution. As per the Constitution, a member can either swear “in the name of god” or “solemnly affirm” while taking oath. In the case of Raja, who had taken oath in Tamil, he had failed to take the oath in either of the ways laid out in the Constitution. Opposition leader V D Satheesan had raised a point of order in this regard on June 2, and had said that in the past, there were two instances when the members had taken oath not in accordance with the Constitution. He said that in 1960, former MLA R Sugathan and in 2001 by Umesh Challiyil, who had taken his oath in the name of Sri Narayana Guru. Challiyil had lost his case in the Supreme Court and had to remit a hefty fine by way of returning his sitting fees in the assembly, Satheesan had pointed out. However, the speaker on Monday ruled that Raja had made the error as there was a mistake in the statement of oath that was translated and served to him in Tamil from the law department. The chair could seriously examine and take necessary action into how such a grave mistake happened. The speaker also ruled, by referring to court verdicts in this regard, that the member’s vote during this period need not be declared invalid. Raja had taken part in the speaker election and had cast his vote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mla-fined-for-attending-assembly-sans-proper-oath/articleshow/83319487.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Four law students helping Covid patients overcome the crisis||HYDERABAD: A group of four law students under the banner Helping Humans Hyderabad has been in the forefront helping Covid-19 patients in meeting their needs for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds and rare medicines. So far, the group has provided 1,930 beds at hospitals, 2,100 oxygen cylinders, hundreds of medicines including 382 doses of rare medicines like Remdesivir, Amphotericin, Tocilizumab and Itolizumab. The team also airlifted a patient from Patna to Hyderabad for special medical treatment. The group attends to about 400 calls daily from Covid-19 patients and their attendants. These law students, who are assisted by 10 youths on the field, also supply free food and Covid-19 protective gear to the needy. Since the second wave hit Hyderabad, the Helping Humans Hyderabad supplied dinner boxes to 3,600 people and masks to 3,150 people at various government hospitals. The team comprises Mohammad Abdul Yousuf, Lamya Hussani, Ismail Zabiullah and Molshree Totla. “Lack of proper medical assistance and facilities left many people hopeless. Several had lost their lives. Patients were seen helplessly seeking oxygen. If not now, when? If not us, who? We thought together and formed Helping Humans Hyderabad,” said Abdul Yousuf, who leads the young group. Their services reached beyond Hyderabad as well. Patients in Bengaluru, Gujarat, Delhi, Patna and Kerala also received help. The group also received backing from local leaders like Kavita Kalvakuntla and officials like Gajarao Bhupal. Yusuf told TOI that the small initiative that started off with the idea of helping and making a difference to the lives of at least four people now receives about 400 calls per day for help. “We have been working hard to fulfil the requirements of each hand that has asked for help. We have also purchased an oxygen concentrator. We also supply ration to the poor,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-law-students-helping-covid-patients-overcome-the-crisis/articleshow/83321908.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Lucknow||It’s time to shunt double engine govt to sicklines: SP||Lucknow: Attacking the ruling BJP over its claims of “double engine government”, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said the train is stranded in the yard and collecting rust. He said it was time for the train to be shunted to ‘sicklines’ for good. “Even the team of observers which was sent to Lucknow by the BJP’s central leadership has realised that since the days of the government are numbered, there is no point in making amends. The BJP government stood helpless when widespread misery swept the state in the form of Covid-19 pandemic. People were left to die due to the shortage of medicines and lack of treatment,” Akhilesh said. “Those who excel in finding an opportunity in disaster went on a plundering spree. All that the BJP did was to roll out one propaganda after another in the name of governance to divert the attention of the people,” he added. He also took on the UP Chief Minister for his tall claims on zero tolerance towards crime and criminals. He said at least 11 families living in houses near Gorakhnath temple were being pressured to vacate their houses and go elsewhere. “As many as 4,132 illegal firearms were seized but no action was initiated against people who were selling these weapons,” Akhilesh said in a statement on Monday. He cited the recent incidents of the rape of two sisters and their friend in Lakhimpur Kheri, kidnapping and gangrape of a girl in Azamgarh, sexual assault on a student in Izzatnagar while she was out with two classmates and the rape of another girl in Raniganj. “In Achalganj, a 9-year-old girl was raped while a minor was kidnapped and found murdered after his family failed to pay the ransom demanded by the abductor. All this has happened in the last few days but the government claims that crime is under control in UP,” he said. Akhilesh said hundreds of people lost their lives in the last four years after consuming hooch being sold from government licensed outlets but the government failed to check the menace. “Even the business community is facing the heat now. In Moradabad, the owner of a company dealing in spare parts was kidnapped and later murdered. In Lucknow, traders and businessmen have been targeted and murdered in broad daylight but the government claims everything is under control,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/its-time-to-shunt-double-engine-govt-to-sicklines-sp/articleshow/83323920.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Delhi||HC prods Centre to involve RWAs in vaccination||New Delhi: Delhi High Court has asked the Centre to “seriously” consider involving RWAs in the Covid-19 vaccination drive in association with private hospitals so that residents could safely get jabs at their nearby centres. In case the government finds merit in this suggestion, the position may be clarified without any delay, and if the authorities are not inclined to permit residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) to organise such camps, the reasons must be disclosed in a status report, the court has stated in a recent order. “In our view, the said aspect deserves serious consideration, and unless there are any specific reasons why the Centre would not want the RWAs to play a role in the vaccination drive, there should be no impediment in designating the camps organised by the RWAs in association with private hospitals as vaccination centres run by private hospitals,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh noted, while hearing pleas relating to management of Covid risis in Delhi. It added that permitting vaccinations at such camps would go a long way in making it convenient and safe for the residents. “The central government should, therefore, seriously consider this proposal at the earliest,” it said, adding that the Centre should file a status report in this regard by July 7. The issue relating to permit RWAs to carry out vaccinations was raised by the court amicus curiae, who pointed put that, on May 29, the Union health ministry issued a clarification on the scope of vaccination by private hospitals in accordance with National Covid Vaccination Programme. The amicus pointed out that, before the Centre’s directive, several RWAs across Delhi organised vaccination drives/camps within their respective colonies in collaboration with different private hospitals, and this was done keeping in view the convenience of the residents and to avoid overcrowding at other vaccination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-prods-centre-to-involve-rwas-in-vaccination/articleshow/83351724.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Yogi told officials to ensure that universities run courses which are relevant in present times and also prepare students to deal with future challenges. New subjects, if required, must also be included, he said. Yogi said students enrolled in higher educational institutions must get quality and job-oriented education. For this, competitive environment is a must so that the state gets talented manpower. To strengthen the healthcare services in the state, universities, said CM, should focus on designing new courses in nursing, pharmacy, biochemistry and biotechnology. This, he said, will help fight any pandemic. The CM told officials to approve proposals of private universities that meet the government norms.

---||Delhi||Post-Covid, teenager suffers rare heart issue||New Delhi: Doctors at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) on Monday said Covid-19 led to inflammation of cardiac muscles in an 18-year-old youth — a rare and potentially life-threatening complication. Family members of Abdullah, a resident of Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi, rushed him to the hospital when he fell unconscious. Tests revealed he had a weak, poorly functioning and enlarged heart. “His heart had started to fail with reduced pumping leading to build up of fluids in the lungs, which kept him out of breath,” the hospital said in a statement. Abdullah was diagnosed with myocarditis, which many times is the result of a viral infection. He recalled an episode of fever, giving a clue that it may be post-Covid infection cardiac complication, the hospital said. “We conducted an antibody test for Covid-19 on him. The antibody levels were unusually high confirming the suspicion of post-Covid cardiac involvement,” the statement read. Abdullah was treated with anti-arrhythmic agents along with heart failure drugs and was discharged after a few days of treatment. He is recovering at home. “Many times, patients suffer from what doctors describe as unexplained tachycardia (fast heartbeat) and postural hypotension (fall in blood pressure), but occurrence of myocarditis and heart failure post-Covid is rare. It is a life-threatening complication needing urgent attention,” Dr Ashwani Mehta, senior consultant, department of cardiology, SGRH, said. The inflammation of cardiac tissues can lead to congestive heart failure, a term used to describe the failing heart pump, symptoms of which are breathlessness, swollen face and feet. “It can also cause abnormalities of cardiac rhythm which, if not treated appropriately in time, can even lead to cardiac arrest,” Dr Mehta added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/post-covid-teenager-suffers-rare-heart-issue/articleshow/83321945.cms||---

The team has been assisting Covid-hit families by providing hospital expenses, arranging beds, medical supplies and food. Varun J Vincent, a digital financial services expert came to India from the United States to support his family and later other Covid-19 victims. He said ,”During the period of my family’s struggle in April when we were scrambling to find an ICU bed for my dad, the response I received from one WhatsApp group in particular was so overwhelming that I found hope when there was none. This WhatsApp group was started by my teacher from Little Flower Junior College (LFJC), M Bala Reddy who currently lives in Georgia, Atlanta. It connected all the alumni from the junior college. An alumni network I completely lost touch with that came together with the sole focus of saving lives,” M Bala Reddy former teacher of LFJC said, “While everyone in our LFJC WhatsApp group is helping each other in some way, few members have stepped up to a whole new level by sacrificing their own sleep and health to help strangers,”  Some of the many more such heroes from LFJC who continue to support and help with ground operations and other capacities include Aditya Reddy Varakantam, Vamsi Krishna Meruva, Anand Cherupally, Rakesh Mahankali, Krishnam, Raghuvamshi Surikuchi, and Harsha Kim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/little-flower-junior-college-alumni-assist-470-families/articleshow/83321938.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Pune||Pune: Walls came down for rescue, but fire & smoke trapped victims||PUNE: The 18 men and women trapped inside the SVS Aqua Technologies plant at Urawade near Pirangut in Mulshi taluka about 30km from Pune on Monday had little scope to save themselves as the blaze raged on and the smoke dimmed visibility. Rescue attempts too failed as the fire grew in intensity. The police said 37 people were working inside and around the plant. Barring those caught inside, the others moved to a safe place when the fire started. The Paud police were in the process of registering a case late on Monday. The team of rescuers from the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority, the MIDC and local officials scurried to help those trapped inside, but were too late. They brought in earth movers and other heavy equipment and broke down the walls at either ends to gain access to the inside of the plant. The company manufactures, supplies and exports air, water and surface treatment chemicals, systems and solutions. It was founded in 1987 and incorporated in 2012, the website said. Devendra Potphode, chief fire officer of PMRDA, said the plant had a lot of chlorine component required in the manufacture of water purification units. “The fire grew in intensity because of the plastic and chemical material in the plant, and the thick smoke caused by the burning chemical reduced the visibility inside. The chlorine component by itself is not inflammable. We suspect things may have gone wrong during the packaging of units that involved the use of plastic. Some spark may have caused the blaze which would have spread quickly,” Potphode said. The PMRDA’s MIDC fire brigade brought in at least eight fire-fighting tenders and 50 firemen fought to put out the fire, and bring out the victims from the plant. “The last victim whose body was traced late in the evening was a lab technician working at a small laboratory located on the mezzanine floor of the plant,” Potphode said. People who stood by in large groups waited in absolute silence. Villagers warned those arriving at the scene to keep away from the site because of the chemicals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/walls-came-down-for-rescue-but-fire-smoke-trapped-victims/articleshow/83324000.cms||Mihir Tanksale

---||Hyderabad||With no takers, govt to reduce rice production by 12L acres||Hyderabad: With the Food Corporation of India (FCI) unwilling to take the entire rice produced in Telangana, the state government is forced to plan strategies to bring down the paddy cultivation in the state to ensure farmers get a remunerative price. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the agriculture and other officials concerned to hold meetings with the farmers and convince them to bring down the paddy cultivation by at least 12 to 15 lakh acres in the current Vaanakalam (Kharif) season. In the last Vaanakalam season, paddy was cultivated on nearly 53 lakh acres. Though the cultivation area comes down in subsequent Yasangi (rabi) season), farmers cultivated paddy on 52 lakh acres in the Yasangi season too due to the availability of water from irrigation projects, round-the-clock power supply and Rs 10,000 per acre Rythu Bandhu sop every year. A senior official said that though the state government is purchasing 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the produce from the farmers, the FCI in turn is not procuring the entire quantities from the state government. This is because other states like West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu to which boiled rice used to be supplied by Telangana through FCI, have also started producing paddy as per their local requirements. The CM has also written a letter to the Centre to direct FCI to procure the entire rice produced in Telangana. On the directions of the chief minister, agriculture minister Singireddy Niranjan Reddy held a high-level meeting with the officials of agriculture, marketing and other departments concerned and directed them to encourage farmers to take up cultivation of cotton and tur dal among other crops which would fetch them remunerative prices. Of the total 1.40 crore acres on which cultivation is expected to be taken up in the current Vaanakalam season, the state has fixed the target of confining the paddy crop between 41 lakh and 43 lakh acres, as against 53 lakh acres last year. Singireddy Niranjan Reddy told the officials to ensure that the farmers are encouraged to take up cultivation of cotton on 75 lakh acres, as against 61 lakh acres last year. The idea is that the Cotton Corporation of India will procure the cotton as such there would be no financial burden on the state government. Also, the farmers will get a minimum support price, or even more than that as there is demand for Telangana cotton in the open market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-no-takers-govt-to-reduce-rice-production-by-12l-acres/articleshow/83321953.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Kolkata||Private hospitals in Kolkata resume non-Covid treatment as corona cases dip||KOLKATA: Several private hospitals that had turned Covidexclusive last May started opening their doors to non-Covid patients on Monday following a slide in the number of Covid admissions. This includes RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), Belle Vue Clinic, Narayana Superspecialty Hospital and Narayana Multispecialty. Some others like Medica Superspecialty Hospital and Charnock have already converted a substantial section of their Covid beds into non-Covid ones. On Monday, Belle Vue threw open 22 of its 37 critical care beds to non-Covid patients. As many as 94 of its general beds — all of which were reserved for Covid patients till Sunday — were thrown open to non-Covid patients on Monday. The hospital has 194 general beds. “Over the last 20 days, the number of Covid admissions has dropped significantly. On the other hand, the demand for non-Covid treatment is rising again since hundreds of our patients had deferred consultations and surgeries since May. So, we have re-converted some of the sections and have resumed non-Covid treatment,” said Belle Vue CEO P Tondon. Belle Vue’s satellite centre had three patients till Monday. “All will be released on Tuesday and we will soon take a call on whether to keep it operational,” said Tondon. Non-Covid patients streamed into RTIICS on Monday within hours of its resuming general admission. “Non-Covid patients at the hospital is now 230, which is 60% of our (non-Covid) capacity. Critical care occupancy for non-Covid is 85%,” said Narayana Health zonal head R Venkatesh. At RTIICS, there are 207 Covid beds and the occupancy stood at 55% on Monday. Critical care occupancy was 60%. The day also saw two floors with 70 beds — so far a Covid unit — being converted into a non-Covid unit at Narayana Multispecialty Hospital. At its Howrah unit, a floor was thrown open to non-Covid patients with 16 beds. “We will continue to scale up the number of non-Covid beds depending on the requirement. We have made a beginning on Monday, with provisions to shift back to a Covid set-up very quickly,” said Venkatesh. More than 100 Covid general beds at AMRI Hospitals have been converted into non-Covid since the third week of May across the hospital’s three units. “We had 425 general Covid beds till two weeks back. We hope to convert at least another 100 by the next fortnight,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. The hospital is keeping a watch on the situation. “We are waiting for the non-Covid number to rise further before we go for a further reconversion,” said Barua. Two of Charnock Hospital’s four buildings have already been converted into non-Covid sections. “We now have a 50% occupancy at the non-Covid sections,” said managing director Prashant Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hospitals-resume-non-cov-treatment-as-corona-cases-dip/articleshow/83319514.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The positivity rate dipped to 0.36%. Meanwhile, 36 more people succumbed to the disease in a day, pushing the death toll here to 24,627. On Sunday, Delhi had recorded 34 fatalities, the lowest in around two months, and 381 cases with a positivity of 0.5%. On Saturday, the city registered 60 fatalities and 414 new cases of Covid-19 with a positivity rate of 0.53%. The day before, it had recorded 50 deaths and 523 new cases with a positivity rate of 0.68%. The national capital started the unlocking process from Monday, after remaining under lockdown since April 19, in view of a massive surge in Covid-19 cases in the second wave of the pandemic. Since April 19, both daily cases and single-day death count had been spiralling up. On April 20, the city had reported 28,395 cases, the highest in the city since the beginning of the pandemic. On April 22, the case positivity rate was 36.2%, the highest so far. The highest number of 448 deaths was reported on May 3. However, the number of cases has shown a downward trend of late. The positivity rate, too, has been shrinking in the last several days. The national capital had recorded 623 cases and 62 deaths last Tuesday, 576 cases and 103 fatalities on Wednesday, and 487 cases and 45 deaths on Thursday. A total of 63,610 tests, including 50,139 RT-PCR ones, were conducted a day ago, according to the health bulletin on Monday.

---||Delhi||Ensure e-POS machines at fair price shops, says Centre||New Delhi: Amid the ongoing war of words between the Centre and Delhi over doorstep ration delivery, the food ministry on Tuesday urged the Arvind Kejriwal government to expedite the installation of e-PoS machines at fair price shops (FPS) for quick roll out of One Nation One Ration Card scheme. It said this will ensure nearly 10 lakh migrants get the subsidised and free foodgrain without any additional cost to the city government. In a letter to Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev, Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey wrote, “ln view of immense advantages to people, I shall be grateful for your personal intervention for expeditious resumption of ePoS devices in all FPSs of Delhi for transparency in distribution of foodgrains and ensure the implementation of One Nation One Ration Card plan at the earliest.” The scheme was launched in August 2019 and so far 32 states and UTs have implemented it. But there has been no progress in Delhi so far. “Since, One Nation One Ration Card is a technology-driven process to enable intra-state and inter-state portability of ration card holders, it is highly dependent on availability of ePoS devices at all FPSs,” Pandey wrote. He said through this system, the migrant NFSA beneficiaries are empowered to lift their entitled quota of subsidised foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of their choice, anywhere in the country, by using their existing or same ration card. Pandey has said this will ensure people who are shifting their residence from one place to another within the city or outside Delhi to get their entitled foodgrain from any FPS of their choice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensure-e-pos-machines-at-fair-price-shops-says-centre/articleshow/83351779.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Source tracing to identify mucor ‘hotspots’ in Nagpur city||NAGPUR: Taking the battle against black fungus one step ahead, mucormycosis task force and health officials have decided to study patients’ data procured from hospitals to zero down upon the source of their infection and to identify ‘mucor hotspots’. This will help the administration in better management of the disease at highly concentrated specific zones. While Covid hotspot was associated with restrictions, barricading and contact tracing, the one related to mucormycosis is expected to be revolving more around studies of the fungal growth, its pattern, risk factors, spread and disease control at particular locations. Sources in the mucormycosis task force also stated that scientists from National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) would be roped in to address environmental issues of such hotspots where concentration of the fungal growth and spread would be found more in comparison to adjacent areas. In its meeting last week, mucormycosis task force, now expanded to 22 members with the inclusion of infectious disease specialists, microbiologists and other experts, has decided to undertake elaborate study on the pattern of fungal infection, its spread and possible counter-mechanisms to save the populace. The meeting was chaired by collector Ravindra Thakare. The study is expected to kick off shortly following the guidelines of the high court which had instructed the district administration to keep no stone unturned to eradicate the disease from the root. Microbiologist Dr Dinesh Agrawal, part of the mucormycosis task team, said hospitals would be provided a fixed proforma to fill in the details of patients suffering from the fungal infection. This shall act as a database for the study of the infection source. “The main objective of the study would be to ascertain whether a patient had actually come to the hospital with some other health problems like Covid and ended up developing the fungal infection or the patient had come directly with the complaints of mucormycosis and got admitted,” said the microbiologists. “If he or she had got admitted with mucormycosis directly, then from which area did the patient come from would be the key question. According to the findings, the source of the infection would be identified, studied and acted upon whether hospital or an area and it’s related factors,” said Dr Agrawal. He also added that hospitals in city would be first covered in the study. Dr Sanjay Chilkar, NMC chief medical officer, said plan is to ensure each case of mucormycosis is traced to ascertain the source of infection. It it is found that several patients of the fungal infection are being reported from a particular zone, it would be earmarked as ‘mucor hotspot’. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA), said the root cause of the fungal disease has kept everyone on the toes. “Such kind of epidemiological research will help the NMC and task force to come out with more striking revelations and findings which may take the causation of the disease beyond the obvious reasons encountered so far. Other than hospital-acquired infection, we may also come across locality specific origin of the disease,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/source-tracing-to-identify-mucor-hotspots-in-city/articleshow/83319504.cms||Soumitra Bose

State entrance commissioner A Geetha had submitted a proposal to the government, recommending drastic changes in the way state entrance rank is prepared. The proposal was submitted in view of the uncertainly over Plus Two exam by central boards and its possible fallout on the state entrance examination, currently schedule on July 24. The state entrance rank list for admission to engineering courses are prepared considering the score obtained by candidates in entrance test and the marks they scored in maths, physics and chemistry. “The meeting discussed some options in view of the current scenario. Nothing has been finalized. A fair decision, ensuring justice to all candidate, can be expected within a few days,” sources said. Since central boards and several state boards too have decided to cancel Plus Two exams in view of the pandemic, state government is worried over the appropriateness of considering Plus Two marks of students pursuing qualifying course offered by different boards. State has already conducted Plus Two exams.

---||Hyderabad||De novo diabetes poses new challenge to treat black fungs||Hyderabad: De novo diabetes (new onset of diabetes) after Covid-19 is making it a challenging task to treat cases of mucormycosis, say doctors treating patients at nodal centres in the state. So far, 350 patients have undergone surgeries at Government ENT Hospital, Koti, while another 150 at Gandhi hospital. The two centres together have handled over 800 patients so far. With these cases on the rise, endocrinologists and nephrologists have been deputed from Osmania Hospital to tackle complications. “Post-operative patients are being given amphotericin and posaconazole. It is a challenging situation as most patients had de novo diabetes following Covid and had compromised lung function. Also, the use of antifungal medicines result in kidney-related issues,” Government ENT Hospital superintendent Dr T Shankar said. The problem with de novo diabetes cases is with the onset being recent, patients’ reaction to medications is not known. “We are finding new cases of patients with blood sugar levels as high as 400-500 points, making things more complicated in terms of usage of medicines and treatment options,” a doctor at Gandhi Hospital said. With 350 surgeries done in the last 10 days alone, the operation theatres at ENT Hospital were running full steam between 8am and 10pm daily and the staff has gone without a leave for the last 15 days. At Gandhi Hospital too, the situation is similar with more admissions of mucormycosis (black fungus) patients being seen as compared to Covid-19 patients. Once operated, the patients from ENT Hospital were being shifted to SD Eye Hospital so that more patients for surgery could be accommodate. “Nursing staff, lab technicians and sanitation staff have been deputed to the hospital from other health facilities and out-sourcing agencies. Essential equipment and prioritised supply of anti-fungal medicines to the nodal centres are being ensured. We have pressed in ophthalmologists, maxillofacial surgeons, nephrologists, endocrinologists and anaesthesiologists from other hospitals to ensure treatment of patients,” an official from the health department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/de-novo-diabetes-poses-new-challenge-to-treat-black-fungs/articleshow/83321951.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Bhopal||Will Bhopal win over the ‘3rd wave’? Public participation must: Experts||BHOPAL: After the cases receded following the first Coronvirus wave, Covid-19 protocol — compulsory mask, social distancing and not crowding a place — was virtually forgotten by the people. However, agencies responsible for enforcing the Covid-19 protocol too had forgotten their responsibilities. When a senior district administration official was asked in those days in reference to a story, why penalty is not being slapped on people not wearing masks or not maintaining social distancing at a public place, he admitted there has been slackness on their part in ensuring continued adherence to Covid-19 protocol but said, “The cases are now so low... Imposing penalty for not wearing a mask doesn’t appear to be morally correct.” Flouting of Covid-19 norms, undoubtedly, had created the pitch for a more ferocious second wave. With second wave on the wane and amid talks of the third wave, would Bhopal repeat the same mistakes it committed after the first wave? “Even after so much damage that the second wave has done, you may still find people not wearing masks and moving around. After the second wave, people in the urban area are taking vaccines. But in rural areas, the percentage of vaccination is not high. In Bhopal, I see a lot more people wearing masks, maintaining safe distance, not crowding markets but as of now, the wounds of the second wave are fresh. People are still scared and the lockdown is still in force with some relaxations. See, how it pans out as the days pass,” said Varinder Singh, who had his wife infected in the second wave. If people are adhering to Covid-19 protocol, the state government and the district administration also appears to be cautious and not taking any chances to let the positivity rate, which once touched 30 percent in Bhopal during May and has now come down to less than 4 percent in Bhopal, to increase again. Graded unlocking, constant review of the situation, identifying more infected areas and putting it under "containment zone" restrictions, marriages which were banned in May is being allowed but only 20 guests from both sides together, all the events-religious, political, sports, entertainment, social, cultural and the rest- where people may gather continue to be banned, "Covid Safety Team' to monitor observance of Covid-19 protocol in the shops and the market, tourist spots are closed and continued weekend lockdown and night curfew are some of the measures, which create an impression that the state government and district administration are serious in their intentions not to allow the Covid-19 pandemic to take wings again.  Chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, has often attributed his success to contain the second wave to crisis management groups - now working from panchayat to ward to block and district level- and public participation they ensured in efforts to contain the pandemic. Earlier, there used to be only the District Crisis Management Group but during the second wave, when the situation appeared to be going out of hands- groups were created at all levels to work among the people for awareness on Corona prevention and containment and also suggest measures to fight the menace. Their active participation in campaign to promote vaccination in rural areas and carrying out "Kill Corona" campaign under which health workers go door-to--door and every suspected Covid-19 patient is given a medical kit (medicines often used on Covid-19 suspects) may help the administration more than anything else in averting the third wave of Coronavirus. The fleet of Corona volunteers, which now has 1.71 lakh volunteers across the state, can also help the administration in containing the pandemic in a big way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/will-we-win-over-the-3rd-wave/articleshow/83319510.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

The cops have seized 12 cars from him but Ketul Parmar, who was nabbed from Botad, is suspected of having sold 254 cars in the last nine months. Amar Patel, a resident of Bhathena, had lodged a complaint against Parmar in detection of crime branch (DCB) on June 5. Patel, who is a cab service provider, told the police that he met Parmar some years ago and both became friends. Parmar, himself a cab service provider, told Patel that he had got a contract to give cars on rent to a solar firm.  Parmar and Patel both are cab service providers and met each other a few years ago during work. They were in regular touch and Parmar informed Patel that he got a contract to supply cars on rent to a solar company. Patel then gave a car to the accused on a 10-day trial and then started providing more cars as he received rental regularly.  Patel’s friends too began supplying cars on rent to Parmar. “The accused took the original RTO registration certificate and insurance papers. It is suspected that he used these papers to mortgage or sell the cars," said V K Parmar, assistant commissioner of police, EOC that is now investigating the case.  Parmar had been committing this fraud since September 2020. The accused has been booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code including breach of trust, cheating and forging documents. “Some of the sold cars were registered in the name of new buyers as well. It is also a matter of investigation for the police on how this was done,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/multi-crore-car-rental-racket-accused-held-from-botad/articleshow/83317370.cms||---

---||Kolkata||MR Bangur, Medical College scale up infrastructure, keep things ready if third wave strikes in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Even as the Covid graph is on a downward slope and more beds are falling vacant at government Covid hospitals, the state’s largest Covid facilities at MR Bangur and Medical College & Hospital, Kolkata have no plans to reduce Covid beds like they had done earlier this year when the patient count petered out towards the end of the first wave. On the contrary, they are planning to add more Covid beds and other facilities as they take the opportunity of the current dip in cases to be ready to tackle the impending third wave. At MR Bangur, where 30% Covid beds are currently vacant, the authorities are planning to add 83 high dependency units (HDU) and16 critical care units (CCU). The hospital currently has 199 HDU and 78 CCU beds and 350 odd active Covid patients. Unlike January though, they have no plans to admit non-Covid patients. “We had all become a bit complacent last time but the Covid second wave has taught us an important lesson. Taking a cue from what we have seen in the second wave, we have already started preparing for a possible third wave. Hence, we will be adding more HDU and CCU beds,” said Sisir Naskar, the medical superintendent of the hospital. TOI had reported in February this year on how MR Bangur had started realigning and disinfecting the 500-bed old building that had only one active patient on February 22 while it prepared to welcome patients suffering from other diseases from the second week of March. However, the numbers started increasing from next month and the move never matured. By April end, hospitals were being flooded with Covid patients again. “The state health department has asked all dedicated Covid hospitals to be more cautious than last time and while the numbers decline, the hospitals have been asked to upgrade their facilities during the interim period,” said a doctor at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital. “Considering that the third wave may affect children, the state health department has sought a slew of statistics and information regarding paediatric set-up as the department is extremely well-developed in our hospital. The health department possibly has a plan to set up a dedicated Covid paediatric facility at our hospital and we will work it out accordingly,” said hospital superintendent Manab Nandy. He added the hospital currently has 350 odd active Covid patients with around 20% vacant beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mr-bangur-med-college-scale-up-infra-keep-things-ready-if-third-wave-strikes/articleshow/83319524.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Agriculture minister Singireddy Niranjan Reddy told this to the owners of the mills at a meeting he held with various associations on Monday. Saying that the by-products of cotton such as oil, cake and solvents command a good demand at national and international level, the minister said the government is committed to encouraging ginning mills in the wake of increase in the extent of cotton crop. Niranjan Reddy said that more incentives would be given to the mills after taking the issue to the notice of CM K Chandrasekhar Rao. “The number of ginning mills was less than 100 before formation of Telangana. Now, 350 new mills have come up in the last seven years and another 30 are in the pipeline,” he said. According to the minister, the Cotton Corporation of India and traders used to take the cotton purchased here to Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh but now there was no such need. Ginning mills set up mostly in the rural areas provide direct employment to 100 people in each mill and indirect employment to another 500, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-planning-cotton-solvent-policy-min/articleshow/83321987.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Public works department frames plan to expedite road infrastructure development in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: To streamline execution and ensure timely completion of development projects, the public works department (PWD) has submitted a comprehensive annual work plan for the development of highways and district roads in the state. Principal secretary, PWD, Nitin Ramesh Gokarn said once the plan gets approved by the state government, the department would take it up on priority. “Earlier, projects were taken up on a piecemeal basis due to which there was no clarity. The annual work plan, which we have proposed for the current fiscal, would make things clearer and expedite development of roads and highways,” Gokarn told TOI. Sources said PWD decided for annual work plan after the Covid second wave started flattening. The government’s decision to step up development of road infrastructure comes after CM Yogi Adityanath pitched for early completion of various expressways, including Purvanchal and Bundelkhand expressways. The government has also expedited acquisition of land for the 594km Ganga expressway, touted as the longest expressway project in the country. Experts said the development of district roads and highways forms the core of any government’s development agenda as the condition of roads decides the political fortunes of a ruling party. Sources said the department had been grappling with the issue of timely sanction of funds to execute projects. “The issue would be addressed as the engineers would know how the projects would be taken up over a period of one year,” a senior PWD official said. PWD has earmarked funds for widening and strengthening of state highways in at least eight districts –Lakhimpur Kheri, Kannauj, Ghazipur, Basti, Firozabad, Barabanki, Mathura and Bahraich. The work is proposed to be carried out at a cost of around Rs 80 crore in the first phase. The department has also proposed the development of main roads in over 20 districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pwd-frames-plan-to-expedite-road-infra-development-in-up/articleshow/83324036.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Kolkata||Weekend car surge is new headache for cops in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Each enhanced restriction weekend is ending up to be worse than the last with the number of vehicle owners flouting the norms growing at a steady pace. Now in its third weekend, police sources said the number of seizure and challan of vehicles have gone up three times compared to the two weekends in May. According to cops, bikes and private cars alone have constituted over 95% of the violations. “This weekend stands out from the rest as we have seized more than 45% more vehicles than last weekend. More importantly, we have seized more vehicles in the evening than in the morning,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Of the 18,756 vehicles seized so far, almost 60% of seizures have taken place on weekends,” said a source. In the May 21-23 weekend, 2,403 vehicles were seized. The seizures stood at 979 (Friday), 923 (Saturday) and 501 (Sunday). The next weekend (May 28-30), 406 vehicles were seized on Friday, 1158 on Saturday and 1,034 on Sunday — taking the total count to 2,598. This weekend (June 4-6), 7,872 vehicles were seized — 4,895 on Friday, 1,687 on Saturday and and 1,590 on Sunday. That is almost three times the seizures made in the earlier two weekends. “The numbers keep rising through the day at nakas in Ultadanga or those at Howrah bridge. Incidentally, people trying to come to the city all through the day is higher than on weekdays when the pressure of people entering the city is confined to a few specific hours in the morning. Hence, for cops at nakas, the checks are intense all through the day. We also carry out special checks at unannounced locations, which add up to the numbers,” explained an officer. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha said they had now asked cops to carry out random checks even if they carry documents to ascertain no one was taking undue advantage of their ID cards. “The checks are happening across the day and hence the high numbers,” he said. The trend is almost similar if one looks at the total number of mask violations. “We were having an average of 150-170 people being challaned daily in the first two weeks of enhanced restrictions for not wearing masks properly. The past two days have seen these numbers shoot up to around 220-235,” explained the officer. “We have prosecuted hundreds of people and motorists under CrPC 200 in the past week, around the same time that violations began to rise. However, the past two days have been especially worrying. We will send our recommendations to courts where their fate will be decided,” said an officer from a south Kolkata police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/weekend-car-surge-is-new-headache-for-cops/articleshow/83319547.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kozhikode||Dr PK Warrier, doyen of Ayurveda, turns 100 today||Kozhikode: Eminent ayurvedic physician and managing trustee of Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala (AVS) Dr PK Warrier, who played a key role in popularizing ayurveda across the world and strived to uphold the scientific basis of classical authentic ayurveda treatment, will turn 100 on Tuesday. But, there won’t be centenary birthday celebrations at Kailasamandiram, his ancestral home, on Tuesday to comply with Covid protocols. But, activities scheduled as part of ‘Satapoornima’, the centenary birthday celebrations, will continue online. Warrier, a visionary institution builder, has during his decades-long ayurvedic practice given solace and care to countless patients comprising both heads of state as well as the poor with equal dedication and a compassionate, healing touch. Among the dignitaries treated by Dr Warrier include former presidents VV Giri, Pranab Mukherjee, former PM AB Vajpayee, former Sri Lankan President Sirimavo Bandaranaike, former Mauritius president Kailash Purryag, Pakistani ghazal singer Mehdi Hassan among others. More importantly, Warrier played a historical role in invigorating the traditional practices of ayurveda by making significant contributions to research, upgradation and expansion of ayurveda by modernizing its clinical, pharmaceutical, educational and research domains. The country had honoured him with Padma Bhushan in 2010 for his contributions to ayurveda. As Warrier turns 100, it could be a rare instance in corporate history as well of one person steering an acclaimed institution – a 119-year-old charitable trust – for over six decades into an internationally-reputed premier institution for treatment, research and medicine manufacturing. Warrier, born in 1921 in Kottakkal, has had an eventful life. During his student days he participated in the Quit India movement and was later attracted to the Left movement. After studying ayurveda at the Aryavaidya Patalasa (now, Vaidyaratnam PS Varier Ayurveda College), he started his career as factory manager of the medicine manufacturing plant of AVS in 1947. He took over the reins of AVS as managing trustee in 1954 following the demise of his elder brother PM Varier in an aircraft crash. Under his stewardship the name of Kottakkal become synonymous with ayurveda and one of the most-trusted healthcare brands. AVS, which had an annual turnover of Rs 9 lakh when he took over, has grown and its current turnover is Rs 400 crore. Under his leadership, AVS has also been concentrating on research and had taken up collaborative research programmes with CSIR for identifying bioactive molecules and improving manufacturing processes. He personally oversees cancer-related studies at AVS. Taking into account the crucial importance of medicinal plants in the growth of ayurveda, he set up the Centre of Medicinal Plants Research at Kottakkal. He also initiated research activities in the fields of drug standardization, drug development and process improvement. At his instance, AVS also collaborated with major research agencies like CSIR, DST, AYUSH and IIT in joint programmes on rasayana, herbo-metal formulations, bioactive molecules, etc. Warrier has co-authored the five volume treatise ‘Indian Medicinal Plants – A Compendium of 500 Species’, which is testimony to his dedication to scientific research and documentation. Now more than 530 classical formulations are manufactured at the two factories of AVS at Kottakkal and Kanjikode and another 37 new-generation formulations are produced at the new factory at Nanjangud in Karnataka. More than 700 different types of raw herbs are sourced from across the country for producing these medicines. Warrier has taken care that the institution remains firmly rooted in its charitable nature with a major chunk of the income of AVS going for the charitable hospital that provides free treatment for around 1,500 outpatient patients each day. "Normally, we used to have a family get-together and feast during his birthdays. This year, we won’t be holding that to comply with Covid protocols. We hope that once the threat of the pandemic is over, we will be able to hold a befitting public event for him, said Dr PM Varier, chief physician and trustee of AVS. He said that though Dr Warrier has not been conducting personal consultations since the pandemic began, he still provides medical advice for treatment of referral patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/dr-pk-warrier-doyen-of-ayurveda-turns-100-today/articleshow/83319627.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Doctors under national health mission threaten stir over Covid benefits||NEW DELHI: Doctors under the National Health Mission in Delhi have threatened to go on strike if the state government fails to meet their demands for health benefits as well as Covid incentives as are being given in other states. The NHM doctors in the city, around 250, have been requesting this for a year now while working at Covid care centres and mohalla clinics and participating in the vaccination drive and other health projects. “Many of the doctors tested positive, not once but twice, but we paid for our treatment ourselves,” claimed Dr Alka Chaudhary, president, Delhi NHM Doctors’ Association. “And it was not just us, even our families were affected. We lost three doctors.” She said that the Delhi cabinet approved a conveyance allowance for the doctors in 2018, but hadn’t paid them till date. “We have been requesting these benefits for five years,” continued Dr Chaudhary. “We have e-mailed the government and if it doesn’t understand our problems and find possible solutions in the next 10 days, we will be forced to go on strike even if we don’t want patients to be affected by our action.” On Monday night, via an e-mail addressed to the chief minister, Delhi NHM Doctors Association informed him about their demands and that they would go on a strike if they were left with no option. The NHM doctors in Delhi claim to have tried several times to turn the attention of Delhi government to their demands. Both last year and earlier this year, they sought time from the CM and health minister but didn’t get. The email said, “We, 250 doctors and specialists, have been working in the Delhi State National Health mission since 2007 on contract. We are performing all duties equivalent to our regular counterparts running health centres, managing vaccination, tests, home isolation, Covid care centre, surveillance, containments, teleconsultations, patient transfers, routine OPDs, implementing all national health programmes, etc. We are doing our duties with full dedication and sincerity, now without any leave /holiday/incentive for more than one year in the Covid pandemic.” The association has raised five major demands related to equal pay for equal work (“pay parity with our regular counterparts”), health insurance and medical benefits for them and their dependent family members as has been given to all contractual staff working under Delhi government’s health department, leave encashment if leaves are cancelled in view of the pandemic, Covid incentives as is being given in many other states and lastly, the implementation of the cabinet decision of 2018 on giving NHM doctors conveyance allowance, not given so far despite the association running from pillar to post. The emailed letter said these benefits had been requested at all levels, including the lieutenant governor, chief minister, health minister, chief secretary, principal secretary of health and the mission director, for many years without any favourable response. “It is our humble request to you to take up the matter on utmost priority so that we can get our legitimate demands fulfilled at the earliest. Otherwise, we will be left with only the option of going on strike,” the letter cautioned. Speaking to TOI, Dr Shruti Mittal, who works at a dispensary in Dwarka, said “I spent a lot of money on my husband's Covid treatment. He later passed away due to other complications.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/doctors-under-national-health-mission-threaten-stir-over-covid-benefits/articleshow/83322027.cms||Sakshi Chand

The officers would be based out of India, although they are likely to be employees of the parent company (headquarters) instead of the Indian operations, top sources told TOI. Twitter is believed to have communicated its willingness to the government through an official communication, though it’s not clear how much time/relaxation the company has sought to appoint the officers who were originally supposed to be in place by May 26. The sources said that the company now seems to have mellowed down again after it received a green signal from the headquarters in the US with regards to the contentious issue of appointment of three statutory officers. When contacted, Twitter did not confirm, but said, “We have assured the Government of India that Twitter is making every effort to comply with the new Guidelines, and an overview on our progress has been duly shared. We will continue our constructive dialogue with the Indian Government.” The action by the company comes after the government on Saturday warned it of “consequences” under IPC, asking it to comply with the statutory provisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/twitter-blinks-to-appoint-officers-as-required-by-law/articleshow/83326746.cms||Pankaj Doval

On Wednesday, Kolkata Municipal Corporation will roll out a facility where Kumar will meet with citizens virtually twice every week — on Wednesdays and Saturdays — from 11am to noon. Special municipal commissioner Somnath De will also be available for virtual meetings twice a week — on Tuesdays and Thursdays — at the same time slot. De will take questions on problems related to property tax, licences, KMC-run markets and car parking. According to an official in the civic administration, the interactive programme was planned after seeing the demand for a similar programme, ‘Talk to the KMC’, held every Saturday where KMC Board of Administrators chairman Firhad Hakim interacts with citizens. “Though the BoA chairman passes necessary instructions on to senior civic officials to solve problems based on his interaction with the citizens, Kolkata residents can meet him only once every week. We thought we should offer more such virtual windows to the citizens,” said a senior KMC official. According to a KMC source, due to restrictions imposed on movement because of the pandemic, several civic departments are getting flooded with inquiries from across the city, which the officials of the departments concerned are passing on to the office of the municipal commissioner and the special commissioner. “Now, they themselves will hold virtual meetings and take direct calls about different problems being faced by the citizens,” said a senior civic official. The departments getting the maximum calls include buildings, health, water supply, assessment collection and car parking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-to-roll-out-e-meet-sessions-to-solve-civic-issues/articleshow/83319561.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Doctor beats Covid to reunite with newborn||KOLKATA: A doctor who got Covid during pregnancy, fleetingly saw her baby boy who had to be shifted to NICU immediately after the delivery. Three days later, she herself was put on ventilator. Winning her battle against the virus, she couldn’t stop crying as she held her newborn for the first time on Friday. The heart-warming video has now gone viral. While she was being treated at the intensive care unit (ICU) of ILS Hospital in Howrah, doctors attending to 25-year-old Arfa Sajadin would show her the baby via video call. She gradually started responding to treatment and finally, on Friday, the mother-son duo was reunited. The team of doctors is especially thrilled because Sajadin’s chances of survival were rather thin. She was one of those doctors who wasn’t inoculated because of conception. A total of 646 doctors have died due to Covid-19 in the ongoing second wave in the country, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said on Saturday. “The sight of the baby served almost as a vaccine in her case and this young medic realized that being a mother was the biggest reason to live,” said consultant paediatrician and neonatologist Abhishek Tiwari. The doctor was 37 weeks pregnant when she was infected. She was diagnosed with having very poor glycemic control and the ultrasonography revealed a baby large for its gestational age. There were clear signs of foetal distress as well. Considering her symptoms and clinical status, Sajadin underwent Caesarean section and delivered a 3.9kg baby. He didn’t cry after birth and the neonatal team initiated positive pressure ventilation (PPV) before shifting the boy to NICU where he was provided intensive care. “Fortunately, his Covid-19 report came negative,” said Tiwari. Meanwhile, three days after her delivery, Sajadin’s battle between life and death began. “She started experiencing respiratory distress with acute decline in sensorium and was promptly shifted to the Covid ICU,” said a doctor. She had developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a condition in which small blood clots develop throughout the bloodstream, blocking small blood vessels. Sajadin had to be intubated, underwent exploratory laparotomy and the blood clots were removed. “Everyone lost hope except our critical-care team. She stayed on mechanical ventilator for 10 days. I would hear my colleague, Kaushik Naha Biswas, talking to her, saying, ‘Arfa you are a fighter, please don’t give up. Your baby is waiting for you.’ Finally, she came around,” Tiwari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/doctor-beats-covid-to-reunite-with-newborn/articleshow/83319571.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The farmers of Nana Khadba, Gadhkda, Bhojabedi, and Badhla of Lalpur taluka of Jamnagar have joined hands for the cultivation of watermelon and muskmelon in 320 bigha land. The group farming started in 2017 with just four farmers coming together. But now the number increased to 25. Next year more farmers are expected to join this group. Each farmer has land ranging from 10 to 50 bigha. Adam Sapiya of Nana Khadba village was the first to initiate group farming in his village in 2017. “The farming of watermelon and muskmelon used to be scattered. Not many farmers were farming for these desert fruit as there was no market. But once we started farming in a group, traders started coming to our doorstep to buy the produce and pay in cash.” These farmers are using drip irrigation method for farming and collectively decided on the use of pesticides. The use of scientific method for farming has resulted in a yield of 8 tonne per bigha. This year the farmers have already sold about 70,000 tonnes of watermelons. The sowing for these fruits starts from December and harvesting is done in March. Ashraf Sapiya, another farmer said, “Currently, the profit per bigha is Rs 50,000 for a farmer. We can save on seeds, pesticides and other raw materials by purchasing in bulk and also negotiate with traders at the time of selling the fruits. This year we earned Rs 1.50/kg more compared to the market price.” How does group farming work? In group farming, the farmers together decide which seeds to be used and what technology would be more effective. Before the sowing season starts, farmers decide on when to start sowing, when to start harvesting, how much pesticides to use, and when. Everybody follows the instructions to the dot. The harvest is then sold in big cities like Ahmedabad and Mumbai. These farmers also grow tomatoes, chilli, brinjal and cucumbers during winter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/group-watermelon-farming-yields-profit-of-rs-rs-50k/bigha/articleshow/83317434.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

According to police, after an argument over a petty issue between two groups, comprising eight Intermediate and degree first year students at Chanchalguda on Sunday night, members of both the groups assaulted one another. “A teenager, Abbas, made fun of another youth, Abdullah, calling him a kid. Abdullah responded to the comment angrily and assaulted him. Soon a scuffle ensued between members of the two groups,” Dabeerpura inspector N Satyanarayana said. When friends of Abbas and Abdullah were confronting one another, 18-year-old Adnan from Parvath Nagar in Dabeerpura intervened. Kamran, a friend of Abbas, punched Adnan on his neck and he collapsed on the spot. “Adnan came to visit his aunt at Chanchalguda and upon noticing an argument between local youth he intervened. After Adnan fell unconscious due to the punch on his neck, family members rushed him to a nearby hospital. Doctors performed surgery to clear blood clot, which occurred due to the assault. Adnan’s condition is stable,” the inspector said. Based on the complaint of the victim’s family, police registered a case against Kamran, his friends, Abdullah, Mujeeb, and Najeeb under Sections 323, 341 and 506 of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-booked-for-clash-at-chanchalguda/articleshow/83322072.cms||---

The rescued hyena is a male and has some recent leg injuries, which is why it has been brought to SGNP. After medical treatment, it will be released in a forested area. We are seeing a striped hyena after over two decades,” said wildlife activist Pawan Sharma of Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW). Environmentalist D Stalin said: “Due to incessant human encroachments into forest buffer zones and boundaries, there is a lot of pressure on wild animals like deer, leopards, hyenas and others to survive due to human-animal conflicts.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh plantation campaign to steer recreation of Ramayan Van||LUCKNOW: For this year’s plantation drive, the state government might draw inspiration from Valmiki’s Ramayana. The government is keen on planting trees that find mention in the Ramayana and might create ‘Ramayan Van’ (forest) at multiple locations. The drive will see plantation of 30 crore trees in July. A few sites in west UP have been identified to create these mini-forests. Chief conservator of forests Mukesh Kumar said that the proposal would be finalised in some time. Meanwhile, the forest department has already identified 88 tree species that find mention in Valmiki’s Ramayana. The list includes scientific names of species as well. Some of these are Priyangu, Bakul, Indugi, Varan, Tinish, Dhaaman, Saalai, Neevaar, Ankol, Bhilawa, Garjan, Paatal, Karajj, Hintaal, Ranjak, Padmak, Bandhu-jeev, Kurant, Katak, Muchkund, Kutaj and Sarj, which are lesser known ones. The aim is to increase awareness about trees and develop a connect between trees and the public. Besides, forests which find mention in scriptures like Shringaar Van, Tamaal Van, Rasaal Van, Champak Van, Chandan Van, Ashok Van, Anang Van, Vichitra Van and Vihaar Van might also be recreated. Last year, in Kasganj along the Ganga, the state government had got more than 3.5 lakh trees planted to raise ‘Bhagirathi Van’ named after one of the streams of the Ganga originating from ‘gaumukh’ in Uttrakhand. The Yogi government has emphasised on planting trees that find mention in holy books and astrological, mythological, ‘tantrik’ and ayurvedic scriptures. In 2017, the forest department had printed nine pamphlets on various forms of plantations mentioned in holy scriptures. ‘Masihi Vatika’ mentioned trees in Bible while ‘Qurani Vriksha Vatika’ and ‘Guru Ke Bagh’ mentioned trees significant in other religions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/plantation-campaign-to-steer-recreation-of-ramayan-van/articleshow/83324102.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Mumbai||On Day 1 of unlock, Mumbai takes slow steps towards normalcy||MUMBAI: A city accustomed to staying indoors since 2020 took it slow and steady on the first day of unlocking. Several stores selling non-essential items, gyms, salons and restaurants reopened for clientele, and obeyed the state’s call to roll down shutters at 4pm. But many other establishments remained closed, unwilling to risk the expenses of reopening without customers. Public transport infrastructure failed to meet the challenge of the mini unlocking. There were long queues of frustrated passengers at BEST bus stops, especially at Sion and Borivli, as local trains remained off bounds for the common commuter. A BEST official said the rush was expected as the company owned fleet has been pared down by half, to less than 2,000 vehicles. Motorists reported congestion on the Eastern and Western Express Highways, Andheri east, Dadar and LBS Road. Restaurants welcomed daytime diners after months of impersonal home delivery. “Around 20-25% restaurants and cafes opened with 50% capacity, registering 30-40% of the pre-Covid business. Many migrant workers are yet to return so most hotels kept dine-in facility closed. But this may improve soon,” said AHAR president Shivanand Shetty. However, HRAWI (Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India) senior VP Pradeep Shetty said only 15-18% restaurants reopened. He said they should be allowed to operate till 11 pm. Fitness enthusiasts flocked to gyms. Ten people were working out at the Mumbai Cricket Association gym at BKC around 9 am, half the normal number, since government rules say they must operate at 50% capacity. “We were glad to be back for our fitness routine. The equipment was sanitised and the premises were clean. Afterwards we went for tea and snacks to a nearby restaurant, and there too, customers were enjoying their breakfast of omelette pav after many weeks. The city was clearly tired of being cooped up indoors,” Asad Ali, a member, said. Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria pointed out a loophole in the new rules. While municipal parks, gardens and open grounds may be open only from 5-9 am, outdoor sports activity is allowed during those hours as well as from 6-9pm. “But where will people play outdoor sports if grounds and parks are shut in the evening?” he said. In Navi Mumbai and Thane, shoppers flocked to malls, food courts and restaurants. Around 80% stores at Seawoods Grand Central Mall, Nerul, reopened Monday, clocking 6,000 footfalls. One customer was reported to have purchased items worth Rs 25,000 on day one itself. However, activists Rohitt Malhotra and Anarjit Chauhan urged NMMC to monitor violations of footfalls and closing timings. Wine shops in Vasai-Virar saw buyers who stood in orderly queues to secure their fix. Bar owners in Mira Bhayander were upset at being placed under the more stringent Level 3 guidelines. In Kalyan-Dombivli, there was a shopping spree for “non-essential” items like garments and footwear. Bhavesh Maru, general secretary of Thane Vyapar Udyog Mahasangh received complaints of authorities enforcing shutdowns in Ghodbunder, Kalwa and Mumbra. The confusion was resolved after senior officers clarified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-on-day-1-of-unlock-city-takes-slow-steps-towards-normalcy/articleshow/83322804.cms||---

All its entry points will get grand gates called ‘Ram Dwars’ along with gardens with the theme of Ramayana stories. These will be called ‘Ramayan Kaleen Vatikaayen’. The novel look will transform the approach to Ayodhya from that of a small town to one with modern facilities and a seat of culture. Principal secretary housing and urban development Deepak Kumar, who reviewed the development work in Ayodhya on Monday, told TOI that an exercise on war-footing is going on to meet the target of chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s vision document on Ayodhya on time.

International consultation firm Lee & Associates, along with Indian partners L&T and CP Kukreja Architects are working on various projects. Of 27 projects, detailed reports on 10 are being made as of now. These are: widening of roads, river front, restoration of river banks, bus stand, parking facilities and construction of gates at entry points.

After facing acute oxygen scarcity in the state in April, Chouhan announced setting up of plants on a war footing in all the 52 districts. However, there seems to be a delay in the setting up of these plants. Large number of people had allegedly died of oxygen scarcity as they gasped for breath after lung infection because of coronavirus. The Madhya Pradesh government had also announced an oxygen plant by Inox Air products in Hoshangabad district in October last year and it was scheduled to be operational in a year. However, the work for the setting up of the plant is on and it is likely to take about 2 years to start production. Inox is one of the largest manufacturers of industrial and medical oxygen in India. There is no oxygen plant in any district of Bundelkhand including the district hospital of Sagar, the divisional headquarter of Bundelkhand. One plant was already functioning in the medical college hospital before the outbreak of coronavirus infection. Places like Damoh where the pandemic claimed a large number of lives, only some civil work for the construction of the oxygen plant has started. “Now there seems to be no interest of the state”, an official of the district administration commented,” and oxygen plant is not in the priority list of the government.” The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of the PWD department selected locations for the oxygen plants. Health minister Prabhuram Choudhary denied any delay and said 7 out of 8 oxygen plants announced by the government are operational. He said that one plant was started on PPP basis in Jaora in Ratlam district. Besides, another plan was started in Ratlam. “Many plants have started operating while many others will start this month or in July,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/oxygen-plants-announced-by-cm-still-not-operational/articleshow/83319626.cms||---

The Corona situation in state is under control, but vigilance and caution is still necessary, he reiterated. The CM directed ministers and officers in-charge of districts to study the circumstances and reasons for the arrival of the first wave of Covid, its end and the second wave. “There is a need to learn from this study. We have to see what caused the second wave, on the basis of which we can stop the third wave.” He said, the process of reopening of markets should begin only after assessing the situation on the ground. Based on the number of active cases, the state is at number 19 in the country. Positivity rate of 46 districts is less than 1%. Medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said, to encourage vaccination in Bhopal, ‘Tika Lagwao, Market Khulwao' (Get vaccinated to open the shop) campaign is being started in collaboration with traders' unions. Under this, vaccination of traders and their employees employees working in shops will be encouraged. It was informed in the meeting that it has been decided to open shops in Khargone on odd-even basis. The market will open in Ujjain till 7 pm. In Shivpuri, it is being considered to open shops on the left side of the road one day and on the right side other day. Efforts on to make state self-sufficient in Oxygen:Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Monday that the state has to be made completely self-sufficient in oxygen production. Along with the establishment of Oxygen production units in the state, adequate storage arrangements should be ensured in all the divisional headquarters so that any emergency can be dealt with effectively. Production should be started within time-limit in all 101 PSA Oxygen plants to be set up in the state. Efforts should be made to make maximum units functional by August 30. A capacity of 800 metric tonnes of oxygen storage is to be developed in the state. Chouhan said that he would review the progress being made in this direction every week.

She was arrested by NCB as part of a probe into supply of drugs to Sushant, who died by suicide on June 14, 2020. Rhea stated that Sushant’s sister Priyanka Singh and brother-in-law Siddharth used to consume marijuana with the late actor, and would procure drugs for him. NCB officials said they are investigating the claim, and no action can be taken based on someone’s statement unless supported by strong evidence. Rhea mentioned that Sushant was a drug addict before she came in contact with him. She said Sushant’s family was aware about his addiction. “There are conversations regarding uses and effects of Clonazepam. I would like to explain, they are prescription drugs prescribed by Dr Nikita Shah. Showik and I are seen here discussing Google side effects of Clonazepam,” Rhea’s statement in the chargesheet submitted before court said. NCB arrested Rhea on September 8 last year under sections pertaining to production, manufacture, possession, sale, purchase, transportation of narcotic or psychotropic substance and abetment and conspiracy under NDPS Act. She is out on bail.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh jumps to grade A from C in 1 year for school education in Performance Grading Index||LUCKNOW: The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education has some good news for UP. With 804 points out of 1,000, UP has attained grade A in 2019-20 in school education, according to the index released by ministry of education on Sunday. Its grade last year was C. The state has made significant improvement in the governance processes by upping its score by 67 points—from 214 in 2018-19 to 281 (out of 360 in 2019-20). Despite strengthening the areas of governance, UP is among the 24 states which have scored less than 80% of the maximum score. This implies that even if this indicator has been accorded the highest importance, UP must focus upon areas ranging from monitoring the attendance of teachers to ensuring transparent recruitment of teachers and principals that will lead to critical structural reforms. Basic education minister Satish Dwivedi thanked Yogi Adityanth’s dream project ‘Operation Kayakalp’, which is aimed at strengthening the infrastructure in schools. “Our Mission Prerna campaign has helped in improved learning outcomes for students. We aim to achieve grade A+ next year,” Dwivedi said. The grading index, which analyses the performance of states on 70 parameters, has put UP with 10 other states that have shown improvement in their score by 10% to 20% in comparison to last year. The report stated that UP has shown an improvement by at least 10 points in areas of learning outcomes and quality in school education due to an improvement in their reporting mechanisms. In learning outcome and quality, UP scored 132 points (out of 180) in 2019-20 against 114 in 2018-19. The scores obtained in higher standards are less than those in lower standards. It is, therefore, imperative to ensure better interventions at the lower standards as it will have a positive cascading effect at the higher levels, stated the report. Infrastructure and facilities in UP require attention. With a score of 113 out of 150, this area is a cause for concern as a proper school building with adequate facilities is a must to improving the overall quality of school education. Indicators like availability of ICT facilities and timely availability of textbooks and uniforms, which are critical inputs for better performance of students (and mentioned in the RTE Act), are measured in this domain. In access and equity, the state scored 65 (out of 80), and 213 (out of 230) respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-jumps-to-grade-a-from-c-in-1-yr-for-school-edu-in-pgi/articleshow/83324158.cms||Isha Jain

Now, its 28th rank in Majhi Vasundhara Abhiyan, launched by Maharashtra government’s environment and climate change department, comes as a rude shock. And the score — 130 marks out of 1,500 — presents a dismal picture for Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). The city was among 395 urban local bodies (including 28 AMRUT cities) and 304 panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) to participate in Majhi Vasundhara Abhiyan competition launched last October and the result was declared on June 5. Thane top scored with 1,127, followed by Navi Mumbai 976 and Greater Mumbai 950. The initiative launched by state minister Aaditya Thackeray focuses on identifying potential action points under five basic elements of nature (panch mahabhuta) to improve environment for the cities. Though the result was declared on June 5 on website https://abhiyanmis.majhivasundhara.in, the NMC apparently tried to hush up its poor performance, sources said. Even the civic body’s environment engineering department did not reveal the score obtained under different categories as it fared very poorly, sources added. The state government had set 400 marks under water category, earth 600 marks, air 100, energy 100 and enhancement 300 marks. Criteria for markings was included for number of trees planted in the city, newly created green areas, percentage of solid waste collected, segregated and scientifically treated, air quality monitoring, greening roadside areas, promotion of public transport, rainwater harvesting among others. In most areas, the civic body’s performance was poor, said sources. The environmental engineering department could not reveal where the civic body secured less marks. A senior official from the department claimed it has yet not received the marks it scored in the competition. “The state has only declared the score,” the official claimed. Sources, however, pointed out that being a first year of the competition, the NMC was caught unawares about the criteria. Hence the poor performance, added the source. Admitting city’s poor performance, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said it is an important Abhiyan for the city. “NMC will ensure that in the days to come, we will definitely improve our ranking. Serious efforts will be put in during next surveys so that city secures better position in environment competitions too,” he said. Green activist Shrikant Deshpande expressed concern over the city’s poor performance and said it will slip further in future competitions. Citing example of study carried out by Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), Nagpur city has lost 40% of green cover in the last 20 years. “Even the condition of lakes in the city is deteriorating. Barring three lakes — Sonegaon, Futala and Ambazari — all other lakes have reportedly turned into ponds with rampant encroachments in their catchment areas,” he said. According to Deshpande, Nagpurians should elect those leaders whose slogan should be “Jo paryavaran ki baat karega... woh desh pe raj karega (those who would protect the environment, would rule the country).” Green Cities in Maharashtra Cities---Score---Ranking Thane---1127 | 1 Navi Mumbai---976 | 2 Greater Mumbai---950 | 3 Chandrapur---788 | 8 Amravati---267 | 21 Akola---139 | 27 Nagpur---130 | 28 Times View For a city that once prided itself as second greenest in the country, to be 28th in Maharashtra is a matter of immense shame. It should also be a matter of worry. The last few years have seen trees being felled with reckless abandon as the city chased its ‘development’ dream. Just see how authorities are steamrollering the opposition to mass felling for Ajni IMS. While jury remains out on whether such projects are doing any economic good to the city, the ecological harm is already evident. About time we said no to them and made clean air and water our top priorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/poor-show-city-ranks-28th-in-state-environment-contest/articleshow/83322202.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

An inquiry was initiated after top authorities came to know of the dispute, sources say.The tender may be scrapped or would be awarded to the second lowest bidder, said sources.Apprehending that the tender would be terminated, the company M/s GVK EMRI (which is L2) has made a representation before the home minister Narrottam Mishra giving examples of other states where a single bidder who is left after the technical evaluation was awarded the tender.Earlier this company had filed a complaint with the SSP (radio) police telecommunication HQ, accusing the other of enclosing bogus documents to meet the eligibility criteria, say sources.“To meet the pre-qualification criteria the consortium has to provide proof of operating 250 passenger vehicles /LMV/ HMV/ambulances in India in multicity scenario and they (the competitor firm) have given a proof of operating passenger services of IBM in Gurgaon and Bengaluru,” alleges a previous complaint sent by a vice-president of the complainant firm. He says they contacted the IT company and got an email response that the competitor firm was running no more than 90 vehicles.“They don’t qualify for the bid pre-qualification and technical evaluation stage itself,” he wrote, urging the MP government to contact the tech MNC if they want to verify the details. The letter of complaint also doubts a certificate presented by the competitor firm on operating emergency vehicles in another state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/home-dept-to-decide-fate-of-600cr-tender-for-dial-100-vehicles-today/articleshow/83319658.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab BJP VP regrets, withdraws statement against advocate on granthi’s arrest||Jalandhar: Punjab BJP vice-president Rajesh Bagha has expressed regret and withdrawn his May 21 statement against a Bathinda-based advocate Harpal Sngh Khara who had lodged an FIR against granthi Gurmail Singh for performing ‘ardas’ with reverential reference to Sirsa dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim at gurdwara in Beer Talab village of Bathinda district. It also nips in the bud attempts to make the case against the granthi a Dalit issue. In the state expressing regret issued on Monday, Bagha said, “Harpal Singh Khara has performed his duty being a Sikh devotee as his feelings were hurt due to the ‘ardas’ by the Granthi Gurmail Singh for the Dera Chief Gurmit Ram Rahim and not due to prayers performed for well-being of Prime Minister Narendra Modi....” The Punjabi version of this statement also added "I admit the mistake". Bagha issued this corrigendum as Khara’s counsel had sent a legal notice to the BJP leader asking him to issue a corrigendum to apologize within 15 days and also to pay compensation of Rs 5 crore. In is earlier statement, Bagha, who is former chairman of Punjab Scheduled Caste Commission, had alleged, "Granthi Gurmail Singh praising PM Narinder Modi’s decision to make Dalit chief minister in Punjab prayed for his good health in the ‘ardas’, after which at behest of the Congress leaders, advocate Harpal Singh Khara lodged a complaint with the police and the dalit granthi was arrested. It is clear from all this that ruling Congress does not want that a Dalit should become CM of Punjab. After BJP’s announcement that a Dalit would be CM of the state other parties are now afraid." Other BJP leaders, including National SC Commission chairman Vijay Sampla, had also claimed that Granthi Gurmail Singh was booked for performing ‘ardas’ for PM Modi. However advocate Khara had rubbished the allegations stating that his complaint was only against praise of Sirsa dera chief Gurmit Ram Rahim. The corrigendum on Bagha's behalf was issued through state BJP media co-secretary Janardhan Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-bjp-vp-regrets-withdraws-statement-against-advocate-on-granthis-arrest/articleshow/83322141.cms||IP Singh
---||Patna||Bihar: CSP in-charge robbed of Rs 5 lakh, killed in Samastipur||Patna/Samastipur: Unidentified criminals looted Rs 5 lakh from the in-charge of a customer service point (CSP) of a nationalized bank and shot him dead in Samastipur district on Monday. The deceased, identified as Sunil Kumar, is stated to be the younger brother of former MP from Ujiarpur and JD(U) district president of Samastipur Ashwamedh Devi. The incident took place around 1.30pm near Jhakhra village under Sarairanjan police station area in the district. Police said five criminals on three motorbikes intercepted Sunil when he was returning to his CSP at Meyari on a bike after withdrawing the cash from Sarairanjan branch of the Central Bank of India. The criminals escaped with the looted amount after leaving Sunil in a pool of blood. He was rushed to a local primary health centre where the doctor declared him brought dead. The news about the loot and subsequent murder on the busy road spread like wild fire in the area and some local residents blocked the NH-103 to vent their ire. The protestors dispersed only after Samastipur SP Manavjeet Singh Dhillon assured them that the criminals would be arrested at the earliest. Earlier on May 19, another CSP in-charge, Omnath Choudhary alias Prashant Kumar, was robbed of Rs 1.5 lakh and gunned down near Sivaisinghpur under Mohiuddin Nagar police station area in the district. When contacted, Dhillion said a special team has been assigned the task to crack the two cash loot cases. “We hope to get results very soon,” he told this newspaper over phone. Another police officer associated with the probe said a few suspects have been detained for interrogation on the basis of CCTV footage obtained from the bank. The criminals were reportedly chasing Sunil from the bank itself, the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/csp-in-charge-robbed-of-rs5-lakh-killed-in-samastipur/articleshow/83318391.cms||Ramashankar
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh slips 27 points in national school grading index||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh has faltered in the latest performance grading index (PGI) issued by the department of school and literacy, government of India for 2019-20. In the latest index (2019-20), MP secured 748 points on the scale of 1000 while it had scored 775 points in the previous PGI. As per the released data, MP secured place in grade 3 (701-750 on the scale of 1000) in which other states were Assam, Bihar and Mizoram. Even states like J&K and Tripura scored better than MP. Neighbouring state Chhattisgarh is in grade 4 (751-700 on the scale of 1000). The schemes initiated by the Department of School Education and Literacy (DoSEL) along with the implementation of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, have resulted in significant improvement in accessibility to education. As a logical next step, the focus has now shifted from access to quality of education. DoSEL, therefore, has designed the Performance Grading Index (PGI) to catalyse transformational changes in the field of school education. The index grades states and union territories on a set of 70 parameters to assess and catalyse transformational change in the field of education. Five states and union territories including Punjab, Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu, Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Kerala occupy the highest grade (Grade A++) for 2019-20. The PGI for the States and Union Territories (UTs) was first published in 2019 for the reference year 2017-18. The PGI for reference year 2018-19 was published in the year 2020. The present publication, PGI 2019-20 The PGI for the States and Union Territories (UTs) was first published in 2019 for the reference year 2017-18. The PGI for reference year 2018-19 was published in the year 2020. The present publication, PGI 2019-(MDM), is created and maintained by the DoSEL, MoE. For remaining 16 parameters, scores from National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017 conducted by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) have been used in all the three PGIs- PGI 2017-18, PGI 2018-19 and PGI 2019-20. The PGI is structured in two categories, namely, outcomes and governance and Management; it comprises 70 indicators in aggregate with a total weightage of 1000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-slips-27-points-in-school-grading-index/articleshow/83319688.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Unlock, stock & staring down barrel||NEW DELHI: On Day 1 of the second phase of lockdown relaxations, not many shops opened, and those that did in markets like Connaught Place, Lajpat Nagar, Greater Kailash I &II, Green Park, South Extension, Sadar Bazar, Laxmi Nagar and Preet Vihar mostly had no customers. TOI also saw that on an odd-dated day, shops with even numbering had opened in violation of the alternate day operations norm. The otherwise crowded Laxmi Nagar market was almost closed on Monday except for a few air-conditioners and sweets shops. “Most shop owners opened the shops only to clean them and to check their stocks before actually starting operations,” said Ashok Gupta, a trader. Things looked similar at Preet Vihar where many big showrooms were empty. Even the major south Delhi markets in Green Park, GK I and GK II M Block and South Extension wore a deserted look. There were very few customers around and the shops seemed to be taking the opportunity of carrying out maintenance work after almost 50 days of closure. Rajender Sharda, head of the M Block market at GK I, requested the government to have all the parking attendants vaccinated in the next few days and to prevent the Civil Defence personnel from harassing people to boost customer confidence. CP was virtually closed, with Atul Bhargava, president, New Delhi Traders’ Association claiming that even the showrooms that had opened was mostly for repair or maintenance. “More or less, everyone is scared and so not resuming business,” he said. Sarojini Nagar Market was relatively more populated even without the still-banned hawkers. Ashok Randhawa, member of the traders’ association, described the footfall as being around a third of normal and said it was “good” considering it was just the first day response after the lockdown. The problem there, however, was the ignorance of physical distancing requirements. While experts have recommended double masking, compliance wasn’t total, and a few shoppers with handkerchiefs and gamcha covering their faces argued with Civil Defence Volunteers. In CP, Sadar Bazar and some other markets, policemen had to step in to enforce the mask orders. At Sadar Bazar, shopkeepers had marked their shops with red and green colours, the former to open on even dates and the latter on odd days. “Our challenge is implementing social distance on our narrow lanes, which are barely 3-4 feet wide,” admitted Paramjeet Singh Pamma, vice-president, Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Associations. Shops in Lajpat Nagar didn’t have such a defining system. “Here, the numbering of complexes has been done randomly and it is not feasible to implement the odd-even concept,” argued Ashwini Marwah, secretary, Traders’ Association of Lajpat Nagar. “So, even-numbered shops abutting each other will surely open on Tuesday at cross-purposes with the odd-even scheme.” Despite some wholesale markets seeing congestion on Monday, attended by widespread flouting of Covid-appropriate behaviour, many wholesalers claimed that retailers from far-flung areas were avoiding shopping because the odd-even scheme does not allow them to purchase everything they need in a single visit. Some market association officials, like Sanjay Bhargava of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, also complained of being unable to get e-passes for their employees. In South Extension too, Vijay Kumar, member of the market association, reported problems due to e-passes not getting generated. And since there also was the problem of enforcing the odd-even system because one plot had a single shop while another had two or three, Kumar batted for all shops being allowed to open every day with staggered timing. Most of the shop owners and businessmen generally felt that it would take 3-4 days for the customers to regain confidence and return for shopping without fearing Covid infection. As Sharda said, “We only got a day to get the markets ready for opening.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unlock-stock-staring-down-barrel/articleshow/83322252.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Thane||Mumbai braces for first heavy rain of season from this Thursday||MUMBAI: The city is bracing itself for the first heavy rain of the season from June 10. It is likely to intensify from June 12, said India Meteorological Department (IMD). While the onset of monsoon over Mumbai is yet to be declared, IMD officials said as of Monday, the northern limit of monsoon continued to pass through Alibaug, Pune, Medak, Nalgonda, Rentachintala and Sriharikota. While the official onset over the Maximum City is June 11, it is likely to be declared earlier this year. IMD on Monday, while announcing a district-wise forecast for five days, issued a yellow alert for Mumbai, Thane, Palghar for June 11, indicating heavy rains at isolated places being very likely, and orange alert for Raigad, indicating heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places. But officials said the colour coding for Mumbai is likely to be updated in the coming days. The reason for the rain activity is formation of a low pressure area over North Bay of Bengal and its neighborhood by June 11 being likely, and strengthening of westerlies. “An active rainfall spell is expected over Konkan, Goa and adjoining ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra from June 10 for 4-5 days. Widespread rainfall is expected over the region during the period, with possibility of heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places,” said IMD. Shubhangi Bhute, scientist (IMD), said they are closely monitoring the situation. “For now, we have announced a yellow alert, but it may be upgraded in the coming days depending on the situation,” she said. On Monday there was significant rain in the city. In the 24 hours between June 6-7, Colaba reported 9.4mm of rain and Santacruz 17.2mm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-city-braces-for-first-heavy-rain-of-season-from-this-thursday/articleshow/83327551.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Patna||Bihar: Cop held for boozing inside Gaurichak police station||PATNA: In a state where policemen have to enforce liquor prohibition law, a munshi (constable) was arrested and sent to jail on Monday for boozing inside the police station. Dinesh Yadav, posted at Gaurichak police station in rural Patna, was arrested after a video showing him consuming alcohol on the police station premises went viral on social media on Sunday. The breathalyser test confirmed that the cop had consumed alcohol, Patna additional SP (Sadar) Sandip Singh said. “He was arrested after lodging of an FIR against him under the provisions of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act 2016. Investigation is underway to ascertain the involvement of other policemen posted there,” Sandip said. The viral video, the authenticity of which TOI doesn't confirm, shows Dinesh consuming alcohol at the police station. Some people serving him the banned commodity have also been spotted. However, their identity is being ascertained, authoritative sources in the SSP office said. This is not the first occasion when a policeman has been found consuming alcohol in violation of the prohibition law in the state. State prohibition, excise and registration department minister Sunil Kumar had earlier told the state legislative assembly that altogether 186 police personnel and eight excise department staff had been sacked for violating the prohibition law. In addition, 60 station house officers (SHOs) were debarred from appointment to this post for the next 10 years as punishment, the minister had told the House. Liquor was banned in state on April 5, 2016. Since then, over 3.46 lakh people have been arrested for violating the liquor law. Among them, around 5,000 people were arrested from states like Punjab, Haryana and Jharkhand for supplying the banned commodity in 'dry' Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cop-held-for-boozing-inside-gaurichak-police-station/articleshow/83318494.cms||Ramashankar
---||Rajkot||Rajkot: Infant with swollen kidney slays Covid-19||RAJKOT: A 27-day-old girl has staged a miraculous recovery from Covid-19 infection despite kidney complications, high D-dimer levels and surprisingly elevated sugar level that was as high as 657. The health woes of the infant, now named Lakshmi, started right from her birth in Surendranagar Civil Hospital on May 10. Doctors said she did cry when born, a condition called birth asphyxia, indicating that she did not receive enough oxygen. If babies don’t cry at birth, chances of swelling in the brain increase. After being treated and discharged, her parents again brought her to the hospital after a few days as she had fever, urine problem and swelling on the body. After doctors detected inflammation in the kidney, she was immediately referred to Rajkot Civil Hospital on May 18 with slim chances of survival. As the infant continued to face breathing problems, a Covid-19 test was done which turned out to be positive. The D-dimer level crossed 1,000 and sugar level was 657, much to the surprise of the doctors who then shifted her to high-flow nasal cannula. Talking to TOI, Dr Chetan Bhalgamiya, paediatrician at the Rajkot Civil Hospital, said, “The inflammation in the kidney was a big risk. She was unable to breastfeed properly due to infection.” Doctors said neither of her parents were infected with Covid-19, so it was surprising how the infant got infected. “We verified the family history, but none of the members had Covid. One possibility is that some asymptomatic person might have come in child’s contact and infected her.” Dr. Bhalgamiya added. Lakshmi is the first child of Ashok and Kajal Tharecha who farm labourers in their native Rajgadh village of Dhrangadhra taluka in Surendranagar. Hospital officials said they have treated 191 paediatric patients (aged 1 day to 12 years) since March 2020, but this was the first case where the infant was suffering from dangerously impaired kidney function as well as coronavirus infection.  According to doctors, after a few days she was shifted to HFNC and given insulin which helped in controlling her sugar level. The treatment worked and her sodium levels too normalized. “The swelling on kidney also reduced significantly and she was passing urine normally. Lakshmi was discharged after nine days of treatment on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/infant-with-swollen-kidney-slays-ncov/articleshow/83317676.cms||---

Giri after meeting state BJP chief VD Sharma expressed regrets for his statement. Giri along with Tikamgarh district president Amit Nuna reached BJP state head to meet party chief Sharma. "There was a confusion and in a fit of rage I had made allegations, but now the matter has been resolved and I have apologised to the state president for my conduct. There is no discontentment and all the district leaders have cordial relations," Giri told reporters after the meeting. Giri had on May 28 during a meeting of disaster management committee in collector's office Tikamgarh, blamed Lok Sabha member Virendra Kumar of favouritism.

---||Chandigarh||Scholarship funds: NCSC seeks reply from Punjab||CHANDIGARH: Taking strong notice of the decision taken by the Joint Association of Colleges (JAC) to withhold roll numbers of two lakh scheduled caste students, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) headed by Vijay Sampla has put the Punjab government on notice, asking it to ensure immediate release of roll numbers. The commission has directed the Punjab government to submit an action taken report immediately to the commission. The JAC has stopped roll numbers in protest against non-disbursal of Rs 1,549 crore under the SC post-matric scholarship scheme by the Punjab government but private colleges cannot punish two lakh SC students because of the blunders on the part of Punjab government, said Sampla. He said it was unacceptable to harm the careers of two lakh SC students. The commission has issued notice to the Punjab chief secretary, principal secretary department of social justice, empowerment and minorities and principal secretary department of higher education, asking them to submit an action taken report to the commission immediately. Sampla warned that stopping the roll number or withholding the degree of any student admitted under post-matric scholarship is an offence. He asked the Punjab government to take strict action against the erring government officials. Meanwhile, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukat) has said that the decision of Joint Association of Colleges (JAC) in Punjab to withhold roll numbers is irrational, unjustified and atrocious. Former deputy speaker of Punjab assembly and SAD (Sanyukat) senior vice-president Bir DevinderSinghsaid the JAC should either put up a direct fight against the Punjab governmentormove to the high court against non-disbursal of Rs 1,850 crore under the SC postmatric scholarship scheme. “If the Punjab government has not paid the stipend of Rs 1,850 crore as the scholarship amount of scheduled caste students for years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, then what is the fault of students,” he said. When social justice, empowerment and minorities department principal secretary Kirpa Shankar Saroj had exposed the Rs 2,000 crore SC post matric scholarship scam, the chief ministerimmediately removed the officer from the department instead of taking punitive action against erring officials, Bir Devinder said. It encouraged the perceived perpetrator, Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal, who was the director of the department when the scam happened, and was predictably involved in it, he added. “The chief minister rewarded him with Congress party nomination to contest the byelection from Phagwara assembly constituency, who ironically later became an MLA,” he said. Bir Devinder said that Saroj’s revealing report, some bogus institutions had even returned about Rs 22 crore to the government, but the latter did not bother to register any criminal case against them, as the chief minister and the chief secretary were seen working hand in glove with each other to shield the culprits. “If the central government had sent a huge amount of around Rs 2,000 crore to the department concerned of the Punjab governmentfor thepayment of scholarships to SC students, then why was the payment not made assiduously as per the norms to beneficiaries,” he questioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/scholarship-funds-ncsc-seeks-reply-from-punjab/articleshow/83322192.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Narottam-Kailash deny leadership change, Cong has the last laugh||Bhopal: State Congress on Monday took a dig at home minister Narottam Mishra even as he denied there is any likelihood for a change of leadership in the ruling BJP. Soon as Mishra put the blame on social media and commented that vice-chancellor of Whatsapp University does not require any qualifications and that chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will continue in office, @INCMP tweeted, “Byteveer (brave man giving television bytes) is out of the race for chief minister. Now he is trying to control damages by supporting Shivraj”. An hour later, state Congress tweeted again saying, “Kaun chakhega CM padh ka swad. Kailash, VD, Uma ya phir Prahlad. (Who will get the taste of chief minister’s post? BJP national general secretary Kailash VIjayvargiya, state BJP chief VD Sharma, former chief minister Uma Bharti or Union minister Prahlad Patel?) Last week, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya made a four-day visit to the state capital and met several ministers and RSS leader Suresh Soni. This long visit and his meeting with Suresh Soni sparked speculations on the social media that Vijayvargiya is returning to the state. After Vijayvargiya’s visit, Narottam Mishra and VD Sharma held a meeting at the latter’s residence. Thereafter, both their names also surfaced as being in the race for CM post in case the high-command is considering a change in leadership in the state. Till Sunday, Congress was on a wait-and-watch mode. But when Kailash VIjayvargiya also denied he is in the race for CM post, the Congress had the last laugh. Party spokesman and PCC chief Kamal Nath’s media convener Narendra Saluja took to twitter and said, “In politics within the Madhya Pradesh BJP, Narottam Mishra and Kailash Vijayvargiya who gave a boost to the speculation with closed-door meetings every day and reunions, suddenly seem to have changed their expression today. Now they are saying, Shivraj was there and will remain the chief minister. Did the pressure politics work, has Shivraj bowed down to them?” However, Saluja said that all may not be well in the BJP even after the clarification of Kailash Vijayvargiya. “But Kailash Vijayvargiya’s one line had far deeper meaning. When he was asked if he too is in the race for CM post, he said ‘I am still engaged in another place’”.

---||Agra||22 dead in ‘mock oxygen drill’ at Agra hospital on April 26?||AGRA: The health department in Uttar Pradesh has set up a probe after the owner of a prominent private hospital in Agra was caught on camera purportedly saying that on the morning of April 26 he got the oxygen supply of critical patients snapped for five minutes "as an experiment to know who all are going to survive". Twenty-two of the patients, both in the Covid and non-Covid wards, may not have made it out alive. “There was an acute shortage of oxygen. Modinagar had run out of it. We were asking people to discharge (take away) their patients but no one was ready. So I decided to conduct an experiment… a mock drill of sorts. We snapped the oxygen supply for five minutes on April 26, at 7am. Twenty-two patients started gasping for breath and their bodies began turning blue. So we came to know that they will not survive in case there is no oxygen. Then, family members of the remaining 74 patients in the ICU wards were told to bring their own oxygen cylinders,” Arinjay Jain, owner of Paras hospital bang on NH 2, is heard saying in the video clip, which has now gone viral. When contacted, chief medical officer (CMO) of Agra district, Dr RC Pandey, said, “We have taken cognizance of the video. A committee has been constituted to investigate the matter.” Jain, meanwhile, told TOI that his statement has been "misconstrued". While not denying that it was him in the video, he said, “We had conducted a mock drill to identify critical patients and better serve them. Four Covid-19 patients died on April 26 and three on April 27.” Asked if a total of 22 had died due to lack of oxygen, he said he "did not have the exact numbers". District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “The hospital has a large ICU ward and other deaths may have occurred. The content of the video is being investigated in detail.” A resident of Agra’s Jeevani Mandi area, Mayank Chawla’s grandfather had died on April 26 at the hospital. “On that day, several other patients had died at Paras hospital. It is shocking to see the owner of the hospital narrating the inhuman act of switching off oxygen supply to patients in critical condition. It is murder. Authorities must take strict action against the owner of the hospital.” Superintendent of police Botre Rohan Pramod said, “We have not received any formal complaint in the matter so far. We will look into it only after health authorities approach us. Let them first do the initial investigation. It will not be appropriate to further comment on the subject.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/22-dead-in-mock-oxygen-drill-at-agra-hosp-on-april-26/articleshow/83317708.cms||Deepak Lavania

For, Shruti Dharamsi’s heart was functioning at only 40% capacity and her lungs were also weak. Shruti (38), a former beautician, was scared as in the second wave of Covid, many infected patients suffered from severe lung pneumonia. “My heart is already functioning at very low capacity as I am suffering from Cardiomegaly. My lungs too get filled with water sans medication. When I was tested positive for Covid, I was worried and felt that my chances of recovery may be less due to my prevalent conditions,” Shruti, a resident of Warasia, said. “I had to beat Covid and even ensure that my heart functions properly till I recover from the virus. It was very stressful but my 12-year-old daughter was my motivation. I had to live for her and give her a good life,” Shruti told TOI. But troubles were not over for Shruti as her mother too got infected with Covid just a week after she was tested positive. “I was in home quarantine when she was tested positive. After a few days she was admitted to the hospital as her condition worsened. I had to move out and visit the hospital despite being Covid positive. It was a difficult time as my daughter too was Covid positive. My family stays in another city as I had to manage everything alone,” Shruti added. After 22 days of hospitalization, her mother died on May 26. “It was a shock for us. I had barely recovered when she breathed her last. But I have come out stronger and my heart is also functioning well,” Shruti said. It was in 2018 that Shruti got diagnosed with Cardioheartmegaly wherein the heart enlarges and heart muscles become weak. She has been on medication since then. She used to run a beauty parlour for a living but her condition forced her to close the business and start private tuitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/covid-no-match-for-this-former-beauticians-grit/articleshow/83317748.cms||Tushar Tere

As a photograph of the SP founder was posted by Samajwadi Party’s verified official handle, it got the twitterati busy. The ruling BJP was quick to react, seeking an apology from SP national president Akhilesh Yadav for his "BJP vaccine" comments. The SP founder had been admitted to the Gurugram hosptial on April 7 and has been under medical supervision ever since for regular monitoring of his health parameters. On Monday, the 82-year-old veteran politician took his first dose of the vaccine. Moments later, a photograph of Mulayam wearing the red SP cap while taking the jab was uploaded by SP’s verified Twitter handle. The BJP was quick to respond. Party state president Swatantra Dev Singh tweeted the photograph expressing hope that taking inspiration from the SP founder, the party’s national president and cadres would also get themselves vaccinated. Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya also tweeted MSY’s photo and wrote: "If Akhilesh Yadav is to be believed, party’s founder Mulayam Singh Yadav ji took the BJP vaccine jab…" Maurya said it was now up to the people to decide whether Mulayam had provided BJP publicity or put an end to the confusion spread by his son. "SP founder and former UP CM Mulayam Singh Yadav, thank you for taking the ‘Swadeshi’ vaccine.Your taking the jab is proof that what SP national president Akhilesh Yadav had said about the vaccine was baseless. Akhilesh Yadav should apologise for it," Maurya said in another tweet. Mulayam is not the only member of the Yadav clan to have got himself vaccinated. The SP founder’s younger son, Prateek Yadav, and "chhoti bahu" Aparna Yadav were also vaccinated recently. In January, just after the launch of the Covid vaccination drive, the SP chief had called it a "BJP vaccine". "How can I trust the vaccine which will be used for vaccination by the BJP? We cannot get inoculated by the BJP's vaccine," Akhilesh had said in response to a media query at a press conference in Lucknow on January 2. The BJP had then, too, described it as an attempt to question the hard work that Indian doctors and scientists had put in to produce the vaccine. The party described Akhilesh’s statement as an attempt to spread confusion among the people about the efficacy of the vaccine. A day later, Akhilesh explained that he had full faith in the country’s doctors and scientists and that he was in no confusion about their ability to make the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-patriarch-takes-covid-19-jab-bjp-quick-to-make-a-jibe/articleshow/83324239.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Mango farmers of 14 belts to be trained in harvest operations||LUCKNOW: The horticulture department will train mango farmers in pre-harvest and pro-harvest operations. Select mango growers in 14 fruit belts of UP will be trained by the Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (CISH). In each fruit belt, 50 farmers will be trained. They will receive grants for equipment and infrastructure, said the institute’s director Shailendra Rajan. They will be able to use vending carts to connect to far away. markets. Malihabad has been selected as one of the country’s two mango clusters for development of infrastructure facilities over the next two years. CISH will work with farmers in these clusters to provide technical assistance. Organizations such as the horticulture department and UP State Horticultural Co-operative Marketing Federation (Hofed) will also assist farmers with mango marketing. “Using this cluster approach, there is a good chance that mango growers will be able to get a fair price,” said Rajan. CISH on Saturday hosted an online mango buyer-seller meet to connect farmers, fruit trading companies and government departments. The departments of horticulture and fruit processing, HoFED and directorates of agricultural marketing and agriculture foreign trade took part in the meet along with horticulture and private sector entrepreneurs. The discussion concluded that both pre-harvest and post-harvest operations are critical for producing high-quality mango and profit. Traders start visiting Malihabad’s orchards as soon as small mangoes appear after flowering. Coronavirus, however, kept them away this year. Mostly, farmers are not given a fair price for mangoes by traders. The only solace for farmers is the guaranteed sale of their produce. Once farmers get trained in pre-harvest and post-harvest operations in orchards they can become self-dependent in the business and earn more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mango-farmers-of-14-belts-to-be-trained-in-harvest-operations/articleshow/83324300.cms||---

The state education minister’s promise to announce results by June-end may not be fulfilled and officials in the state board have said results should be declared by mid-July. The state board would soon announce the schedule for submission of marks by schools to their respective division boards. Dinkar Patil, chairman of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, said schools will receive a set of instructions soon, based on which they could start compiling them. “We are working on the instructions for schools and we want to release them at the earliest. We expect to instruct schools on assessment in the next two days. We hope the results will consequently be announced by mid-July,” he added. After SSC exams were cancelled, the Maharashtra State Council for Education Research and Training (MSCERT) prepared the formula for evaluation of SSC students. On May 28, the state government decided to evaluate students with 50% marks from Class IX and the remaining 50% based on the assessment of students conducted during the current academic year. In Maharashtra, there are 25,927 schools and more than 16 lakh students have enrolled for SSC exams. “We have prepared a complete plan for assessment and have instructed all the divisional boards to ensure every parent and student is aware about the assessment pattern. Schools have entered the details of evaluation of students from Std IX in the Saral software, so the government has access to it for calculation,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-ssc-evaluation-to-take-time-results-likely-by-mid-july/articleshow/83319664.cms||---

Amarinder said he had promised to upgrade Malerkotla as a district during his previous tenure in 2005 but it could not materialise then for some reasons. He said he had made a formal announcement about this decision on the occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr on May 14 this year. Initially, sub-divisions of Malerkotla and Ahmedgarh, as well as the sub-tehsil of Amargarh (by upgrading it to sub-division), would be included in the newly-created district. Temporary offices have been set up at the district level and offices of 12 departments would be made operational at district level soon, said the chief minister, adding that the district administrative complex and sub-divisional complex would be constructed at a fast pace. An amount of Rs 20 crore has been allotted for this, he said. A total of 192 villages, 62 patwar circles and six Kanungo circles will be included in Malerkotla district, he said. During his inaugural speech, the chief minister elaborated on the history of Malerkotla, since its establishment by Sheikh Sadruddin-i-Jahan from Afghanistan in 1454. The chief minister also digitally laid the foundation stone of Nawab Sher Mohammed Khan Government Medical College at Malerkotla at a cost of Rs 500 crore. The first installment of Rs 50 crore has already been sanctioned for this. He also laid the foundation stone of Government College for Girls, Malerkotla for Rs 12 crore, a new bus stand (Rs 10 crore) besides a women’s police station. Amarinder announced a grant of Rs 6 crore to ensure urban development under the urban environment improvement programme. The Punjab government, he said, has already acquired the Mubarak Manzil Palace and its restoration and upkeep would be a befitting tribute to the Nawabs of Malerkotla. Punjab water supply, sanitation, and transport minister Razia Sultana, who is also the local MLA, thanked the chief minister for this “precious gift” to residents of Malerkotla. PPCC president Sunil Jakhar, while hailing this decision, urged the CM to explore the potential of developing a few other districts like Abohar and Batala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-cm-inaugurates-malerkotla-as-23rd-district/articleshow/83322288.cms||---
---||Rajkot||‘Covid-hit people falling into superstitions trap’||RAJKOT: The Covid-19 pandemic has left such a deep psychological impact on people’s minds that a majority of those who recovered have turned to blind faith for healing. In an extensive survey of 1,620 Covid-recovered patients and their family members carried out by the Saurashtra University, nearly 60% people confessed to approaching tantriks (witch doctors) when their kin fell ill with symptoms of this virus. The respondents in the survey which was conducted by the psychology department include 45.3% from urban areas. Overall, the survey reveals that 36% of the people gave into blind faith and unfounded beliefs after recovering from Covid-19. Head of department Yogesh Jogsan and assistant professor Hasmukh Chavda went to the respondents with questionnaires and got these shocking results. Another shocking finding was the belief that branding is a cure for those infected with the virus with as much as 45.3% believing in this torturous method. According to surveyors, 27 % participants accepted that they did not believe in lucky charm or charm bracelets earlier, but during the pandemic they started feeling that these do help. Around 45 % participants admitted that they believed that lucky charm, charm bracelet and witch doctors can help cure the infection. “Blind faith is directly connected with psychology. A fourth-year student who often fails doesn’t want to listen that he is weak in studies but readily believes that luck is not favouring him. It's human psychology that people need something to blame and they want quick results. When lakhs of people start believing in unfounded beliefs, it’s a dangerous sign for the entire society and this is what the survey reveals.” Chavda said “tantriks have started conning people in the name of blind faith by exploiting their fear and insecurity caused by the pandemic. There are several reasons like ignorance, lower economical status, propaganda, lack of education, traditional beliefs, cultural beliefs that have aggravated the beliefs in superstitions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/covid-hit-people-falling-into-superstitions-trap/articleshow/83317791.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Chandigarh||Sikh Forum asks PM, HM for ‘truth and reconciliation commission’||IP.Singh@timesgroup.com Jalandhar: On the occasion of 37th anniversary of Operation Blue Star, Delhi-based Sikh Forum has sent a resolution, signed by prominent Sikhs, including former IAS and defence forces officers, to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, urging them to appoint a truth and reconciliation commission to record incidents of violence against innocents during 1980s. Mentioning the Army action on Darbar Sahib and 37 other gurdwaras, the resolution said, “The Indian state ordered this aggressive action against its own people. It resulted in the death of thousands of innocent men, women and children, who had gone to the shrine to pay their homage to Guru Arjan Dev. Many Sikhs were killed elsewhere in Punjab in the military operations in June 1984. The army action was followed, in November 1984, with the horrific pogrom against the Sikh community, when again thousands of innocent Sikhs were brutally murdered in Delhi and other parts of the country.” Saying that Sikhs globally were keeping the collective memory of both the tragic events alive, the resolution said, “the Sikh community must never forget these incidents lest they are repeated.” “Over the last 37 years, the Sikhs, individually and collectively along with members of civil society, have been demanding justice for those wronged by the Indian state. Unfortunately, over time, it has become increasingly difficult to pursue legal cases, even though the Sikh community will continue to pursue them unless we get justice.” “The Sikh Forum demands that the Indian government appoint a Truth and reconciliation Commission to record incidences of violence against the innocent during the 1980s and urges reconciliation from those who suffered. Such a recording of crimes against the innocent and recognizing the failure of the Indian police and the judicial system may help make sure that such acts never happen,” the resolution added. It further stated that the safety and security of Sikhs was not possible in an environment that promoted hatred and enmity among groups and communities. It said there had to be fundamental change in the national culture of doing politics and ensuring constitutional rights for all. The letter was sent by the Sikh Forum to PM and HM by acting president Ravinder Singh Ahuja and general secretary Partap Singh, former DIG. Others who signed the resolution included former IAS officers Bhupinder Singh, Tirlochan Singh, Chiranjiv Singh, Lt Gen D S Sodhu (retd), former Vice-Admiral B S Randhawa, Maj Gen M S Chadha (retd) former MP Tarlochan Singh, Prof A S Narang, Captain L S Bahl, Dr D P Singh and Dr Uma Chakarvarty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sikh-forum-asks-pm-hm-for-truth-and-reconciliation-commission/articleshow/83322337.cms||I P Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: S-mall wonder! People back, but it’s far from normal||NEW DELHI: After a gap of about two months, malls in Delhi were thrown open to public on Monday. However, the malls received a lukewarm response as not many people turned up. At Ambience Mall in Vasant Kunj, many families and small groups of friends were seen taking pictures while many visitors roamed around from one store to another. A spokesperson at Ambience Mall said that they were following a high standard of sanitisation and safety protocols. “Following the guidelines set by Delhi government, thermal scanners have been placed at all entry points to check the temperature of shoppers. Hand sanitising units are also placed at several locations. To ensure social distancing, the current guidelines on opening of shops on an odd-even basis are being followed strictly at the mall. Also, to encourage no-touch formula, thermal scanning machine with infra-red screening is being used instead of frisking. It is mandatory to wear masks at all times,” said the spokesperson. The spokesperson added that all door handles, rails, washrooms, ATM and other touch points like trolleys and baskets were wiped with an alcohol-based sanitiser. “The entire mall staff has been educated on Covid prevention measures and equipped with face masks, face shields and gloves. A well-dedicated team of trained professionals is available at all times for deep cleaning interventions. Stores are following sanitisation and social distancing protocols by controlling shopper density and are strictly adhering to the government guidelines.” At Select Citywalk in Saket, the shops were opened on alternate basis and many of them had delivery desks to assist consumers with home delivery of the purchased products. The options of takeaway and home delivery are available at the restaurants, coffee shops and food courts, but dining is currently not allowed. “Queue managers have been deployed to ensure social distancing in the mall,” said a staff member. Yogeshwar Sharma, executive director & CEO, Select Citywalk, said, “The first day of unlock was managed with a great deal of caution and all safety guidelines of the government were adhered to. We are glad to have opened our doors for patrons and we are following the proposed odd-even rule for all retail outlets to maintain social distancing. The consumer sentiment is cautious but encouraging and we are glad that our retail partners, stakeholders and consumers have placed their trust in us. We mostly received serious shoppers who were keen to visit specific stores for their retail needs.” Sneha Singh, one of the shoppers, said, “My brother is getting married in July and I came to the mall only for specific items.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/s-mall-wonder-people-back-but-its-far-from-normal/articleshow/83322374.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

Ruling parties in BMC have indulged in ‘haath safai’ instead of ‘nullah safai’, said BJP MLA Ashish Shelar, after inspecting desilting work. Shelar led a BJP delegation to inspect pre-monsoon desilting of drains by BMC. Times ViewBMC’s claims of desilting drains and making the city flood-free have failed year after year. BMC makes tall claims but they are washed out in the rain. This year, parts of the city were flooded when Cyclone Tauktae struck. Netas and BMC must ensure that errant contractors and officials are punished.This was the third inspection this season, with Shiv Sena and Congress already going on what activists and political observers are calling ‘nullah safai tourism’ last month. With BMC elections less than a year away, and this being the last monsoon before that, political parties are keen to cash in on desilting work. While Sena, which rules BMC, claims that desilting has been done 100% and the city will not flood, BJP said the claims were bogus and will be washed away. Congress, part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government but an opposition party in BMC, said claims of desilting are a farce. Last month, city Congress president Bhai Jagtap and party corporator Ravi Raja, who is Opposition leader in BMC, carried out an inspection. Raja said BMC was making claims of 100% desilting, but many drains were choked with trash and silt. “BMC’s claims are a farce. If these claims fail, we will dump silt outside the home of additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu. They are misleading people,” Shelar said. BMC claimed desilting of Mithi river and minor nullahs is on schedule and will be finished in few days. After an inspection last month, mayor Kishori Pednekar had said desilting was being carried out on a war-footing and it would give maximum relief to people during heavy rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ruling-parties-in-bmc-are-indulging-in-haath-safai-not-nullah-safai-says-bjp-mla/articleshow/83322792.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

What could a third wave bring for the state? The state government is preparing for resources assuming cases will double – at 29,000 to 30,000 per day. Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani told TOI that the state machinery’s focus is to ensure that the third wave doesn’t happen. “But if it happens, we are preparing the state machinery to respond it in the best possible manner. We are scientifically preparing an action plan to respond to the third wave,” he said. “The maximum daily cases may double compared to the second wave. We are drawing up district-wise action plans.” The CM said they are ensuring that all citizens get beds, oxygen and medicines. “All district government hospitals and medical college infrastructure will be upgraded shortly,” said Rupani. It is notable that the state has lifted several restrictions including the start of public transport, allowing 100% staff at government and private offices, and increasing business hours from Monday. The decision was taken after a steady fall in daily and active Covid-19 cases. “In the second wave, we tried to control the pandemic by relatively less restrictions so the citizens don’t need to stop economic activities, and also to ensure that movements are not restricted unnecessarily,” said the CM. “While several other states opted for complete lockdown, we opted for limited lockdown with other restrictions. We still could bring the daily Covid cases down. We however are regularly monitoring the situation daily to ensure that there is no further rise in cases.” Analysis of the three peaks of Covid-19 – in September, November and April – reveal that there was not much difference between the first two peaks as cases remained around 1,000 to 1,600. But the third peak in April was nine times higher than the previous peak. Experts said that the system took time to adjust to the massive surge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-readying-for-30k-daily-covid-cases-in-third-wave/articleshow/83322378.cms||Kapil Dave

The interim order was passed by the NGT principal bench at Delhi in an application that sought “compliance of EC conditions in providing parking by Skylark Buildcom Pvt Ltd and Oberoi Realty Ltd, Mumbai”. The panel will comprise representatives of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), said the June 4 order uploaded on Monday. No lawyers appeared for the builders, noted the NGT, but the order by a five-member bench headed by chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel stated, “We have considered the application and find that the grievance needs to be gone into by a joint committee of CPCB, MPCB and SEIAA, Maharashtra.” A spokesperson for Oberoi Realty declined to comment on Monday. The application claimed the SRA project for Sai Sundar Nagar CHS and other amalgamated societies is coming up on a 21-acre plot in Worli with “260 super luxury flats”. Mumbai residents Santosh Patil and Manoj Salvi, through their advocate Aditya Pratap, had filed the application before the NGT for directions to provide 500 parking slots as set out in the January 28, 2016, EC issued by the SEIAA. The EC condition stated, “Traffic congestion near the entry and exit points from the roads adjoining the proposed project site must be avoided. Parking be fully internalised and no public spaces should be utilised. Parking for existing and proposed development (1,726 for sale building and 500 for rehab building).” The MPCB shall be the “nodal agency for coordination and compliance” said the NGT. “The joint committee may look into the grievance and if there is violation of EC conditions, take suitable measures as per law, including assessment and recovery of compensation, following due process. The joint committee may visit the site and is also free to conduct proceedings online,” the order added. The committee may interact with the stakeholders and consult any other expert and submit any ‘action-taken report’ within two months, said the NGT and posted the next hearing on September 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ngt-panel-to-verify-green-nod-for-parking-area-of-sra-project-in-mumbai/articleshow/83322354.cms||Swati Deshpande

Suspended mayor Somya Gurjar who was always surrounded by controversies slammed the government for shielding a bureaucrat, Yagya Mitra Singh and ousting elected candidates due to political animosity. Gurjar said, “The state government’s action without listening to my side of the story is undemocratic. I will not bow down to the pressure.” The BJP, which secured a comfortable victory in JMC-Greater pollswas forced to come out on roads to protest Gurjar’s suspension. Deputy mayor Puneet Karnawat alleged, the action was taken to settle scores and suspension was done in haste even before investigation. “The Congress government is attempting to unsettle the functioning of Greater corporation. Earlier, it intervened when committees were constituted, however, faced a defeat. Now, it is adopting unconstitutional practices to suspend the mayor on a false complaint.” BJP mayor and ruling Congress slugfest has been witnessed for quite some time in JMC-Greater. Earlier, the state government dismissed the working committees. However, order was stayed by the Rajasthan High Court. Following this, the CEO had sent a list of 10 working committees to the state government and asked to allocate specific work. A BJP councillor said, “No work has been done so far in the heritage corporation where Congress party has formed the board. Due to immense friction, the committees are not constituted. The public is suffering due to political rivalry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/congress-turf-war-intensifies/articleshow/83324328.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: After Corona, methylene blue finds takers in mucormycosis too||VADODARA: In the first wave, its use was isolated and only few doctors as well as citizens used it. But in the second wave of Covid-19, methylene blue (MB) gained rapid popularity and is being said to be helpful in avoiding one of the most dreaded post-Covid ailments — mucormycosis (MM) or the Black Fungus. The use of MB in the state began in Bhavnagar with veteran pulmonologist Dr Deepak Golwalkar using it to treat his Covid patients and was limited to a few isolated cases elsewhere. This, however, changed rapidly after the deadly second wave when many others too started to campaign for the cheap drug. Observations regarding its success in avoiding the Black Fungus have added to the popularity. According to Golwalkar, the anti-fungal activity of MB is very strong and known since over a century. “Those patients who were treated with MB have not developed the fungus at all,” he said. Golwalkar said that he had treated around 7,000 patients so far using MB and none of them had Mucormycosis. Golwalkar says that MB can be given orally, through a nebuliser or intravenous He said that even patients who were on oxygen under his treatment did not get the fungal infection. Apart from mucormycosis, the patients also did not suffer from post-Covid fibrosis of the lungs. The mass popularity of MB came from Surat where a campaign was started to ensure that it reached every home. Activist Ashwin Sankdasariya along with like minded people started working on the project. The group believes that MB is an effective and cheap weapon against Covid and, now, mucormycosis. “There cab be multiple reasons for the infection including use of industrial oxygen, using tapped water in oxygen humidifiers, comorbidities and others. We ran six Covid isolation centres and treated patients there using methylene blue. None of the patients treated by us got mucormycosis,” claimed Sankdasariya. Sankdasariya pointed out that many doctors were using MB, but were not willing to go public with information. MB is also being used in oxygen humidifiers by some doctors, he said. Sankdasariya said that the group in Surat itself has distributed over four lakh litres MB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/after-corona-methylene-blue-finds-takers-in-mm-too/articleshow/83317888.cms||Sachin Sharma

According to the police, most of these women worked as stage performers at big events and weddings in Pune, Mumbai and other cities. They were left without means of livelihood owing to the Covid restrictions. Thus, to earn a living, these women took the risk of attending illegal parties at farmhouses. “I have been home and out of work after the latest curbs were announced. I even worked for a food delivery aggregator before the assignments of parties started coming in. So, I quit my job as a ‘food delivery girl’ and chose to take assignments at private dance parties,” a performer from the Katraj area said.She said, “Travelling in cabs, the police never stopped us. I earned enough money to support my family after attending a private party recently.”Abhinav Deshmukh, Pune rural superintendent of police, said, “We found these women dancing to the tunes of Bollywood numbers when we raided bungalows/farmhouses. While recording their statements, we found that most of these women belong to economically backward families.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-most-dancers-held-from-economically-weak-families/articleshow/83325886.cms||---

An extensive search was launched which went in vain for several hours. However, around 4.30pm on Monday, jail authorities claimed to have found the accused, Vijay Arakh, 22, hiding in the bushes between the inner and the outer boundary of the Banda jail. The incident has raised questions over the security at Banda jail and exposed the claims of jail officials about foolproof arrangements to guard Mukhtar who were brought here on April 7 from Punjab’s Ropar jail on the Supreme Court’s directive. The security apparatus includes deployment of 22 additional personnel, installation of 38 CCTV cameras and aerial surveillance by drones. Vijay Aarakh was found missing from barrack number 4 during the head count at 8:30pm on Sunday. The emergency alarm was raised and three police teams were formed to trace him at possible spots, including his native village in Banda. DIG Chitrakoot range, K Satyanarayan, told TOI that the accused was a first time offender and had been arrested for theft and trespassing.. DIG jails, Prayagraj range, Sanjeev Tripathi, who supervised the search operation, said any jail official found responsible for the incident would face action. Tripathi also inspected the jail on Monday morning. Sources told TOI that 30 personnel form the security cordon around Mukhtar’s barrack while the area where Vijay was lodged has 338 prisoners and with just one policeman on duty for four hours each. They said Vijay was lodged in the prison on February 6 this year and knew the prison area. “He picked up a bamboo stick from the food storeroom of the jail and then scaled the inner wall which is about eight feet high using the bamboo,” said an officer. Senior jail officials said Vijay belongs to the ‘Nat’ community and is skilled in using bamboo sticks. They added that Vijay had missed out on securing bail on the grounds of Covid pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/inmate-escapes-from-banda-prison-that-also-houses-mukhtar-ansari/articleshow/83324325.cms||Arindam Ghosh
---||Bhopal||Govt planning to hand over media management to private agency: Kamal Nath||BHOPAL: Former chief minister Kamal Nath in a statement on Monday alleged that the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government is planning to cripple the public relations department and clandestinely working to hand-over media handling and management work to a private agency. The senior Congress leader said that list of work prepared for the private agency includes “purchasing” the media. “The state public relations department in March this year, prepared a proposal to appoint on contractual basis a private agency for public relations management and content creation work. The proposal mentions that companies that apply must have an annual turn-over of at least Rs 50 crore and if the turn-over is less that not more than three companies can make a consortium and apply,” Kamal Nath said. He explained that after handing over the public relations work to the private agency, all assignments which are presently with the department will be shifted to the company. Kamal Nath claimed that all credible public relations officers of the department will have no work. “Filing newspaper clippings, preparing material on chief minister and government’s policies and schemes, organizing events, contacting media organisations, even analysis of news articles is being given to the private agency,” the former Union minister alleged. This move can affect the job security of employees and officials working for the department. Nath said that government has not even filled the posts that are lying vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/nath-govt-planning-to-hand-over-media-mgmt-to-pvt-agency/articleshow/83319952.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Hospitals erring on mucormycosis SOPs may lose DCH status in Nagpur district||NAGPUR: Medical establishments may lose Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH) status if they fail to follow standard infection prevention practices as recommended by the mucormycosis task force and health officials. Following the high court’s order, the task force’s specialist team members have prepared a standard operating procedures (SOPs) for effective infection control, hygiene and cleanliness to be followed by hospitals. This protocol would soon be sent to all hospitals in the district. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and other officials will monitor Dedicated Covid Hospitals for adherence to the SOPs. Dr Sanjay Chilkar, NMC chief medical officer, said the DCHs are expected to follow the protocol strictly. “Expert team would inspect the hospitals in the coming days to ascertain whether they are following the principles laid down in the protocol. The hospitals would be informed about lacunae, if any, following which they are expected to rectify them,” he said. “If any hospital fails to rectify the lacunae, it would stand a chance of losing the DCH status and will not get the approval next time,” said Dr Chilkar. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said the standard protocol would revolve around how to improve air quality in hospitals and basic infection prevention, which are the two baseline causes of mucormycosis. Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) and Indian Medical Association (IMA) too have been asked by the high court to sensitize their members regarding the significance of hygiene and infection control. According to renowned microbiologist Dr Dinesh Agrawal, a member of the task force, the hospital infection control committee and guidelines of National Accreditation Board for Hospitals (NABH) focus on ensuring premises, especially key areas like wards, operation theatres and ICUs, are kept ‘organism-free’, but not many follow them diligently. “We will provide the hospitals with basic guidelines for infection control and maintenance of hygiene as mucormycosis is an infection contracted from the surrounding and hence keeping the ambience sterile is of utmost importance,” he said. “Our committee would visit hospitals to check their level of adherence to the guidelines,” he said. Dr Anup Marar, convener of VHA, said the high court has directed hospitals, especially the Covid treatment facilities, to rule out any feasible causes of the fungal infections. “Most Covid hospitals are already following infection control practices and many have now added saline nasal washes or sprays in the treatment protocol. Likewise, Covid patients too are being advised regular check-ups of their sugar level and also ENT assessments,” he said. A senior microbiologist, who was also part of the district team, said the standard protocol would be simple and feasible even for moderately equipped hospitals. Dr Tushar Gawad, director (administration), Alexis Multispecialty Hospital, said environmental cleanliness and air quality management are the two most important aspects for his organization. “We lay much stress on ample daylight and fresh air. We also have infection control teams and our manpower is regularly trained,” he said. “There is regular cleaning of ducts and also proper controlling of air conditioning system,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hospitals-erring-on-mucor-sops-may-lose-dch-status/articleshow/83322388.cms||Soumitra Bose

As the state prepares for a possible third wave in the second half of the year, the administration’s focus is on increasing bed capacity and identifying facilities that can be converted into Covid Care Centres (CCCs). Several community halls and public places in Ahmedabad have been identified for the purpose, said officials. Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA) officials said at its peak, over 6,000 beds were earmarked for Covid-19 treatment, and of these 94%-97% were occupied. Even at the biggest facilities like the 1,200-bed Covid Hospital in Ahmedabad, queues of more than 50 ambulances were reported. In Surat – the second worst-affected city after Ahmedabad in terms of cases – peak occupancy was 7,886 beds at dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH) and Community Covid Isolation Centres (CCIC). SMC officials said there was 85% occupancy at DCHs while the overall occupancy was 67% on April 14. In this period, 1,496 beds were added at CCICs. A total of 261 hospitals including ten government hospitals with 4,000 beds and 251 private hospitals with more than 10,000 beds were treating patients in Vadodara during the peak of the second wave when the hospitals were flooded not only with patients from the city and its periphery but also from outside the district and state. “Vadodara admitted and treated more patients than Ahmedabad and Surat but there was almost zero waiting of ambulances at OPDs as we had adopted an intelligent referral system,” said Dr Vinod Rao, officer on special duty for Covid-19 in Vadodara. “The capacity of ventilator beds which was 90 in March was increased to 1,200 by May 1,” he said, adding that even during the peak, 15 % of them were getting empty every day. “Around 200 people got ventilators each day even during the worst days.” The availability of free hospital beds which was 1,250 in March 2021 was increased to 4,000 beds in May 2021 in Vadodara.

---||Jaipur||Trash torment: Murky dealings hit garbage collection in Jaipur||JAIPUR: With no amicable solution in sight on how to make payments to the firm managing the door-to-door garbage collection project, the issue will continue to raise a stink in the city. Though the firm resumed work on Monday after receiving an assurance from the state government, the recent fight between mayor, bureaucrat and the firm over clearance of approximately Rs 290 crore indicates a whiff of a scam in the garbage collection scheme. A member of the sanitation committee at JMC-Greater alleged that the firm was not lifting 1,600 metric tonnes of garbage from the city and producing inflated bills. “On April 27, the joint sanitation committee of JMC-Greater passed a resolution to terminate the contract of the company after it failed miserably. The officials who are hand-in-glove with the firm are dragging their feet to take action. For the past four years, the bills of the company were never settled. How is it possible that the firm is working without getting remuneration?” Councillors further alleged that despite door-to-door garbage collection being launched, trash remains littered in all the neighbourhoods. Congress councillor, who wished not to be named said, “As per estimation, approximately 1,500 metric tonne is lifted. But, there is no transparent system in place to find out how much garbage is lifted. Deputy commissioners were directed to verify the firm’s work. But, this was not done. To benefit the firm, exercise was also done to release the payments.” The firm representatives, however, refuted the allegation and claimed that since January, the JMC has not released any payment. BVG India director Omkar Sapre said, “The firm requires 7,000 litres of fuel per day and Rs 2.70 crore to reimburse its employees. In absence of payment, the company is facing financial crises. Moreover, in August 2020 the JMC slapped a fine of Rs 57 crore for no reason. It’s a tactic to unnecessarily harass the existing establishment.” The firm claimed, as per the tender document, the company had to collect 1,340 metric tonne from the city. The vehicles were deployed accordingly after chalking out the plan. At present the company is lifting more than 1,600 metric per tonne. Contradicting company’s claim, councillors claimed that the JMC is paying higher amount Rs 1,792 per tonne and still garbage is not lifted. A BJP councillor said, “The garbage is only lifted on papers. From one colony the garbage is lifted in two days. The company does not have resources and work is sublet against norms.” Sapre, however, said, “The company has deployed 800 vehicles. Also, in the contract there is nowhere mentioned subletting is prohibited.” To resolve the issue, a team of independent engineers (IE) was also constituted to assess the collection of garbage. But, it was also revealed the team of IE has made no assessment of garbage collection in past one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/trash-torment-murky-dealings-hit-garbage-collection-in-city/articleshow/83324364.cms||---

The decision comes after spurious liquor or hooch claimed the lives of at least 89 persons in Aligarh last week. CM Yogi Adityanath has said that illegal liquor outlets should be destroyed. On Monday, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi asked ADG (prosecution) to submit a list of matters linked with excise within three days, along with directions to take strict action against the culprits in cases of manufacture and sale of illicit liquor. Awasthi said that action against the culprits must be taken under Section 60 of the UP Excise Act and the Gangsters Act. The details of such persons against whom FIR is registered under the two Acts should be uploaded on the e-prosecution portal and provided separately to the government. Section 60 says that a person selling or making available an intoxicating substance or adding something to a substance to make it intoxicating which leads to the death of a person, will be punishable by death or life sentence. DMs to issue licence for sale of methyl alcoholIn cases where such substance cause disability, the culprit will be sentenced to six to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and can be fined Rs 5-10 lakh. Meanwhile, provisions have been made to issue licences and permits for the possession and sale of methyl alcohol, a key ingredient of spurious liquor, and district magistrates have been authorised as the licensing authority. ACS excise Sanjay Bhoosreddy said that methyl alcohol is a poison, declared under the Poison Act.

A three-member nodal committee will be set up at the district level for implementation of the rules,” Bhoosreddy said. He added that orders have been issued to keep vigil on the use of methyl alcohol and action will be taken if an unlicensed unit is caught producing methyl alcohol. Tanks and containers of methyl alcohol have to be clearly marked and a poison sign has to be inscribed compulsorily on both sides of the tanker. Strict action will be taken against a person found indulging in illegal trade of methyl alcohol. In case of death due to consumption of illicit liquor made from methyl alcohol or the seizure of illicit liquor in large quantities, accountability of the local excise and police officers will be fixed. “Gangster Act and NSA shall be invoked against those found involved in the activities of illicit liquor and action will be taken to confiscate their property,” Bhoosreddy said.

The peak hour traffic rush was a clear indicator of business as usual resuming in the city, as offices resumed operations at 100% staff, courts resumed in-person hearing, public transport services resumed at 50% capacity, while shops and commercial establishment continued operating from 9am to 6pm. “Starting with the public transport came as a big relief to staffers who used to travel longer distances to reach the workplace. We hope whenever next the government imposes restrictions or regulations, things are uniform,” said Varis Isani, a tax professional. As the lower courts resumed physical hearing, more litigants visited the court campuses, especially the metropolitan court at Gheekanta, on the first day. As the courtrooms were opened after two months, the criminal courts at Gheekanta witnessed a little rush because people came to inquire about the status of their cases with their lawyers. The courtrooms, however, did not allow the litigants unless it was absolutely necessary. Only one gate of court campuses was kept open and security guards were deployed with temperature guns at the gates. The guards at city civil court at Bhadra did not allow litigants inside the campus without a nod from their advocates. However, there was no rush of visitors witnessed in Bhadra court campus. Even traders breathed easy as offices could operate at 100% staff. “This will come as a big relief in not just attaining normalcy in business operations but will also go a long way to better demand in the days to come as consumer sentiment improves,” said Jayendra Tanna, president, Gujarat Traders’ Federation (GTF). Traders however opined that the frequency of both AMTS and BRTS buses must be increased during peak hours especially to help cater to the rush.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/citys-bustle-returns-public-transport-courts-schools-open/articleshow/83322411.cms||---

The district administration will organize a camp in the markets of the state capital on Wednesday to carry out 100% vaccination of shopkeepers and their staff. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of minister for medical education Vishwas Sarang, with the representatives of the traders' organisations both from the Old and New Bhopal, district administration and police officials on Monday. A slogan "Tike Lagwao, Dukan Khulwao" ("Get vaccinated, open your shop) has been coined for the arrangement, said police officials. Traders had been demanding permission to operate their shops. The meeting chaired by Sarang decided that the entire market would be opened in Bhopal from Thursday, for which the shopkeepers will be required to ensure 100% vaccination of traders themselves and their staff. Along with this, shops will be allowed to open only after ensuring compliance with Covid-19 guidelines. Sarang said that granting permission to open the market on Saturday also is under consideration. Traders will have to ensure that their customers follow Covid-19 guidelines. Announcements regarding social distancing, wearing masks, vaccination will be made in the market. Stating that Corona has not gone yet, Sarang further said that caution is a must. Markets will be opened while adhering to Covid-19 guidelines and on Wednesday, free vaccination camps will be organized by the government in all the markets of the New and Old city areas. Only then, will the shops be allowed to open. Market opening and closing time will be as per Corona protocol. He said that the Covid Security Team created to ensure adherence to guidelines will have to be supported by the traders, to ensure Bhopal wins over Corona pandemic. Collector Avinash Lavania, DIG Irshad Wali and representatives of traders' organisations of new and old city were present in the meeting.

Meanwhile, the VP Road police probing the case against the sailor have raised doubts over the intention of the complainant. Police said the 46-year-old complainant was in a live-in relationship with the accused and had even attended his wedding November last year. The Navy too has rubbished the allegation of “rape on the warship” saying the warship mentioned by the woman was decommissioned in November 2017. In her complaint, the woman has alleged that the sailor had raped her at various hotels in Mumbai, Delhi and Jaipur between 2016 to 2020. She has even alleged that when she got pregnant, the accused forced her to take abortion pills, thereby risking her life. Besides rape and cheating, police have booked the sailor for causing miscarriage without the woman’s consent, criminal breach of trust and criminal intimidation under relevant sections of the IPC. “It’s very unfortunate since whatever the accused has done was in his personal capacity. The relationship may have even been consensual, but the allegation will ruin his career. The allegation that the woman was raped on the warship is doubtful too. The police should have at least verified the facts before taking the complaint as the said warship was decommissioned in November 2017,’’ said a source. According to the FIR, the victim came in contact with the sailor in March 2016 over social media and finally met him when she went to see the warship anchored at Lion’s Gate in Colaba. The sailor took her around the warship and the two then became friends. The victim has alleged that the sailor even stayed with her when she was alone, and under the pretext of marriage raped her in Mumbai, Delhi and Jaipur. She alleged that on November 26 last year, he got married to another woman and when she confronted him, he said it was only due to family pressure. “The woman did not only attend his marriage but also danced during the ceremony. Why didn’t she complain then?,” asked one of the lawyers representing the sailor. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-naval-officer-booked-for-rape-cheating-seeks-pre-arrest-bail/articleshow/83324443.cms||Ahmed Ali

This forest range is under Ramgarh Vishdhari Wildlife Sanctuary, the proposed site for the fourth tiger reserve in the state.MLA Bharat Singh Kundanpur alleged that state forest minister Sukhram Bishnoi and mining minister Pramod Jain Bhaya have ‘personal commercial interests in the rampant illegal mining across the state’. “This man (state forest minister) does not move out anywhere. His son handles the shady deals in illegal mining across the state. The forest minister is hand in glove with mining minister Bhaya,” Kundanpur told TOI on Monday while reacting to the news story ‘Illegal mining at proposed tiger reserve site, Raj admn ignorant’, carried by TOI in its Sunday edition.The Sangod MLA said he wrote a letter on Monday to CM Ashok Gehlot urging him to remove the state forest minister. He had already written to CM in the past demanding removal of mining minister Pramod Jain Bhaya for involvement in illegal miningMany officials of mining, forest, police and revenue departments are involved in illegal mining under political cover, said Bundi district Congress vice-president, Charmesh Sharma.Wildlife activist Prathvi Singh Rajawat emphasised that illegal mining in Dabi needs to be banned immediately. “The government has a defective mining policy that is apt to promote illegal mining,” senior Congress leader and ex-minister Harimohan Sharma said.However, DFO, Bundi, Sonal Jourihar claimed that at least 19 FIRs have been lodged from January to June 5 this year with the seizure of 13 vehicles and penalty of Rs 25 lakh has been collected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/forest-mining-mins-linked-with-mafia-alleges-cong-mla/articleshow/83324392.cms||---

A total of 17 persons were rescued. BMC officials said heavy rainfall may have caused the structure to collapse. They said several families living on the banks of Vakola nullah and Mithi River will be temporarily moved to safer locations. The BMC said the ground-plus-four storey structure that collapsed was illegally constructed on land belonging to the railways. According to officials, the incident occurred around 1.45 am. “While locals had managed to rescue six people, the Fire Brigade rescued 11 others. The injured were sent to Bhabha and V N Desai Hospitals,” the official said. Officials said Riyaz Ahmad (28) was declared dead on arrival at hospital, while the injured victims were in a stable condition. A senior civic official said they would investigate the exact cause of the collapse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1-killed-5-injured-after-illegal-bldg-crashes-in-bandra/articleshow/83322782.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Ranchi||Fearing Covid spread among animals, Ranchi zoo asks ill cage-keepers to stay at home||RANCHI: The management of Ranchi’s Birsa Munda Biological Park has issued a directive to all its cage-keeping and zoo staff to abstain from coming to work if they are ill. The zoo has close to 50 cage-keepers and gardeners working on contractual basis. Four of them had recently tested positive for Covid. The directive, issued by park director Y K Das, came after a 10-year-old male tiger Shiva died days after developing fever and loss of appetite. The four-page directive has also asked the zoo staff to abstain from consuming tobacco products on the park’s premises. Sources in the park management said the directives were issued to prevent any Covid outbreak among the park’s animals. Notably, the swab and blood samples of the dead tiger and 21 other big cats, including nine tigers, four lions, seven leopards and a black panther, have been sent to Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly (UP), for RT-PCR tests. “All the animals will have to be medically examined at least once a month. The cage-keepers have been directed to inspect their gait, the shine in their coat, look out for parasites or infection and damages to their tooth, nails or paws during these check-ups,” Das said. Special emphasis will be given on their diet and sanitation as cage keepers have been directed to disinfect the enclosures every day, he added. The park management also came under scrutiny after a 10-year-old female sloth bear was attacked and killed by a 12-year-old male bear during mating on June 5 evening. Sources said no additional cage-keepers were deployed around the bear enclosure to prevent such an incident. Now, under pressure, the park management has asked its cage-keepers to take necessary steps to separate two warring animals with doctors’ consent. “If a cage-keeper is found guilty of dereliction in duty, he can be fired,” the directive has stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/fearing-cov-spread-among-animals-ranchi-zoo-asks-ill-cage-keepers-to-stay-at-home/articleshow/83320613.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Covid data negate government findings, show more cases in villages||RANCHI: The state government’s recent claims that the spread of Covid-19 in rural areas has been negligible during the ongoing second wave is contradictory when one goes through the daily bulletin, which indicates that the virus has wreaked havoc in the villages. The health department had carried out an Intensive Public Health Survey (IPHS) from May 25 to June 6 using RAT kits where it found that the rural areas were largely unaffected by the virus. However, the virus, which became more virulent and spread to more number of districts from April onwards — which is when the second wave struck Jharkhand — has affected nearly 12 districts this year, most of which have rural clusters. Districts like Ranchi, East Singhbhum, Dhanbad, Chaibasa, Garhwa, Giridih and Godda, which have mostly urban clusters, had lower share of net Covid cases this time, when compared to their last year’s figures. For example, Hazaribag reported 4,478 cases during the first wave, sharing 3.62% of the state’s entire caseload of 12,35,08. However, during the second wave it recorded 14,701 cases (between April 1 and June 6), which account for 6.76% of the entire caseload of 2,17,417. Similarly, Koderma, with 3,538 cases last year, had 2.86% of the total cases but now, its share has increased to 4.16%. The increase in share of total caseload during the second wave was observed in 10 more districts — Gumla (3.28%), Palamu (3.91%), Ramgarh (4.16%), Deoghar (3.14%), Jamtara (1.89%), Khunti (2.53%), Latehar (2.57%), Lohardaga (2.18%), Simdega (2.19%) and Chatra (1.36%). Ranchi, for example, accounted for 28.4% of the total cases last year but during the second wave, it reported a dip in cases as it accounted for 22.84% of the total cases. A similar dip was observed in Dhanbad whose share came down to 3.73% in the second wave from 6.42% last year. East Singhbhum had 15.4% of the total caseload but that has now come down to 14.45%. Explaining the difference between IPHS and the regular data, nodal officer Siddhartha Tripathy said, “No district should be considered as rural or urban when considering data. There may be difference at the level of blocks and panchayats and our survey was aimed at finding out if the situation is really grim in the villages.” Asked if it was correct in assuming that the virus has not spread in rural areas, Tripathy said the extent of transmission in rural areas is not as alarming as was being suspected before the extensive survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cov-data-negate-govt-findings-show-more-cases-in-villages/articleshow/83320567.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

---||Ranchi||New cases dip, but post-Covid complications on rise in Ranchi||RANCHI: Even as new Covid cases gradually dip, city hospitals are witnessing a rise in the hospitalizations of recovered patients with post-Covid complications. Leading hospitals in the city said they are now attending people with various ailments, mostly breathing difficulties, which have risen after they recovered from the viral infection. Talking to TOI, the medical director of Bhagwan Mahaveer Medica Superspeciality Hospital, Dr Vijay Mishra, said, “We are getting patients with severe post-Covid complications and they are complaining about breathing difficulty. We have also detected cases of aspergillosis — which is a kind of fungal infection in the lungs and around two dozen patients are admitted currently in the ICU of our hospital. The reason behind these complications is fibrosis in the lungs which worsens the respiratory function, leading to breathing difficulty.” On precautions needed after recovering from Covid, Dr Mishra said: “After discharge, patients should regularly monitor their oxygen saturation and blood sugar apart from looking out for symptoms of influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (ILI/SARI). It will help in the detection of any complication. People with covid history should immediately reach out to their doctor if they experience any abnormalities in these parameters.” Dr Nishit Kumar, the pulmonologist at Orchid Medical Centre, said he has seen an increase in fungal infection among recovered patients and many are admitted to his hospital. "Recovered patients are visiting us with different kinds of complications and fungal infection is one of them. Many have also complained about an acute spike in their blood sugar levels and bacterial infection." Chairman of Raj Hospitals Yogesh Gambhir, too, confirmed that they are reporting an increase in patients with lung infections and blood coagulation in arteries and veins. “We have around a dozen patients with such infections in our ICU. To assist patients discharged from our hospital, our doctors are regularly following up with them.” Nodal officer of the post-Covid clinic at the Ranchi district hospital, Dr Ajit Kumar, said: “Patients visiting our clinic are of two types- one who are psychologically shaken and the other who are developing minor as well as major complications. Three patients have been admitted to the district hospital, too, after they developed breathing difficulty and symptoms of infection in the salivary gland. The problem starts when people come with very high blood sugar and blood pressure levels. Such people are susceptible to heart attacks which might prove fatal.” Assistant professor of Rims cardiology department, Dr Prashant Kumar, said, “We have received a few cases of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients who had a history of Covid infection in the recent past. People who have been infected by the virus must go for regular testing of their heart and other pathological tests like D-Dimer and CRP so that they could be provided proper management for any cardiac ailments.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/new-cases-dip-but-post-cov-complications-on-rise-in-city/articleshow/83320645.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand finance minister Rameshwar Oraon demands compensation of cost incurred to procure vaccine||RANCHI: Welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement that free Covid-19 vaccines will be provided for the 18-44 age group, Jharkhand finance minister Rameshwar Oraon on Monday asked the Centre to reimburse the expenses incurred by all the states to procure vaccines for young adults so far. Both JMM and Congress, the two major ruling alliance partners in the state, maintained that the Modi government was forced to make a change in the vaccination policy due to opposition from several states and Supreme Court’s recent observations. Talking to TOI, Oraon said, “The Union government was forced to change its stand because of sustained protests and campaign by Congress and other parties to highlight the shoddy policy. We welcome the decision.” Oraon, also the Congress’s state president, added, “The Centre must now compensate the states the expenses they had incurred in procurement of vaccines for the 18-44 age group. Since Independence, entire vaccination cost has been borne by the Centre. In any kind of vaccination programme rolled out in the country, Centre used to procure and distributed vaccines to states free of cost. However, BJP government started a new trend to shrug off from its responsibility amid a pandemic. Finally, it seems to be correcting itself.” Notably, chief minister Hemant Soren recently wrote to Modi demanding universal coverage of vaccination, citing cost implications on poor states like Jharkhand. On Monday, Soren in a post on social media said about Rs 257 crore has been allocated for vaccinating the 18-44 years, of which about Rs 47 crore has been paid to the manufacturers of Covaxin and Covishield. Soren also reiterated that the state was committed for giving free vaccines. Following Modi’s announcement, Soren’s party — JMM -- hoped that the Centre will walk the talk without posing any hurdles to states. JMM spokesperson and general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharjee said, “We would have gladly welcomed this announcement had it come on April 19. But better late than never. Now that the Centre has exposed itself, it has decided to extend free vaccines. However, it is still not fully committed to give entirely free. It is because the PM said that 25% stocks will be given to private hospitals so that those who can pay can walk in to get the jabs. We hope that in coming months, the government-run vaccine centres do not suffer a crisis to fill coffers of private hospitals forcing people to opt for taking vaccine there.” Opposition BJP on the other hand hailed Modi. “Once again the PM has proved that his government is pro-people. Not only he announced free vaccine for the country, but also extended free ration scheme under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana till November,” BJP state president Deepak Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/oraon-demands-compensation-of-cost-incurred-to-procure-vax/articleshow/83320614.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: BJP MLA Biranchi Narayan protests against ‘power crisis’, gets trade body support||BOKARO: Bokaro BJP MLA Biranchi Narayan sat on a dharna on Monday in protest against prolonged power cuts faced by residents here. In the rural belt, people are getting power only for two hours, and in urban areas for just four hours, claimed Narayan while staging the dharna near the district collectorate building. Several residents also complained to TOI that it was becoming difficult for them to stay indoors during the lockdown owing to the power cuts. The Bokaro Chamber of Commerce and Industries has also extended its support to the protest. “Three power sub-stations are complete in Fudnidih, Chaura-Narayanpur and Pindrajoda areas falling under Bokaro assembly constituency. Although the power stations were made during the BJP rule, I request chief minister Hemant Soren to take the entire credit for their construction and start operations at these facilities. People must get electricity. The truth is that the alliance government in the state is not paying attention to development projects of those assembly constituencies where BJP has won. In Bokaro and Chandankyari, both MP and MLA are from BJP.” Narayan pointed that the previous BJP government constructed 70 power grids and 150 power sub-stations across the state during its rule. “I am worried that if these sub-stations do not start operations on time, the condition of the equipment will suffer. In the past one and a half years, there was not a single assembly session in which I did not raise the demand of starting the three power sub-stations, but in vain,” said Narayan. Chas sub-divisional officer (SDO) Shashi Prakash Singh, who reached the dharna spot and met the MLA, assured to solve the power crisis. The SDO said, “There is a requirement of 60 megawatt in peak season in Chas area, but only 40 megawatt is supplied by the DVC. Apart from this, there are frequent power trips due to overloading. The problem will be solved after the power sub-stations start functioning in the next few days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/biranchi-protests-against-power-crisis-gets-trade-body-support/articleshow/83322885.cms||Divy Khare

The court also directed the JPSC to publish a fresh merit list within eight weeks and ordered the government to allocate cadres to the appointees within four weeks thereafter. The court of Justice S K Diwedi heard as many as 16 petitions which were clubbed together challenging the merit list published by the JPSC. The petitions challenged the examinations on points of irregularities in the merit list, irregularity committed by the Commission in following the reservation norms and age-related discrepancies. While the high court rejected the other petitions, it found substance in the petition filed by Dilip Kumar Singh, Pradeep Ram, Sumit Kumar Mahto, Mukesh Kumar, Ravikant Prasad and Ruby Sinha who challenged the merit list prepared by the Commission. The court had earlier this year heard the matter at length on February 17 and reserved its order in the matter which was delivered online on Monday. After hearing the arguments, the high court in its order has mentioned that the JPSC flouted the rules to be followed while computing marks to prepare the merit list of the successful candidates. The merit list is important and crucial as it decides the allotment of cadre among the successful candidates. However, the merit list had a serious anomaly as the JPSC while preparing the same had also computed the qualifying marks achieved by the candidates. This is contrary to the rules for preparing the merit list which has already been formulated by the Commission. The qualifying marks of candidates ought not to be included while adding their marks for preparation of the merit list, the court observed in its order. The JPSC had conducted the sixth state civil services main examinations on February 28, 2019. The examinations were challenged by candidates before the high court on different counts and the high court in its order passed on October 21, 2019 ordered the JPSC to publish the results. Thereafter, the JPSC published the result and declared 326 candidates successful in the exams. The Commission then prepared the merit list and sent its recommendation to the government on April 23, 2020 for allotment of cadre. The government then appointed the successful candidates on July 29, 2020 and sent them for training.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-scraps-merit-list-for-6th-civil-services-exam/articleshow/83320778.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Tribal Advisory Council rules changed after governor rejected state government’s nominees: JMM||RANCHI: Ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Monday endorsed the state government’s decision to rewrite the rules of appointment for members of the Tribal Advisory Council (TAC) stating that the change was necessary because of Governor Droupadi Murmu’s alleged unhappiness with the incumbent chief minister Hemant Soren's government. On June 4, the state cabinet had approved a new set of rules for the appointment of the TAC members. The rules, notified by the government on Monday, vests powers with the incumbent chief minister for making appointments to the 18 member council. The TAC will consist of 15 MLAs from ST assembly seats and three members who are experts on tribal affairs. Earlier, the governor had the powers to appoint the TAC members based on the government’s recommendation. TAC is headed by the incumbent CM as per provisions of Schedule 5 of the Constitution. “In the past 18 months, the honourable governor madam rejected the list of TAC members recommended by the government twice. Hence, reframing the rules was necessary,” JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya claimed. The JMM’s response came a day after a BJP delegation met Murmu at the Raj Bhavan and submitted a memorandum challenging the new rules. “Being the custodian of the Constitution, the governor did not intervene when the TAC functioned with a non-tribal chairman (former CM Raghubar Das), which is against the mandate of the Constitution,” Bhattacharya said. JMM also criticized the governor for appointing the senate and syndicate members of various state universities and for giving vice-chancellors and principals of many colleges extensions in their tenure. “The state government was consulted and BJP functionaries were offered posts. This is not right,” Bhattacharya said. Apprehending that Murmu's current stance might lead to a rift between the government and the office of the governor, Bhattacharya said JMM is determined to make some necessary changes to avoid a rerun of the ongoing feud in West Bengal, where governor Jagdeep Dhankhar is publicly criticising the Mamata Banerjee government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/tac-rules-changed-after-guv-rejected-govts-nominees-jmm/articleshow/83320492.cms||---
---||India||BJP plans for UP, PM Modi says take lessons from Bengal||NEW DELHI: Prompted by the lurking threat of a “third wave”, the BJP brass including PM Narendra Modi have brainstormed for several hours on an extensive virtual campaign for the forthcoming assembly polls in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, next year. After having deliberated for over two days among themselves over what is expected to be the “new normal” in electoral politics, BJP chief J P Nadda and national general secretaries had a five-hour discussion with the PM on Sunday on how to reach out to the electorate amid pandemic curbs. The PM, on his part, is learnt to have given suggestions emphasising on taking lessons from past mistakes, a reference to the organisation agonising over why the saffron challenge to Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal could not succeed and why it failed to convert what it considers the growth in Hindutva’s appeal in Kerala into electoral gains. “Take lessons from the failures while making future strategies,” the PM is learnt to have told party office-bearers. Sources said the party has decided to focus on improving its digital reach across the country for which party cadres in poll-bound states will be trained. It was learnt that the party is working on a plan to live stream virtual rallies of senior leaders in all assembly constituencies where polling will take place next year. Different morchas have also been asked to make plans about how to reach out to the electorate in the poll-bound states. Office-bearers in UP have been asked to hold meetings at the regional level to boost poll preparations. “The poll in-charges at assembly level have been tasked to review the performance of sitting MLAs, and feedback will play a crucial role in finalising candidates,” a BJP functionary said. Party office-bearers called on Modi after Nadda and general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh held a meeting with eight general secretaries and the presidents of its yuva, kisan, mahila, OBC, SC, ST and minority morchas. The members also deliberated on post-poll violence in Bengal, BJP general secretaries said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-plans-for-up-pm-modi-says-take-lessons-from-bengal/articleshow/83326794.cms||---

Twelve states/union territories are ahead of Andhra Pradesh. In the 2018–19 index, Andhra Pradesh was limited to level six. Performance Grading Index (PGI) is intended to help states and UTs in identifying gaps in education policy. States can accordingly prioritise areas of intervention to ensure that the school education system is robust at every level. PGI is structured in two categories: outcomes, and governance & management. The index comprises 70 indicators with total weightage of 1000. No state/UT could find a place in level I (951-1000 score) in the 2019-20 PGI Index. In the 2018-19 index, no state/UT even could even make it to level II. But for the first time, five states/UTs, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Kerala, Punjab and Tamil Nadu, have found a place in level II (901-950) in the 2019-20 Index. Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra, NCT of Delhi, Puducherry and Rajasthan have crossed the threshold score of 851 to reach Level III in the index. The Union government introduced PGI with a set of 70 parameters to catalyse transformational change in the field of school education. PGI for states and union territories was first published in 2019 with reference year 2017-18. The PGI for 2019-20 is the third publication in this series. The PGI exercise envisages that the index would propel states and UTs toward undertaking multi-pronged interventions that will bring about the optimal educational outcomes. According to Andhra Pradesh officials, steps are being taken up to ensure 100% access to education. Some of the strategies being implemented for universalisation of elementary education are: strengthening existing schools, providing financial assistance to students under various schemes and creating educational facilities in small and unserved habitations. Enrolment in all types of schools during 2020-21 in Andhra Pradesh is 72.78 lakh, of which 37.28 lakh (51.22%) are in classes I–V, 21.79 lakh (29.94%) in classes VI-VIII and 13.71 lakh (18.84%) in classes IX-X. In 2020-21, the annual average dropout rates are: 0% (no dropouts) in classes I-V (primary level) and V-VIII (elementary level). There is a 4.38% dropout rate at the secondary level (IX-X).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-rises-to-level-four-in-school-education-on-pgi/articleshow/83318371.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh surpasses nation in child sex ratio at birth||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh has surpassed the national average in terms of sex ratio at birth, according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) India Index 2020-21 released by the Niti Aayog. While the national average stood at 899 females for every 1,000 males at birth, it is 920 in Andhra Pradesh. Chhattisgarh topped this category with a male-to-female ratio of 958, followed by Kerala with a ratio of 957. Recognising and valuing unpaid care and domestic work is a key component of the SDG 5. It calls for full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life for women. The overall SDG index scores for Goal 5 ranged between 25 and 64 for states, and between 33 and 68 for UTs. Chhattisgarh (64) and Andaman and Nicobar Islands (68) are the top performers among the states and the Union Territories, respectively. However, no state has bagged a position in the category of front runners (score range between 65 and 99, including both). Two UTs, Andaman and Nicobar Islands (68) and Puducherry (66, made it to the ‘front runners’ category. Fourteen states and three UTs fell behind in the Aspirants category (with Index scores less than 50). But Andhra Pradesh has managed to score 58, standing in the fifth position among all the states. As per the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 2018-19, the overall labour force participation rates were 57.8% for Andhra Pradesh, whereas the national average is about 37.5%. It is 48.3% for Andhra Pradesh in rural areas and 39.4% in urban areas. The PLFS survey revealed clear-cut gender differences in work participation rates (WPR). The WPR among youth (15-29 years) is the lowest one - both in Andhra Pradesh and at all-India level. This was more profound in the case of urban females (15.2% as compared to 28.8% in rural areas). The relatively higher work participation rates of females in rural areas could be due to the livelihood and employment generating works like MGNREGS. One solace in this regard for Andhra Pradesh is that the WPR for females in all age groups is nearly double that of the country in rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-surpasses-nation-in-child-sex-ratio-at-birth/articleshow/83318442.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Two each were killed in West Midnapore, East Midnapore and Bankura and one in Nadia. Three of the deceased were women. The lightning strikes were triggered by a combination of factors: a ‘surface trough’ between east Uttar Pradesh and northeast Bay of Bengal and a squall line stretching across Burdwan, Nadia, Murshidabad and Midnpaore led to storms across south Bengal and clouds floating in from Bangladesh further strengthened the system. The state government announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the kin of each of the deceased. PM Modi announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to each of the bereaved families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/27-killed-by-lightning-in-south-bengal/articleshow/83326846.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Sangam dairy case: ED to probe money laundering charges||Amaravati: The state Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has shared vital documents with Enforcement Directorate to probe alleged money laundering charges at Sangam Dairy. According to ACB sources, ED is likely to register an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) against Sangam Dairy chairman Dhulipalla Narendra Kumar and other directors. ED is also looking into the illegal transfer of government land to private entities owned by Narendra Kumar’s family. The Sangam Dairy management was found making illegal transfer of money to transport operators and kin of directors through unofficial accounts. ACB has tracked down some of the transactions and is taking ED’s assistance to zero-in on the beneficiaries of money transfers. ACB had seized several documents from Sangam Dairy offices during the raids held last month. The ACB also gathered critical information about cash transactions from the dairy accounts to suspected unauthorized individual accounts from computers operated by marketing and accounts sections in the dairy. The dairy management is facing charges about securing Rs 105 crore loan from National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) by producing forged documents. ACB has also gathered documents regarding illegal transfer of about Rs 115 crore worth land from the dairy to a private trust owned by Dhulipalla Narendra Kumar family. The dairy has allegedly been pumping funds to the private trust from the profits earned with the money of milk producers. As per the rules, the dairy should secure all the required clearances from the government before converting the cooperative milk producers’ dairy into Company Act. It should also clear dues to the government and return government land if any in the control of the cooperative unit to switch to the company limited. Without following the due procedure, Dhulipalla Narendra-led board of Sangam dairy converted the dairy into the Company Act. ACB has taken the issue of the dairy’s decision to pay huge bonus to private milk companies which sold the stock to the dairy on par with growers to the notice of ED. According to sources, the dairy has paid Rs 70 crore to private dairies and routed the money to unauthorised accounts. The dairy’s huge payments to transport firms owned by people close to the board director is also under ED’s scrutiny.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/sangam-dairy-case-ed-to-probe-money-laundering-charges/articleshow/83318484.cms||Samdani MN
---||Chandigarh||In Punjab, shops can open till 6pm, curbs on till June 15||CHANDIGARH: With the second Covid-19 wave abating, Punjab government has ordered graded relaxations from June 8, including opening of shops till 6pm and allowing private offices to function at 50% strength, but further extended the curbs till June 15 With case positivity declining to 3.2% and active cases also coming down, the chief minister allowed gatherings of up to 20 people, including weddings and cremations. Entry restrictions of negative Covid test/vaccination for entering the state have also been done away with. Recruitment exams will be allowed to be held subject to adherence to social distancing and other Covid appropriate norms, though the CM said online mode should be preferred. Sports training for national and international events has also been permitted and the department of sports has been asked to issue the necessary instructions and guidelines, which shall have to be strictly adhered to. Night curfew will remain in force from 7 pm to 6 am on weekdays, including Saturdays and the regular weekend curfew will continue on Sundays, the CM announced. The CM said district administration may determine the opening of non-essential shops, including on the weekend, on the basis of the local situation. In the case of government offices, he said that attendance can be decided by the head of the concerned office but co-morbid/disabled employees at risk may be exempted. Further relaxations will be allowed in the coming weeks, if the cases continue to decline, said Captain Amarinder, adding that gymnasiums and restaurants could be opened after a week at 50% capacity, and other conditions as per experts' advice, if the situation improves further. Owners and workers of gyms and restaurants should get themselves vaccinated prior to reopening, he added. For better management of cases, the CM asked the departments to reduce testing time. Post-Covid complications should be studied carefully for better preparation to handle those, he said, citing the example of Milkha Singh, who was discharged after Covid recovery but had to be again hospitalised. He said he had been informed that 20% of patients in hospitals in Patiala are those of recovered patients being readmitted. Punjab’s Covid expert group head Dr KK Talwar informed the meeting that almost 30% Covid patients are having post-Covid complications and continue to be symptomatic. Patients are taking almost three months to get back to normal, and thus need to be strictly monitored, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-punjab-shops-can-open-till-6pm-curbs-on-till-june-15/articleshow/83326850.cms||---
---||Goa||Minister Michael Lobo for ban on nightlife in Goa until pandemic eases||PANAJI: Minister for science and technology Michael Lobo on Monday said nightlife in Goa should continue to remain out of bounds until the Covid-19 situation improves. He also said that if the state decides to reopen the tourism sector, it would have to be with strict adherence to norms as tourists would begin arriving in droves akin to what was witnessed six months ago. Lobo’s statements come a few months after he had said that enforcing health protocols for tourists would deter them from visiting the sunshine state. “If you make SOPs stricter and you harass tourists, which tourist will come to Goa? We have to take precautionary measures, but at the same time, you cannot stop business because Covid-19 cases are increasing,” he had said in March. The popular Baga-Calangute party hub — which Lobo represents as MLA — subsequently emerged as the biggest hotspot of Covid-19 infections in the state, according to a study conducted by the Goa Medical College in April. The minister, who had earlier dismissed the need for Covid-negative certificates for people entering the state, on Monday made a case for the exercise. “Covid-negative certificates are essential for people checking into hotels. In fact, once tourists arrive at a hotel, they should be tested for the virus all over the again. Protocol must be followed if the government decides to open up the hotel industry after June 15,” he said. “We used to say that the economic condition would be bad (if economic activities were stopped). Exactly that has happened today, but life is more important,” Lobo said, even as he called for relaxation of the curfew in the phased manner from June 14 and predicted that it would take one year for the economy to get back on track once it reopened. “We have to see what happens till June 14. The chief minister and committee will then decide in the interest of the state...once we see Covid-19 clearing in India, economic activities will start in the state and not before that,” he said. Lobo also suggested that vaccination against Covid-19 should be made mandatory in India even as he rued that when he tries to convince people to take the jab, they say that it is entirely their choice if they choose not to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-for-ban-on-nightlife-in-goa-until-pandemic-eases/articleshow/83322894.cms||---

The Centre must have provided some alternate medicine.” In early May, health minister Vishwajit Rane announced that the state would give all those above 18 years of age Ivermectin tablets as a prophylactic to combat the severity of Covid-19. He said the decision was based on studies conducted in the US and UK. The next day, the World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that the medication can only be prescribed for clinical trials. “Safety and efficacy are important when using any drug for a new indication. @WHO recommends against the use of ivermectin for Covid-19 except within clinical trials,” said WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan. The contentious issue also recently came up before the high court of Bombay at Goa. “As regards the use of Ivermectin, the issue raised by the petitioner concerns mainly its prophylactic use,” the court observed. “As for its therapeutic use, it is nobody’s case that the medicine has not been included by ICMR for Covid-19 treatment protocol. Though the expert committee of the state, in its decision dated 13/05/2021, has recommended even prophylactic use of Ivermectin, from the affidavit filed by the state (through) the additional secretary (health), what emerges is that the state has, for the present, decided that Ivermectin would be given to all suspected and symptomatic patients, and provided in the kit to be supplied to positive patients in home isolation.” “It does not appear that as of now, the state has been promoting the prophylactic use of these medicines,” the court further observed. “In case, however, the state does so in future, it will be open for the petitioners to raise appropriate objections and the matter in that case will be dealt with by this court.

---||Goa||School, college staffers confused over Goa government orders||PANAJI: The doors of schools and colleges finally opened on Monday as restrictions in the state eased following a drop in infections. However, confusion prevailed on Sunday and Monday among school and college staffers as the North and South Goa collectors issued orders on Sunday extending the curfew to June 14 while also stating that schools and colleges will remain shut. School and college teachers and other staffers saw this as being in contradiction of the orders issued on June 4 by the state directorates of education and higher education. The two directorates stated that teaching as well as non-teaching staff should join duty from June 7, but classes for students should continue in the online mode only. “The following activities/establishment/facilities/events shall remain closed: Schools, colleges, educational and coaching institutions, except for examinations of college students,” said the collectors’ orders. This led to officials of the directorate of higher education sending out a message to college principals clarifying that colleges have to open for teachers and other staffers from June 7. “As there were a number of queries about whether staff, both teaching and non-teaching, would resume their duties (as per the government circular) in view of the curfew continued by government till June 14, the directorate of higher education has clarified that the curfew does not apply to staff of schools and colleges. Circular of the government with respect to reopening of colleges stands and is to be implemented,” the message from the directorate read. An official from the collectorate said that “it is understood that the schools and colleges are shut for students only” and staffers can be directed to join work by the parent department. Teachers, however, were seen criticising the contradiction in orders in online forums, asking whether the collectors had issued the same orders as earlier without the necessary modifications. Others questioned how the two directorates of education and higher education had issued the orders asking teachers to resume work before the extension in lockdown could be announced by the chief minister. “When curfew is extended and the notification is issued by the state government clearly states schools and colleges will remain closed, so under which law teachers should join their duties?” a teacher said. Officials, however, said that just as other government employees across the state had resumed full-fledged duties, school and college staffers are also eligible to be summoned to join work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/school-college-staffers-confused-over-govt-orders/articleshow/83322927.cms||---
---||India||Captain Amarinder Singh thanks PM Modi even as Congress attacks him||NEW DELHI: Congress on Monday contended that the Modi government’s decision to provide free vaccines to all above 18 years of age was taken after the Supreme Court pulled it up and questioned its vaccine policy. Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters, “Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, party leader Rahul Gandhi and several others have written to the government to provide free vaccines to every citizen of the country, but the government did not pay heed to their demands.” “The government was put in the dock by the Supreme Court and several other courts of the country. And today the government accepted Congress’s demand, at least partially,” Surjewala added. While Congress attacked the government, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh struck a different note, tweeting, “I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji for acceding to our request for central procurement and distribution of vaccine for all age groups. I had written twice to the PM on this issue and to health minister Harsh Vardhan ji.” He added, “…both the state and central government will work as per new guidelines in the coming two weeks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/captain-amarinder-singh-thanks-pm-modi-even-as-congress-attacks-him/articleshow/83326855.cms||---

GFP vice president Durgadas Kamat has demanded that the chief minister must immediately clarify why teachers are being called back to schools and colleges if online classes are to continue. “On one hand the education department says that the Covid situation has improved and the district collector says that there is a surge in cases. It clearly looks like every department is doing what they want. This is a clear cut example that the chief minister has no control,” Kamat said. The orders issued by the director of education on June 4 instructed teaching and non-teaching staff of all aided and non-aided institutions to report to work while the notifications issued by the two district collectors clearly state that schools, colleges, educational and coaching institutions shall remain closed. “There must be common consensus in the government. There is no clarity who runs this government. It looks like each minister has started behaving like the chief minister of their department,” Kamat added. GFP said that with the Disaster Management Act invoked, the district collector has the final say in district management. Kamat has blamed the BJP government for creating confusion and harassing teachers through “cut copy paste governance” as seen in the conflicting orders issued by the departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-ministers-behaving-like-they-are-cms-of-their-depts/articleshow/83322946.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The case positivity rate was at 15 %, while the recovery rate increased to 94%. Goa now has 6,000-plus active cases. On Monday, thirteen patients died at the Goa Medical College (GMC) and three at the South Goa District Hospital (SGDH). Of these, five were below the age of 50, with the youngest being a 35-year-old man from Maharashtra’s Sindhudurga district, who died after 15 days of treatment at GMC. He had no comorbidities. Several Covid patients from neighbouring districts of Maharashtra as well as Karnataka come to GMC for treatment for want of similar facilities in their towns. A man in his late thirties from Vasco, whose immediate cause of death was given as acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, having multiple comorbidities, died at the SGDH after 10 days of treatment. A 45-year-old woman from Cudnem, who did not have any comorbidity, died within a few hours of admission to GMC. She had tested positive a day earlier. A 62-year-old man from Verem, who was rushed to GMC in critical condition, died within a few hours. Though he had undergone the Covid test mid-last month, the mortality bulletin said that he had complained of ill-health for a month. The day saw 69 patients hospitalised and 14 discharged. The active tally of four centres in North Goa — Aldona, Bicholim, Mayem, and Cansarvanem — on Monday dropped below the 100 mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/positivity-at-15-state-sees-418-fresh-cases-13-deaths/articleshow/83322971.cms||---

UT administrator V P Singh Badnore will take a decision during a review meeting on Tuesday. Sources said the administration was likely to extend the shop-opening timings from the existing 9am to 4pm to 9am to 6pm. Restaurants, bars and clubs might receive the nod to open with 50% capacity. The issue of opening of malls and gyms will be discussed. Chandigarh Beopar Mandal (CBM) has already sought restoring the old shopping timings of 10am to 8pm in markets. The administration has extended the Covid curfew till June 9. Last week, it had allowed opening of salons and barber shops for haircutting only. A senior UT official said the administration will allow relaxations on the basis of the dip in Covid cases. The positivity rate has decreased from 5% to 3% in the last one week. The highest positivity rate was on May at 27.8%. This dropped to 19.3% on May 14 and to 14.1% on May 19. On June 1, the rate was 4.8%. The daily rate has been reducing due to less number of infections in last two weeks. Also, since the end of May, the testing, which was more than 4,000 a day, had reduced by 50%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-may-get-to-eat-out-shop-more/articleshow/83326876.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The low case count, however, came out of a drastically reduced number of tests. On Sunday, some 15.9 lakh Covid tests were conducted, less than half the number done on the previous day (35.7 lakh), according to the covid19india.org website that tracks these numbers. As a result of lower testing, the positivity rate on Monday shot up to 5.4%, up from 2.8% recorded on Sunday. India recorded 86,161 fresh cases on Monday, the lowest count since April 1, as per TOI’s Covid database. The last time the country’s daily case tally was below 1 lakh was on April 5. At the peak of the second wave, India had reported 4,14,554 fresh cases in a day (May 6). Similarly, the day’s death toll from the virus was recorded at 1,867, not counting 186 old deaths added to Maharashtra’s tally. This was the fewest single-day fatalities in India since April 19, when 1,693 deaths were recorded. Since then, the daily toll has remained above 2,000. While the case tally may increase slightly in the coming days as testing hopefully improves on weekdays, the overall declining trend continues so far. Tamil Nadu again led the country in recording the highest number of cases and deaths on Monday. However, for the first time since May 1, the state reported less than 20,000 daily cases with Monday’s count at 19,448. On Monday, Tamil Nadu was among just three states which recorded more than 10,000 cases. The other were Karnataka (11,958) and Maharashtra (10,219).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-68-days-daily-covid-cases-fall-below-1-lakh-toll-under-2000/articleshow/83326882.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

About 20% of the hospital’s beds have been occupied by patients having post-covid respiratory complications, head of pulmonary medicine, GMC, Dr Durga Lawande said. The hospital has 80-beds. It also caters to non-Covid diseases such as tuberculosis, multi-drug resistant TB, Chronic Obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and many other types of respiratory illnesses. “Obviously, there has been a rise in patients needing treatment after their ecovery and we treat them so that they don’t develop post-Covid lung complications or fibrosis. Many of the beds are getting filled with such patients,” Lawande said. Patients who had severe Covid-19 pneumonia and were on ventilators will mostly require further hospitalisation to cut their risk of going into post-Covid respiratory complications, she said. If not treated in time such patients face a huge risk of developing lung fibrosis, which is a permanent disability and leaves patients incapable of carrying out their normal routine. But most patients respond well to the treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/20-of-tb-hosp-beds-occupied-by-post-covid-cases/articleshow/83323098.cms||Bindiya Chari

While a few said they had not received any communication from the local administration and were unclear if, and till when, they could open their premises, those who lifted shutters after nearly 40 days hardly drew any customers. Owners of eateries said they got a few diners owing to today being a Monday. “If such a number comes, it will not help in running the business,” said members of an association. A restaurant owner in Sector 5 suggested extending the timing as people tend to come for dinner and drinks after finishing work at their offices or business around 9pm. The Haryana government on Sunday announced hotels, restaurants and bars could open from 10am to 8pm. “Giving salaries to staff will become a problem if the timings are not be changed,” said association members. Almost all bar/restaurants/hotels were found following the norms by using sanitisers and thermal scanning at the entry. Social distancing was maintained and tables had been put up at a distance. Buffet service was not started. However, many remained shut too. Owners of restaurants in Sector 9 said they had not got any orders and they were open for home delivery only. “Once the directions come, we will start the dine-in facility,” they said. Deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh held a meeting at the mini-secretariat Sector 1, and directed officials to ensure the orders were followed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/panchkula-eateries-reopen-doors-few-enter/articleshow/83326885.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

This defeated the objective of reducing congestion and maintaining social distancing. Major markets like Central Market in Lajpat Nagar, South Extension, Khan Market and Greater Kailash-I M Block market faced this problem. Wholesale markets like Sadar Bazar are opposed to the plan because customers won't want to turn up on multiple days. As a result, many shops next to each other were found to have opened at many places but footfall was quite low. Sarojini Nagar market, however, saw about 30% of its usual customers turning up, mostly women who had been postponing essential purchases. Many shop owners preferred to carry out maintenance work and review their stock position on Monday while some were waiting for their workers who have left the city to return. Many shops at M Block market in GK-II, however, had the "To-Let" sign displayed outside. The owners seemed to have thrown in the towel. Meanwhile, a month after it was shut down and 48 days after its doors were closed for passengers not engaged in essential services, Delhi Metro resumed operations from Monday with restrictions in place. The day also witnessed the maximum number of buses of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and the cluster scheme hitting the roads. Delhi Metro, which was allowed to operate with 50% seating capacity and no standing passengers, witnessed around 4.5 lakh "passenger journeys" till around 8.30 pm on Monday. Before the lockdown was imposed in Delhi on April 19, Metro had witnessed 20 lakh passenger journeys on an average every day.

Officials had issued notice to Narendra on Sunday seeking him to attend the interrogation with the investigating officer. Narendra along with his advocate Gottipatti Ramakrishna Prasad reached the premises around 9 am. However, Ramakrishna was not allowed to attend the interrogation session with Narendra. On his request, the ACB did record the entire interrogation session on video for two hours. Addressing the media after the interrogation, Prasad informed that there are post-COVID weaknesses to Sangam Dairy chairman Narendra and had requested ACB to ensure the meeting takes place sooner. Sources said that ACB have presented the evidence gathered on various irregularities including forgery, illegal transfer of lands belonging to Sangam Dairy worth over Rs 700 crore in the open market, etc. They then recorded the statement related to the same. ACB officials have sought Narendra’s presence on Tuesday as well. The anti-graft officials primarily allege that the accused is involved in committing the crime in 2013 after converting the dairy, which was under Cooperative Society sector, into a firm under the Companies Act by forging signatures of government officials. While ACB sought to interrogate Narendra at Rajahmundry Jail, the entire session was postponed after he tested positive for Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/acb-resumes-quizzing-dhulipala-narendra/articleshow/83319035.cms||---

The deceased were identified as Hemant (6), Machavaram Charan Teja (8), Jahnavi (12) and Sheikh Khalil (45). According to Ozili police, three children ventured into the pond on Monday evening for a swim. Due to a pit in the bond, the three got dragged in deep. Upon finding the children struggling, Sheikh Khalil jumped into the bond to save them. However, all four drowned in the pond. Upon receiving information, police rushed to the spot and fished out the bodies. Cops said that none of the children knew how to swim and that the pond was deep owing to the recent spate of rains in the region. All the bodies were sent to a local government for post mortem. A case has been registered under section 174 of CrPC (death due to drowning) at Ozili police station. Investigation is underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/four-including-three-kids-drown-in-pond/articleshow/83319085.cms||---

The accused was identified as Y Srividya. According to the police, they received a complaint from cell phone shop owner Siva Krishna. In his complaint, Siva Krishna said that he became acquainted with Srividya when she had come to his shop to get her phone repaired years ago. One day, she took his phone number and the two started talking to each other every day. In course of such conversations, Srividya told Siva Krishna that she had Rs 1.5 crore worth property stuck in a mortgage and she needed Rs 80 lakh to get the land released. Siva put together the money in instalments and gave it to Srividya who promised to return it upon selling her land. But Srividya did not keep her end of the promise. When Siva Krishna asked for her money back, he was allegedly threatened by Srividya and her brother. Siva Krishna also found out that Srividya had no land to begin with, let alone it being pledged for a loan. Siva Krishna claimed that Srividya had committed similar offences in the past with the same modus operandi. Police said that they have registered a case under sections 420 (cheating) and 405 (criminal breach of trust) of the IPC and are working on tracing Srividya’s whereabouts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/woman-cheats-mobile-shop-owner-of-rs-80-lakh/articleshow/83319138.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Rayalaseema farmers start postcard campaign to save Regional Agriculture Research Station||VIJAYAWADA: The farmers of the four Rayalaseema districts have launched a postcard campaign addressing chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy to save the 115-year old Regional Agriculture Research Station (RARS) at Nandyal. The state government had decided to relocate the RARS from Nandyal and construct new medical college on the premises. Established in 1906, the research station, which is affiliated to the Acharya N G Ranga Agriculture University has been serving the people in identification, development and popularisation of suitable crops and cropping systems, varieties and technologies pertaining to cotton, rice, jowar, small millets, chickpea, sunflower and tobacco in the region, particularly in Kurnool district. The local leaders, particularly the Rayalaseema Saguneeti Sadhana Samithi, headed by Bojjala Dasaratha Rami Reddy, has launched the agitation against the government’s move. They have asked the state government to stop the plan to shift the RARS and go for fresh land acquisition or outright purchase of land for the medical college. “It would take at least 10 months to one year to construct the RARS and resume research activity. It would also require at least Rs 500 crore for the government to construct and establish RARS in the new place,” said Dasaratha Rami Reddy, who is heading the movement to save the research station. He said that the RARS was established in the pre-independence period to promote agriculture activity in the region. It was later delegated to the agriculture university in 1963. Research on rice, cotton, jowar, Bengal gram, sunflower, tobacco and millets was carried out over the years with the Indian Council of Agriculture and Research. The ‘Nandyal Sona’ rice variety was developed here besides ‘Narasimha’ and ‘HYPS 152’ varieties of cotton, he said. While welcoming the establishing of a medical college in Nandyal, Dasaratha Rami Reddy requested the chief minister to continue the RARS at its present location and find new place for the medical college, in the larger interest of the farming community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rseema-farmers-start-postcard-campaign-to-save-rars/articleshow/83319168.cms||Gopi Dara
---||India||Covid left 3.6k kids orphaned, 26k lost one parent: NCPCR||NEW DELHI: As data from different states are being collated to track children who were orphaned or lost one of the parents after Covid-19 hit the country last year, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that there are over 30,000 children who need care and protection in the aftermath of the pandemic. Filing an affidavit in the apex court, the Commission said Covid had left 3,632 children orphaned while 26,176 lost one parent between April 1 last year and June 5 this year. The NCPCR also clarified that it compiled the data as per the information uploaded by state governments on its portal and it also contains those cases where parents may have died due to non-Covid diseases. It said the figure is likely to increase as many states have not collected all information on such children, particularly in rural areas, and some of the states like Delhi and West Bengal have so far not initiated the exercise. The affidavit, filed by advocate Swarupama Chaturvedi, said around 274 children were abandoned in the last one year and majority of the affected children (around 20,000 out of 30,000) belonged to the 0-13 age group. As Additional Solicitor General K M Nataraj brought to the court's notice that Delhi and West Bengal failed to comply with its order to provide information, a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose pulled them up for not complying with its order. It directed them to immediately take steps to collate information and upload all information on NCPCR’s newly created Bal Swaraj portal. Responding to the court’s query on how it intends to provide support and financial assistance to children who lost their parents to Covid as announced by the government, Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati told the bench that consultation were on with all stakeholders, including state governments, to work out modalities and sought more time to chalk out the plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-left-3-6k-kids-orphaned-26k-lost-one-parent-ncpcr/articleshow/83326937.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Noida||Noida toll in 15 months a sixth of Covid cremations since March||NOIDA: From March 15 to June 5 this year, the period overlapping with the second Covid wave that pummelled Delhi-NCR in April and May, crematoriums in Gautam Budh Nagar saw a total of 4,910 funerals. Covid protocols were followed in 3,155 of these cremations. The official Covid toll in the NCR district, in the 15 months since the first case was reported in 2020, is 459. Data on funerals was sourced from records maintained by crematoriums in the district. This includes Antim Niwas in Sector 94, Mokshdham in Shafipur (Greater Noida), Dadri’s Muktidham as well as four cremation grounds in sectors 14, 135, 52 and Barola. Besides, there are three cremation grounds in Jewar that don’t maintain category-specific (like Covid or non-Covid) records. These three grounds registered a total of 33 deaths in April and May. Crematoriums perform last rites with Covid protocols based on information from a deceased’s family, which is very different from the way Covid deaths are officially counted. Still, the gap between crematorium data and the official number is a wide one. At Antim Niwas, where two CNG furnaces are in use, a total of 2,124 cremations took place during this period – Covid protocols were followed for 1,349. According to officials at the crematorium, 30% of the bodies cremated were of residents from other neighbouring cities. Mahesh Saxena of Noida Lok Manch, the NGO which runs Antim Niwas, said, “Most of the Covid cremations are conducted in the CNG furnace, but at times, if the kin of the deceased insist, the cremation is carried out using wood. We send the data to the office of the chief medical officer every day.” In Greater Noida’s Shafipur, a total of 2,119 cremations took place, nearly the same number as Antim Niwas. This crematorium started functioning from late April when Antim Niwas became overburdened. Here, the official tally till June 5 for cremations following Covid protocols is 1,756. At Shafipur, Sachin Sharma, in-charge of the Mokshdham crematorium, said information on whether it’s a Covid death or not was garnered from family members of the deceased. On April 24, as Antim Niwas started running out of space, the Noida Authority issued an order that non-Covid cremations would be done at four other cremation grounds in sectors 14, 49, 135 and 52. These grounds saw 508 cremations over April and May. “When as many as 60-70 bodies were being cremated every day and furnaces started becoming dysfunctional due to overuse, four other cremation grounds started taking some of the load off Antim Niwas, which then became a ground for only Covid-positive deceased,” said an Antim Niwas official. At Dadri’s Muktidham, 126 cremations were conducted from April to June, according to Shamir Kashyap, executive officer, Dadri Nagar Palika. Vinod Prajapati, who carries out most of the cremations, told TOI 50 of the deceased were treated as Covid-positive, based on information from the next of kin. In Jewar’s three crematoriums, information on the 33 funerals IN April and May were submitted to the district administration, said Dinesh Shukla, executive officer of the Jewar Nagar Panchayat. Asked about the numbers, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate, Suhas L Yathiraj said the number of cremations don’t equal Covid deaths. According to Yathiraj, a reason for the high number of cremations with Covid protocols could be the policy of the administration to treat all suspect deaths as Covid related. “While government guidelines don't allow testing of patients after death, in suspect cases, a strict protocol of sanitisation is followed and the body is cremated as Covid-19 suspect. This also increases the number of cremations being undertaken under Covid protocols,” said the DM. He cited the example of patients who recover from Covid but continue to suffer from comorbid conditions. “They may die of non-Covid reasons but may still be cremated with full protocols. Or patients who are HRCT-positive but RT-PCR negative – in case of demise of such patients, their number is not captured on the portal but adds to the high number of cremations,” Yathiraj added. According to him, a number of high mortality cases, both Covid and non-Covid, also come to the district because of its quality medical care. “Hospitals here are providing tertiary-level healthcare, including kidney and liver transplant services. A high number of sick patients, both Covid and non-Covid, come to this district from all over the country for treatment,” he said, adding this added to the mortality rate of GB Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/over-3000-cremations-with-covid-19-protocols-in-noida-from-mar-15-june-5/articleshow/83323564.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Bengaluru||Private hospitals in Bengaluru gave 70% of doses last week||BENGALURU: Having administered nearly 35 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses since January, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike on Monday said it aims to inoculate 30 lakh people over the next one month and private hospitals are expected to share twothirds of the burden. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said they will intensify the drive in the coming days and focus on people above 60 years of age and the unvaccinated. He said there are no issues with vaccine supplies and private players have joined hands with the civic agency. In the past week, private hospitals shared 70% of the vaccination burden. “If we see the last week’s trend, we administered nearly a lakh of vaccines every day. Inclusion of private hospitals and other donors has increased the numbers. There is adequate supply of vaccines and we are aiming to administer 30 more lakh vaccines in the next 30 days,” he said. The Covid-19 vaccination execution in Bengaluru appears lopsided given the burden private hospitals are bearing. ‘Will vaccinate max people before 3rd wave’The Centre’s policy had mandated that vaccine producers must sell 50% of their production to the Union government, 25% each to states and private parties. In the past week, private hospitals have overtaken the government in the vaccination drive and provided 70% of doses administered. According to BBMP data, 1.6 lakh vaccines were provided by BBMP in the past week, whereas private hospitals have given 4.1 lakh jabs. Asked about the gap in numbers between government and private hospitals, Gupta said, “Our foremost goal is to vaccinate as many as people as possible before the start of the third wave. Whatever the government has received has been shared judiciously and BBMP has got its share. Private players who have ordered the jabs have vaccinated more people in Bengaluru city than elsewhere. There are many philanthropists who are buying vaccines for the underprivileged. The state government, at its level, would have to equitably distribute its stocks to all places in the state, whereas a city like Bengaluru would be recipient of more private supplies because of people’s capacity to pay.” “We are working for a judicious mix of government supply of vaccines and of private supplies. Considering the present trend, we are optimistic of getting 30 lakh doses in the city, of which we estimate 8-10 lakhs may be from government supplies,” Gupta said. According to him, offices, institutions and resident welfare associations are tying up with private hospitals to hold vaccination drives for their communities and some donors are doing it for people living in slums, garment workers and unorganised workers. Gupta said, “The administration has identified 26 lakh people above the age of 45 and15.4lakhhavebeen vaccinated at least one dose till date. Close to 60% have been vaccinated and our target is to reach 75% in the next 30 days. We need 4 lakh additional doses and we will get it from the central government.” BBMP said they have identified 64 lakh in the 18-44 age group and only 9 lakh (or 13%) have been vaccinated. On third wave, he said major hospitals have created oxygen plants and setting up child care centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/private-hospitals-in-bengaluru-gave-70-of-doses-last-week/articleshow/83326938.cms||Kiran Parashar

After Bangladesh, Nepal too signed a non-disclosure agreement with Chinese authorities for commercial purchase of Sinophar m jabs. With India having effectively banned vaccine export after the devastating second wave in April and May, Nepal and other Indian neighbours have been looking elsewhere for Covid-19 jabs. Bangladesh had recently signed a contract for purchase of 15 million doses from China. The non-disclosure agreement remains a controversial issue though with Nepal media, while confirming that it had indeed been signed, questioning if such an agreement had any legal basis. Kathmandu Post quoted an official to say that except in a situation where the government decides to procure defence-related materials, which are sensitive from a national security point of view, details of all other procurement including pricing must be disclosed as per the existing law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/shot-shortage-forces-nepal-to-ink-china-pact/articleshow/83326961.cms||---

This was disclosed by its MD & CEO A K Goel. The RBI had initiated PCA for the Kolkata-based lender in May, 2017 in view of high non-performing assets (NPA) and negative return on assets. In the last financial year, the bank posted a full-year net profit of Rs 167 crore against a whopping Rs 2,436.8 crore net loss during FY20. During FY19, the net loss had stood at Rs 4,321 crore. “We approached the RBI to consider taking the bank out of the PCA framework after declaring the fourth quarter results. The bank registered full year profit. It has meet all the criteria for exiting PCA,” Goel said. The lender had earlier approached the central bank on lifting the restrictions after it had posted a net profit during the last quarter of the financial year FY20. After making losses for several consecutive quarters, the bank had reported a net profit of Rs 16.7 crore for Q4FY20. On restructuring under the RBI’s new policy on loan recast, Goel said the bank already extended relief under Resolution Framework 2.0 to 2314 accounts, amounting Rs 127 crore as on June 7. “We are expecting around Rs 1,000 crore of loans required to be invoked for restructuring by June itself. For the whole of the year the numbers may be more,” he added. Banks and lending institutions can invoke restructuring under the proposed framework till September 30. The restructuring would be available to borrowers with exposure up to Rs 50 crore. In the last financial year, Uco Bank had restructured less than Rs 400 crore of retail and MSME loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/uco-bank-urges-rbi-to-lift-pca/articleshow/83321872.cms||---

Two each were killed in West Midnapore, East Midnapore and Bankura and one in Nadia. Three of the deceased were women. The lethal lightning strikes were triggered by a combination of factors: a ‘surface trough’ between east Uttar Pradesh and northeast Bay of Bengal and a squall line stretching across Burdwan, Nadia, Murshidabad and Midnpaore led to storms across South Bengal even as clouds floating in from Bangladesh further strengthened the system. “As a result, we had a thick column of cloud, fed by moisture from the region, that sailed southward lashing all the districts that came in its path. The cloud reached a height of 12 km and triggered frequent lightning strikes that turned out to be fatal,” said a Met official. The state government announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the kin of each of the deceased and asked the district administrations to reach out to the affected families by Monday night. Abhishek Banerjee, Trinamool Congress national general secretary, will visit the homes of the victims in four districts soon. PM Narendra Modi, too, sent his condolences to the victims’ families and announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to each of the bereaved families from the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund. “My thoughts are with all those who lost their near and dear ones due to lightning in parts of West Bengal.
