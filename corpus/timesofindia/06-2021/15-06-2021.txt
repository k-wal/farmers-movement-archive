Nathaniel Veltman, 20, was arrested shortly after the June 6 attack in a parking lot in London, Ontario, a short distance from the city's oldest mosque. He was wearing what appeared to be body armor and a helmet at the time, police said. Due to a publication ban, details from a hearing in which Veltman appeared by Zoom on Monday from jail cannot be revealed. However, provincial and federal prosecutors provided their consent to commence terrorism proceedings against him, alleging that the killings of Salman Afzaal, his wife, their daughter and Afzaal's mother, and attempted killing of the couple's son constituted terrorist activity, according to a statement from London police. Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland reacted to the new charges afterward, saying: "It is really important for us to name it as an act of terror ... and it is important for us identify the terrible threat that white supremacism poses to Canada and to Canadians." The members of the Afzaal family were out for an evening walk near their home when they were mowed down. The one survivor of the attack - a nine-year-old boy, remains in a hospital with serious injuries. It was the worst attack against Canadian Muslims since a man gunned down six members of a Quebec City mosque in 2017. So far, few details have emerged that would shed light on why police say it was a pre-meditated, hate-motivated crime. Veltman is due in court again on June 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/canadian-man-accused-of-killing-muslim-family-members-to-face-terror-charges/articleshow/83522471.cms||---
---||World||US, Russia envoys discuss Iran nuclear deal ahead of summit||VIENNA: Delegations from Russia and the United States involved in nuclear negotiations with Iran held talks in Vienna on Monday, two days ahead of a summit meeting between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The United States is not directly involved in the Vienna negotiations but has regular contacts with participating diplomats. Efforts to revive a 2015 nuclear containment deal for Iran are a rare topic of collaboration between the two global adversaries. Mikhail Ulyanov, a senior diplomat who headed the Russian delegation at the meeting in Vienna, called the talks with US counterparts ``fruitful.'' ``Our dialogue in Vienna seems to be proof that the two countries can maintain businesslike cooperation on issues of common interest, non-proliferation in this particular case,'' Ulyanov wrote in a tweet. The nuclear agreement was scuppered in 2018 when the Trump administration pulled the United States out of the accord, arguing that it handed Iran too many concessions. Diplomats from China, Germany, France, Russia, and Britain held joint talks with Iran Saturday and multiple bilateral meetings afterward at a hotel in the center of the Austrian capital. Matthew Rojansky, director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute in Washington, said Russia was keen to curb some of Iran's ambitions. ``Moscow still prefers to see Tehran checked in its aspiration to develop a weapon, but is much less motivated when it comes to checking Iran's regional ambitions and its broader global misbehavior,'' he told the AP. ``At the same time, Russia has a balancing act to perform in Syria, where Iran's force of arms on the ground could become a problem for Russian ambitions.'' The 2015 agreement was designed to keep Iran's nuclear program peaceful, imposing strict controls on uranium enrichment levels as well as the technology and facilities used for the process. Iran stopped abiding by those limits after the US withdrawal but insists it has no plan to build nuclear weapons _ a claim that the US and its western allies dispute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/us-russia-envoys-discuss-iran-nuclear-deal-ahead-of-summit/articleshow/83522857.cms||---

BJP Delhi general secretary Kuljeet Chahal remarked on Twitter, " While you are comparing the Delhi model of education with Gujarat, you must also disclose how many ministers in your government are sending their kids to schools run by your government". Chahal was joined by Uttar Pradesh and Delhi leaders in asking the query to AAP. During a media address, Kejriwal asked why Gujarat schools could not achieve any distinction in 70 years when Delhi schools become a better place to study within five years of his government. Kejriwal also said that his party will contest on all 182 seats in the Gujarat assembly elections next year. He was in Gujarat to inaugrate the state party headquarters in Navrangpura area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-asks-aap-about-ministers-kids-schooling-in-delhi/articleshow/83523819.cms||---
---||World||US bans dogs brought in from 100 countries with rabies risk||NEW YORK: US health officials Monday announced a one-year ban on bringing in dogs from more than 100 countries where rabies is still a problem. Dogs coming in from those countries already needed proof of rabies vaccination. The ban is being imposed because of a spike in the number of puppies denied entry because they weren't old enough to be fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The ban goes into effect July 14. Douglas Kratt, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association, applauded the decision. ``We want to make sure we're bringing healthy dogs into the country _ especially if they are going to be pets,'' said Kratt, a veterinarian in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The ban applies to dogs coming into or returning to the country, including pets or those brought in for sale or adoption. For example, if an American couple took their dog to Belize, they wouldn't be able to bring the dog back to the US unless the dog first spends six months in a country that is not at a high risk for rabies. About 1 million dogs are brought into the US each year, and the ban is expected to apply to 4% to 7.5%, officials said. Exceptions will be made for some situations, including guide dogs for the blind or foreigners moving to the US with their pets. Most of the dogs recently rejected came from just three countries _ Russia, Ukraine, and Colombia. But numerous other denials prompted the CDC to ban dogs from all countries where the risk of rabies is also high, said Emily Pieracci, a CDC rabies expert. Many of the rejections were due to fraudulent paperwork claiming the dogs were older than 4 months, Pieracci said. Dogs younger then 4 months aren't allowed in because rabies vaccinations don't take full effect before a dog is that age. Rabies is usually a fatal disease in animals and humans, caused by a virus that invades the central nervous system. It's most commonly spread through a bite from an infected animal. There is no cure for it once symptoms begin, but it can be prevented through vaccination. Dogs were once common carriers of the virus in the US but the type that normally circulates in dogs was eliminated in the US through vaccinations in the 1970s. In 1988, a new type of dog rabies was brought in from Mexico. It spread to wild coyotes and it took 19 years to eliminate. Cases from that second wave ``highlight the impact that a single imported case of rabies can have on wildlife, domestic animals, and people,'' Pieracci said Demand for dogs is believed to have been increased during the Covid- 19 pandemic, with Americans seeking furry companionship, Pieracci noted. But some dog rabies vaccination programs had to be suspended or canceled during the pandemic, making the risk of bringing in a rabid dog higher, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-bans-dogs-brought-in-from-100-countries-with-rabies-risk/articleshow/83524123.cms||---
---||World||US intel report warns of more violence by QAnon followers||WASHINGTON: A new federal intelligence report warns that adherents of QAnon, the conspiracy theory embraced by some in the mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol, could target Democrats and other political opponents for more violence as the movement's false prophecies don't come true.  Many QAnon followers believe former President Donald Trump was fighting enemies within the so-called "deep state" to expose a cabal of Satan-worshipping cannibals operating a child sex trafficking ring. Trump's loss to President Joe Biden disillusioned some believers in "The Storm," a supposed reckoning in which Trump's enemies would be tried and executed. Some adherents have now pivoted to believing Trump is the "shadow president" or Biden's victory was an illusion.  The report was compiled by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security and released Tuesday by Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat. It predicts that while some QAnon adherents will pull back, others "likely will begin to believe they can no longer 'trust the plan' referenced in QAnon posts and that they have an obligation to change from serving as 'digital soldiers' towards engaging in real world violence."  As major social media companies suspend or remove QAnon-themed accounts, many followers have moved to less well-known platforms and discussed how to radicalize new users on them, the report says.  The report says several factors will contribute to QAnon's long-term durability, including the COVID-19 pandemic, some social media companies allowing posts about the theories, societal polarization in the U.S., and the "frequency and content of pro-QAnon statements by public individuals who feature prominently in core QAnon narratives."  The report does not identify any of those public individuals. But Trump, who while in office praised QAnon followers as "people that love our country," has repeatedly refused to acknowledge the election is over and spoken baselessly of his victory being "stolen," despite multiple court rulings and a finding by his own Justice Department upholding the integrity of the election. One longtime ally told The Associated Press that Trump has given credence to a conspiracy theory that he could somehow be reinstated into the presidency in August.  Heinrich pressed FBI Director Chris Wray in April to release an assessment of how the government views QAnon. "The public deserves to know how the government assesses the threat to our country from those who would act violently on such beliefs," he said then.  The movement around QAnon has already been linked to political violence, notably during the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection in which some rioters believed they would reverse Trump's defeat. At least 20 QAnon followers have been charged with federal crimes related to Jan. 6, according to an Associated Press review of court records.  Some charged in the riot wore attire bearing the telltale letter "Q" when they stormed the Capitol. One of the defendants, Jacob Chansley, calls himself the "QAnon Shaman" and famously wore a furry hat with horns, face paint and no shirt that day. Others had posted about QAnon on social media before the riot.  The Justice Department has arrested more than 400 people in the insurrection, where pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, did about $1.5 million in damage and sent lawmakers running for their lives. Five people died and dozens of police officers were wounded. Defendants have argued that Trump himself spurred them on, or they were just following the crowd, or law enforcement allowed them in, or they were the victims of disinformation stoked by right-wing media.  Lawyers for some of the defendants have argued their clients were specifically misguided by QAnon. Defense attorney Christopher Davis argued that his client, Douglas Jensen, is a victim of internet-driven conspiracy promoted by "very clever people, who were uniquely equipped with slight, if any, moral or social consciousness." Jensen now realizes that he "bought into a pack of lies," his lawyer maintains.  "For reasons he does not even understand today, he became a 'true believer' and was convinced he doing a noble service by becoming a digital soldier for 'Q.' Maybe it was mid-life crisis, the pandemic, or perhaps the message just seemed to elevate him from his ordinary life to an exalted status with an honorable goal," Davis wrote.  A witness told the FBI that another defendant, Kevin Strong, expressed a belief that Jan. 6 would usher in "World War 3" and the military would be involved. Strong, who was a Federal Aviation Administration employee in San Bernardino, California, had a flag with a QAnon slogan on his house and has declared that he had "Q clearance," an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit.  "He had recently purchased a new truck and believed that QAnon would cover the debt," the agent wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-intel-report-warns-of-more-violence-by-qanon-followers/articleshow/83524226.cms||---
---||India||India behind China and Pakistan in nuclear-warheads but not worried||NEW DELHI: India is confident of its strategic deterrence capability, which will get a greater punch with the ongoing induction of Agni-V missiles and Rafale fighters as well the commissioning of nuclear submarine INS Arighat this year, though it still lags behind both China and Pakistan in the number of nuclear warheads. China now possesses 350 nuclear warheads, while Pakistan has 165, as compared to 156 of India, as per the latest assessment of the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI) released on Monday. The nine nuclear-armed countries together possess an estimated 13,080 nuclear weapons, with Russia (6,255 warheads) and the US (5,550) leagues ahead of the rest. The others are France (290), UK (225), Israel (90) and North Korea (40-50). These figures, of course, are not exact because countries by and large keep their nuclear weapons programmes shrouded in secrecy. Apart from Russia and the US, all the other seven countries are also either developing or deploying new weapon systems. “China is in the middle of a significant modernisation and expansion of its nuclear weapons inventory, and India and Pakistan also appear to be expanding their nuclear arsenals,” said SIPRI. The report comes at a time India and China remain locked in the military confrontation in eastern Ladakh, which erupted in May last year, with no signs of de-escalation as yet. But the fresh border ceasefire with Pakistan has held since February. Indian officials say robust delivery systems like land-based ballistic missiles and nuclear-powered submarines with ballistic nuclear missiles (called SSBNs), with “assured second-strike capabilities”, have more strategic significance rather than the actual number of warheads. “Nuclear weapons are meant for deterrence, not war-fighting. Pakistan, of course, has benefitted from its nexus in nuclear and missile proliferation with China and North Korea. But India is doing fine with the development and modernisation of its indigenous credible minimum deterrence,” said an official. The tri-Service Strategic Forces Command, for instance, is now inducting the over 5,000-km range Agni-V intercontinental ballistic missile, which brings the whole of Asia and China as well parts of Europe and Africa within its strike envelope, after shorter-range missiles. Similarly, the new Rafale jets have boosted the existing “air vector” for delivery of nuclear gravity bombs after some Sukhoi-30MKIs, Mirage-2000s and Jaguars were earlier modified for that role. But the third leg of the “nuclear triad” is still far from being credible. India currently has only one SSBN in INS Arihant, with 750-km range K-15 nuclear missiles. Countries like the US, Russia and China have SSBNs with well over 5,000-km range missiles. India has three more SSBNs under development, with INS Arighat slated for commissioning this year after some delay. The developmental trials of K-4 missiles, with a strike range of 3,500-km, in turn, have been completed but the induction is still some distance away, as was earlier reported by TOI. Pakistan as yet does not have sea-based nukes, though it has tested the 450-km-range Babur-3 cruise missiles for deployment on conventional diesel-electric submarines. China, of course, is far ahead with its Type-094 or Jin-class submarines armed with the 7,400-km JL-2 missiles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-behind-china-pakistan-in-nuclear-warheads-but-not-worried/articleshow/83524404.cms||Rajat Pandit

With the new unlock plan for Mumbai (the city is on Level 3 of lockdown restrictions), Mumbaikars can now step out for breakfast, brunch, lunch or coffee. Dinner plans, however, will have to wait because restaurants are only allowed to operate till 4 pm on weekdays. Also, restaurants can operate at only 50 per cent capacity. While the restaurant industry has welcomed the move, they also say that a large chunk of their business is usually post evening hours. ‘Around 75 to 80 per cent of a restaurant’s business takes place post evening hours’People having lunch at a restaurant in Andheri East recently (Pic: Kaushik Naik/BCCL)The decision, part of the five-level plan by the Maharashtra government, signals a new start. But the early timings prop up a question: In a busy city like Mumbai, with more takers for dinner than a daytime meal, will there be enough footfalls with the new timings? Riyaaz Amlani, CEO and MD of a hospitality group, says that this is a welcome move. “Given the current restrictions such as the time limitation and 50% occupancy for dine-in, business will be slow as a majority of our revenue comes from early evening and dinner hours. At this point, we cannot bank on a large crowd turning up in the afternoon, especially during weekdays. We are hoping all the markets open up and timings are normalised,” Riyaaz Amlani adds. Pradeep Shetty, Sr. Vice President, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), echoes the thought. He says, “At least 75% to 80% of a restaurant’s business takes place post evening hours. We do welcome the move and hope that restaurants will soon be allowed to function during their full operational hours.” Restaurateurs conduct staff vaccination drives, have socially-distanced tablesand sanitisersThe restaurants are following the COVID-19 safety protocolsThe reopening is however a significant move and the next step, building customer confidence, is key on their agenda. Restaurants plan to do this by vaccinating their staff and adhering to COVID-safety norms in their premises. Informs Riyaaz, “We have conducted vaccination drives for our staff in Mumbai and Pune and almost 90% have gotten the first jab. We are doing everything we can to ensure the safety of our staff and customers. We also urge the government to increase vaccination availability so that more people can get vaccinated. Last year, to ensure safety and hygiene protocols for all, the NRAI had created a 1,000-page SOP for front of the house and heart of the house staff, which all restaurants have implemented across the country. We will be following the same this time around as well. The mandated SOPs, which include digital menus and payments, acrylic partitions between guests, running at 50% capacity, and one-meter distancing between tables, are being followed across all our restaurants.” Keenan Tham, who is the director at an Asian restaurant, has also kicked off a vaccination drive for his staff. He shares, “Being safe is key and we are not opening yet as we are planning to vaccinate the entire staff first and have recently got slots for this. We have also announced this to customers via social media as building trust matters the most. In addition to other protocols, we plan to have our staff wear double masks and face shields and follow thorough sanitisation practices.” Restaurateur Megha Datwani, who had closed down her Mexican eatery during the lockdown, has a new strategy for reopening. She says, “We used to start at noon and now the plan is to start at 9.30am. We will have a special Mexican breakfast menu with special dishes. I did a lot of research during the lockdown and came up with these dishes. We may not possibly see patrons during late evening hours any time soon, so we have to capitalise on what time we actually have.” Food delivery is still a sizeable revenue for them(Pic for representation only)Over the last few months, with dine-in coming to a halt, the focus shifted to food deliveries for several places and that made for their profits. Says Megha, “Yes, in fact, delivery is still big, but for a dine-in establishment, it’s not a major chunk of the business because when you eat out, it’s about selling the whole experience. In pre-lockdown times, delivery was just 10-15% of the revenue. And then with food delivery permitted for 24 hours, it grew to 80% of the revenue. Now that dining-in is allowed, it will be around 35% of the revenue, which is still a sizeable amount.” Aji Nair, COO of a hospitality venture, adds, “Current conditional relaxations will not be economically viable for us. The cost of operations is huge, hence, we have decided to wait till the dinner operations start officially. For now, delivery is our only source of revenue.” ‘Asked CM to lift curbs on weekends, timing extension to 11 pm’For now, the restaurants can operate from Monday to Friday, but with food akin to socialising for busy city-goers and a lot of dining out taking place on Saturdays and Sundays, the industry is hoping to get back to where it was. Says Keenan, “The current situation is a double-edged sword. While we are happy with the news of opening, it’s also a challenge to be able to operate only till 4pm, especially just on weekdays. But something is better than nothing and we’re hoping to have normalised timings soon.” Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, Vice President, Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI), adds, “Restaurants have negligible footfall in the daytime and a significant portion of the business happens after 8pm. We have written a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray for an extension to 11pm and to stay open on weekends and are hopeful that things will improve soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vaccinated-staff-50-capacity-mumbai-restaurants-happy-to-be-back-but-say-4pm-deadline-is-a-challenge/articleshow/83520431.cms||Ismat Tahseen

On Monday, the Magistrate Court was to start hearing the case of Choksi's "illegal entry" into the country on May 23 but he was a "no show", a media website Natureislenews reported. His legal team submitted a medical certificate from the doctors of Dominica China Friendship Hospital, where Choksi is being held, of "mental stress" and elevated blood pressure. Chief Magistrate Carette-George adjourned the matter to June 25 and ordered to keep Choksi, wanted in the Rs 13,500 crore scam in the Punjab National Bank here, under police watch at the hospital. He also asked authorities to present Choksi before the court on June 17 for further remand. Choksi's lawyer in London, Michael Polak, issued a statement on Monday claiming new evidence has emerged which shows that Barbara Jabarica, the woman with whom the diamantaire was last seen, sought booking of an accomodation with a jetty. He alleged Jabarica, who is suspected to be part of Choksi's "kidnapping" from Antigua, had enquired about a neighbouring property too, which was booked by a UK-based company. Polak issued two videos showing a small boat which, he alleged, was used to transport a gagged and beaten Choksi to open seas where he was transferred to a bigger boat to be taken to Dominica. Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi had fled India in the first week of January, 2018 weeks before the scam in the Punjab National Bank rocked the Indian banking industry. Modi escaped to Europe and was finally held in London where he is contesting his extradition to India, while Choksi took citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda in 2017 where he was staying since his escape from Delhi. Choksi, 62, had mysteriously gone missing on May 23 from Antigua and Barbuda, where he was staying since 2018 as a citizen, since he fled Delhi. He was detained in neighbouring island country Dominica on May 23 for illegal entry after a possible romantic escapade with his rumoured girlfriend. His lawyers alleged that he was kidnapped from Jolly Harbour in Antigua by policemen looking like Antiguans and Indians and brought to Dominica on a boat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dominica-court-adjourns-till-june-25-hearing-in-choksis-illegal-entry-into-caribbean-island-nation/articleshow/83523734.cms||---

Please remember, do not refresh too often, as you may be locked out of your account. Appointments remain available at all posts, and we will continue to add appointments as conditions allow,” the US embassy said in a tweet on Monday after it resumed the process of facilitating travel for those who have to join colleges in July and August. Students who kept refreshing in the hope of booking a slot were eventually blocked for “suspicious activity” for 72 hours. By afternoon, the site had a message that said: “We are down for maintenance”. The embassy’s tweet warning students not to refresh too often drew scores of replies. “My account got locked without a prior warning. Many others are facing this issue too.

Officials had assured candidates that everyone would get a slot once the process opened. “Student visas remain a top priority for the US mission to India and we are making every attempt to facilitate student travel in time for the fall semester,” the embassy had said. However, an aspirant who is flying out for a post-doctoral programme said, “There was no clarity on the time when the embassy would open appointment slots. Many logged in a little after midnight.

I am surprised they did not anticipate the rush. Nobody was able to open the site. Going by the previous numbers about 80,000 to 1 lakh students must have logged in at the same time; it is like opening a two-by-two door for entry into a large stadium; there is going to be a stampede.” Another counsellor added: “Ideally, the process should have been staggered.” Students who have been locked out have requested the embassy to unblock their accounts. One father tweeted asking for locked accounts to be reopened: “Please empathise and let not our kids go through more stress.” Another said: “The site kept crashing leaving us with no choice but to log in many times and now we’ve been blocked for 72 hours.” Meanwhile, France is wooing students from India and has resumed student visa processing.

Echoing the points raised by the Supreme Court on the existence of Digital Divide as a dampener, a Boston Consulting Group survey released on Monday showed, 63% in rural areas and 43% in smaller towns didn’t know how to register on the CoWin app for vaccination, 60% of rural residents and 40% of those in smaller towns did not even know how to enrol. But the good news is that Indians are slowly shedding vaccine hesitancy. The pandemic’s second wave which spread outside of bigger cities into smaller towns and villages and its resultant impact on life and livelihood has made more Indians, specifically in smaller towns and rural areas, shed their reluctance over Covid vaccination. As many as 78% of Indians in large towns were “extremely willing to take vaccines” as of May over 62% in March, Boston Consulting Group’s Covid-19 Consumer Sentiment Survey said. And 74% of Indians in smaller towns answered in the affirmative to the question “Can you tell us as of today would you be willing to take the Covid-19 vaccine if it was made available to you”, against just 39% in March and 63% were willing adopters of the Covid vaccine in May in rural India as against 41% in March. Among those who had not taken the vaccine despite being available, issues with registration on CoWin were the main reasons. Two thirds (65%) of all Indians in big towns faced issues with the app, with non-availability of vaccination slots and fear of crowds at the centre. While 55% in smaller towns and 53% in rural areas had issues with the technology behind seeking slots for vaccination. BCG’s survey was fielded from May 23 to 28 covering nearly 4,000 respondents across metros and smaller towns and cities and rural India. Some categories have continued to show positive sentiment. For example: essentials, health, and home entertainment continue to be winners. “There is an impending sense of uncertainty. However, we have observed certain positive messages too. The spending sentiment has not been impacted similarly across categories. Essentials, health, in home entertainment continue to be winners. Some of the discretionary categories, however, have been negatively impacted,” said Nimisha Jain, MD and Partner, BCG India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/60-in-rural-areas-unaware-of-how-to-enrol-for-vaccination-poll/articleshow/83524988.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

Five of the six LJP MPs joined the putsch, leaving Chirag with the legacy of his late father, a respected figure for Dusadhs, a Dalit category in Bihar. Ramvilas Paswan’s younger brother Pashupati Paras — a known figure in Bihar politics who has served in several ministries and currently represents Hajipur, the constituency of the elder sibling, in Lok Sabha — is the new leader. Ramvilas’s nephew Prince Raj too has sided with Paras. Chirag’s dethronement climaxed a dizzying turn of events, which unfolded in public glare since Sunday evening, and is widely believed to have been executed by JD(U) as revenge against Chirag for causing the defeat of Nitish Kumar’s nominees in the last assembly polls. The precision targeting of JD(U) nominees left the party languishing in the third spot, way behind its arch-rival RJD as well as ally BJP. Seething with resentment, JD(U) had sworn revenge. It was exacted in a forensic manner, with Chirag failing to get wind of the plot until the rebels had met the Lok Sabha Speaker late Sunday evening with the plea that they be recognised as a separate group under Paras. JD(U) was, quite naturally, thrilled with the success of the game plan, with party chief R C P Singh exulting, “Chirag has reaped what he had sown.” BJP kept an indulgent distance from the goings on but did not appear to be mourning Chirag’s embarrassment. Indeed, party functionary in Bihar Prem Ranjan Patel said the Paswan dynast invited it all upon himself. The speed with which the “rebels” got recognised as a separate group, within less than 24 hours of meeting Speaker Om Birla, was also being talked about in political circles. To be sure, however, the rebels fulfilled all the criteria laid down under the anti-defection law to earn the recognition from the Speaker for being the “real” stuff. BJP, used to the old school politics practised by Ramvilas Paswan, was wary of Chirag’s swagger and maximalist posture. During the LJP-JD(U) feud, it had maintained a posture of neutrality, much to the annoyance of JD(U), which quickly sniffed a conspiracy. BJP soured on Chirag after seeing that he had also undercut the prospects of saffron candidates and had smoothened the way for RJD biggies, Tejaswi and Tej Pratap. The “hands off” stance during JD(U)’s retaliation can help minimise the pall of any suspicion lingering in JD(U) about a closet understanding between its ally and Chirag, its self-avowed rival. Of course, family equations played an important part, with Paras always suspected to be smarting under Chirag, who tried, unspectacularly so, his hand at acting before coming into the family vocation. Paras was hugely embarrassed when pressure from Chirag forced him to eat his praise for Nitish. He was helped by the discomfort that many MPs, mostly a bunch of political adventurers, and others had felt about Chirag’s style, finding it to be too formal and distant. On Monday, with the tables turned on him by an uncle who remained unscrupulously devout to Ramvilas Paswan, and a cousin who appeared absolutely blissful playing second fiddle, Chirag tried to reach out to the estranged part of the family. He drove to the apartment where the rebels were holding a meeting but Paras dodged him. With the rebels having been recognised as the LJP, Chirag is left with only the “sympathy card”. He can hope to turn it into an ace by tapping into the reverence the Paswan community has for Ramvilas if he shows the determination and endurance for a contest which is three years away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ljp-split-wide-open-chirag-paswan-out-in-the-cold/articleshow/83525156.cms||---

The early success of the US vaccine rollout has had a huge impact on the pace of Covid-19 fatalities in the country. It took 113 days to go from 500,000 total US Covid-19 deaths to 600,000 - the second slowest 100,000-death jump since the pandemic began. The nation went from 400,000 to 500,000 deaths in just 35 days. "My heart goes out to those who've lost a loved one.... We have more work to do to beat this virus and now's not the time to let our guard down," said President Joe Biden on the sidelines of NATO meetings in Brussels, Belgium, urging people to get vaccinated. The US seven-day Covid-19 death average has fallen by almost 90% from its peak in January. The country reported 18,587 coronavirus-related deaths in May - about 81% less than in January, Reuters data showed. While the epicenter of the pandemic has shifted to places like Brazil and India in recent months, the United States remains the hardest-hit nation in terms of cumulative deaths. But the country has so far vaccinated 166 million adults with at least one dose, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), although the rate of shots administered has dropped significantly from a mid-April peak. The average seven-day Covid-19 hospitalization number has also plummeted since April due to vaccinations. On June 2, total hospitalized patients fell below 20,000 for the first time since June 24, 2020. However, hospitalization among teenagers has increased as more easily transmitted virus variants began to spread, according to recent CDC data. The rate of hospitalization due to Covid-19 increased among adolescents aged 12 to 17 in April to 1.3 per 100,000 people from a lower rate in mid-March, the agency reported. Overall, daily new Covid-19 cases have also been dropping since March, with the country reporting the lowest number of cases per capita in May of this year, according to a Reuters analysis. With vaccinations down to about 1.10 million doses per day last week - some 67% lower than the highest seven-day rate - the Biden administration and state governors have come up with all manner of incentives to get unvaccinated people to roll up their sleeves. These include free childcare and rides to vaccination centers, extended Friday night hours at pharmacies and the chance to win $1 million or college scholarships in a lottery. As of Sunday, nearly 52% of the US population has received their first vaccine dose, according to the CDC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/as-death-rate-slows-us-exceeds-600000-covid-19-fatalities/articleshow/83525148.cms||---
---||India||For climate change, rich nations owe us billions: Javadekar||NEW DELHI: A day after G7 members reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change, India on Monday reminded rich nations of their responsibilities citing their historical emissions and said they still owe $1.1 trillion to developing countries as per what was promised 11 years ago. “As part of the Paris Agreement rich countries promised to provide US $100 billion a year to help developing nations combat climate change. But for the last 11 years practically nothing has come,” said environment minister Prakash Javadekar. Speaking at a webinar on ‘revival, regeneration and conservation of nature’, organised by FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO), he said, “India's cumulative contribution to climate change (in terms of emission) in the last 200 years is just 3%. The unbridled carbon emissions particularly by Europe, US and in the last 40 years by China, caused climate change disaster. “These countries prospered economically but polluted the world. India is one of the suffering countries with the least contribution to climate change,” the minister said. Referring to the discussion on climate finance at the G7 summit which concluded on Sunday, Javadekar said the rich nations discussed it seriously because they know that the subject cannot be put off further. His remarks assume significance in view of the concerns of developing countries as to how the lack of finance has become a major hindrance to their decarbonisation efforts as switching over to low carbon economic growth path has a cost. The G7 countries – US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Italy and Japan – on Sunday once again reaffirmed the collective goal to jointly mobilise $100 billion per year from “public and private sources” in the context of meaningful mitigation actions. Besides promising to accelerate efforts to achieve ‘net zero’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as soon as possible and by 2050 at the latest, they also reaffirmed their existing commitment to eliminating inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025. As part of a fresh move towards decarbonisation, they decided to end “new direct government support” for unabated international thermal coal power generation by the end of 2021 with Canada, Germany, the UK, and the US agreeing to back a $2 billion fund to accelerate the coal transition and support ‘just transition’ for affected workers and sectors. Though green activists expressed their disappointment over the issue of climate finance saying the rich countries cannot simply reiterate existing obligations but must put substantial new and additional finance on the table, they appreciated the G7 members’ decision to end the public financing of coal by the end of this year. “The deal leaves China isolated as the world's biggest public backer of the dirtiest fossil fuel,” said Tasneem Essop, executive director, Climate Action International.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-climate-change-rich-nations-owe-us-billions-javadekar/articleshow/83525389.cms||Vishwa Mohan

In one instance, a single phone number was used to register over 50 people while one antigen test kit (which has an exclusive number and is meant for single use) was shown to have tested 700 samples. “Addresses and names were fictional. Almost 530 samples were taken from ‘House Number 5’ in Haridwar. Is it possible for a house to have over 500 residents? Bizarre addresses have been given — House number 56 Aligarh, House number 76 Mumbai,” an official who is part of the investigation told TOI. The official added, “Phone numbers were fake too. People in Kanpur, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and 18 other locations shared the same phone number.” Coronavirus: Live updatesKumbh Mela health officer Dr Arjun Singh Sengar told TOI, “The agency was supposed to submit the samples to two private labs. The labs are also under investigation.” According to health secretary Amit Negi, the investigation report has been forwarded to the Haridwar DM. “Several irregularities have been found. We will take action after receiving a detailed report from the DM in 15 days,” said Negi. Haridwar district magistrate C Ravishnkar said he was investigating the matter and pending payment of all agencies has been put on hold until further notice. The 200 sample collectors employed by the agency turned out to be students and data entry operators in Rajasthan, who had never been to Haridwar. “A sample collector has to be physically present to collect samples. When we contacted the sample collectors registered with the agency, we found 50% of them were residents of Rajasthan, many were students or data entry operators,” said an official. “One sample collector was someone enrolled in a skill development training programme at a government authorised centre in Hanumangarh (Rajasthan). Upon inquiry, he told us that he had never been to Kumbh. He said he had been given the data by his instructor who had asked him to upload it as part of his training,” according to the investigation report. According to officials, this is “just the tip of the iceberg” since eight more sample collection agencies were tasked to conduct tests by the state government after the high court directed Uttarakhand to carry out at least 50,000 tests daily during Kumbh. The festival was held from April 1 to 30 in Haridwar. The four lakh tests in this period were conducted by nine agencies and 22 private labs. Majority of these tests were antigen tests. The state department also conducted its own tests through government labs. Of the 1 lakh tests conducted by the agency under scanner, 177 were “Covid positive” — a positivity rate of only 0.18%. In contrast, the positivity rate in Haridwar in April went upto 10%. The scam came to light earlier this week after a Punjab-based man — who had not visited Kumbh— received a Covid-negative report on his phone from the Haridwar health department. He filed a complaint with the Indian Council of Medical Research, which alerted the state authorities. The agency was paid Rs 350 per antigen test and higher for RT-PCR tests, which means the scam runs into crores. Test results by other agencies are also being probed now, said a health department official.

---||India||A 3D-printed mask that attacks corona||NEW DELHI: Now, an anti-viral mask that attacks coronavirus. A Pune-based startup in collaboration with Technology Development Board (TDB) of the department of science and technology has developed a special kind of cost-effective 3D-printed mask that is coated with anti-viral agents known as virucides. The anti-viral agent in these masks attacks the coronavirus when viral particles come in contact with it. The coating has been tested and shown to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus. The project to develop virucidal masks received financial support from TDB in May last year as part of its search for novel solutions to fight Covid-19. Thereafter, an agreement was signed on July 8, 2020 for developing virucidal masks. Pune-based Thincr Technologies India Private Ltd, which developed these virucidal masks, claims that the masks are more effective in checking the spread of Covid-19 than ordinary N-95, 3-ply and cloth masks as they give an additional anti-viral protection beyond the shield provided by filtration mechanisms. Plastic-moulded mask generated by 3D-printersThincr Technologies has now applied for a patent for the product, whose commercial production has started. Around 6,000 of such masks have been distributed by an NGO to four government hospitals in Nandurbar and Nashik in Maharashtra and Bengaluru for use by healthcare workers. The virucidal masks have also been distributed to a girls’ school and college in Bengaluru. Founder director of the startup, Dr Shitalkumar Zambad, said: “We sensed that use of face masks will become nearly universal as the most important tool to prevent infection. But we realised that most masks which were then available (when the pandemic started) and within the reach of common people were homemade and of relatively low quality. It is this need for high-quality masks which led us to undertake a project to develop and commercialise cost-effective and more efficient virucidal-coated masks, as a better approach to reduce the spread of infection.” The mask was developed with support from Merck Life Sciences located in Nerul, Navi Mumbai, whose research facility was used for the purpose. The coated layer can be incorporated as an additional layer in N-95 masks, 3-ply masks, simple cloth masks, 3D printed or other plastic cover masks along with reusable filters to provide extra protection. The material used for coating on the mask is a sodium olefin sulfonate based-mixture. It is a soap forming agent with hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. When it comes in contact with enveloped viruses, it disrupts the outer membrane of the virus. The ingredients used in the coated layer are stable at room temperature and are widely used in cosmetics, an S&T statement said. Zambad said the masks have been found to have bacterial filtration efficiency higher than 95%. “In this project, for the first time, we used 3D-printers to make multilayer cloth filters to precisely fit plastic-moulded or 3D-printed mask covers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-3d-printed-mask-that-attacks-corona/articleshow/83526104.cms||Surendra Singh
---||World||Convict sentenced to life without parole in official's death||RIPLEY: A convicted felon was sentenced to life in prison without parole Monday in a deal with prosecutors in the rape and killing of a Tennessee prison administrator during a 2019 escape.  Curtis Ray Watson pleaded no contest to a charge of first-degree murder in the perpetration of a rape. He also pleaded no contest to aggravated rape, and guilty to seven additional charges, including aggravated burglary and escape.  Lauderdale County Judge Joe Walker sentenced Watson to life in prison without parole for the murder charge and an additional 25 years for the rape charge.  Watson has been held at a Nashville area prison since he was arrested. He had been indicted on 15 counts in the Aug. 7, 2019, killing of Tennessee Department of Correction Administrator Debra Johnson.  Watson was on regular lawn care duties at West Tennessee State Penitentiary near Henning when he sexually assaulted and killed Johnson, 64, at her home on the prison grounds that morning, authorities said.  Watson had access to a tractor and a golf cart as a "trusty" - an inmate granted special privileges as a trustworthy person, authorities said. Watson had been housed in the minimum security annex at the prison, located about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of Memphis.  Watson escaped on a tractor, which was left in a cotton field about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the prison, authorities said. He was found four days later after an intense manhunt among homes and fields near the prison.  Prosecutors had said they would seek the death penalty should Watson be convicted at trial.  Johnson had been a state employee for 38 years and oversaw wardens at several area prisons.  Watson has been serving a 15-year sentence for especially aggravated kidnapping. He illegally confined his wife and hit her with an aluminum baseball bat in July 2012, court documents showed. His sentence began in 2013 and was set to expire in 2025, officials said. He also had been previously convicted of aggravated child abuse.  During his four days on the run in rural West Tennessee, Watson stole items from two homes, including camouflage clothing, binoculars, a compass, two knives, a saw and food, the indictment said.  He was captured seven hours after homeowners recognized him on their outdoor surveillance camera, officials said.  Prison officers testified in previous court hearings that they could not locate Watson on the morning of his escape. They found Watson's golf cart at Johnson's house about 8:30 am, prison officers said.  Phone records show Johnson was talking on the phone at 8:10 am, according to an affidavit. Watson drove away from the prison sometime between 9 and 10 am on a tractor, the affidavit says. He was discovered missing at 11 a.m. When Johnson didn't show up for work, co-workers discovered her body at her home at 11:30 am, according to the affidavit.  A prison nurse testified she found a cellphone charging cord wrapped around Johnson's neck. A medical examiner ruled Johnson was strangled. DNA evidence collected from the crime scene matched Watson, prosecutor Julie Pillow said.  Johnson's killing led to questions about security at the prison. During a December 2019 appearance before members of the Tennessee Legislature's Joint Corrections Subcommittee in Nashville, Tennessee Department of Correction Commissioner Tony Parker said that it was "worth looking at" adding video surveillance cameras at residences located at the prison. Parker and assistant corrections commissioner Lee Dotson became emotional as Parker spoke about Johnson. Parker called her an extraordinary woman "who treated everyone she encountered with dignity and respect."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/convict-sentenced-to-life-without-parole-in-officials-death/articleshow/83526364.cms||---

The stocks, however, recovered later in the day after the group claimed that the accounts remained active. Citing a mail from NSDL, the Adani group said the accounts of the three FPIs that were shown as frozen on May 31 on the depository’s website, remained active. “As may be verified from the said system, the status of demat accounts …are held in ‘Active’ status in (the) NSDL system,” a document from Adani group quoted from the mail it received from NSDL. All group companies informed the bourses that their registrar and transfer agents have also clarified that the demat accounts “in which the aforesaid funds hold the shares of the company are not frozen”. The three foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) whose accounts were frozen as of May 31 were Albula Investments, APMS Investment and Cresta Fund. Their combined investment in the listed Adani entities add up to Rs 43,000 crore. Read AlsoWhy shares of Adani Group plunged sharplyThe shares of Adani Group companies suffered a massive jolt on Monday. All stocks of the group hit their respective lower circuit limits during the trade resulting in massive loss of more than $6 billion in one day.Sources said the accounts of these three FPIs, along with several others, were frozen as a result of a Sebi order of 2016 relating to depository receipts (DRs), that is Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) and American Depository Receipts (ADRs). “The investment accounts of these three FPIs for investing in India and the ones relating to investing in DRs are completely separate. Hence, the freezing of DR accounts in no way hampers their operations in India as an FPI,” the source said. At the end of each month, depositories come out with the list of demat accounts which are frozen by it due to various reasons including regulatory directives and non-disclosures. Since the distinction between the accounts was not made on the NSDL site, the markets got jittery. As a result, in early trades, all the group companies -- Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports & SEZ, Adani Power, Adani Transmission, Adani Green and Adani Total -- were at their respective lower circuit levels, after falling up to 20%. The sell-off in one of the most talked-about groups in India, which saw its total market valuation jump multiple times in just a couple of years, weighed on market sentiment. As a result, the sensex was down by about 450 points but after the company's clarification, the index finally closed marginally higher, at 52,552 points, up 77 points on the day. On Monday, there was panic among investors on Dalal Street in early trades since the sell-off in these stocks was strong. This was more so because of the smart rise in group stocks in recent months, a dealer with a local brokerage said. For example, so far this year till Friday, the stock price of Adani Enterprises has gone up more than three times -- from Rs 479 to over Rs 1,600. On Monday, after touching an intra-day low at Rs 1,441, the stock closed at Rs 1,501, mainly because of the end-of-the-session pull-back rally, the dealer said. Most of the other Adani group stocks too witnessed such pull-back rallies, BSE data showed. However, Adani Power, Adani Transmission and Adani Total Gas all closed at the 5% lower circuit level. At the close of the day’s trading, the group’s total market was down nearly Rs 54,000 crore to Rs 8.97 lakh crore, BSE data showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/adani-stocks-tank-as-nsdl-freezes-accounts-of-3-fpis/articleshow/83526786.cms||---
---||World||Senate set to elevate judge on Joe Biden's high court short list||WASHINGTON: The Senate is expected Monday to narrowly confirm the first appellate court judge of President Joe Biden's tenure, elevating a judge with strong prospects of landing on the president's short list should a Supreme Court vacancy arise.  The Senate is voting on the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to take the place of Merrick Garland on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the nation's second most powerful court. Garland vacated the seat to become Biden's attorney general.  Biden has promised to name a Black woman to the Supreme Court and many view Jackson as a leading contender. She has written nearly 600 opinions as a district judge in Washington, worked as a federal public defender and served as vice chair on the commission that sets the guidelines judges consult when sentencing federal offenders.  The White House has sought to emphasize diversity in background, race and gender with his first batch of judicial nominations. Last week, the Senate confirmed the nation's first federal Muslim judge, Zahid Quraishi, to serve as a district court judge in New Jersey. Quraishi's first day on the job at a New York law firm was Sept. 11, 2001. He would go on to join the Army's legal arm and served two deployments in Iraq.  The Senate has also confirmed Regina Rodriguez as a district judge in Colorado and Julien Neals as a district judge in New Jersey.  Democrats are mindful that former President Donald Trump and a Republican-led Senate installed more than 230 judges on the federal bench, including the three newest Supreme Court justices, with assembly line precision. They're focused on giving Biden some early victories as they mount their own effort to shape the courts.  "Women, especially women of color, have long been underrepresented on the federal bench," said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. "Along with President Biden, the Senate Democratic majority is working quickly to close the gap."  The Senate voted last week to end debate and bring Jackson's nomination to the floor. Three Republicans, Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, joined Democrats in voting yes.  Sen. Dick Durbin, the democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that nominations to the District of Columbia-based circuit court are often controversial because the stakes are so high, with most cases involving the federal government coming before the court. Durbin said it was noteworthy that Jackson received the support of some Republicans on the committee.  "The importance of the circuit cannot be overstated," Durbin said.  Two Republicans, Graham and John Cornyn of Texas, voted with Democrats in advancing her nomination out of the committee by a vote of 13-9. Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican from Iowa, voted no, saying that he was not satisfied Jackson would "adhere to the Constitution as originally understood."  Jackson graduated from Harvard Law School and served as a clerk to Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. In 2005, she began work as an assistant federal public defender in Washington. She joined a private firm in 2007 and then served on the U.S. Sentencing Commission beginning in 2010. President Barack Obama nominated her to serve as a federal district judge in 2012, and the Senate confirmed her the following year.  In one of her most high-profile decisions, she ordered former White House counsel Don McGahn to appear before Congress in a setback to Trump's effort to keep his top aides from testifying.  Groups supporting her confirmation have cited the need to bring more racial diversity to the federal judiciary.  "Since the establishment of the judiciary, there have only ever been eight Black women to serve on the federal appellate branch," the NAACP's Legal Defense and Educational Fund told senators in a letter supporting Jackson. "Such disparities undermine the legitimacy and integrity of the judicial system."  She also exemplifies a push by Biden to nominate more judges with experience representing lower-income people.  "Our judiciary has been dominated by former corporate lawyers and prosecutors for too long, and Judge Jackson's experience as a public defender makes her a model for the type of judge President Biden and Senate Democrats should continue to prioritize," said Christopher Kang, chief counsel for Demand Justice, a liberal advocacy group.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell made filling judicial vacancies a top priority when Republicans controlled the chamber, including confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the US Supreme Court just days before the presidential election.  However, Republicans blocked Obama from filling a vacancy during his final year in office. McConnell reiterated in an interview Monday that he would follow that path again in 2024 if Republicans were to retake control of the Senate and Biden sought to fill an opening on the Supreme Court.  "I don't think either party if it controlled, if it were different from the president, would confirm a Supreme Court nominee in the middle of an election," McConnell said on the Hugh Hewitt Show.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/senate-set-to-elevate-judge-on-joe-bidens-high-court-short-list/articleshow/83526964.cms||---

Pratapgarh-based Sulabh Srivastava was found dead just a day after he had written to ADG (Prayagraj) Prem Prakash that his life was under threat and sought protection. Times ViewIndia is ranked 142 among 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders’ 2021 report. The report also categorised India as “one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists trying to do their job properly.” This is why. The report had also noted that four Indian journalists were killed in connection with their work in 2020. This murder underlines the confidence with which the liquor mafia operates in the state. Authorities must take a portion of blame for the incident, especially since the deceased had earlier complained in writing to the police. Initially, the death was being treated as an accident case after some eyewitnesses told police that they saw Srivastava’s motorcycle hit a roadside pole and then ram into a hand pump before he hit the ground. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he succumbed. His wife stated that the crime was dressed up to make it look like a road accident. Police have now registered a case of murder. Read AlsoUP journalist death: Editors Guild slam police for 'cavalier' probeNEW DELHI: The Editors Guild of India has expressed shock at the 'cavalier manner' in which the Uttar Pradesh police is handling the case of TV journalist Sulabh Srivastava, who was found dead under mysterious circumstances. In a press statement issued on Monday, the guild alleged the UP Police hadThe incident saw opposition leaders including AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and TMC president Mamata Banerjee take to twitter to attack the Yogi Adityanath government. “The Editors Guild of India is shocked by the cavalier manner in which UP Police is treating the mysterious death of TV journalist, Sulabh Srivastava, in Pratapgrah. Srivastava believed that some people were following him. The authorities paid no heed to his fears,” the Editors Guild of India said. ADG: Received complaint a few hours agoHowever, the police lodged a case of murder after oSulabh’s wife in her complaint stated that he was receiving threats from a lcoal 'unidentified' liquor mafia whom he had exposed in his online stories in the recent past. Additional Director General of Police (ADG) Prayagraj Zone Prem Prakash said the threat angle would be thoroughly probed and action initiated accordingly. Prem Prakash admitted that Sulabh had sent him his complaint on WhatsApp about a threat from the liquor mafia a few hours before the incident -- at around 1:40 on Sunday afternoon — which he had forwarded to the SP for further action. He said Sulabh had met the SP thereafter and was satisfied with the assurance given to him by the officer. The incident saw opposition leaders including AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and TMC president Mamata Banerjee take to twitter to attack the government over the law and order situation in the state. The Editors Guild of India, too, issued a statement criticizing the UP Police for not taking Sulabh's complaint seriously. Reports said it was around 11 pm on Sunday when Sulabh was found lying by the roadside near a brick kiln in Sukhpal Nagar by some labourers unloading some material from the truck. One of the labourers told the police that he saw Sukhpal’s motorcycle first hitting a pole and then ramming into a hand pump. Sulabh suffered injuries on his forehead and mouth and was rushed to the hospital where he passed away. On the basis of the eye-witness account, the police initially summed up the incident as that of death in a road accident. What came as a twist in the tale was a letter that surfaced in the social media that Sulabh had addressed to ADG, Prayagraj Zone, and apparently written on Saturday in which he expressed apprehensions of a backlash from the local liquor mafia whom he had exposed in his online stories for his channel. In the letter he said he was being followed by some unknown individuals whenever he ventured out of his house and expressed concern about the security of his family and himself. Subsequently on Monday morning Sulabh’s wife Renuka also told the police that her husband was under stress because of the ‘threats’ and talked about the letter that he had sent to the ADG. “On Sunday night, Sulabh had gone to cover an illegal arms factory that was unearthed in a village in Lalganj police circle. At around 11 pm, I received the news about my husband’s accident. Later, he was declared dead at the hospital,” Renuka said. In her written complaint Sulabh’s wife cited the contents of same letter as a possible reason behind her husband’s death which she described as a murder. She also stated that the crime was dressed up in a manner to make it look like a road accident. On the basis of this complaint Kotwali police police lodged a murder case against unidentified accused. A team of senior police officials, including ADG (Prayagraj zone) Prem Prakash and SP (Pratapgarh) Akash Tomar, on Monday inspected the incident site and carried out investigations. Meanwhile Pratapgarh MP Sangam Lal Gupta has written a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath urging him to offer compensation to the kin of the deceased and government job to his wife. He also sought a detailed probe into the incident. On the other hand, AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi and SP national president Akhilesh Yadav took to Twitter to attack the government. Priyanka said liquor mafia is on a murder spree from Aligarh to Pratagarh and the government is silent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-journalist-found-dead-widow-sees-liquor-mafias-hand/articleshow/83527077.cms||---

Hours after AAP MP Sanjay Singh and ex-SP MLA Pawan Pandey alleged that the trust bought 12,000 sq m of land valued at Rs 2 crore for Rs 18.5 crore, trust general secretary Champat Rai pointed out that land prices in Ayodhya had increased manifold since the SC’s 2019 verdict in the Ram JanmabhoomiBabri Masjid title dispute. “The land’s present rate is almost Rs 5,000 per sq ft. So, for the 12000 square meters, its price is around Rs 60 crore,” another member said. In 2017, the land’s original owners — Kusum Pathak and Harish Kumar Pathak — had entered into an agreement with Sultan Ansari, Ravi Mohan Tewari and others to sell the plot for Rs 2 crore. Then, Rs 92 lakh was paid to the Pathaks.  On March 18 2021, the agreement was cancelled and a registry was executed between them, after which Ansari and Tewari became the owners. They sold the plot to the trust for Rs 18.5 crore. “After SC verdict, the price of land has increased over 20 times,” the member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ram-temple-trust-contests-charge-of-shady-land-deal/articleshow/83527289.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||World||Republican McConnell would block a Biden Supreme Court pick in 2024||WASHINGTON: US Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday that President Joe Biden would not get a Supreme Court nominee confirmed in 2024 if Republicans regain control of the chamber and a vacancy arises during that presidential election year. "It's highly unlikely. In fact, no, I don't think either party, if it were different from the president, would confirm a Supreme Court nominee in the middle of an election," McConnell told syndicated conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. McConnell could return as majority leader if Republicans regain control of the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections. While serving as majority leader, McConnell blocked Democratic former President Barack Obama from filling a vacancy left by the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016, saying it would be improper to confirm a Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election year. McConnell and his fellow Senate Republicans refused to consider Obama's nominee - Merrick Garland, who now serves as Biden's attorney general - in a move with little precedent in US history. That enabled Donald Trump, the winner of the November 2016 election, to appoint conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017. Democrats accused McConnell of hypocrisy last year when he allowed the Senate to confirm Trump's conservative Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett to replace liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in September about six weeks before the 2020 presidential election. Trump, a Republican, was defeated by Biden, a Democrat, in the election and Democrats also took control of the Senate. McConnell signaled that a Biden nominee could have problems even outside an election year. When Hewitt asked if a Republican-controlled Senate would give "a normal mainstream liberal" nominee a fair shot at a confirmation hearing if a vacancy opened in 2023, McConnell replied: "Well, we'd have to wait and see what happens." He described his decision to keep Scalia's seat open until after Trump was elected as "the single most consequential thing I've done in my time as majority leader of the Senate." McConnell made confirmation of Trump's conservative judicial nominees a high priority. Trump appointed three justices, also including Brett Kavanaugh, to the Supreme Court, which now has a 6-3 conservative majority. Democrats denounced McConnell's comments, with some even using them to solicit campaign donations. "He would change the rules a third time if he could to make sure they (Republicans) would get the choice for the next Supreme Court justice. He's not much for precedent and tradition when it doesn't serve him politically," said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, the chamber's No. 2 Democrat. Democratic Senator Ed Markey wrote on Twitter: "Mitch McConnell is already foreshadowing that he'll steal a 3rd Supreme Court seat if he gets the chance. He's done it before, and he'll do it again. We need to expand the Supreme Court." Some Democrats have proposed expanding the number of justices in order to end the Supreme Court's conservative majority. Some liberal activists have urged liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, at 82 the court's oldest member, to retire now while the Senate remains in Democratic hands. Biden during the election campaign vowed to name a Black woman to the court, which would be a historic first. The Senate was due later on Monday to vote on the confirmation of Washington-based US District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to an influential federal appellate court. Jackson, among the most prominent Black women in the federal judiciary, is considered a potential Supreme Court pick for Biden. The 100-seat Senate is currently split 50-50, with Democrats in control only because Vice President Kamala Harris wields a tie-breaking vote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/republican-mcconnell-would-block-a-biden-supreme-court-pick-in-2024/articleshow/83526926.cms||---
---||World||Thousands in Hungary protest anti-LGBT bills on eve of vote||BUDAPEST: Protesters and human rights officials urged lawmakers in Hungary on Monday to reject legislation banning any content portraying or promoting homosexuality or sex reassignment to anyone under 18.  Thousands of LGBT activists and others demonstrated in front of the Parliament in Budapest in the evening, chanting "we are here!" as they urged lawmakers to abandon plans for the bills.  "We have a lot to do before tomorrow's vote: We have to tell, we have to write to every member of Parliament, why this bill is anti-child, anti-family and anti-human," David Vig, director of Hungary's branch of Amnesty International, told those gathered. Fidesz, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's conservative ruling party, presented the legislation last week and plans to vote on the bills Tuesday. They include a measure aimed at fighting pedophilia along with other amendments prohibiting transmitting information about LGBT people or same-sex relationships to youth.  Fidesz describes the legislation as an effort to protect children from pedophilia.  But Lydia Gall, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said equating sexual and gender diversity with pedophilia hurt the dignity of LGBT people and risked putting them in danger.  Gall called the legislation "a cynical, distasteful and deliberate attempt by the Orban government to trample the rights of LGBT people and essentially make them invisible in Hungarian society."  Dunja Mijatovic, the commissioner for human rights at the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights body, asked Hungarian lawmakers to reject the legislation.  "I urge you to remain vigilant against such initiatives to push through measures that limit human rights or stigmatize ... some members of society," Mijatovic said in a statement Monday.  The Hungarian amendments would outlaw any depiction or discussion of different gender identity and sexual orientation in public, including in schools and the media.  Some human rights groups have compared the planned ban to a discriminatory 2013 Russian law banning so-called gay "propaganda," widely viewed as a tool of discrimination.  Mijatovic said such legislation reinforces prejudice against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. She also argued that international human rights groups have established that young people have a right to comprehensive sex education, which is not possible if there is a ban on any discussion of LGBT issues.  "The proposed legislative amendments run counter to international and European human rights standards. It is misleading and false to claim that they are being introduced to protect children," she said.  The legislation is expected to be approved, given that Fidesz has a majority.  The opposition in Hungary is divided on the matter.  The right-wing Jobbik party said Monday it plans to vote for the anti-pedophilia bill and amendments, despite what it said were some flaws, because it agrees that the "promotion" of gender change and "all kinds of sexual orientations" shouldn't be allowed in schools.  Other parties plan to boycott the vote. The center-left Democratic Coalition said it would boycott the entire Tuesday session to protest Fidesz's "hate-mongering" and "discriminatory politics."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/thousands-in-hungary-protest-anti-lgbt-bills-on-eve-of-vote/articleshow/83527577.cms||---
---||India||Citizenship to Afghanistan, Pakistan minorities not tied to CAA: Govt||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that its notification of May 28 delegating powers to collectors of some of districts to grant citizenship to members of the minority community from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh was not related to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and that such exercise had been done earlier too since 2006. Responding to the allegation of the Indian Union of Muslim League, which filed an application against the notification in a case pending in SC on the constitutional validity of CAA, the government said its notification is part of an administrative decision to decentralise the decision-making process for speedy disposal of citizenship applications and is not in any way related to CAA. “It is submitted that the notification seeks to merely delegate the power of the central government to the local authorities in particular cases. The said notification does not provide for any relaxations to the foreigners and applies only to foreigners who have entered the country legally. The central government used its authority under Section 16 of the Citizenship Act and delegated its powers to grant citizenship by registration or naturalisation to district collectors. It is submitted that it is merely an administrative delegation of power without any specific classification or relaxation,” said the Centre’s affidavit. By the notification, the Centre has delegated power to grant citizenship in such cases to the collectors of 13 more districts — Morbi, Rajkot, Patan and Vadodara in Gujarat; Jalore, Udaipur, Pali, Barmer and Sirohi in Rajasthan; Durg and Balodabazar in Chhattisgarh; Faridabad in Haryana; and Jalandhar in Punjab and to the home secretaries of Haryana and Punjab. Now, district collectors of 29 districts and home secretaries of 9 states can exercise such powers. “It is further submitted that the existing law and procedure for acquiring citizenship of India is in no way sought to be amended through the impugned notification,” the government said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/citizenship-to-afghanistan-pakistan-minorities-not-tied-to-caa-govt/articleshow/83527477.cms||---
---||Business||Retail inflation hits 6-month high, WPI at record 12.9%||NEW DELHI: Retail inflation jumped to a six-month high in May on the back of pricey food and fuel, while wholesale inflation during the month hit a fresh high of 12.9%, signalling the strengthening of price pressures in an economy battling to get growth back against the backdrop of a second Covid-19 surge. Data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Monday showed inflation as measured by the consumer price index rose to 6.3% in May, higher than the 4.2% recorded in April. The food price index was at 5%, above April’s 2%. Rural inflation continued to remain high at 6.5% while urban was at 6%. Retail inflation has breached the upper band of the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation target after remaining within the range for five months’ in a row. Core inflation, which is minus food and fuel, has shot up to a seven-year high. Oils and fats soared by 30.8% during May while eggs rose an annual 15.2%. Edible oil prices have been rising due to a host of factors, including global price increase, and has emerged as a concern for several households. The fuel and light component rose to a shade over 9-year high in May due to an increase in global prices and imposition of higher taxes at home. This has also led to higher transportation costs which economists said has also fed into higher prices in other segments. Some of the price increase has also been attributed to the supply restrictions due to the localised lockdowns. Separate data released earlier in the day by the department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade on Monday showed inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index, accelerated to an annual 12.9% in May, higher than the 10.5% in April and above the 3% deflation in May 2020. This was largely driven by higher fuel and power prices, which shot up to their highest level in the 2011-12 series and a low base effect as well as increase in global commodity prices. Prices of vegetables eased in May, but onion prices shot up 23.2%. Economists said the increase in onion prices could be due to logistical issues and higher demand. Inflation in the fuel and power segment soared to 37.6% and this could inch higher as due to high global crude oil prices and rebound in economic activity as the economy unlocks after the second wave cools down. “High CPI inflation will be a concern for RBI as it is higher than their estimate of 5%. Though the states policy is that growth is more important which means that repo rate will not be touched, it will be a nagging issue nevertheless especially if inflation remains in this region. We expect it to be around 5.5-6% in next couple of months,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings. “The higher WPI inflation can be attributed to low base effect as well as rise in global commodity prices. This will persist during the year. Therefore, we will be dealing with an economy where inflation is high and growth is getting moderated during the lockdown, which is not a very comfortable position to be in,” said Sabnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/retail-inflation-hits-6-month-high-wpi-at-record-12-9/articleshow/83527752.cms||---

The new U.S. president has urged his fellow NATO leaders to stand up to China's authoritarianism and growing military might, a change of focus for an alliance created to defend Europe from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The language in the summit's final communique, which will set the path for alliance policy, came a day after the Group of Seven (G7) rich nations issued a statement on human rights in China and Taiwan that Beijing said slandered its reputation. "China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to alliance security," NATO leaders said in the communique. Biden also told European allies that the alliance's mutual defence pact was a "sacred obligation" for the United States - a marked shift in tone from his predecessor, Trump, who had threatened to withdraw from the alliance and accused Europeans of contributing too little to their own defence. "I want all Europe to know that the United States is there," said Biden. "NATO is critically important to us." Biden stopped at the NATO headquarters' memorial to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by al Qaeda militants, when NATO triggered its Article 5 for the first and only time. Under the article, the alliance treats an attack on one member state as being an attack on all. Later at a news conference, Biden, who will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday in Geneva, said China and Russia were trying to split the transatlantic alliance and that, while he was not seeking conflict with Russia, NATO would respond if Moscow "continued its harmful activities". He described Putin as tough and bright. "Russia and China are both seeking to drive a wedge in our transatlantic solidarity," Biden said. He also pledged to support Ukraine in its conflict with Moscow, although he was non-committal on whether Kyiv could one day join NATO. "We are going to put Ukraine in a position that they will be able to maintain their physical security," Biden said, without giving more details. 'AMERICA IS BACK' While there are still differences in strategies on how to deal with China across the West, Biden said NATO was united under U.S. leadership. "America is back," he said, seeking to reassure Europeans that a Trump-like populist would not be back in the White House in four years. "The leadership of the (U.S.) Republican Party is fractured and the Trump wing of the party is the bulk of the party, but it makes up a significant minority of the American people". German Chancellor Angela Merkel, at her last summit of the alliance before she steps down in September, described Biden's arrival as the opening of a new chapter. She also said it was important to deal with China as a potential threat, while keeping it in perspective. "If you look at the cyber threats and the hybrid threats, if you look at the cooperation between Russia and China, you cannot simply ignore China," Merkel told reporters. "But one must not overrate it, either - we need to find the right balance." In NATO's glass and steel headquarters on the outskirts of Brussels, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said China's growing military presence from the Baltics to Africa meant nuclear-armed NATO had to be prepared. "China is coming closer to us. We see them in cyberspace, we see China in Africa, but we also see China investing heavily in our own critical infrastructure," he said, a reference to ports and telecoms networks. Stoltenberg also said the leaders had agreed to increase their contributions to the alliance's common budget. The vast bulk of military spending in NATO is handled separately by member countries. CHINA'S REPUTATION G7 nations meeting in Britain over the weekend scolded China over human rights in its Xinjiang region, called for Hong Kong to keep a high degree of autonomy and demanded a full investigation of the origins of the coronavirus in China. China's embassy in London said it was resolutely opposed to mentions of Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which it said distorted the facts and exposed the "sinister intentions of a few countries such as the United States". "China's reputation must not be slandered," the embassy said on Monday. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there were risks and rewards with Beijing. "I don't think anybody around the table wants to descend into a new Cold War with China," he said. From China's investments in European ports and plans to set up military bases in Africa to joint military exercises with Russia, NATO is now agreed that Beijing's rise deserves a strong response, although envoys said that would be multi-faceted. Allies are mindful of their economic links with China. Total German trade with China in 2020 was more than 212 billion euros ($257 billion), according to German government data. Total Chinese holdings of U.S. Treasuries as of March 2021 stood at $1.1 trillion, according to U.S. data, and total U.S. trade with China in 2020 was $559 billion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nato-adopts-tough-line-on-china-at-bidens-debut-summit-with-alliance/articleshow/83527895.cms||---

Defence minister Rajnath Singh and road transport minister Nitin Gadkari, along with BJP chief J P Nadda and general secretary in charge of organisation B L Santhosh, met Modi in the latest of the sessions he has held to gather suggestions on improvements needed in the functioning of the government and how to achieve synergy between the government and the organisation. Union ministers Sadananda Gowda and V K Singh were among others who joined the deliberations. The over five-hour interaction came in the wake of a similar marathon exercise on Friday featuring home minister Amit Shah, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Nadda and Santhosh. Although the party has maintained that such meetings were a regular affair and had attracted attention now only because physical meetings were happening after a long gap, they are seen as part of an exercise to seek views of top party leaders over crucial issues, including pandemic management and how different departments managed to perform when the country was hit by Covid-19 and restrictions were in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/modi-brainstorms-with-senior-ministers-for-second-time-in-4-days/articleshow/83527923.cms||---

While over 66.6% of the 2,513 elderly surveyed in household settings had at least received one dose of the vaccine, a significant 39.4% are yet to be vaccinated. Of those surveyed, 20.8% reported to have lost either their family members or friends due to Covid-19. When asked what could have been done to save their lives, almost half (50.8%) called for better health infrastructure, 44.4% said availability of vaccine and 38.7% said availability of medicines on time. A significant 77.5% elders were aware of Covid appropriate behaviour to avoid getting infected. These findings are part of the report “Silent Tormentor: Covid 19 & the Elderly” by HelpAge India that highlights a wide range of concerns on “World Elder Abuse Awareness Day’ observed every year on June 15. The survey was carried out between April and June across six cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore. 72.2% males and 27.8% females participated with about 85% of the respondents were in the age group 60– 69 years. Times ViewThe ill-treatment of the elderly by their own relatives and caregivers is both shameful and horrifying. The government as well as experts dealing with elderly care must come up with ways and means to ensure that such acts are minimized.However, the report expressed concern over misinformation about vaccination that most elders had. Nearly 61.2% of felt that they will be completely immune to the disease after taking the vaccination. “This not only will urge them to throw caution to the wind, but also put those around them susceptible to the virus if Covid appropriate behaviours are not followed,” the report stated. The data shows that over two-fifth (41.8%) of the respondents expressed lack of awareness about any vaccines developed to stop the spread of Covid-19 infection. Amongst those who are aware of the vaccine, the primary benefits reported include ‘being completely immune to Covid-19’ (61.2%) and ‘decrease in the severity of the disease’ (50.6%). Among the cities, some of the respondents saw no benefits in getting vaccinated (Delhi - 14.3% and Chennai – 13.1%). The report goes on to point that 62.1% elderlies felt that during Covid-19 pandemic the risk of getting abused has inthat most elders had. Nearly 61.2% of felt that they will be completely immune to the disease after taking the vaccination. “This not only will urge them to throw caution to the wind, but also put those around them susceptible to the virus if Covid appropriate behaviours are not followed,” the report stated. The report also highlights the loneliness even as families are in “work from home” mode. Despite living in close proximity, 20.5% elders living with members working or studying from home wanted someone to just be with them, and 35.7% elders wanted someone to just call them on phone and speak to them. Nearly, 13.7% felt trapped and frustrated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/silent-tormentor-covid-has-raised-risk-of-abuse-for-elderly-survey/articleshow/83528197.cms||Ambika Pandit

He is possibly the youngest person in Gujarat who will get 24x7 police protection. The baby, whose ragpicker parents live in a slum, was first abducted from Banaskantha by Jignesh and Asmita Bharti in April when he was just two days old. The childless couple made off with him from Gandhinagar Civil Hospital, following which police tracked them down and rescued the child within a week. He was again abducted by a childless couple from Banaswada on June 5. Accused Dinesh and Sudha Katara couldn’t conceive even after seven years of marriage. When Dinesh saw the mother keeping her child in a makeshift cradle on her bicycle while she collected waste, he came on his motorcycle and carried the child away. Police took around four days and analysed footage from over 700 CCTV cameras in Gandhinagar, Mehsana, Arvalli and Sabarkantha districts of Gujarat and Rajasthan’s Banswada district to track and rescue the child. Due to the twin kidnapping, police have decided tocreate a special point near the slums and deploy a team around the clock. Apart from this, cops are also thinking of giving his parents a permanent abode so the baby is not vulnerable to abductors. Inspector H P Jhala, Gandhinagar local crime branch, said, “We have been trying to find some decent jobs and a house for the boy’s parents so that they can live safely.” Detailing the arrangements being made, an officer said, “We will monitor the boy and his parents whether they are at home or work. The mother has been given the contact number of some officers so she can call for help in case there’s no policeman around her during an emergency.” Another police officer added, “We may extend similar protection to other vulnerable kids.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/abducted-twice-in-2-months-baby-gets-24x7-police-cover/articleshow/83528516.cms||Ashish Chauhan

In a tweet, Modi said, “Towards the end of your successful role as prime minister of Israel, I would like to express my deep appreciation for your leadership and pay special attention to the strategic relations between India and Israel.” Modi also congratulated Naftali Bennett who was sworn in as Israel’s new PM and said he looked forward to meeting him and deepening the strategic partnership between the two countries as they celebrate 30 years of upgrade of diplomatic ties next year. Foreign minister S Jaishankar congratulated the new Israeli foreign minister and alternate PM, Yair Lapid. “Congratulate APM and FM Yair Lapid of Israel on his appointment. Look forward to working closely together to further advance our multi-faceted strategic partnership.” In response, Lapid tweeted,I look forward to working together to advance the strategic relations between our countries and hope to welcome you to Israel soon.” He added that Israel-India “strategic relations” would be advanced under the new government. Lapid, the head of the Yesh Atid party, will become PM in the rotating arrangement in September 2023 under a power-sharing deal with Bennett, serving for two years till the end of the term. Modi and Netanyahu have been very close for some time. When Modi became PM in 2014, Netanyahu was one of the first world leaders who called him to congratulate. In 2017, Modi became the first Indian PM to visit Israel, a trip that was significant not only in foreign policy terms but also in terms of the personal friendship between the two leaders. Modi and Netanyahu spent three days together.  In these years, Israel has become not only one of India’s top defence and security partners but a top source for agriculture and water technology as well. In fact, it is the latter that Modi stressed in the past six years. Israel is assisting India with technological expertise in sectors that reach the average Indian farmer. Bennett took oath on Sunday after the Knesset (parliament) elected him as the 13th PM of Israel. The new government — a coalition of ideologically divergent political parties drawn from the right, the left and the centre, along with an Arab party — has a razor-thin majority in the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/modi-bids-farewell-to-bibi-congratulates-israels-new-pm/articleshow/83528568.cms||---

Underlining the country’s record on afforestation, he said, “In India, over the last 10 years, around 3 million hectares of forest cover has been added. This has enhanced the combined forest cover to almost one-fourth of the country’s total area.”  Calling for reduction of the pressure on land and its resources through joint efforts as “mankind’s collective responsibility”, PM Modi said, “Land degradation poses a special challenge to the developing world. A ‘Centre of Excellence’ is being set up in India to promote a scientific approach towards land degradation issues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-on-track-to-have-zero-land-degradation-by-2030-pm-modi/articleshow/83528591.cms||---
---||India||Centre moves to link database of land, assets to judicial grid||NEW DELHI: In what could provide a major boost in reducing the number of unresolved civil suits involving property disputes, the law ministry has asked all the high courts to clear pending permission required for state governments to link their land record and property registration database with the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG).  On integration of the property registration database of each state with the NJDG, the courts can directly refer to the actual registration records online instead of waiting for the evidence submitted by the plaintiffs which often takes several years. “All high courts have been requested by the department of justice to provide clearance to state governments to enable integration of NJDG and eCourts with land record and registration database,” justice department secretary Barun Mitra has said. Already eight states have received the necessary permission from their respective high courts and the integration process is in progress, he said. The linking of the proper ty registration database with the NJDG is also a step towards bettering India’s World Bank ranking on Ease of Doing Business to bring in more transparency in land-related disputes and fast-tracking commercial cases. Last year, the law ministry had held a meeting with representatives from eCommittee of Supreme Court and department of land resources and others to enable linkage of property registration with NJDG as part of improving the ease of doing business ecosystem. A working group was then constituted to work out a detailed action plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-moves-to-link-database-of-land-assets-to-judicial-grid/articleshow/83528610.cms||---
---||India||Single shot may suffice for adults already infected: Studies||NEW DELHI: A single dose of the Covid-19 vaccine could be sufficient for adults who have already been infected with the virus, two recent studies in India suggest. The WHO and the Union ministry of health and family welfare have recommended getting both shots of double-dose vaccines, but authors of the studies said their findings could help promote “judicious” use of vaccines and larger population coverage.  The first study was conducted by researchers at the AIG Hospital, a tertiary care facility in Hyderabad, results of which were published in ‘The International Journal of Infectious Diseases’ in May. They enrolled 280 healthcare workers vaccinated between January 16 and February 5. They were divided into two groups — those who had been infected with Covid-19 (131) and those who hadn’t (149). All of them were vaccinated with two doses of Covishield, 28 days apart, going by government guidelines in place then. Blood samples were taken at the beginning and at the end of the study, and tested for two things — antibodies and memory cells (immune cells which can recognise a foreign particle encountered previously).  “At the end of four weeks, we found the Covid-19 group had developed 1,000 units of antibodies, 10 times that generated in the non-Covid-19 group,” said Dr D Nageshwar Reddy, a co-author of the study and chairperson of AIG Hospital. As for the memory cells — called T-cells and B-cells, which form a major part of our immune response — they found better response in the Covid-19 group. “There are two types of T-cells, Cd4 and Cd8. Response of both was three times higher in the Covid-19 group than the other,” he added. On that basis, he further said, “Our suggestion is to just take just one dose.” The other study was conducted by the Banaras Hindu University in April, which has been accepted for publication in ‘Science Immunology’. Prof Gyaneshwar Chaubey from the department of zoology headed the study, conducted on a smaller scale of 20 people, half of whom had been infected and half hadn’t. Both groups were administered one dose of Covishield and their antibodies were checked every week, for a month. “The group which had Covid-19 earlier developed antibodies in the first and second week, in a high and robust amount. In the other group, 90% of the participants developed antibodies but only in the third and fourth weeks. The remaining 10% didn’t develop any antibodies even after 10 weeks,” said Chaubey. In this study, researchers found, those who had been exposed to the virus earlier developed double the antibodies (400 titers) than those who hadn’t (200 titers). “Considering the vaccine shortage, the study could lead to wider vaccine coverage in a shorter time,” Chaubey said. But doctors advised caution. “Sufficient antibody generation after single dose vaccine in previously Covid-afflicted patients comes as no surprise. Indeed, the infection itself is about equivalent to one dose of vaccine. However, long term data are required to gauge durability of antibody response in these patients,” said Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology. “I have patients who have had both the doses and still got infection. I sincerely recommend two doses of vaccine,” said Dr Pritam Moon, internal medicine specialist, Wockhardt Mira Road, Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/single-shot-may-suffice-for-adults-already-infected-studies/articleshow/83528541.cms||Shobita Dhar
---||Patna||Revenue of places of worship hit||PATNA: The second wave of Covid pandemic has taken a toll on places of worship. The revenue of religious places has fallen by at least 98% due to Covid-induced lockdown, making it difficult for them to pay salaries to employees. The livelihood of priests and staff at the shrines has been affected. Patna’s Mahavir Temple has borrowed Rs 5 crore from bank against its fixed deposit with 1% higher interest to pay salaries to its 800 employees. Acharya Kishore Kunal, secretary of Mahavir Mandir Trust, said they have borrowed the money from the bank against the FD to carry on construction of Viraat Ramayan Mandir at Kesariya in West Champaran. “Around Rs 3 crore was utilised to pay the salaries to the employees at Mahavir Cancer Sansthan and the remaining Rs 2 crore was spent on paying wages to staff of Mahavir Mandir, Mahavir Arogya Sansthan, Mahavir Netralaya, Mahavir Heart Hospital and some other hospitals in Begusarai and Muzaffarpur. The average revenue of temple was about Rs 5 lakh per day from charity, rituals, havan, prayer and sale of the offerings of Naivedyam ladoo. But, due to the closure of the temple for several months in the last one-and-a-half-year, the deposits have been exhausted,” Kunal said. He added, “We are expecting that the religious places would open for people from next month.” Maulana Shibli Al Quasmi, general secretary of Imarat-e-Shariah, a Islamic religious body, which has its jurisdiction over Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha, said they are hardly getting any donation or charity to pay salaries to staff of mosques, madarssas and other minority schools. “We have exhausted our savings and every month we have to struggle a lot to pay salaries to our employees,” he added. Fr Prem Prakash SJ, Vicar General of Patna Archdiocese, said they are paying only 50% wage to priests and employees of the churches. “As the religious places are shut, we are not able to get revenue through charities. Hence, we have cut the salaries of our staff. As far as schools are concerned, we are only paying 50% salary to our teaching and non-teaching employees in Patna,” he said. He added, “Around 50-60% students are able to pay the school fees amid the lockdown in Patna. In other districts, we hardly get any school fee. Hence, we could not pay our staff for two months. In remote areas, online classes are not fruitful.” Patna Archdiocese manages 35 churches and 20 schools, including 13 English and seven Hindi-medium schools in the state. Daljeet Singh, superintendent of Takhat Sri Harmandir Ji Prabandhak Committee, said they have not faced any difficulty in paying salaries to their 400 staff. “We are able to generate revenue through online ‘Akhaand Path’ and ‘sangat’ across the country and abroad. Donations are also being received through digital mode. “The priests encourage the devotees for Dasvandh in which a devotee donates 10% of his/her income to the gurdwara in the form of seva. In this way, we are able to generate revenue to pay wages to our staff. We have to pay Rs 40-45 lakh per month to our employees,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/revenue-of-places-of-worship-hit/articleshow/83520262.cms||Faryal Rumi

The minister’s assurance came after a delegation of farmers of Nanegaon village in Sinnar taluka visited Bhujbal and made their case. “The issue of farmland is most dear to the farmers. But in cases like linear alignment, there is not much that can be done other than provide good compensation. The farmers will get five times the value of the land they lose as compensation for their willing cooperation,” said the minister. The 235km proposed Pune-Nashik Semi High-Speed Rail corridor project will be passing through Sinnar and Nashik talukas of Nashik district. The Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (MRIDCL)-MahaRail has announced land acquisition through private negotiations and the rate would be declared by the district administration after a detailed study. The farmers were skeptical about the compensation for the “very small pieces of land’ that would be left redundant after a major portion is acquisitioned for the railway project. They have demanded that such small pieces of land also be compensated for. They also want justified compensation for the wells, trees, grape plantations, sugar cane, onion and other cash crops that are the only source of income for the families. They also demanded that an arrangement be made so that the farmers do not have to seek permissions in future to lay pipelines across the tracks connecting the farms and water sources. The farmers also want one person from each family to get employment in the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/farmers-assured-5-times-the-value-of-land-acquired/articleshow/83517128.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Besides generating green power, the barrage of the plant will also provide alternative route to cross the river. Speaking on the occasion, Union minister Singh described the signing of the MoU as a “historic moment,” adding that the Dagmara multipurpose hydel power plant marks the lesser dependence of the country on the fossil fuel. The power plant twill also provide direct and indirect employment to people of the state. For his part, state energy minister Yadav said the Dagmara plant will open a set of new opportunities for people in the Kosi region. “Kosi river has been known as the ‘sorrow of Bihar’, but the completion of the project will convert the Kosi region into an area of opportunities,” he added. Yadav also extended congratulations on behalf of CM Nitish Kumar to those present and people of the state. Further, additional chief secretary of state health department, Pratyaya Amrit, who had played a big role in bringing the NHPC and BSHPC on one page for the establishment of the hydel power plant at Dagmara, said it will also open way for fisheries, besides providing recreational facilities through ecotourism. State energy secretary Sanjeev Hans had earlier presented details of the project. Others present on the occasion included Union power secretary Alok Kumar, NHPC chairman-cum-MD A K Singh, additional power secretary S K G Rahate and joint secretary Tanmay Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nhpc-to-establish-dagmara-hydel-power-plant-in-supaul/articleshow/83520633.cms||Abhay Singh

ECR GM L C Trivedi held a high-level monsoon safety meeting with senior officials of the headquarters on Monday. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, directives have been issued in each division to keep a close watch at all vulnerable places during monsoon. “Under the safety plan envisaged, railway safety employees have been directed to maintain a close vigil at major rail bridges and on vulnerable tracks. The measures also aim at keeping railway tracks and bridges in proper condition during monsoon,” he said. "Railways has identified vulnerable places in the ECR. During monsoon, railway signalling system often goes haywire causing disruption in the smooth running of passenger trains on different sections of the divisions. Railways has set up a direct maintenance team comprising officials and staff from signal cum telecom and engineering department to keep visiting big and small stations and repair faults either in the signalling system or tracks during monsoon,” he said. “Branches of the tress always cause hindrance to loco pilots to sight signal lights during monsoon. Railways has also trimmed branches of trees located along the railway tracks. Railways had faced a tough challenge recently when several trees fell on the tracks due to the ‘Cyclone Yas’,” the CPRO said . Safety staff have been imparted special training to deal with any emergency situation during monsoon. Railways has introduced track patrolling, particularly at major bridges like Koelwar, Kiul, Mokama and Kosi. Small bridges, which have been identified as vulnerable, are under constant surveillance, he said, adding railways is in touch with the state disaster management department and MET offices to get information about weather condition in advance. According to the CPRO, railways is more alert at those places where soil subsidence is most likely to occur during heavy rains. A team of track safety staff has been asked to remain vigilant at such places and keep sand bags of boulders in readiness to meet any emergency situation, he said, adding railways has installed water measuring devices at each major rail bridge to get signal in advance about rising water level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/adopt-monsoon-safety-measures-railway-staff-told/articleshow/83520639.cms||Kumod Verma

The initiative includes localised farming activities, such as ‘nutritional gardens’ akin to ‘kutir udyog’ to overcome nutritional deficiency of protein and micronutrients through diversification of food intakes. BAU vice-chancellor Dr Ravindra Kumar Sohane said the initiative has been implemented by the Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) under BAU in several districts of the region. “Strong linkages were established between respective KVKs and anganwadi centres to create awareness on the perils of malnutrition and ways to overcome nutritional deficiencies among children and pregnant and lactating women in rural areas,” the VC said. “In order to achieve the objectives, we are trying to promote ‘nutri gardens’ under anganwadi centres for growing mushrooms, green leafy vegetables, localised fruits and roots like beat, carrots and radish that are rich in protein and vitamins with an aim to ensure intake of diversified food items in the diets of rural women and children,” Dr Sohane added. “As growing of mushrooms is easy and less costly, the AKAT module has focused on growing of mushrooms through nutri gardens and elsewhere besides provided technical knowhow to preserve mushrooms for a longer period at the respective homes in rural areas,” the VC said. Malnutrition and anaemia have been primarily responsible for stunted growth of 38% children in India. “At least 35% children are underweight and nearly 70% anaemic in rural areas. Similarly, 25% of women of reproductive age in India are undernourished and nearly 63% anaemic, who give birth to malnourished children,” said a BAU scientist quoting National Family Health Survey-5 of the year 2019-2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bau-bid-to-provide-nutritional-support-to-rural-kids-women/articleshow/83520705.cms||Kumar Rajesh

Sebi said that although the six funds were sold as having different investment strategies, they were actually managed almost with a similar high-risk investment approach. The fines relate to FTMF’s six debt schemes which are under a winding-up process since April 2020. In a related matter, Sebi also imposed a fine of Rs 45 lakh on Venkata Radhakrishnan, a director with the fund house and Rs 5 lakh on his wife, Malathi Radhakrishnan, for redeeming his investments ahead of the announcement of the closure using private information. The regulator further imposed a fine of Rs 25 lakh on Jayaram S Iyer, also a director at the fund house, for exactly the same fault as Radhakrishnans. In another related order, Sebi imposed a fine of Rs 5 crore on Mywish Marketplaces, a little known startup that had taken a $15-million loan from FTMF. The company has also been fined for redeeming its investments with one of the under-closure debt schemes just ahead of the announcement of winding up, using private information. Along with Sapre and Kamat, Sebi also imposed a penalty of Rs 1.5 crore each on Kunal Agarwal, Sumit Gupta, Pallab Roy, Sachin Padwal Desai and Umesh Sharma. These people were the fund managers at the time of violation, and Rs 50 lakh on Saurabh Gangrade, who was the chief compliance officer at that time. All were fined because of non-adherence to regulatory requirements about how funds with differentiated objectives should also be managed differently, Sebi order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-fines-franklin-mf-head-fund-managers-rs-15cr/articleshow/83525138.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The governor cleared the names of Thota Trimurthulu, Koyye Moshen Raju, Lella Appireddy and R V Ramesh Yadav for appointment as MLCs. The decision comes after chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy called on the governor at Raj Bhavan. There had been speculation among some YSRC functionaries that the governor had raised objections to certain candidates, reportedly in view of pending criminal cases against them. The governor is believed to have sought additional information about the candidates. However, YSRC sources said the governor had not raised any objection to its proposal. The sources also said the chief minister’s meeting with the governor was not connected to the MLC issue. Among the candidates is party general secretary (state office affairs), Lella Appireddy, who has been with Jagan since he floated the YSRC. Similarly, Moshen Raju has been with the party for years. Former legislator Thota Trimurthulu got the chance within a year of joining the party as he was considered a strong leader in East Godavari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/governor-gives-nod-to-nomination-of-4-mlcs/articleshow/83521112.cms||Samdani MN

District revenue authorities on Sunday recovered 49.5 acres of lands valued at Rs 791 crore in Gajuwaka limits on the outskirts of Vizag, which were allegedly encroached on by former TDP MLA Palla Srinivasa Rao. The former MLA has now thrown a challenge, claiming he will quit politics if it is proved that he encroached on the lands. Tourism minister M Srinivasa Rao had in turn alleged that TDP leaders grabbed Rs 4,000 crore worth of 430 acres of lands in the district. Palla Srinivasa Rao added that allegations amount to vengeance as he did not switch parties and raise his voice and protest against the privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. “I have lands in Yadava Jaggarajupeta not in Kapu Jaggarajupeta. They are linking lands to which I have no connection with my name. They should prove their claims,” he said.

The report has proposed a uniform definition for microfinance loans for banks, MFIs, and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), and said that lending to a household should be capped in relation to its income. Other proposals include doing away with pre-payment penalty and collaterals for loans to households with annual income of Rs 1.25 lakh and Rs 2 lakh for rural and urban areas, respectively. If the recommendations are accepted, lenders will have to disclose pricing in a standard simplified fact sheet. “In having a common definition of microfinance loans for all regulated entities, it will ensure a level playing field, making it entity-agnostic as done by MFIN as part of its voluntary Code of Responsible Lending (CRL). The focus on responsibility on boards promoting good governance and sound operational policies is a welcome step,” said Alok Mishra, CEO and director of MFIN — an association of micro lenders. “The suggested framework in the consultative document is intended to be made applicable to the microfinance loans provided by all entities regulated by the RBI and is aimed at protecting borrowers from over-indebtedness as well as enabling competitive forces to bring down the interest rates by empowering the borrowers to make an informed decision,” the RBI said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-seeks-same-micro-fin-rules-for-banks-nbfcs/articleshow/83525321.cms||---

The bank has begun the process of vacating 10 floors of its rented premises in Indiabulls Finance Centre and shifting to the new premises, which is now called Yes Bank House. “We are vacating the premises floor by floor and the complete transition will happen over a period of two months,” said Yes Bank MD & CEO Prashant Kumar. He said that every month the bank will bring down its rental costs. Last week, the bank’s board of directors approved the shifting of the registered office within the local limits of the city. Yes Bank had acquired the Santacruz premises from Anil Ambani’s Reliance Infrastructure with the Rs 1,200-crore valuation being used to repay Reliance’s debt. Reliance Infrastructure has also decided to convert its dues from its energy arm Reliance Power into equity, thereby hiking stake in the firm. Shares of Reliance Power rose 5% following the announcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/yes-bank-shifts-to-new-santacruz-hq/articleshow/83525205.cms||---

The three Mauritius-based foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) — Albula Investments, APMS Investment and Cresta Fund — together had about Rs 43,000 crore worth of holdings in six companies belonging to the Ahmedabad-based group, run by billionaire investor Gautam Adani. There are at least six FPIs with large exposure in Adani Group stocks. According to disclosures on the BSE, one of the six, Cresta Fund, holds nearly 3% in Adani Enterprises, which was worth about Rs 5,000 crore as of Friday, while Albula’s 2.1% stake was worth about Rs 3,700 crore. Early on Monday, the stock was down 25% but recovered in late trades after the company clarified that the accounts of the FPIs were still active. The stock finally closed at Rs 1,501, down 6.3% on the day. The prices of other five stocks also showed a similar pattern with some of the group stocks closing at the 5% lower circuit level. The other FPIs with large exposure in the group’s stocks were Albula Investment Fund, APMS Investment, Asia Investment Corp, Elara India Opportunities Fund, LTS Investment Fund and Vespera Fund, shareholding disclosures on both the BSE and the NSE showed. In Adani Enterprises, while the promoters hold 74.9%, just a tad below the regulatory upper limit of 75%, these six FPIs together held 20.5% of the company, while mutual funds hold just 0.7%. Small investors hold 2.4%. A similar trend of high FPI concentration is observed in other group companies. Usually a demat account is frozen due to a regulatory order against the holder of the account, non-disclosure of information demanded by the bourses, depositories or some other domestic or international legal issues. Investors on the Street interpreted the freezing of the account as some regulatory issues relating to these FPIs and hence the strong selling in these stocks, dealers and market players said. According to market sources, the freezing of the accounts was because of a Sebi regulatory order of 2016 relating to depository receipts (DRs). This particular order does not in any way hamper the FPIs’ regular investments in India and hence the fear was unfounded, they said. Dealers also said that with the positions of these FPIs now clear, the Adani Group stocks are expected to make a recovery on the bourses on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/large-holding-by-three-fpis-in-adani-cos-made-mkts-jittery/articleshow/83525127.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Got 54,000 vials to treat mucormycosis since April 1: Gujarat govt to HC||AHMEDABAD: The state government on Monday informed the Gujarat high court that it received 54,411 vials of liposomal amphotericin B for treatment of mucormycosis (MM or black fungus) since April 1 and it has distributed as many as 37,494 to various hospitals. In an affidavit, the state health department stated that 16,917 vials are still in stock with the Gujarat Medical Services Corporation Limited. The government furnished details about distribution of the medicine after the argument during the last hearing of the suo motu PIL on Covid-19 that there is a shortage of medicines to treat the black fungus disease and the Centre had centralized its distribution. The high court asked the state government to bring in more transparency in its distribution policy for amphotericin B injections. The government told the HC that it has notified a hospital in each of the 33 districts for supply of the injections for black fungus treatment. It cited a government resolution issued on June 10 in this regard. The government has said that each of the 33 hospitals have a district-level committee of experts to decide on distribution of injections to hospitals treating mucormycosis patients. The committee is to be headed by the medical superintendent of the hospital and will have experts from the departments of medicine, ENT, ophthalmology, neurosurgery, and nephrology. The committee will scrutinize requests from private hospitals for allocation of injections. Apart from management of the black fungus disease, the state government has claimed that to deal with a possible third wave of Covid-19 cases, it is in the process of undertaking measures such a establishing more healthcare institutions and oxygen plants as part of its preparedness plan. It said that this war can be won by increasing the focus on vaccination. It has vaccinated 2.02 crore people so far, and has got 5,07,690 doses of Covishield and 1,07,710 of Covaxin. The state government also claimed that it has “improved its performance on the health front tremendously over the years. This has been made possible due to the extensive healthcare delivery network in the rural areas as well as various programmes being run by the state health department”. The state government cited the CM Setu scheme under which 309 private medical practitioners have been appointed and it claimed to have initiated various measures to address the shortage of doctors at government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/got-54k-vials-to-treat-mm-since-april-1-govt-to-hc/articleshow/83524616.cms||---
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Around 20,000 kids below 10 vulnerable in case of third wave||KOCHI: Around 20,000 children below 10 years of age are likely to be infected with Covid, if a third wave hits Ernakulam. District health officials will submit a report in this regard to the district administration on Tuesday. Of the total 3,31,329 Covid-positive cases reported in the district so far, 16% are below 20 years old. Health authorities expect that around 200-300 cases of 20,000 children might develop post-Covid complications. “We need to concentrate on the ones below 10 years of age. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome will affect only 1-2% of them, only if the third wave hits us. About 16% of the total positive cases reported in Ernakulam so far are below 20 years old. As per the current situation, no such third wave is likely to come up. However, if the virus strain mutates again, another wave is likely to hit us. If 20,000 cases are reported, we have three facilities— Kalamassery medical college, Ernakulam general hospital and Aluva district hospital — equipped with pediatric ICUs. Besides, private hospitals also have facilities,” said a district health official. Authorities expect a gap of three to four months in reporting 200-400 post-Covid complications. Though schools are not opening this academic year, children are likely to contract the infection from others who step out of the houses. Authorities expect the third wave by October-November, if it happens. Experts opine that the impact of third wave, if it happens, will depend on various factors — vaccination, mingling of people, mutation of the virus and how people abide by Covid protocols. The proportion of children to be infected by Covid in the third wave will be high as their vaccination has not started yet. Chances are less of a third wave, which is severe and infecting only children. The solution is fast-track vaccination, which is currently at a slow pace, say experts. “People should also abide by Covid protocols to prevent the onslaught of the third wave. It cannot be predicted when it will affect us. But we need to prepare for it,” says Dr D Padmanabha Shenoy, who is monitoring the progress of infections. Meanwhile, the surveillance report, submitted to the district administration on Sunday shows that three children below 10 years are under ICU care in Ernakulam and seven between the age group of 11-20 years. Meanwhile, case fatality rate of people aged above 80 years touched 3.84% in the district, as per the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/around-20000-kids-below-10-vulnerable-in-case-of-3rd-wave/articleshow/83522275.cms||T C Sreemol

Under this stretch, Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation Limited (UPMRC) has started the ‘Building Condition Survey’ to acknowledge the current structural status of the buildings, which come under the vicinity of about 50 meters on both the sides of the proposed Metro tunnel. In the second phase of the project, major construction work would be carried out underground between Chunniganj and Transport Nagar. Between these two ends, seven underground stations would be made. And a total of 12 stations will be constructed between Chunniganj and Naubasta in South city, a 14 km long stretch. Out of 12, seven would be underground and remaining would be elevated. In the survey carried out by Metro engineers on Monday, old, multi-floored and buildings with basement were identified and examined. Strength and resistivity of any building found weak is enhanced in advance and also information about privately dug bore-wells is collected and if needed, they are shifted. Repairing and shifting works will be done with the consent of the owner of the building and the cost will be borne by UPMRC. During the construction of the Metro Tunnel, real time monitoring will be done of the surveyed buildings in the vicinity of 50 meters sideways on both sides of the tunnel up to a distance of 10 meters in the direction of movement of the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM). The building owners are being informed about the purpose of the survey and it is also being ensured that all the surveyors must have the authorization letter. At present the construction of priority corridor between IIT-Kanpur and Motijheel is being done. Managing director, UPMRC, Kumar Keshav, during inspection of metro yard at government polytechnic, had said that the trial of Kanpur Metro will be carried out in November and also that the metro coaches are being constructed in Savli in Gujarat. Tracks have been constructed while system installation depot will done next month and system installation at metro stations has commenced. With the fast pace of the project, the city denizens may likely get a chance of metro ride in January next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/upmrc-begins-condition-survey-of-bldgs-in-50m-vicinity-of-metro-tunnel/articleshow/83524265.cms||---

The cumulative fatality rate of mucormycosis is 13.5% while the recovery rate stood at 17.7% as more than 100 patients have been discharged from the health facilities so far. As per the data shared by the state health department, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna has registered maximum 175 cases of black fungal infection, followed by AIIMS-Patna (140), private hospitals (115), PMCH (77), Nalanda Medical College and Hospital-Patna (18) and Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital, Bhagalpur (19). As far as the fatalities due to mucor infection are concerned, 27 deaths have been reported from IGIMS, 19 in private hospitals, 15 at AIIMS-Patna, six at PMCH, four at JNMCH and one at NMCH. Mucormycosis, a rare fungal infection, is being reported in patients getting treatment for Covid and in some cases after recovery from the coronavirus complications. The infection rate is high among diabetic or immunocompromised patients. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna, said the number of mucor patients admitted there so far had crossed 150. While 18 of them died, 32 recovered and were discharged. “As many as 102 patients are undergoing treatment, of which 60 have gone through surgery. The mortality rate in mucor patients is high due to severity of the infection. There might be unreported deaths of black fungus as well, because some of the severe patients have taken the option of LAMA (left against medical advice), who have very little chances of survival. Almost 12 to 15 such patients have taken LAMA,” he said. “The doctors have done evisceration in ten patients, including a few cases of exenteration (complete removal of eye leaving a hollow). Neurosurgery was also done in a few cases in which the infection travelled to the brain. Maxilla bone was removed in most of the cases to stop the spread of mucor. There were less than 10 cases of removal of mandible bone,” Dr Sanjeev said. The doctors at AIIMS-Patna OPD claimed that more than 30 mucor patients come for admission per day but due to shortage of drugs and beds, only 5-6 are admitted. The increase in their numbers is partly due to the severe shortage of the key drug - Amphotericin B. Minimum 50-60 vials of the injection are required to treat a mucor patient. Dr Krishna Gopal, assistant professor, general surgery, at IGIMS said the hospital received around 700 vials of Amphotericin B injection on Saturday, which were already administered to the patients. “We have not got the fresh stock yet. The non-availability of drug led to delay in the treatment of mucor patients as each one needs six vials per day,” he said. Paras HMRI regional director (east) Dr Talat Halim said 3 mucor patients were undergoing treatment. He said 24 such patients were admitted there so far and four of them died as the infection had travelled to their brain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/black-fungus-claims-76-lives-in-bihar/articleshow/83520207.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||BJP blames Chirag Paswan for split in LJP, hints at berth for Pashupati Kumar Paras in cabinet||PATNA: The BJP on Monday denied its role in engineering the split in the LJP parliamentary party saying it was its “internal matter”. However, it held the erstwhile LJP president Chirag Paswan solely responsible for the new development in his party. At the same time, BJP strongly hinted that the Lok Sabha MP from Hajipur and new chief of the LJP parliamentary group, Pashupati Kumar Paras, could be inducted into the Union cabinet by PM Narendra Modi during the cabinet reshuffle to fill the berth that otherwise had fallen vacant last year due to the death of LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan. “Who all will be inducted into the Union cabinet is the prerogative of the PM, but during the 2019 parliamentary elections, LJP was part of the NDA. Its president Ram Vilas Paswan was in the Union cabinet by virtue of that,” state BJP spokesman Prem Ranjan Patel said on Monday. “Paras could be made Union minister to fill the berth vacated following the death of Ram Vilas, since he is the true inheritor of his elder brother. Paras took care of the party and its workers in Bihar. Ram Vilas ji handled national politics,” Patel added. He also said Jamui MP Chirag had annoyed the party’s rank and file last year during the state’s assembly elections, when he fielded his party’s candidates against the NDA partners, mainly JD(U), and on a few seats even against BJP. “The LJP rank and file wanted their party to remain in the NDA. Therefore, they felt cheated and were annoyed with Chirag for his decision,” Patel said. Seemingly, the BJP appeared to be satisfied with the new developments in the LJP, leading to the eventual isolation of Chirag amounting to his being in political wilderness in the state and even on the national panorama. “Who becomes the new LJP president is the concern of the new parliamentary party head. The role of Paras ji is to supervise the affairs of his party, keep the Ram Vilas Paswan’s family united and also rebuild the party again,” Patel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-hints-at-berth-for-pashupati-kumar-paras-in-union-cabinet/articleshow/83520552.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Chirag reaped what he sowed: JD(U) chief||PATNA: JD(U) national president RCP Singh on Monday said Jamui MP Chirag Paswan has reaped what he had actually sown. Reacting over the split in the LJP, Singh also said all the five MPs revolted against party president Chirag mainly because of his autocratic behaviour with senior leaders. “Getting a plum post without any hard work and digesting the gravity of the post are two different things,” he said. All six LJP MPs hail from Bihar. Five of them -- Chirag’s uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras, his cousin Prince Raj, Choudhary Mehboob Ali Kaisar, Chandan Kumar and Veena Devi — revolted against Chirag on Sunday and declared Paras as their parliamentary party leader. “There is a popular adage that as you sow, so you reap. The LJP under the leadership of its founder Ram Vilas Paswan had a perfect coordination with the NDA. Because of this coordination, the NDA won 39 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar in 2019. But during the 2020 assembly polls, the LJP was being headed by Chirag. What a bad strategy he worked up for assembly polls. It ultimately damaged the NDA in the 2020 polls,” Singh, who is also the JD(U) leader in the Rajya Sabha, told reporters here. During the last assembly polls, Chirag had opened a direct front against CM Nitish Kumar, fielding LJP candidates against all JD(U) nominees, many of them rebels from the BJP. Chirag had then openly said his priority was to remove Nitish from the power and he wanted to help the BJP form its own government in the state. RCP said the five LJP MPs were uneasy due to bad behaviour of their party chief and charted their own course, finally. He also said Chirag was ‘too young’ to keep his flock together because of his style of functioning. When asked whether he would welcome Paras and other LJP MPs if they wish to join JD(U), Singh said, “Paras was earlier a part of the NDA and he was a respectable minister in the NDA government in Bihar. It is up to him whether he comes with us, remains in LJP or comes with our ally BJP. It has to be decided by Paras. We will welcome any of his decisions.” On being asked whether some RJD legislators were in contact with JD(U), Singh said, “I remain in contact with only the NDA leaders.” On being specifically asked whether some RJD legislators were willing to join JD(U), Singh said, “If someone is disappointed somewhere and wants to take a decision, what can we do in such a scenario. If any such case comes up before us, we will decide. Right now, our main focus is to strengthen our organization.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-reaped-what-he-sowed-jdu-chief/articleshow/83519417.cms||Madan Kumar

Earlier, the criminals had looted Rs30 lakh in Purnia on Sunday night. In the first incident, three criminals looted Rs10.94 lakh from two employees of a petrol pump near Jamunia Mor under Pipra police station area in East Champaran on Monday. The incident took place around 10.30am when Sandip Kumar and Ram Pravesh Kumar were on way to the Chintamanpur branch of the State Bank of India (SBI) on a motorbike to deposit the cash. East Champaran SP Naveen Chandra Jha, who visited the spot, said a special investigation team (SIT) has been set up under the leadership of Sadar SDPO to crack the case at the earliest. “Raids were on to arrest the robbers,” he said. In the second incident, armed criminals took away Rs10 lakh belonging to a private courier company located at Gola Bazar after holding an employee, Ravi Kumar, captive at gunpoint around 10am under Sonepur police station in Saran district on Monday. Earlier, on Sunday, unidentified miscreants looted Rs30 lakh from the office of a courier company under Maranga police station in Purnia district. Purnia Sadar SDPO Anand Pandey said five criminals barged into the office of the courier company and collected cash after holding the cashier Pankaj Kumar captive at gunpoint. The SDPO expressed surprise over the office remaining open till 10pm in violation of the Covid-19 restrictions. SHO Rajiv Azad, however, claimed that the CCTV installed at the office was non-operational due to some technical snags. Pandey said some important clues in the incident have been gathered and raids were on to nab the culprits. Earlier, Rs1.19 crore was looted from Jadhua branch of HDFC Bank near Hajipur in Vaishali district on June 10. The police have failed to make any breakthrough in the case till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs20-lakh-looted-in-two-separate-incidents-in-saran-champaran/articleshow/83520553.cms||Ramashankar

The order, signed by Ravikumar Duraisamy and H P Chaturvedi, has given the committee of creditors of DHFL two weeks to consider a redistribution of funds that they will receive from the Piramal Group to small investors. The court has also appointed Ashok Kacker, former executive director of Sebi and ex-director of Indiabulls Asset Management, as an observer-cum-permanent invitee in a seven-member group that will have management and control of DHFL until the implementation date. The other six members include three representatives from the lenders, two from the Piramal Group and the administrator. Lenders are not bound to make a payment that is more than what they are required to in terms of the resolution plan. The court has said that it does not expect the bidder to up his offer, but has asked the creditors to meet and consider a higher payout for small investors. These include public depositors, fixed deposit holders, NCD holders, small investors, Employees Provident Fund Trust, and Army Group Insurance Fund. “We are of the considered view that they should get a fair, increased share money out of the resolution plan,” the order said. It also said that in respect of the Army fund, lenders should consider paying the full admitted claim. According to lenders, the law is very clear on the distribution of the realisation from the resolution plan. The money that they are realising from the sale of DHFL is only a fraction of their dues and their funds are public money. They fear that allowing additional payment outside what is permissible under the law could set the precedent for future claims by small creditors and could undermine the insolvency process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dhfl-lenders-to-decide-payout-for-small-investors/articleshow/83525242.cms||---

The court said there is no need for further searches and refused to grant permission. The ACB had filed the petition after completing their interrogation of Narendra last week. Officials are investigating irregularities including forgery, illegal transfer of lands worth over Rs 700 crore in the open market belonging to Sangam dairy. ACB officials first raided the dairy in mid-April for a period of three days which led to the arrest of the former Ponnur MLA. The government had earlier tried to acquire Sangam dairy by issuing an order, but the AP high court on May 7 restrained the state from taking over the cooperative society. The HC also restrained the company from selling its assets without prior permission of the court.

---||Patna||Monsoon rain: Met issues red alert for today||PATNA: The onset of southwest monsoon along with a low pressure area in the region has led to good rainfall in the initial days of rainy season in the state. Patna and many other parts of the state received showers on Monday and India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued red alert for heavy rainfall in the state on Tuesday and yellow alert for Wednesday and Thursday. A red alert by IMD stipulates that the authorities concerned should take necessary action with respect to expected extreme weather conditions. The yellow alert, on the other hand, asks the authorities to be watchful for extreme weather conditions. An all-India weather bulletin issued by IMD on Monday evening stated that the low pressure area is situated over south Jharkhand and neighbourhood with an associated cyclonic circulation tilting southwestwards. Under the influence of the weather systems in the region, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall along with isolated extremely heavy falls is very likely in Bihar on Tuesday. The IMD further stated in its weather warning section that heavy rainfall is expected at isolated places in Bihar on June 16 and 17 as well. Forecast for fairly widespread rainfall in Bihar has been issued till June 18. Southwest monsoon had entered Bihar through Purnia in north-eastern parts of the state on June 12, a day ahead of its schedule. The rain-bearing cloud covered the entire state in the next 24 hours and light to moderate rainfall has been occurring across the state since the last three days. Places which received significant rainfall in the last 24 hours included Bhagalpur (56mm), Motihari (11mm) and Aurangabad (17.5mm). Two spells of moderate rainfall occurred in Patna in the afternoon and evening hours on Monday. “Light to moderate rainfall occurred at many places in northeastern and southwestern parts and almost in the entire state in the last 24 hours. Moisture feeding is happening from Bay of Bengal in entire state. Accordingly, light to moderate rainfall will continue to occur at many places along with heavy rainfall at one or two places,” an official at Patna Meteorological Centre said. He added monsoon trough line was passing from west Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and north Jharkhand to northwest Bay of Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/monsoon-rain-met-issues-red-alert-for-today/articleshow/83520597.cms||---

Arrangement for their Covid test has been made at Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital. Strict action will be taken against the agencies not following the order,” the DM said. The DM also said salary for the month of June of those teachers who have not taken even first dose of vaccine will be withheld. He has asked the district education officer to ensure that midday meal incharges, cooks and teachers along with their family members take the vaccine shots. “Despite vaccination facility provided for the teachers, achievement is not satisfactory,” the DM said. A special vaccination was organised on the collectorate campus on Sunday for the staff posted at the offices of divisional commissioner, sadar SDO and circle officer and their families. The DM has also asked the officials concerned to conduct Covid test of people at public places like vegetable markets, railway stations and bus stands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dm-cov-test-must-for-delivery-boys-in-gaya/articleshow/83520424.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: New school year begins online today with same old issues||PUNE: All schools in the state will reopen online on Tuesday, except for Vidarbha region where they will start after June 26. This is the second year of online reopening caused by the pandemic situation. The Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training (MSCERT) has prepared 45 days of bridge courses for students from standard II to X which will cover important topics from the previous year and will be taught across the state after June 26. The board has tied up with Doordarshan’s Sahyadri channel to impart lessons every day on television, and a YouTube channel launched just for the purpose. A survey to understand how many students have access to online modes of education will also start in all schools from Tuesday. Deputy director at MSCERT Vikas Garad said, “We have 2.25 crore students in Standard I to XII in Maharashtra. Apart from Vidarbha region where the schools will start after June 26, schools in the rest of Maharashtra will reopen online from Tuesday. The bridge course for each subject and class is ready with MSCERT and we will launch it statewide once all schools are open, as it is designed in a weekly manner for easier monitoring.” However, a gist of reports published first by Active Teachers Forum last May and the latest report released by Shantilal Muttha Foundation this April, indicates that the number of students who have access to online education is less than 50% and access to television and radio is not good in rural areas. Activists and teachers say that the condition of the urban poor especially with the pandemic induced financial crunch means spending money on cellphones and internet recharges are of the least priority. The first study puncturing the state’s claim of online education was done by Active Teachers Forum in its report released last May citing that only 27% students in the state had a smartphone with internet connectivity. The survey was done by a Zilla Parishad teachers collective with responses from 1,186 schools encompassing 1,67,687 students. Only 8% of these students had their own cellphones while 11% had a desktop or a laptop. The next big survey was done by the SCERT with help from Unicef in standards I to VIII. Two blocks from each district were selected on the basis of the highest and lowest literacy rates and a total of 737 schools with 6,855 students were surveyed. The results were again poor as only 50% of the students were able to access the home learning online package devised by SCERT. Even among students with access, more than 50% of students spent less than an hour in the online module. There were stark regional and social divides in terms of percentage of access with rural areas showing lesser access while reserved categories showed lesser access to online education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-school-year-begins-online-today-with-old-concerns-about-access/articleshow/83526219.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Abducted twice in two months, baby gets 24x7 police protection||AHMEDABAD: Cops will be deployed round the clock to protect him. Abducted twice in two months, he's neither a politician nor a celebrity. Instead, he is a two-month-old baby from Adalaj in Gandhinagar – possibly the youngest person in Gujarat who will get 24x7 police protection. The child, whose parents stay in slums near Adalaj Trimandir, was first abducted in April when he was just two days old. He was rescued from his kidnappers, only to be snatched again by another pair of kidnappers on June 5. In both the kidnapping bids, the abductors were childless couples who wanted to complete their families with a child. Due to the double kidnapping, the police have decided to create a special point near the slums and deploy a team round the clock. Apart from this, the police officers are also thinking of giving the parents, who collect waste for a living, a permanent abode so that the child is not vulnerable to abductors. H P Jhala, inspector with the local crime branch in Gandhinagar, said, “We have been trying to find some decent jobs and a house for the boy’s parents so that they can live safely.” Detailing the arrangements being made, an LCB officer said, “We will monitor the boy and his parents whether they are at home or at work. The kid’s mother has been given the contact number of a few cops so that she can call for help in case there’s no policeman around her during an emergency.” Another cop added, “There are many such vulnerable kids who live on the footpath or roadside with their parents. They are easy targets for kidnappers. Taking a lesson from this case, we may extend similar protection to other vulnerable kids.” The child was first abducted when he was just two days old from Banaskantha by Jignesh and Asmita Bharti from Kadi in Mehsana district in April. The childless couple made off with the child from Gandhinagar Civil Hospital. The Gandhinagar LCB tracked them and rescued the child within a week. Then, the baby was abducted from Banaswada on June 5; this time, by a childless couple again. Accused, Dinesh and Sudha Katara, did not have a child even after seven years of marriage. So, when Dinesh saw the mother keeping her child in a makeshift cradle on her bicycle while she collected waste, he swooped down on his motorcycle and carried the child away. The LCB took around four days and analyzed footage from over 700 CCTV cameras in Gandhinagar, Mehsana, Arvalli and Sabarkantha districts of Gujarat and Banswada district of Rajasthan to track and rescue the child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abducted-twice-in-2-months-baby-gets-protection/articleshow/83523957.cms||Ashish Chauhan

WCCB regional deputy director (western region) M Maranko said, “The enrolled volunteers above 18 years of age will assist WCCB in gathering intelligence, capacity building and awareness. They will be enrolled after verifying their background and volunteer I-cards will be issued.” Keeping in view the enormity of the task, said Maranko, WCCB’s existing resources need to be augmented substantially in the long run. However, for its immediate requirement, the body has decided to enrol volunteers who have knowledge of wildlife crime issues. The membership of these volunteers will be renewed every year and meetings held every three to six months. The volunteers will assist state forest departments in building awareness and the capacity of stakeholders for combating crime. They will also conduct public campaigns and programmes on wildlife laws and policies. However, holding the position doesn’t entitle these volunteers to undertake any law enforcement actions directly. They will have to pass the information to the legally mandated enforcement agencies and assist the enforcement officers. A four-member selection committee headed by the additional director of WCCB, Delhi, will select the volunteers on the basis of interviews. Tenure of these members will be two years and subject to renomination. It is a voluntary scheme and no honorarium will be paid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wildlife-bureau-to-enrol-volunteers-to-combat-crime/articleshow/83524488.cms||---

The ‘Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal Yojana’, one of the seven components of CM Nitish Kumar’s ‘Saat Nischay’ scheme, was launched in September, 2016 with an aim to provide piped drinking water to every household. While reviewing the scheme, the CM asked the officials of the three departments to complete the remaining works at the earliest. “Ensure continuous monitoring of the ongoing works at the department level,” he told the officials. Earlier, while making presentations about the progress of works before the CM, the heads of three departments said all the remaining works would be completed by the end of July. “Work in the remaining wards of the panchayats and urban local bodies is being executed at a faster pace,” the officials said in their respective presentations before the CM.

Interdistrict bus services to places like Jamui, Nalanda, Nawada and Sheikhpura have already started from this interstate bus terminal (ISBT). Along with government buses, private bus operators will also run their buses on these routes from the ISBT. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh reviewed all passenger amenities at ISBT, such as parking system, ticket counters, service station, ferry service, traffic system, toilets and drinking water. He asked the district transport officer (DTO) to make necessary arrangements in coordination with the transport representatives. Singh said, “District-wise site for parking of buses at the terminal will be identified. For this, the DTO has been asked to coordinate with the transport representatives. As per the demand of bus operators, the ticket counter has been made on the ground floor apart from a service station for cleaning and washing the buses.” The DM has instructed the officials to take special care of passenger facilities. Ferry service will be started from Mithapur bus stand to ISBT, so that there is no inconvenience to the passengers. “For this, two buses of Bihar State Road Transport Corporation Limited will be pressed into service. Apart from this, auto services will also be there for the movement of passengers,” Singh added. The DM has constituted a committee comprising additional collector (revenue), DTO, BUIDCO officials, representatives of transport unions and auto unions to ensure smooth arrangements at the terminal. Along with private buses, government buses will also operate from ISBT. City buses will operate from Bankipur bus stand only. The ISBT is spread over 25 acres with all necessary facilities. There is a parking arrangement for buses in about 11 acres. Buses for other routes, which are being run from the Mithapur bus stand at present, are also likely to shift to the ISBT by July. The ISBT, built with an expenditure of Rs 300 crore, was inaugurated by CM Nitish Kumar in September last year. It has four separate multi-storey blocks — A, B, C and D. Block A will be used for the purpose of arrival of buses and Block B for departure. Block C will act as connectivity between the two. Block D will be for commercial purposes like restaurants, lounge, shopping complex and multiplex. Construction work on block D is still going on.

These fish species are produced in a small space in fibre pond. Rajesh Prasad of Chittabari locality is one of the few farmers engaged in fish production through biofloc method. He has constructed five fibre-made ponds on a vacant piece of land in front of his house and is rearing various fish species on a large scale. District fisheries officer Sambhu Prasad Nayak said Rajesh has availed the scheme provided by the fisheries directorate of the state government. “The fisheries department of the state government has given him a financial assistance of 75% for culturing fish in front of his house. The cost of the project was around Rs 8.50 lakh. He has stocked 7,000 fish seeds in the five fibre tanks,” Nayak said. “In the last two months, these fish species have gained weight of 150 grams, which can go up to 250 grams before they are sold. These fish varieties are favourite among buyers and sold at a high price,” Nayak added. He said these fish species are cultured scientifically and in an artificial tank. “Trained experts take care of medicines, aeration and food for the fish. Air blowers are used for providing oxygen supply to fish. Generator sets and borewell facilities were provided at the spot for culturing fish,” he said. Rajesh said, “I have chalked out a plan to harvest these fish twice a year. This new techniques help me earn maximum profit. A casual approach in rearing these fish varieties may prove a loss-making venture.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-biofloc-fish-farming-gains-foothold-in-katihar/articleshow/83520586.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Bars, restaurants get ready to party with 8-hour window, 50% seating||KOLKATA: Restaurant and hotel owners have welcomed the relaxation order issued on Monday and are hoping to restart business soon. Most of the stand-alone bars and restaurants will resume operation from June 16 itself while those in malls may restart after some time as they are planning to discuss certain issues with the mall authorities. The heritage clubs, however, are waiting for more clarifications before reopening its bars and restaurants. According to the order, restaurants and bars — including those in hotels and malls — may remain open from 12pm to 8pm with 50% seating capacity. The president of Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI), Sudesh Poddar, said that the industry is very happy with the decision of the state. Poddar, who is the owner of Songhai, Manthan, pointed out that the fraternity is thankful to chief minister Mamata Banerjee. “Seeing the plight of the industry, the CM has allowed this move and most of the bars and restaurants will open from June 16,” he said. The HRAEI president added that vaccination drives are being carried out in a big way. Initially, during her interaction with chambers and industry bodies in the first week of June, Banerjee had said that restrictions were needed because of the pandemic. But she also wanted businesses to run after taking all the necessary precautions, otherwise people would have lost jobs. Anjan Chatterjee, the founder and chairman of Speciality Restaurants that has brands like Mainland China, Oh! Calcutta, Haka and Asia Kitchen, said this was a welcome move. “Most of our people have been vaccinated. A lot of them are in their villages now, so the establishments will take some time to reopen,” he said. Most of Chatterjee’s restaurants are in malls. He also pointed out that bouncing back of customers this time around would be slower than after the first wave because of the higher mortality this time. The owner of Peter Cat and Mocambo, Nitin Kothari, was also thankful to the CM. “In some other cities, it took two months for restaurants to reopen. Here it is happening much earlier. We shall carry out sanitization tomorrow,” he said. Kothari was also happy about the timings declared in the order. “We shall get customers for lunch too,” he said. Debaditya Chaudhury, director of Chowman, Oudh and Chapter 2, agreed with Kothari. He felt the restaurants will get customers for lunch with this timing, especially on weekends. “The relaxation that has been initiated by the government is beyond our expectations. We are sure that since the majority of the sales come from dine-in, this flexibility will surely get us more business compared to the last few months,” he said. Both Pradip Rozario, owner of KK’s Fusion and Mio Amore, and director of Aminia Kabir Azhar said they will reopen their establishments from June 16. Rozario also pointed out that they will start the stand-alone restaurant first while Azhar said that by June 15, all his employees will be vaccinated. “We are conducting vaccination drives for all our employees,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bars-restaurants-get-ready-to-party-with-8-hour-window-50-seating/articleshow/83523573.cms||---

With the restrictions being eased, all individual retail stores, including those retailing liquor, will have revised business hours from 11am to 6pm from Wednesday when the new rules will come into effect. Till now, they had been allowed to operate from noon to 4pm. The longer window, traders said, will facilitate revival of trade and generate demand for goods and services, which will, in turn, infuse life into the production sector as well. “It is a cautious step towards reopening. I think the CM took the right decision by taking a calibrated approach to normalcy. The extended window of trade for the retail stores makes sense. Traders now have greater independence in buying, stocking and selling things, which was difficult in the shorter window,” said Confederation of West Bengal Traders’ Associations president Sushil Poddar. The curbs were enforced on May 16 to stem the surge in Covid cases across the state. Only grocery stores and daily essential markets were allowed to operate from 7am to 10am. With a decline in the number of infections, the state decided to extend the operating window,” said an officer. “The longer window will also reduce overcrowding. People require many things in their daily life. It is not always possible to reach shops within the specified three hours. On Friday, I desperately required papers and envelopes. I hurried to the shop at 4.15pm to find it shut. It hampered my work,” said Saili Ghosh Dastidar, a commercial artist with an advertising agency. “Many of my fellow traders had complained about how to run their shops without employees who can travel only on public transport. I told them to run the shop on their own. Let the business gradually gain pace before it opens fully. By that time, we will have a greater vaccination coverage among our fellow traders,” said Anil Dasgupta, who runs a hardware shop at Narkeldaga. Booksellers and publishers were also elated with the order. “A seven-hour window is good enough to run a trade successfully. But to swing back into business, we need public transport as well. College Street is a place where buyers come from across the state. Even if only intra-city buses are allowed to ply, we will benefit hugely,” said Ranjit Ghosh, a publisher at College Street. The liquor off-shops will also get the extended hours, an Excise official said. Sudip Kumar Ghosh, a leading liquor merchant, said the new timings will improve sales. Tamanjan Saha and Debasis Ghosh, who also have off-shops, agreed. Saha said that. at present, the average sales of off-shops have reached 60% of the normal level. With the new timing, the sale is likely to improve.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/operating-time-revised-retail-stores-off-shops-to-be-open-for-7-hrs-daily/articleshow/83523612.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Banks have been asked to accept such forms in physical format up to June 30. The tax board adds that a facility will be provided in the new income tax (I-T) portal to upload these physical forms at a later date for the purpose of generation of the document identification number. In its June 14 edition, TOI had front-paged a report about this challenge as well as others faced by taxpayers, including India Inc, owing to glitches in the newly launched I-T portal. Read AlsoUsers stuck as glitches plague new I-T portalThe new income-tax (I-T) portal launched on June 7, which promised to be a gamechanger, continues to be plagued by glitches. Taxpayers and tax professionals find that they are unable to log in, or if at all they do manage to log in, they are unable to carry out transactions—be it uploading aAs reported, taxpayers were unable to upload these forms on the newly launched portal. Hence, they were unable to meet their payment schedules. Several corporates had to default on their contractual obligations and faced the risk of significant penalties for delayed payments. While Form 15CA is a declaration from the taxpayer that tax has been deducted at source against payment to the overseas recipient, Form 15CB is a certification from a chartered accountant that the provisions of the relevant tax treaty and I-T Act have been complied with. The CBDT had given advance notice that the erstwhile portal would not function for six days up to June 6. Taxpayers didn’t expect the new portal to throw up so many glitches, including the inability to register. Ameet Patel, chairperson of the taxation committee at the Bombay Chartered Accountants’ Society, stated, “While it is good that the CBDT had introduced this relaxation for Forms 15CA/15CB, the fact remains that it took them a week to take this step. In the interim, for two weeks (since June 1), remittances have been held up for no fault of taxpayers.” Patel added that unfortunately piecemeal remedial steps are being taken. “No action has been taken with regards to the ongoing I-T assessments where notices are being e-mailed to taxpayers to comply within a day or two, even though it is impossible to do so as the new I-T portal is non-functional. We certainly expect more from the authorities.” According to government sources, high level meetings between the finance ministry officials and Infosys — the tech service provider — are likely in the coming days to take stock of the developments in sorting out the various difficulties being faced by the taxpayers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-filing-norm-for-remittances-eased/articleshow/83525178.cms||---

They also feel that Covid-appropriate behaviour should be followed by all, if the third wave is to be avoided. After a conspicuous decline in Covid cases, the state government had lifted the 35-day lockdown on June 8 and imposed night curfew from 7pm to 5am along with certain restrictions till June 15. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, told this newspaper on Monday that the unlocking process had not created any adverse impact on the lives of the people so far as the spread of Covid-19 cases was concerned. He, however, pointed out, “A lot of people have started stepping out of their houses without masks and violating social distancing norms. If they continue ignoring the Covid protocols, the state will witness the third wave soon.” Gynaecologist, Dr Punam Raman, said, “It is good that the lockdown is ending, but the authorities should ensure that common people do not ignore Covid protocols. Laxity can create havoc once again.” She added, “Although the number of infections has declined, the death rate is yet to slide significantly.” The former head of the English department at Patna University, Shiv Jatan Thakur, also observed that complete relaxation in curbs would spread Covid because “public places like parks, malls and theatres will attract huge gatherings again”. “Many people still do not wear masks or maintain social distancing,” he rued. However, some people have hailed the relaxation in restrictions. Highlighting the plight of small businessmen and vendors, a Patna high court lawyer, Sudhanshu Kumar Lal, said, “Traders have heaved a sigh of relief as their sales have increased.” Dhruv Bhagat, a grocer in Buddha Colony, expressed pleasure over the reported decline in Covid infections and hoped that normalcy would return soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/avoiding-covid-norms-a-definite-no-no-doctors/articleshow/83520358.cms||B K Mishra

The bank admitted it was facing some issue with the app and said it had been resolved, without providing a reason for the outage, in a statement at 1:38pm — over two hours after customers first complained they weren’t able to log into the app. The latest glitch occurred within three months of the last outage reported on March 30, when both net and mobile banking were impacted. The country’s largest private bank has faced regulatory pressure due to at least five digital outages reported in less than three years. The RBI has asked the bank’s board to identify lapses and fix accountability. The current outage comes at a time when the bank is expected to get back to the regulator on how it has addressed recurrent issues on its digital banking platforms. On how long it would take to fix the issues flagged by the RBI, HDFC Bank CFO Srinivasan Vaidyanathan had said in an earnings call on April 17 that it has demarcated the actions between short-, medium- and long-term and that it was focusing on disaster recovery (DR) and network monitoring in the short term.  “Long-term (issues) could take 12-18 months (to address) — cloud strategy is an example. In the short term, it is about DR resiliency, where we tune recovery time and recovery point...In the medium term (6 months), some more security enhancements, automation of the whole process in terms of orchestration (will happen). And both in the short and medium term, we will have application network monitoring tools coming through,” Vaidyanathan had said, adding that the bank has set higher standards in some of the processes it is implementing. In December, the RBI had barred HDFC Bank from any digital launches and issuance of fresh credit cards until it resolved its IT issues. The RBI action had followed prolonged issues in November due to a power outage at the bank’s data centre. Mumbai-based AAA technologies has been appointed by the RBI to conduct an IT audit of HDFC Bank. Incidentally, several HDFC bank customers have been facing intermittent issues since the lender updated its iOS app last week. Customers have complained about getting a blank screen after opening the updated app. HDFC Bank’s stock ended with a 0.7% gain at Rs 1,490 by close of Tuesday’s trade on the BSE after it announced that its board will consider a dividend in a meeting on June 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-customers-face-2-hour-app-outage/articleshow/83538270.cms||Aseem Gujar

The chief minister said schools and hospitals are being revamped under the Nadu-Nedu scheme and a focus is being laid on developing infrastructure facilities in agriculture. He added that English medium was introduced in government schools with CBSE affiliation, and children are coming back to government schools. Similarly, due to lack of infrastructure in the health sector, people travel to Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai for tertiary care. He said medical infrastructure is being developed, right from village clinics to teaching hospitals. He informed the bankers that the government is constructing 16 new medical colleges in the state. The chief minister also told the bankers about the launch of Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) at the village level to assist farmers. These RBKs support farmers from providing certified quality seeds to selling the crop, he said, while agriculture infrastructure is being developed at the RBK-level and godowns, cold storages and other facilities are being provided to farmers. The chief minister said 17,000 new greenfield colonies are being constructed, in which 28.30 lakh houses will be built. Fifteen lakh houses are being constructed under phase 1, the chief minister said, and as much as Rs 34,000 crore is being spent on the scheme and requested the support of banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-unveils-annual-credit-plan-of-over-rs-2-lakh-crore/articleshow/83520857.cms||Gopi Dara

Other colleges who are ready with their plans are waiting for the various boards to announce their criteria for assessing the students of class XII after which they are scheduled to open their admission portals. CBSE, ISC and West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education have cancelled their Class-XII board examinations and will assess the students on different criteria. J D Birla Institute, affiliated to Jadavpur University, has announced, that notification and online applications will begin by the first week of July. “The interested candidates should check the college’s website for the necessary announcements. All the details regarding the admissions will be shared with students,” said Deepali Singhee, principal of the college. The college has decided to hold online interactions with applicants in some subjects to assess their aptitude for the subject that have applied. The entire process will be online due to pandemic. On-campus classes have been suspended since March last year to prevent the spread of the virus. Admissions will be conducted online. The Bhawanipur Education Society College, too, has decided to start the process immediately after the boards declare the assessments for Class-XII students. “Since it will be completely online, interested candidates must follow the college’s website regularly,” said an official.

Singh, three-term Chhattisgarh CM, and BJP national spokesman Dr Sambit Patra had moved HC challenging the FIR registered against them by Raipur police following a complaint against their tweets and copies of certain documents pertaining to the alleged toolkit. “It is not in dispute that the petitioner is a political person. The FIR was lodged by police on May 19 on the basis of a complaint received on May 18, without examining the truthfulness of the complaint. If we see the face value of the FIR, no offence under IPC sections on intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace is made out as the averments of the FIR reflect that by the tweet of the petitioner, Congressmen are aggravated which clearly indicates that no public peace or tranquility is being adversely affected and it is purely political rivalry between two political parties,” the order says. The order reads: “This, prima facie, establishes that the present FIR has been registered with political motives.” Granting interim relief to the petitioners, the HC stayed further investigation into the FIR against both BJP members till the next hearing. The state counsel sought three weeks’ time to file replies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-case-is-made-out-says-hc-stays-raman-toolkit-fir-probe/articleshow/83528638.cms||---

The chief justice is heading a division bench, which also comprises justice Ravindra Ghuge, and will be hearing several important matters over the week of his stay in Aurangabad. “On the next date (June 30), we expect a fresh affidavit. Place on record what action they (Jalna civic authorities) propose to take against the erring officials, the chief justice told the additional government pleader. In February, the high court had imposed Rs”1 lakh fine each on the chief officer (CO) and four other officials of the Jalna municipal council for “making misleading statements, amounting to false information” in relation to the illegal slaughter house. The slaughter house had no clearance from the Maharashtra pollution control board (MPCB). The MPCB had furnished a report to the HC on January 29 stating that an uncontrolled slaughtering was performed by group of people in the slaughter house and the blood that flowed after slaughtering was dumped in the open nullah on the premises of the slaughter house and then disposed of into the municipal nullah outside the premises that are open gutters in the residents colonies without any effluent treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/give-affidavit-on-action-against-erring-officials-hc/articleshow/83517183.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The first accident took place near Gill Chowk around 9.30pm when Kartik, 22, a resident of Haryana, along with his friend, was returning home after attending a function here. Sub-inspector Sulakhan Singh said, “Kartik was driving a Hyundai i20 car (HR 09 E 5668). He was with his friend from Chandigarh. Kartik’s sister is married in Atam Nagar and on Sunday night he, along with his friend, had gone there to attend a function. He was on way back to Haryana when his speeding car first crashed into a Hyundai Santro car and then into an auto. The injured—the auto driver, Kartik and his friend—were taken to a hospital. No complaint has been lodged in the case.” At the time, Sarabjit Singh was in the Hyundai Santro car with his kids and sister. He said, “My wife was shopping and my two children, sister and I were sitting in the four-wheeler when a speeding car hit ours and then an auto before turning over. We had a narrow escape, but my car was damaged.” The second accident was reported near Ishar Nagar bridge of Sidhwan Canal around 10pm when Parshotam Sharma, a resident of Basant Avenue who was allegedly drunk at the wheel, crashed his SUV (PB 10 EC 0111) into another (PB 10 CX 1656). Dehlon SHO inspector Sukhdev Singh said, “Parshotam was going home from Sahnewal. When he reached near Ishar Nagar bridge, his SUV rammed into another SUV of Mandeep Singh of Dholewal. After the collision, Mandeep’s SUV hit two motorcycles and a scooter parked on roadside. It then ran into an electricity pole. Mandeep has suffered minor injuries.” “In the meantime, Parshotam’s SUV hit a Royal Enfield bike, which Parminder Singh, 24, of CRPF Colony, Dugri, was driving. The SUV dragged him for a few metres and then flipped over. Parminder died on the spot. Parshotam, who suffered minor injuries, escaped from there. He was traced to his house,” he added. Parminder owned a mobile repair shop. The inspector said, “It is suspected that Parshotam, who runs a factory of polishing cycle parts, was driving drunk. Tests are being conducted to ascertain it. A case has been registered against him under sections 279 (rash driving), 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC and Section 188 of the Motor Vehicle Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/multiple-collisions-leave-1-dead-4-injured/articleshow/83522326.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Pandemic effect: Bhavans & Modern schools in Nagpur reduce fees||NAGPUR: After persistent demands by parents, many city schools have offered a respite by reducing their fees, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. This includes leading groups like Bhavan’s and Modern, which have provided succour to parents, many of whom either lost their jobs or their business has been adversely affected due to the series of lockdowns. While Bhavan’s reduced fees by 23%, Modern waived off charges for library and other extra-curricular activities. Last year, three schools — Prahaar, Kurveys New Model and Nahate Primary — had slashed their fees substantially, to help out distressed parents, despite facing losses. The schools claim none of them have reduced salaries of their teaching and non-teaching staff, though some of the city’s top schools sacked some teachers. It was reported by TOI on October 4, with parents terming these schools as “corona warriors”. The decision of big groups like Bhavan’s and Modern having several branches across Nagpur district has been hailed by parents bodies, who term it as ‘revolutionary’ in the time of pandemic, which drained everyone financially. They called on other schools to follow suit. “Instead of fighting, both school management and parents should sit together and reduce the fees, as per their capacity. There’s no denying the fact that the majority of citizens are suffering financially due to the pandemic. It’s high time schools themselves help distressed parents and students,” Yogesh Pathare of Rashtriya Shikshak Palak Sanghatan told TOI, adding that Bhavans’ management deserves all praise for its ‘commendable’ move. A senior official from Bhavan’s management confirmed to TOI that the step to reduce fee was taken considering the demands of parents, who were fighting for it since last one year. They had even protested in front of the school’s Civil Lines premises. “The concession of 23% would be applicable to only six branches in the district – Wadi, Shrikrishna Nagar, Ashti, Koradi, and Chinch Bhavan, besides the main branch. It will be a one-time measure only, considering the pandemic situation,” the official told TOI. The Modern Group schools at Koradi and on Neeri premises have waived off charges it used to collect other than the tuition fees. “Since no activities had taken place throughout last year and students didn’t attend classes, we’ve decided not to charge for components like computers and sporting activities, among others. It was basically parents’ demand after which our management decided to provide respite to the parents,” Neeri branch principal Uday Thosar told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pandemic-effect-bhavans-modern-schools-reduce-fees/articleshow/83524553.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Pune||States can get home kits’ data on ICMR portal||PUNE: All states should check the ICMR portal to track and treat people testing positive via home Covid test kits, officials from the research body have said. The officials were responding to concerns that states were missing out on cases testing positive via such kits. Mylab’s Coviself, a home-based rapid antigen kit that hit pharmacies last week, gives test results within 15 minutes of taking a nasal swab. State health officials said the data from the rapid kits is key as the five-level unlock process relies on testing information and positivity rates. ICMR officials said the home-based kits are linked to the ICMR portal and states can access patient data, including home addresses. “States have user credentials to access the portal. Officials can check data from their respective states and local authorities can contact the person who has tested positive,” a senior ICMR official said. After Coviself, two more home testing kits — PanBio and Covifind — are expected to hit the market soon. “All these home test kits will be linked to the ICMR portal, which will have data of positive patients and number of tests,” the ICMR official added. State health officials have raised concerns about tracking those testing positive via home kits bought over the counter. “All purchases of the home kits should be strictly monitored. There should also be a mechanism that ensures local authorities, and not a centralised portal, are first alerted about a positive case,” a state official said. Representatives from Mylab, which makes Coviself, said local authorities in Pune have been able to reach out to people testing positive. “The system is in place and will be fortified further,” a Mylab official said. According to company officials, about 30 lakh Coviself kits have been distributed to pharmacies and drug stores nationwide. The volume will be scaled up, they said. “We are ready with a capacity of 1 crore per week. We will react to market demand,” said a Mylab official. The firm’s managing director Hasmukh Rawal said they plan to improve reach in rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/states-can-get-home-kits-data-on-icmr-portal/articleshow/83526287.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Kochi||Flat torture case: Kochi cops seek Martin Joseph’s custody||KOCHI: City police probing the apartment torture case in which a woman was restrained, tortured and sexually assaulted in an apartment at Marine Drive in the city on Monday submitted a custody application for the accused Martin Joseph. Ernakulam central police said that the court would consider the application on Tuesday. Sources said that the investigators have sought seven-day custody of the accused who was remanded in judicial custody on Friday. Police had found that the accused had attacked women familiar to him in both the cases registered against him so far. The original case pertains to Joseph brutally torturing his live-in partner. A Thrissur native, Joseph was residing in Kochi and according to the police, the accused had been in a live-in relationship with the survivor for several months before he allegedly became violent and started torturing her during the last months of 2020. The victim had filed a complaint on April 8, a month after she escaped from the apartment where she was allegedly locked up. Before his abusive behaviour began, the survivor had invested Rs 5 lakh in stock market dealings of the accused. In this case, he was booked under sections 376 (rape), 344 (wrongful confinement for 10 days or more), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous means or weapons) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the IPC. Even as Joseph was on the run in connection with the torture case, another case was registered against him at the Vanitha Police station in Kochi city based on a complaint by a Kakkanad-native woman that she was assaulted by him as he wanted to stay at her apartment. Police found that he had gone to her flat to stay in hiding, due to the other case, and he forcefully stayed there for some time. A case for assault and using criminal force against a woman and outraging her modesty was registered in connection with the incident. “Both attacks had the characteristics of a domestic violence case. Only a thorough probe would reveal the extent of his criminal activities. We will interrogate him about his source of income and how he was able to lead a luxurious lifestyle involving premium flats and multiple vehicles. He would also be taken to the apartment where the crime took place and to the locations where he stayed in hiding,” said an official, adding that a probe is also on to find if the accused had committed other similar crimes. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/flat-torture-case-cops-seek-martins-custody/articleshow/83522317.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Locals, political parties condemn attack on Navelim man||MARGAO: The arrest of two persons on Saturday by Margao police following a murderous attack on Navelim resident Cenvi Pires on Friday, has led to condemnation of the incident from political parties and locals who have voiced their anguish over vote bank politics which, they said, has led to criminal elements getting emboldened in Margao. While the incident served as a handle for the BJP to mount an attack on a politician on social media, AAP leaders including Pratima Coutinho visited Pires at the Hospico hospital where he is undergoing treatment and urged politicians to “stop this dirty politics” that leads to proliferation of crime. Margao town police had on Saturday arrested Sayeed and his accomplice, Anil Kumar, after they allegedly assaulted Pires with deadly weapons after waylaying him at Shirvodem, Margao late Friday evening. Pires was returning home on his two-wheeler when he saw the road near the Quba masjid at Shirvodem, Margao, being blocked as a car was wrongfully parked. When Pires asked the two accused in the car to move aside, an altercation broke out and Pires was assaulted by the duo with a koita and an iron rod. Pires, who sustained severe injuries on his head and legs, was shifted to the Hospicio hospital, Margao, where he is undergoing treatment. Navelim youth also warned that such incidents would not be tolerated in future. On Sunday, BJP general secretary Narendra Sawaikar posted a comment on Facebook said that the incident was a pointer to “an ugly culture raising its head, challenging the very Goan ethos and its existence” while Navin Pai Raikar, general secretary, BJP Margao mandal, in his FB post lauded Margao police for their quick action in nabbing the accused by dismissing all political interference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/locals-political-parties-condemn-attack-on-navelim-man/articleshow/83526435.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Centre trying to end power relief to agriculture sector: Sanyukt Kisan Morcha||BATHINDA: The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has alleged that the Union finance ministry in a recent covert move has tried to disincentivize those states which provide power subsidies to agriculture and farmers. The SKM claimed that the government is indulging in anti-farmer move by offering additional borrowing space to state governments, based on certain conditions and performance criteria including on the agriculture front that coerce state governments to bring down subsidies for farmers. It has evolved a scoring system giving more marks to those states which have no power subsidy for agricultural connections, or for those states which have metered consumption including agricultural connections, or for DBT system for subsidies, the morcha said. SKM said one of the key demands in the farmers’ struggle has been in the context of the Union government attempting the legal route of draft Electricity Amendments Bill 2020 wherein such proposals of ending agricultural subsidies exist. The Centre has agreed verbally to the farmers’ demand to withdraw the draft bill on December 30, 2020. However, the same moves are being made through another route now, the morcha alleged. It said the Mahila Suraksha Samiti formed at Tikri border will be convened by Jagmati Sangwan, with the other members being Sudesh Goyat, Amrita Kundu, Suman Hooda, Sharda Dikshit and Sudesh Kandela. Due to an internal miscommunication, earlier a wrong phone number was released. The correct phone number where women can approach this committee for any complaint redressal is 9650463835, SKM added. The morcha stated the farmers in Haryana have announced to turn the site where they had removed the foundation stone for BJP office in Jhajjar into a new protest spot. Meanwhile, the 5th Sikh master Guru Arjun Dev’s martyrdom day was marked at protest sites on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/centre-trying-to-end-power-relief-to-agri-sector-skm/articleshow/83528132.cms||---

The IAS officer, who served as additional collector in Cuddalore during the first wave and regional deputy commissioner, south, of Chennai corporation during the second wave, said the experience will come in handy while containing virus spread in Coimbatore. “We are seeing around 500 cases daily from corporation limits and many cases from rural areas. Thus, handling Covid-19 is my first priority. While handling the second wave, preparations for the third wave will start soon,” he said. The Friends of Covid Persons Under Surveillance (Focus) system implemented in Chennai corporation, where a volunteer is allotted to people under quarantine, will be implemented in Coimbatore also, Gopal said. “The volunteer will handle all requirements of families, so that they don’t have to step out of houses. I will study containment zone prerequisites and systems to take a call.” He will evaluate the effectiveness of zonal enforcement teams to bring shops that continue to function without permission to task, the official said. “I will also strive to strengthen the civic body’s public service delivery system and public grievance redressal system. Public service delivery includes cleanliness, streetlights, roads and availing birth and death certificates. I remember how much I struggled to get my father’s death certificate, and don’t want others to go through the same hassle.” “For public grievance redressal, the Chennai corporation has a robust system including a Facebook page, Twitter account and helpline numbers. Besides tagging us on Facebook, Twitter and calling helplines, people can meet me directly to submit complaints,” the commissioner added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/will-emulate-chennai-model-to-defeat-covid-corpn-chief/articleshow/83524586.cms||---
---||Nashik||Farmers to agitate for better milk prices on Thursday||Nashik: Alleging that the cooperative milk organisations have reduced procurement prices of milk from the dairy farmers under the garb of lockdown — though they have maintained the sale prices for the consumers — the Kisan Sabha has decided to organise state-wide agitation on Thursday. The Kisan Sabha and the Dudh Utpadak Shetkari Sanharsha Samiti, along with others farmers’ organisations, will be agitating outside each tehsil office demanding an audit of the cooperative milk organisations and penalties for wrong-doings. “During the lockdown, the agencies slashed the procurement price by Rs 10-15. But they did not lower the sale price of the dairy products in the market. The angry farmers want justice. Despite several meetings and delegations, things have not changed,” Kisan Sabha’s Ajit Navale. Farmers also claimed that the government had failed to look into the preparation for the kharif season. As a result, the farmers were yet to get loans and are yet to get the fertilizers and seeds as promised by the government. The Centre has also taken steps to harass the farmers — by increasing the prices of fertilizers, fuel etc. and other issues. The farmers will also raise the issue of tribal farmers who were promised ‘Khavti’ (compensation) as they were unable to get jobs during the lockdown. However, such tribal farmers are trapped in terms and conditions which they are unable to comprehend. The agitation will be organised in support of the demand to take action against the cooperative organisations that have looted the farmers, presenting ‘Khavti’ to the tribals, resolving farmers issues related to kharif activities, expediting the resolution of complaints of tribal farmers pertaining to Forest Rights Act and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/farmers-to-agitate-for-better-milk-prices-on-thursday/articleshow/83517231.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Third wave: Gujarat aims to double ICU beds, oxygen capacity||AHMEDABAD: The state government is preparing for the possible third wave of Covid-19 by doubling its capacity in beds and oxygen capacity, mentioned Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani on Monday. Rupani along with deputy CM Nitin Patel and senior officials of health department unveiled the roadmap for tackling the surge, which is predicted around the last quarter of the year. TOI in its ongoing series on the preparation for third wave had indicated at several issues faced during the second wave and preparations by various quarters for the third wave. “We pray and prepare that there would be no third wave of the pandemic – but we must be prepared for the possible surge. Thus, our team has readied an action plan to tackle the third wave,” said CM Rupani. “We reduced the cases from 14,605 to 400 with limited lockdown in 36 cities and towns. The focus is on increasing 3Ts – testing, tracking and treatment.” According to the plan, Gujarat would increase total Covid hospitals from 1,800 to 2,400, oxygen beds from 61,000 to 1.1 lakh, ICU beds from 15,000 to 30,000 and ventilator beds from 7,000 to 15,000. Likewise, the number of specialist doctors would be increased from 2,350 to 4,000 and MBBS doctors and interns from 5,200 to 10,000. “About 2,000 beds would be added for paediatric Covid care in Gujarat. Children-friendly wards are being created, whereas the number of paediatric ventilators would be increased to 1,000,” said Rupani. The CM added that the new command and control centre would link all the government and private hospitals of the state to give real-time updates on bed availability. Patel, who is also health minister of the state, said that nobody can predict the exact numbers of cases in the third wave. “But the projections are based on the surge that we had witnessed recently, and assuming that the number would be double that peak. We are determined to flatten the curve,” he said. Jai Prakash Shivahare, state health commissioner, in his presentation to the media mentioned that the state is procuring adequate medicines based on the experience of second wave. The number of daily tests – primarily RT-PCR – would be increased two times, he added. “Gujarat will increase its capacity for genome sequencing to 1,000 samples per month from July,” said Shivahare. The senior state officials said that considering vaccination as the only sure-shot way to reduce Covid numbers, the focus is to increase the number of daily vaccinations for both the doses. With focus on rural areas, the state government had introduced special initiatives to encourage villages to fight the pandemic through maintaining social distancing, mask and vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3rd-wave-state-aims-to-double-icu-beds-o2-capacity/articleshow/83524646.cms||---

There is stock for less than a week, as many bags were discarded after reaching expiry date, said activists involved in donation drives. State officials denied wastage. RTI activist Chetan Kothari said, “KEM Hospital has only 11 bags left, while JJ Hospital has 40.”' Red Cross Society has five, while Sion Hospital has six. He said this was because many banks had to discard blood collected during mega drives. “Within days, stock fell from 12,000 to 6,000 bags,”' said a blood bank official from a civic blood bank. “During mega camps, a lot of blood is collected on one day. As blood bags have certain shelf life, some have to be discarded,” he said. Dr Arun Thorat from State Blood Transfusion Council said no mega drives were organised recently due to lockdown. “Blood banks have been told to organise small, local camps when needed. There is no chance of wastage,”' he said. He said the city had over 6,000 units of blood, adequate for around a week. “Hospitals will organise donation camps daily, so stocks will keep getting replenished,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-could-be-staring-at-blood-shortage-soon/articleshow/83528135.cms||---

The minister who was visiting the district had held interactions with the MLAs on the revival of tourism as well as construction of roads to increase connectivity in the hilly areas of the district. He said that plans are afoot to make Fort Kochi a major tourist destination in the state. A special meeting will be called soon to discuss the various action plans. “Steps will be taken to restore Fort Kochi’s damaged beachfront,” he said after a visit to the damaged walkway at Fort Kochi. The minister said that once the second wave of the pandemic subsides, the beach restoration steps will be initiated so that the heritage locale becomes a much sought-after tourist destination. Tourism stakeholders like tour guides and travel operators will be vaccinated to boost the confidence of the tourists. Kochi MLA K J Maxi submitted a memorandum which detailed the damage in the area,” Riyas said. With Cial and Cochin Port as two points for international arrival of tourists, tourist destinations in and around the district need to be revived on a warfooting. Domestic tourists are also a big group whose needs should also be addressed. Issues like inadequate parking space in the Kadambrayar Boating Centre and Eco Village at nearby Kizhakkambalam will be addressed. The minister also inspected the work on the floating Koothambalam project envisaged by the Ernakulam district tourism promotion council at the international cruise terminal at Willingdon Island. Riyas also chaired a meeting of officials and MLAs to discuss the completion of major road projects. He said that hurdles in construction of the Thankalam-Kakkanad bypass will be addressed. An emergency meeting of various departments and people’s representatives will be convened this month, in connection with the construction of the Thankalam-Kakkanad four-lane road connecting Kunnathunadu, Muvattupuzha, Kothamangalam, Perumbavoor and Thrikkakara constituencies. It was pointed out that land acquisition was a major hurdle in the project. This Rs 1,082 crore road project funded by KIIFB will connect the hilly regions of the district to Kochi city. It will connect Kakkanad with the main city and ease traffic congestion at Edappally, Palarivattom and Vazhakkala. MLAs P V Sreenijan, Anthony John and Eldhose Kunnappilly who met the minister put forth their demands for expediting the works on major roads in Kunnathunad, Kothamangalam and Perumbavoor constituencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/plans-afoot-to-restore-fort-kochis-lost-sheen/articleshow/83522370.cms||---

Named ‘Sargathmakam’, through the weeklong activities like setting up a reading corner at home, introducing new books to friends, presenting videos on newly-learnt English words, etc. The SPC commemorates the death anniversary of PN Panicker (June 19 Vayana Dinam), who is the father of the library movement in Kerala. The plan is to conduct different activities everyday throughout the week involving all cadets virtually. On the first day, all cadets were asked to set up their own reading corners at home. On Monday, the cadets were asked to read any newspaper and based on that they created a three-minute video/presentation to share the contents of what they read to friends through WhatsApp groups. Some students presented news in the guise of a TV news reporter. Similarly, student cadets will have to introduce the book they read and its author to friends through a short video presentation. Also, they have to present the brief of any story they read. On the last day, each student will have to find 100 new words hitherto unknown to them and post it in the groups. Also, they have to make a video explaining the meaning of any 10 words from it. “Acquiring knowledge is one of the aims of education and the best way is to nurture the habit of reading. Each cadet has to complete the daily activity before 6pm. The programme was successful over the last two days and all students are cooperating,” said Anoob John, community police officer at the school, who coordinates the programme. Sargathmakam was inaugurated by K Mohamed Shafi, vigilance officer (excise) at a virtual conference presided over by school principal Mani P Krishnan. It was also attended by Shabu PS, district nodal officer, SPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/this-spc-initiative-promotes-reading/articleshow/83522346.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Revoke ban on new tea factories in Nilgiris: Association||UDHAGAMANDALAM: The Nilgiris Bought Leaf Tea Manufacturers’ Association (NBLTMA) and small tea farmers in the Nilgiris urged the Union government to lift the ban on new tea factories in the district. In 2019, the Tea Board India passed an order banning new manufacturing units in the Nilgiris. “On receiving this circular, we made several representations to the board to lift the ban and to give opportunity to new entrepreneurs wanting to enter the industry,” said NBLTMA president Dhananjayan. “The issue was discussed in detail in six board meetings held between June 2019 and Mar 2021.” The board issued a circular in January, stating that NOC or license could be issued to tea manufacturing units covering all regions under north India, Dhananjayan said. Subsequently, NBLTMA wrote to the Prime Minister, seeking his intervention on April 17. “It is clearly evident that there is a biased approach in addressing issues of the stakeholders of south India,” the letter said. “People having small tea gardens of 10-15 acres would want to have their own mini tea manufacturing factories. The proportion between the yield of green leaf tea and the number of bought leaf factories functioning in the Nilgiris do not match. We need more factories,” said K Sivan, a small tea farmer. “This is the earnest, genuine and long unmet demand of the small tea growers in the district.” Revoking the ban would go a long way to strengthen the economy of the district where tea cultivation is the main activity, said vice chairman of Tea Board India B Kumaran. “The board is taking action to lift the ban in the Nilgiris.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/revoke-ban-on-new-tea-factories-association/articleshow/83524619.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Will surveillance detect onset?||AHMEDABAD: How would Gujarat know that the state has entered the ‘third wave’ of pandemic? Apart from exponential rise in cases, would there be any alarm bells to alert the authorities and citizens alike, right at the start, so that the peak could be flattened? On Monday, Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani along with senior state officials launched the plan to mitigate the third wave where one of the strategies was to keep a close eye on the progression of cases. Top officials said that world over, the Covid pandemic has proved to be cyclic in nature, and the only way to counter it would be to predict its spread and contain it. “We have thus devised three primary criteria based on which all the districts and cities would be measured,” said a senior health department official.  “It includes weekly test positivity rate, rate of increase in cases and occupancy for oxygen and ICU beds. Till yellow alert, almost all the activities are permissible, but once it goes into orange and red alert, the authorities would be empowered to impose restrictions.” For example, if a district records 5% test passivity rate with steady rise in cases for two weeks, the authorities would announce orange alert with restrictions on schools and colleges, offices and public places, banning public gatherings and increase per million testing rate to curb the rise. “Methods such as ILI and SARI surveillance and contact tracing of the confirmed positive person would also continue. ITIHAS also helped to forecast the rise in cases in specific areas, based on which the deployment of Sanjeevani Rath had been planned,” said an official, adding that minimum testing would continue in all districts irrespective of fall in daily cases. Officials added that focus would sharply be on the rural areas with relatively lower testing and positivity rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/will-surveillance-detect-onset/articleshow/83524705.cms||Parth Shastri

Instead, the hospital performed surgery to remove the infected portions of his face and begun administering an alternate anti-fungal drug. Though the patient is still under treatment, he has stabilized and is showing all signs of being on the road to recovery, the hospital says. The 42-year-old patient from Erode had recently recovered from Covid-19 and was on steroids. Around 10 days ago, the patient was diagnosed him with Rhino orbital mucormycosis (black fungus). “Then we gave him Posoconazole injections which stabilized him. On the next day, we decided to surgically remove the infected portion,”a doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/removed-black-fungus-by-surgery-hosptial/articleshow/83524617.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Strict curbs fail to keep TPR of Thiruvananthapuram local bodies in check||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: More than a month since lockdown, triple lockdown, critical containment, micro containment were imposed across local bodies in the district, the collector’s call for better coordination and more intensive measures in local bodies seems to have stemmed more out of desperation than diligence. Unrelenting test positivity rate (TPR) in some panchayats for weeks has laid bare the chinks in the strategy of the district administration to keep the virus under check. While between May 31 and June 13, the district witnessed 13.8% dip in cases, it hardly provides solace. By the end of May, there were 684 wards or places were containment areas in the district across six taluks. Despite strict regulations and isolation steps, total wards under containment in these taluks rose to 901, as on June 13. Chirayinkeezhu taluk had 103 containment zones on May 26 and on Monday, the number had risen to 137. Similar rise was noted for Kattakada, Nedumangad, Neyyattinkara, Trivandrum and Varkala. “We failed to ramp up testing. Lockdown should ideally have been backed up by ample resources for early detection and isolation. Instead, we fell short of resources,” says a medical officer. He narrates an instance where they planned door-to-door testing during triple lockdown to pick asymptomatic family members. However, the first hurdle was sourcing of kits, and when that was solved, there was suddenly no money to pay remuneration for the volunteers for the testing drive. Eventually it was dropped. The district information office’s statements in the past two days vaguely hint at the formation of home-based clusters. “There were cases where one family member would test positive and spread the infection to others, and it happens due to breach of protocol. Nearly 90% cases prefer home isolation and there is hardly any way we can prevent protocol compliance at homes,” says another medical officer. Weekly total testing dipped from 1.07 lakh to 83,929 between April and June. Weekly antigen testing dipped from 52,225 to 44,335 between May and June. Weekly RT-PCR tests reduced from 58,345 to 40,244 in the same period. Between May and June, the weekly testing numbers in government sector dropped from 58,292 to 37,376. In the private sector too, testing numbers dipped from 61,737 to 47,203 between May and June. The 14 panchayats declared as critical-containment zones on May 27 have not shown any marked dip in infection rate even after more than two weeks. Only Nagaroor was an exception with TPR dipping from 36% to 9% between May 27 and June 12. In the remaining 13 local bodies, only two panchayats’ TPR was below 20% — Anadu from 40% to 19% and Vilavoorkal from 47% to 19%. Except Nagaroor, no other panchayats recorded TPR below 15%. Coastal villages, which nearly gave an impression of steering clear of the pandemic, are being swept by the second wave, and despite containment measures there was no significant drop in TPR. Between June 1 and June 12, TPR of Anchuthengu dropped from 51% to 43%. Kulathoor, Poovar, Karumkulam have TPRs nearing 20%. If there were five panchayats with TPR 15% or below on May 26, there was not much improvement as on June 13, with only 14 panchayats being able to bring down TPR to 15% or below.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/strict-curbs-fail-to-keep-tpr-of-tvm-local-bodies-in-check/articleshow/83522411.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Navi-mumbai||Navi Mumbai ex-cop held for firing at his two sons, killing one of them||NAVI MUMBAI: A 75-year-old retired Navi Mumbai policeman, residing in Airoli, has been arrested by Rabale police after he fired three bullets on his two sons from his licensed revolver. While one bullet grazed the abdomen of youngest son Sujay (32), two bullets fired by Bhagwan Patil hit the abdomen and shoulder of his other son, Vijay (35). Vijay, who was admitted to Indravati hospital in Airoli and was critical in ICU, succumbed to injuries around 9.50pm, hospital manager Deepak Nimbalkar said. When Sujay was discharged from hospital after being treated for injuries, he filed a complaint against his father and Rabale police registered an FIR against Bhagwan Patil. As DCP (zone I) Suresh Mengade is on official leave and has gone to Pune, additional charge has been given to DCP (zone II) Shivraj Patil. Shivraj Patil said the accused, Bhagwan Patil, had retired as assistant sub-inspector from Navi Mumbai Police in 2004. Bhagwan Patil has three sons. While the eldest son stays with him and his wife in Sector 3, Airoli, his second son Vijay resides in Vasai and third son Sujay (32) resides in his neighbourhood in Airoli. Bhagwan had a dispute with the younger sons Vijay and Sujay over payment of insurance premium of his Maruti Ertiga SUV. He insisted that his younger sons pay the vehicle insurance premium but they refused and hence had an argument with their father. Shivraj Patil said, “On Monday evening, Bhagwan called Vijay and Sujay to his Airoli house to resolve the matter about payment of insurance premium. When Vijay and Sujay met their father at his residence, an argument ensued between them and Patil brandished a revolver to threaten his sons.” Sujay was in front, while Vijay was standing behind him, so Sujay held his father’s hand and a scuffle took place, police said. Patil fired a bullet from his revolver in the scuffle and it grazed Sujay’s abdomen, near the ribs. Patil then fired two more bullets which hit Vijay standing behind Sujay. While one bullet pierced Vijay’s abdomen, the other pierced his shoulder and he collapsed. Both the injured siblings were rushed to Indravati hospital in Airoli. Rabale police arrested Bhagwan Patil and seized his revolver, Shivraj Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/navi-mumbai-ex-cop-held-for-firing-at-his-two-sons-killing-one-of-them/articleshow/83524621.cms||George Mendonca

Victim Suraj Kumar, a resident of Balaji Colony, had asked accused Mohammad Suleman of Kohara to pay up, which infuriated him. Suraj ran a vend near Kohara. There, he sold cigarettes, tobacco and eggs. His brother, Papu Shah, said in his police complaint, “A few days ago, Mohammad Suleman had bought boiled eggs from Suraj. He had promised to pay the money later, but he did not. When Suraj asked him to pay up, he quarreled with him a couple of days ago.” On Sunday night when Suraj was returning home, he saw Mohammad Suleman consuming liquor in his auto parked on a roadside near his house. “When Suraj asked for the money, Mohammad Suleman started fighting with him and attacked him with an iron rod. He then escaped from the spot. On learning about it, I rushed to the spot and took my brother to a hospital, where he succumbed on Monday morning.” Koomkalan SHO sub-inspector Harshpal Singh said a murder case has been lodged against the accused, who is yet to be arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/told-to-pay-up-auto-driver-thrashes-19-yr-old-to-death/articleshow/83522394.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 25% attendance, vaccine for staff in office||KOLKATA: Offices across the city are gearing up for reopening after a month following the new guidelines issued by the state on Monday. ITC Ltd, the biggest corporate in the region, has welcomed the progressive opening up of the state economy. “We will continue to take appropriate action in the best interest of the safety of our employees,” said an ITC spokesperson. Berger MD and CEO Abhijit Roy pointed out that before restrictions it was working with 50% capacity and now it would operate with 25% employees as per the guidelines of reopening. Haldia Petrochemicals director Subhasendu Chatterjee, who is also the vice chairman of CII West Bengal State Council, said that office will open from June 21 after finishing vaccination of all employees. “Our plant is operated in three shifts,” he added. An executive of Exide said even before the restrictions it was operating with 25%-30% capacity. Chairman of Merlin Group, Sushil Mohta, said it would start with 25% workforce. But he felt limited public transport would have been better. “We will arrange for transport but the problem is employees are coming from different localities,” he added. President of Confederation of West Bengal Trade Association, Sushil Poddar, said it had earlier reduced the office time of its members from 10am-7.30pm to 11am-5pm. Kalyan Kar, VP of the Sector V Stakeholders’ Forum, said: “It is a good decision by the government in allowing up to 50% employees post vaccination. While this reduces the risk, it also makes the organisation and the employees more responsible.” However, many companies will continue WFH. “But the present directive certainly provides more options for the companies and it must be mentioned here that the government has trusted the industry to adhere to the guidelines,” added Kar. An IAS officer who heads a state government office said that as the new norm allows 25% attendance, he plans to operate the office twice a week with one forth staff.

---||Nagpur||Act against schools expelling students for fees: AAP||NAGPUR: A delegation of Aam Admi Party (AAP) along with the Jagrat Palak Samiti visited the state education department’s office here on Monday for various demands related to the school fees issue. Members of both the organizations handed over a representation to senior officer Satish Mendhe requesting the government to take action against private schools that are charging exorbitant fees even in the pandemic and expelling students who failed to pay them. Citing the Supreme Court’s landmark verdict on May 3 in the State of Rajasthan versus Jodhpur private schools, the members called on the government to provide respite to parents suffering from financial distress due to lockdown. “The SC’s decision reaffirms the importance of the right to education and legitimises demand for fee reduction. The government should make sure that no child is expelled due to non-payment of fees. It’s a statutory responsibility to provide education to all, which can’t be compromised. It should also ensure that a parent-teacher executive committee should approve the school fee, instead of schools. This is not the time for educational institutions to mint money,” the members led by Vidarbha convenor Devendra Wankhede, treasurer Jagjit Singh and Ashok Mishra said. Apprising the officer of how the schools were harassing the students for fees, the AAP activists and parents informed that a majority of them had withheld results while others issued transfer certificates (TC). “In this academic year, a majority of these schools failed to reduce the fees, despite saving on the power bills, maintenance and other charges. Even after several warnings by the government, the schools resorted to their ways of charging fees. All these years, their management were raking profits, but lacked the mentality to provide some respite to the distressed parents in their hard time,” the members said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/act-against-schools-expelling-students-for-fees-aap/articleshow/83524618.cms||---

The city cops have only one speed radar to check the violation. Earlier, traffic cops were either deputed on Elevated Road or near Sahnewal to check speeding vehicles. On Sunday night, two major accidents were reported from Dehlon and Division 6. In both the cases, speeding was the main cause of crashes and one of the accused was suspected driving drunk. Assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Gurdev Singh said, “Due to Covid-19, the police had stopped using breath analyzers, as these may spread the virus. Drunk driving checks are not likely to start any time soon.” About drives against speeding, he said, “Since there was a lockdown and restrictions on vehicle movement, we had stopped speeding checks. Now that the restrictions have been eased, we will soon restart the drives.” A few years ago, then additional deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Sukhpal Singh Brar had asked the department to give more speed radars. ACP Gurdev said he would follow up the matter to get more of these devices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/pandemic-puts-brakes-on-drives-to-check-speeding-drunk-driving/articleshow/83522440.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Ludhiana||High raw material rates mould plastic businesses into bankruptcy||LUDHIANA: The plastic raw material traders and product manufacturers of the city are passing through the worst phase of their lives with about 70% of them close to shutting shops and factories and facing bankruptcy. Huge rise in the rates of raw materials during the past one year and a fall in demand are to be blamed for the situation. This was revealed by the Plastic Manufacturers’ and Traders’ Association (PMTA), which claimed that rates of raw materials have gone up by four times in some cases and sales reduced to 25%. Despite this, the fixed expenses, like minimum power charge, wages and rents, have remained the same, causing a turmoil in the industry, it said. PMTA president Gurdeep Singh Batra said, “Close to 70% of traders and factory owners dealing with plastic raw material or making plastic goods are on the verge of permanent closure. Rates of raw materials have gone up four times and there is hardly any demand. The statements of the Central and the state governments have proven to be totally false, take for example the Centre and the RBI’s claim that collateral-free loans are being given by banks.” Batra added, “Banks are refusing loans to Ludhiana businessmen without a collateral. Situation is so bad that earlier when we used to pledge properties for availing loans, we were given loans of up to 150% of our property’s value, but now not even 50% is being offered. The day is not far when Ludhiana will see hundreds of shops, factories, offices connected with plastic business close permanently. Once prosperous businessmen will soon be bankrupt.” Mukesh Marjara, general secretary of the PMTA, said, “During the past one year, the rate of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) has skyrocketed from Rs 85 per kg to Rs 320 per kg. The rate of low density polyethylene (LDP) has gone up to Rs 120 per kg from Rs 80 per kg. Similarly, the rate of linear low density polyethylene (LLDP) has increased from Rs 62 per kg to Rs 92 per kg. The rate of polypropylene (PP) has increased from Rs 72 per kg to Rs 100 per kg. Few months back, the rates had gone up even more, but due to no demand in the market, these fell but are still almost four times of what they used to be last year.” Mohan Lal Khurana, association chairman, said, “We have been into this business for decades and have seen many ups and downs, but this is for the first time that we are witnessing such a situation when the closure of hundreds of businesses seems inevitable. The main reasons for this turmoil are unjustified increase in the rates of plastic raw materials, fall in demand to almost 25% due to lockdowns, no financial support from banks to fight the crisis and no relaxation in the recurring expenses, like fixed power charges, rent, property and municipal taxes, among others.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/high-raw-material-rates-mould-plastic-businesses-into-bankruptcy/articleshow/83522428.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Forest department to radio collar wayward ‘Baahubali’||COIMBATORE: The forest department has planned to radio-collar a tusker nicknamed ‘Baahubali’ in the Mettupalayam forest range to study its habitats, migratory paths and prevent man-animal conflicts. The chief wildlife warden has issued orders to radio-collar ‘Baahubali’ for study purposes. “A team has been formed to monitor the elephant. When the elephant comes to suitable terrain, the team will restrain the animal and fix the radio collar. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has given the radio-collar to the forest department,” district forest officer D Venkatesh said. “A complete route map can be prepared within a couple of years by continuous monitoring using the radio-collar. These data will be helpful to keep a tab on elephant movement and reduce man-animal conflict. We can get their exact location and reach there without wasting time in search of the animal and push them back into the forests. This will save human lives as well as properties,” Venkatesh said. “Radio-collaring of an animal costs a few lakh rupees. We need a medical team for darting and a technical team for fixing the collar. Even after the radio collar is fixed, a dedicated team must be deployed to monitor the movement, collect data and record them,” Venkatesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/forest-department-to-radio-collar-wayward-baahubali/articleshow/83524658.cms||---

All the government and private schools in the district have begun the preliminary work for Class XI admission. “A group of girl students were waiting at the CCMA Government Girls Higher Secondary School. So, we issued applications for Class XI to those students alone. After the state government’s instruction, the admission procedure will be started in Coimbatore district,” Ramakrishnan said. The state government has allowed admission for classes I, VI, IX and XI only in 27 districts. In 11 districts, including Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode, where Covid cases are high, admission has not been allowed. Many government schools contacted their Class X students and collected their preferred subject group in Class XI over the phone. “Applications will be issued to the students after getting guidelines from the school education department. Later, the admission process would commence,” Ramakrishnan said. President of Tamil Nadu Private Schools Association R Visalakshi said the faculty members of the schools were asked to collect the student details through phone for Class XI admission.

The tree authority committee of the civic body recently gave its approval to remove and transplant 29 dangerous trees, a decision that did not go down well with the environmentalists. According to the environmentalists, the survey on dangerous trees should have been conducted by the environmentalists and the matter should have been discussed properly before such a decision was taken. They said these 29 trees are over 50 years old. Some environmentalists and tree lovers observed a day-long fast on Sunday, asking the NMC to save these trees instead of hacking them. A day before, the environmentalists and tree lovers had also resorted to Chipko agitation to protect trees. “It is unfortunate that the tree authority of the civic body has given its nod to axe 29 roadside trees in the city. These trees are around 50 to 70 years old and it is sad to see they have taken such a decision at a time when the state government has declared trees above 50 years as heritage trees,” Jalbir Singh, an environmentalist, said. “Hence, we along with 25 other environmentalists and tree lovers observed a day-long fast at our homes to protest against the NMC’s decision,” he added. Environmentalists Rohan Deshpande, Ashwini Bhatt, Uday Thorat and others had resorted to Chipko agitation on Saturday. “We have already approached the divisional revenue commissioner Radhakrishna Game and district collector Suraj Mandahre on the issue of saving these trees. We are also going to meet municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav in a day or two to discuss the issue,” Bhatt said. “The NMC should have conducted a spot survey of these road-side trees through city environmentalists to verify whether these trees are really dangerous. These trees can be saved by making changes in road alignment,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/greens-oppose-nmcs-decision-to-remove-29-dangerous-trees/articleshow/83517310.cms||Tushar Pawar

Four months after awarding the Rs 536-crore contract, the BMC issued a notice to the company threatening to terminate it for failing to submit key documents related to the project and starting work. The BMC has also threatened to blacklist the firm. Times ViewThe Rs 536-crore hybrid power plant project at Middle Vaitarna dam would have helped the BMC generate 100MW of power and given a boost to renewable energy generation too. There are several such projects that are announced but are caught up in irregularities and red tape. The BMC must now ensure that either work is started by the same company or a new one and the project is completed without further delay.In February, the BMC cleared the proposal for the 100MW hybrid power plant, becoming the first local body in the country to do so. The contract was awarded to a joint venture between Shapoorji Pallonji & Company and Mahalaxmi Konal Urja. The power plant was to generate 20MW and the floating solar photovoltaic plant 80MW. The project was expected to be ready in 31 months. “In terms of units, the two plants were to generate about 208 million units of energy per year and save Rs 24.18 crore a year in electricity costs. The generated power was to be supplied to state-run power agencies. In lieu of that, the BMC would get an adjustment in its power bills,” a civic official said. In May, BMC’s chief engineer SB Uchagaonkar water supply projects) said that as per the tender conditions, the company had to submit performance security, legal and stationary charges, documents related to incorporation of the JV, the memorandum of association, details of promoters and their shareholding in the JV, bank guarantees and agreement within 30 days. Despite several reminders, the company hasn’t complied with the conditions and now has sought more time to submit the documents. “You were intimated about the fact that non-compliance of the conditions within the stipulated time would lead to cancellation of the letter of award (LoA)…two months beyond the stipulated time are getting over..it is regretted that you have not even submitted proof of payment, documents of incorporation of project company for executing the project etc…you are called upon to furnish the requisite compliances till the end of first week on June failing which action like cancellation of LoA will be initiated including blacklisting,” Uchgaonkar said in the notice. When contacted, Shapoorji Pallonji & Company declined to comment on the issue. “The company has submitted a letter requesting for more time due to lockdown. We will consider the request based on merit,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmcs-hybrid-power-plant-at-middle-vaitarna-hits-a-snag/articleshow/83524666.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Kochi||Reinstate tree-felling order: Kisan Sabha||IDUKKI: All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), Kerala, the farmers’ wing of CPI, has demanded that the government should reinstate the controversial tree cutting order issued on October 24 last year. The order was withdrawn later in March this year. Talking to TOI, AIKS state vice-president Mathew Varghese said that there was no need to withdraw the order allowing farmers to cut trees on revenue land assigned for cultivation. “The order was issued to save the interests of farmers. Before issuing the order two all-party meetings were held and all-party members, including former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, had attended the meeting. No parties had raised any objection to the order before it was issued. In our opinion, the order is not controversial,” said Varghese. “The title deed holder pays ‘tree tax’ for the trees on the patta land and the farmers have the ownership of such trees. But now the farmers are begging to get passes from revenue and forest lands for tree cutting. The government should allow the cutting of all trees except sandalwood from the title deed lands. The government should amend the 1964 rule to facilitate tree cutting,” said Varghese. Meanwhile, the forest vigilance squads are continuing their inspection in various parts of the district to find illegal tree-felling. A team led by forest flying squad DFO A Shanavaz will inspect all ranges under Kottayam and Idukki districts.  “In Chinnakkanal alone 143 trees were cut under the shield of the order. Tree cutting was reported in Adimali, Ponmudi, Ayyappancovil, Mankuva, Udumbanchola and Rajakkad areas,” sources said. Devikulam sub-collector S Premkrishnan said, “I have asked Devikulam and Udumbanchola tahsildars to submit the details of applications submitted for tree-felling after the revenue department order.” Officials of Ayyappancovil range have unearthed nearly six loads of timber from Vellilamkandam near Kattappana, allegedly felled from the Cardamom Hills Reserve (CHR) area. According to officials, a preliminary inquiry revealed that CPI local leader and former president of Kanchiyar panchayat was involved in bringing the timber to use in cardamom dryer units. The forest officials said that they had not issued passes for tree cutting in the CHR area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/reinstate-tree-felling-order-kisan-sabha/articleshow/83520575.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The surge proved to a great equalizer, as the share of the four districts in the next 5,000 cases fell to 55%. “The statistics indicate a very high mortality in other districts of Gujarat. Against the overall mortality of 1.1% in the last 5,000 cases, Surendranagar recorded a mortality rate of 2.8%, Dang and Devbhoomi Dwarka 2.6.%, Botad and Sabarkantha 2.5%, and Morbi 2.4%,” said a city-based epidemiologist. “While Covid deaths remained high overall among the cities due to more cases, the mortality rate shot up in smaller districts with relatively fewer cases.” Experts also pointed out the skewed geographic distribution of mortality. Saurashtra in the past two months saw relatively more deaths. For example, Surendranagar in the first 5,000 deaths recorded 16 deaths, compared to 120 in the second wave. Junagadh in the first wave had 37 deaths compared to 228 in the second. Ahmedabad had 2,542 deaths in the first wave and 841 in the second. Surat had 1,218 deaths in the first and 723 in the second. “The numbers should be seen as an indicators – the actual mortality rate may be higher due to the fact that deaths when a patient is positive are relatively fewer compared to those from post-Covid impact ranging from heart attacks to blood clotting and lung fibrosis. The cause of death must be studied and the regional variation must also be considered to prepare for the third wave and reduce mortality,” said a city-based critical care specialist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-crosses-10k-covid-deaths-figure/articleshow/83524709.cms||Parth Shastri

Coronavirus has claimed so many lives that there is no space to even conduct last rites, they were told. “We explained that by not wearing masks, they were putting their own lives and others’ lives in danger,” said a panchayat official. As many as 300 cases are reported in Arasur and neighbouring panchayats a day, the official said. “Almost 9% of daily cases are reported from here. Many youngsters without comorbidities are dying due to the virus.” Last year, during the Covid-19 first wave, Arasur panchayat was the first in the district to quarantine itself completely.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Implement Nag River rejuvenation plan at earliest: Bombay high court||NAGPUR: Expressing concern over unabated pollution in Nag River despite its repeated orders, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Monday slammed civic authorities for negligence. Quoting various media reports that highlighted how garbage is still accumulated and sewage water flows in the iconic river after which the city was named, the court called on the authorities to implement its rejuvenation plan at the earliest. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor also directed the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to submit all details for the river’s revised rejuvenation plan within two weeks. The directives came while hearing a suo motu PIL (No 1/2020) based on various media reports highlighting the plight of the historic river that has now turned into a veritable nullah for dumping sewage. Nikhil Padhye has been appointed as amicus curiae in the PIL. Pointing towards the river’s contaminated water polluting the Gosikhurd dam, the bench observed that many viruses like E coli and others were found in it, which pose danger to humans. “Such pitiable condition of the city’s biggest water source is a matter of serious concern. Especially in the pandemic era, where clean drinking water should be a priority, such a condition of the iconic river is hard to believe. It’s necessary to give new life to it and for that, it needs to be thoroughly cleaned and all sources of pollution should be immediately sealed,” the judges said. Earlier, NMC counsel Sudhir Puranik informed about revised Development Project Report (DPR) of the river, where Rs2,400 crore would be spent for its rejuvenation. It would be cleaned in four phases and would be provided a new lease of life. The first phase would involve its cleaning and deepening, followed by plantation work on its borders. Removal of massive encroachments over it would be taken up in the next phase. The bench then asked Puranik if NMC has sufficient budget to implement the DPR and from where funds would be raised, if it’s in financial constraints. Various media reports have highlighted how dirt and slush flows through the river, which flows from Central Telegraph Office’s (CTO) backside and adjacent to Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC). As it hasn't been cleaned in a long time, foul smell emanating from it makes life difficult for the nearby residents. Due to slush, stray pigs have started roaming in the area in large numbers, adding to people’s woes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/implement-nag-river-rejuvenation-plan-at-earliest-hc/articleshow/83524662.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Seven major government hospitals have already been equipped with oxygen plants, while the nine CHCs will have their own plants by July end. There will be no dearth of oxygen for needy patients even at the primary health centres as they have been equipped with oxygen concentrators, health department officials informed TOI on Monday. “Today, Varanasi has a maximum number of oxygen plants in hospitals including those that are operational in the state,” divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal told TOI on Monday. “Over 900 beds in government hospitals were covered with oxygen supply lines before the second wave of Covid-19 arrived in April, but the entire supply was dependent on cylinders refilled at a few units in the private sector,” said district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma. It was the same month when demand for oxygenated beds and ventilators had gone above the mark of 2,000 while supply of oxygen in cylinders was insufficient. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced to set up oxygen plants in every district from the PM Cares Fund on April 25. In less than a week of the announcement, the first oxygen plant of 613 LPM was installed at DDU District Hospital on April 30 while another plant of 500 LPM at the hospital was made operational on Monday. The commissioner said that not only all the percent beds of DDU hospital, but even its maternity and child wing have also been equipped as oxygenated beds. Both these plants have come up through CSR funds, he said. “The SPG Divisional Hospital will also get two plants of 1,000 LPM and 960 LPM by July 15 from CSR funds of two companies,” said Sharma adding, “the plants at LBS Hospital Ramnagar (120 LPM), ESIC Hospital (500 LPM and 613 LPM), Government Ayurvedic College (640 LPM), BLW Railway Hospital (610) LPM, SSL Hospital of BHU (600 LPM) and Mahamana Cancer Centre (613) have also been funded by different organisations or CSR of private companies. “The oxygen plants at CHCs of Cholapur (200 LPM), Narpatpur Chiraigaon (150 LPM), Araziline (283 LPM), Gangapur Pindra (283 LPM) and Hathi Bazar Sevapuri (200 LPM) are also being funded by CSR of companies and even government department,” said the officials adding, “oxygen plants are also proposed at four other CHCs and for them funds will be arranged from government or CSR.” Sharma said some hospitals like DDU District Hospital, SPG Divisional Hospital, ESIC Hospital and LBS Hospital are getting double oxygen plants. “All the oxygen plants proposed so far will become operational by July-end, after which over 1,000 oxygenated beds will become available in these government hospitals,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/all-govt-hospitals-in-varanasi-to-have-own-o2-plants-by-end-of-july/articleshow/83524044.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Allahabad||Early monsoon hits Prayagraj after two decades||PRAYAGRAJ: The entire northern parts of the country is witnessing overcast conditions and receiving heavy showers for the past 24 hours. This has baffled the weather experts as it is after around two decades that this part of the country, including Prayagraj has received early monsoon. Weather experts have termed it as a ‘freak weather phenomenon’ aggravated by two recent cyclones — Tauktae in Arabian sea and Yaas in Bay of Bengal. In the past 24 hours (Sunday to Monday evening), the city has received 69.6 millimetres (MM) of rainfall. Since Monday morning, the city has received 37 mm of rainfall. Experts believe this may be because of the two strong cyclones that the country has witnessed last month and suggest that there could be a long gap of dry spell after these early showers. On Sunday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 29.9 degrees while the minimum was 26.6 degrees Celsius. On the second day in a row, the city was devoid of sunshine and as a result, the maximum temperature on Monday was recorded at 29.1 degrees while the minimum temperature was recorded at 25.4 degrees Celsius. In terms of rainfall, the city received heavy to light rains in the intervening night of Sunday-Monday but during the day time, the weather was quite comfortable as almost the entire city received heavy to light rainfall with some localities receiving occasional drizzle. As per the Indian meteorological department (IMD), the normal date for onset of monsoon in Prayagraj is June 18-20. By June 25, the monsoon covers the entire state. “However, for the past around two decades, the monsoon was arriving in late June or first week of July and the weather experts had in fact started debating on the need of making the changes in the date of arrival of monsoon. But here we are witnessing an early arrival of the monsoon, a phenomenon which should be studied thoroughly,” said former head of the department and renowned geographer of the city, Prof Savindra Singh. He further explained, “Among several reasons, for the early shift in monsoon one could be the two strong cyclones — Tauktae in Arabian sea and Yaas in Bay of Bengal — that had arrived within a small gap and could have affected this alteration.” Supporting his argument, the present HoD and expert in desertification and climate changes, Prof AR Siddiqui told TOI, “This could be termed as ‘freak weather phenomenon’ and the two cyclones surely have caused this change. But at the same time, farmers have to be very careful as there could be long dry spells which could affect their agricultural cycle.” This early arrival of monsoon has also taken the farming community aback. “Many of the farmers have not even prepared the nursery of paddy which is usually planted in the first week of next month. Although the present rainfall has helped us plough our land, prepare it for paddy and we pray to almighty for good rains this year too,” said Udham Singh, a farmer of Sarai Inyaat area. The weather experts have predicted cloudy conditions for the next 48 hours as thick cloud cover would dominate the sky with intermittent heavy to light rainfall across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/early-monsoon-hits-city-after-two-decades/articleshow/83524403.cms||---

The boy was rescued in Dhariya village by a joint team of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the Army and the district administration. The boy was stuck midway in the nine-inch-wide borewell after he fell into it while playing near his home. The borewell was dug by his father Chhote Lal, about 20-feet from their house, after the submersible pump which the family used to irrigate the field stopped working. “The farmer left the hole uncovered,” said police. Finally, the NDRF team dropped a rope inside the bore well and locked it on to the child’s arm and pulled him up, said the SP.Agra SSP Muniraj G, who was on the spot, told TOI, “The boy was rescued and examined by a team of doctors. He was later shifted to the primary health centre where he is in a stable condition.” SP (East Agra) K Venkat Ashok said rescue operations started at 9am and ended at 4:30pm.“We pumped in oxygen into the borewell and dropped down ORS and biscuits for the child. Two cameras were dropped to constantly monitor the boy,” he said. “We knew the boy was fine since he was responding from down there.” The massive operation saw in attendance 32 personnel of the NDRF, an equal number of Army personnel from Para brigade, 28 personnel of the SDRF and local authorities.Finally, the NDRF team dropped a rope inside the bore well and locked it on to the child’s arm and pulled him up, said the SP.

---||Coimbatore||Officer who stood up to the British for teakwood forests||When Hugo Francis Andrew Wood was posted in the hills surrounding Coimbatore in the 1900s, he used to wear a shirt with four pockets containing teakwood seeds and walk with a stick in the reserve forest in Topslip every day. He would sow the seeds in the area and created a teakwood forest in Topslip near Pollachi which had been completely destroyed by British government before Wood’s arrival. His contribution is remembered till now. And so to mark the 151st birthday of the British forest officer, forest officials paid their respects to Wood’s grave at Topslip in Coimbatore on Saturday. Frontline staff from the Topslip forest range decorated the cemetery with flowers and saluted to the late British forest officer Hugo Wood. Born on June 12, 1870 to Scottish parents in Bombay presidency. After joining the imperial forest service (IFS) in 1890, received his professional training at Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper’s Hill, came to India during 1893. He worked in Madras Presidency up to his retirement in 1926, holding various positions such as the assistant conservator of forests, deputy conservator of forests and later the conservator of forests in 1918. Before the British arrived, many rosewood and teakwood trees were found in Anaimalai reserve forest in Coimbatore district. The British axed them down and sent it to the Bombay to construct ships for the British Royal Army. The entire forest in Anaimalai was destroyed by the British between 1800 and 1900. The Mount Stuart Tramway was used to transport timber from Topslip through Parambikulam. In 1915, Hugo Wood was appointed in Coimbatore district. Appalled by the destruction, he focused on growing teakwood trees in the Anaimalai forest. When the British government approached him to axe trees for construction of ships for World War I, he did not allow it. He worked at Anaimalai till 1919. S Ramasubramanian, conservator of forests, Thanjavur circle, told TOI that without Hugo Wood, the dense forest that the Anaimalai hills boasts today wouldn’t have been a reality. “Huho Wood’s epitaph read, ‘If you want to see me, look around’. He committed his life for the forest and he died for the forest,” said Ramasubramanian. Hugo Wood died at the age of 63 in Nilgiris district and his body was buried at Topslip near Pollachi in Coimbatore district.

Addressing the media on Monday, he said that the objective of the department order, issued during the previous LDF government, was to address the demands raised by farmers living in assigned lands, especially hilly areas. "The order was issued as a creative response to the long-pending public demand, but it was revoked when it came to the notice of the government that it was being misused… The government was guided by the good intention to help farmers who were assigned land and were facing the situation of not being able to fell even a single tree," he added. The minister said that he had asked the probe team to submit a preliminary report within two days and actions would be taken against officers if it is found that they have committed illegal activities. He said that the ongoing multi-department probe comprising vigilance, police crime branch and forest would look into all aspects of the case, including allegations levelled against some forest department officers. When asked if government would issue a new order to replace the revoked order, Saseendran said tens of thousands of farmers in state are wishing for a law which would enable protection of trees which are to be conserved and also protect their rights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-lapse-from-revenue-dept-forest-minister/articleshow/83520588.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Beat marshal policing makes way for commando cops on modified bike||NAGPUR: A new era of bike-borne commandos was ushered in by city police on Monday modifying the old concept of Charlie or beat marshal policing. Around 72 specially designed bikes, fitted with public address system and sirens, were introduced along with 14 patrolling vehicles purchased through district planning and development council (DPDC) with a budgetary allocation of over Rs1.64 crore. Around 464 commando technique trained cops would be using the bikes. The patrolling vehicles would be an important addition to the fleet of vehicles which shall be associated with the proposed multi-purpose emergency response system management through common dialling facility of 112, which is expected to kick start soon. “These commandos would keep 78 points, identified as black spots for women, under surveillance and also visit senior citizens staying alone,” said CP Amitesh Kumar. “The commandos would also essentially check hardened goons on records, externee (tadipaar) and other criminals. They are expected to be the first responders,” said the CP, who also urged the commandos to act within the framework of law and ensure department’s image is not blotted. “Don’t hit or lose temper with citizens,” the top cop told the commandos. District guardian minister Nitin Raut, who had flagged off the new fleet of modified bikes and Bolero jeeps, said during the inauguration at Takli police headquarters that he shall ensure budgetary provisions for more projects of the city police for bettering the law and order and improving the citizens’ security. He also extolled the new-look commando team. “The cops in commando fatigue and modern bikes would render a different look to the newly deployed patrolling police personnel. These commandos would be the first responders to tackle harassment to women or other issues alerted by the control room,” said Raut. “City police can also plan to set up makeshift kiosks at different places with changing rooms for patrolling cops. We will try to provide budgets for such a project too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/beat-marshal-policing-makes-way-for-commando-cops-on-modified-bike/articleshow/83524778.cms||Soumitra Bose

By collaborating with the blood banks at Sree Chithra Thirunal Institute of Medical Science and Technology (SCTIMST) and Regional Cancer Centre (RCC), the SPC organized the camp as part of the Jeevadhara Blood Donors Bank. “It was a challenge to organize a blood donation camp during the time of the pandemic. But this camp was the need of the hour. In the present scenario, the requirement for blood is high,” said Sabu N, community police officer SPC, Government High School, Avanavanchery, Attingal. “Understanding the need of society, it was SPC state nodal officer and IG P Vijayan who put forth the idea of organizing a camp. We had ensured to maintain the Covid protocols throughout the camp. The donors were transported in police vehicles. Also, we plan to organize various camps in the coming weeks,” he added. The camps were held from 8am to 1pm at SCTIMST and RCC. At a time six people could donate the blood. Within this time span, 102 people had donated the blood. The donors were selected after thorough screening. It was ensured that the donors are in good health and they satisfied the normal criteria of a blood donor, including weight. Meanwhile, some of the donors had received Covid-19 jabs 14 days before. The donors mainly included pioneer cadets of SPC who are above 18, parents of SPCs, teachers, police personnel in the SPC directorate and drill instructors. SPC is planning to organize blood donation camps in the next week in five sub-divisions under Thiruvananthapuram Rural, including Attingal, Varkala, Neyyattinkara, Nedumangad and Kattakada. The camp, led by assistant state nodal officer G Prathapan Nair and assistant district nodal officer T S Anilkumar, was inaugurated by excise vigilance superintendent Mohamed Shafi. After accepting the consent form from the donors, a blood donors’ forum was also formed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/spc-conducts-blood-donation-camp/articleshow/83522489.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Hotel satellite units being shut after case dip||Kolkata: Satellite centres in hotels opened by hospitals during the peak period of the second wave are now gradually closing down following a sharp fall in positivity rate over the last fortnight. Even stadiums that were converted into field hospitals, like Kishore Bharati and Salt Lake stadium, are being utilized as vaccination centres by the hospitals. These units accommodated Covid patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, where the attached hospital treated them under the care and guidance of their medical teams. President of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) Sudesh Poddar told TOI that hospitals are now releasing hotel rooms that were used as satellite centres because of a sharp decline in the number of patients in the last two weeks. According to Poddar, in the first week of May, the peak period of the second wave in the state, around 2,200-2,300 rooms were still being used as satellite centres across 35-40 hotels. “The occupancy during the peak period was 90%-100% in most of them. At that time, it was difficult to get a bed. Now the occupancy level in such facilities has gone down to 10%-15% or less as a whole,” he said. The general manager of Lalit Great Eastern, Dilip Mishra, said the hotel has started the process to discontinue its satellite facility from Monday, June 14, as there is no patient now. Lalit Great Eastern had a tie-up with AMRI and had one of the biggest satellite facilities in the city with 100 rooms and 200 beds. “We are now preparing ourselves for normal guests,” he said. President of Associations of Hospitals of Eastern India, and Group CEO of AMRI, Rupak Barua told TOI the hospitals have started to close down satellite facilities as there is not much demand at present. “Most of the rooms in satellite facilities have been closed,” he said. According to Barua, AMRI had converted Salt Lake stadium into a Covid hospital, which is now being used mostly for vaccination. “We will continue the Salt Lake facility for sometime, as long as there is a risk of a third wave,” he said. The chairman of Medica Group, Aloke Roy, said the hospital was facilitating 5,000 vaccinations per day at Kishore Bharati Stadium, which had been converted into a Covid hospital in association with ITC. The tie-up between hotels and hospitals for satellite beds was a lifeline during the second wave of Covid. During the peak period, most of the hospitals had a waiting list of 100 patients. HRAEI had joined hands with the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) to solve the acute problem. HRAEI has over 800 members in Bengal and has 60,000 beds under its members. During the first wave of Covid, too, the association had offered over 1,000 rooms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hotel-satellite-units-being-shut-after-case-dip/articleshow/83510471.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Shield against third wave: West Bengal government to keep 10,000 beds for women, kids||KOLKATA: In an effort against the possible third wave, the state government has begun hauling up its paediatric health facilities. It’s planning to earmark 10,000 general beds for women and paediatric Covid infected patients. Preparations are on to earmark 1,300 paediatric intensive care units (PICU) across 91 state-run hospitals across Bengal and 350 SNCU (special newborn care units) in 70 hospitals. On Tuesday, the state health department came out with an extensive order on the specifics on its preparations. TOI on Monday reported about the state government’s major revamp with focus on children, who are likely to be more affected if the third wave strikes. Scientists and health experts apprehend the third wave to hit India around October-November. “In Kolkata, 10 hospitals together will have around 240 PICU beds for Covid care while nine other government-run hospitals in the city will have 70 SNCU beds. Some of these hospitals have already started working on it. We cannot afford to lose time,” said a senior health department official. While mild to moderate positive children between 90 days to 12 years of age will be admitted to the 10,000 beds earmarked for the mothers and their kids, 20% of the SNCU beds that the state currently has — which is around 350 beds — will be utilised for newborns aged between one day and 90 days with mild to critical infections. In addition, 1,300 PICUs will be set up in the existing Covid CCUs and HDUs in medical college hospitals, district hospitals and sub-divisional hospitals. “The existing PICU and NICU (newborn intensive care units) will continue to cater to children suffering from non-Covid ailment. The 1,300 beds dedicated for Covid care will be carved out of the existing adult Covid CCU and HDU beds,” said the official. The state has also planned to link every primary tier facility with the nearest higher health unit. While tele-medicine facilities from these higher set-ups will be available, transport and other logistics are also being worked out in case any infected kid requires better medical care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shield-against-3rd-wave-govt-to-keep-10k-beds-for-women-kids/articleshow/83522506.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Agra||A karate player with over 60 tournament medals selling tea in Mathura||AGRA: From drawing applause at international karate events for flawless strikes to brewing tea at a stall along an alley in Mathura, Hari Om Shukla’s descent from stardom to obscurity was a quick one. Just five years ago, he was a different person altogether. By the age of 23, he had punched his way through 60 medals in junior and senior categories at karate tournaments. But, with funds drying up, no job to support his family despite a science degree and forgotten by the government, Shukla, 28, was left with no other choice. “I used to work in a private educational institute whose management was supporting me in pursuing my passion. But, later, they stopped the funding,” Shukla said. Then he took up teaching karate to school children. It didn’t last long due to the lockdown. “After that I started teaching karate to children in Mathura… and was earning about Rs 4,000 per month. But due to the lockdown people stopped sending their children and I was out of job again,” Shukla told TOI. The circumstances took him to his father’s tea stall. “So I started sitting at my father’s tea shop. I don’t have anything else to do now,” he said.The circumstances took him to his father’s tea stall. “So I started sitting at my father’s tea shop. I don’t have anything else to do now,” he said. “My son is two-year-old and there are expenses which I can’t avoid. So I decided to help my father and also earn some money,” Shukla said, as he showed some of the medals. “I don’t have money to even pay to get a copy of my graduation degree.” “My son is two-year-old and there are expenses which I can’t avoid. So I decided to help my father and also earn some money,” Shukla said, as he showed some of the medals. “I don’t have money to even pay to get a copy of my graduation degree.”“I have also met MP Hema Malini, power minister Shrikant Sharma but nothing has been done so far,” he claimed. A resident of Mathura, Shukla had started training for karate in 2006. He was 13 then. After several junior-level medals, Shukla’s first international medal came when he participated in an event in Thailand. In 2009, he won a bronze medal in Kumite at 14th International Funakoshi Cup Karate Championship in Mumbai. Shukla won gold and silver medals in 2013 in Thailand, which was organised by World Kumite Organisation. In 2015, Shukla won a gold medal in the Senior Men’s Kumite tournament under ‘75-80 kg’ in Sri Lanka. He also bagged the silver medal in Senior Men’s Kata ‘open group’ in the same event organised by International Shotokai Karate-DO Federation, Sri Lanka. President of traditional Shotokan Karate Federation India, Amit Gupta, who was Shukla’s coach, said that the government should support athletes. “The government can provide him a job as a coach in some school so that he can earn and also pursue his passion by preparing athletes,” Gupta said. “Karate is enrolled in the Tokyo Olympics. But due to internal politics, no player from India will be able to participate in it. This game is almost on the verge of extinction due to politics,” Gupta claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/a-karate-player-with-over-60-tournament-medals-selling-tea-in-mathura/articleshow/83522538.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Ahmedabad||Keeping the blood flowing||AHMEDABAD: Four of every 100 people in the city are blood donors, said Dr Vishwas Amin, director of the blood bank of Indian Red Cross Society in Ahmedabad. “It makes me proud of how far the people of the city have come to help their own. It shows that the people of Ahmedabad are very aware of the importance of blood donation,” he said. The city, which has scores of Centurion blood donors, saw blood banks run dry with many making public appeals to citizens to donate. “We saw a drastic fall in blood donations due to Covid-19 pandemic. People were scared to come out of their homes to donate blood,” said Amin. Due to the lockdown, the rate of donation dropped by about 50% overall. He said Ahmedabad is still a developing medical hub and sometimes more blood is needed than usual. To compensate, the Red Cross Society set up vans to collect blood giving donors an in-house collection facility. Dr Ripal Shah, director of Prathama Blood Bank, said they had to contact regular donors to ensure they got blood for essential procedures. “We want to thank all donors who came forward and helped save lives. Today several Covid-recovered patients are also in need of haemoglobin, while Covid patients need blood plasma. We want to appeal to all to come forward and donate blood,” she said. Dr Amin said there is a stipulated period between vaccination and blood donation. “We appeal to citizens to donate blood before they get vaccinated,” he said. Pritesh Mehta, assistant general manager at ADC Bank told TOI that they collaborated with the Red Cross Society to conduct 101 blood donation camps at their 101 branches to help children with thalassemia. “We got 1,000 units for the children. As humans, we felt obligated to help them and give back to society,” he said. Dinesh Bahl, a Vastrapur resident, said he donated blood twice during the pandemic for friends. “I know how difficult it was to arrange for blood when someone had a surgery. I appeal to all to resume donating blood,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/keeping-the-blood-flowing/articleshow/83524820.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Online schooling 2.0: Maharashtra to focus on wider access & virtual discipline||MUMBAI: As schools in Maharashtra, barring Vidarbha, reopen online for the second year in a row from Tuesday, both state and educational institutes are finding ways to make e-learning more effective. The Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training (MSCERT) has prepared 45 days of bridge courses for students of Classes II to X. The courses will cover important topics from the previous year. Deputy director at MSCERT Vikas Garad said, “We have 2.25 crore students in Classes I to XII. The bridge course for each subject and class is ready and will be launched when all schools reopen on June 26,” said Garad. MSCERT has also tied up with Doordarshan’s Sahyadri channel, along with its own Youtube channel, to impart lessons from Mondays to Fridays. A survey to understand how many students have access to online modes of education will also start in all schools from Tuesday, said Garad. The decision was taken after a survey on students in Classes I to VIII by SCERT and Unicef found that only 50% students were able to access home learning online package devised by SCERT. Besides, even among students with access, more than 50% spent less than an hour in the online module. Activists and teachers too are worried about the reach of online education. Reports released by the Shantilal Muttha Foundation in April and the Active Teachers Forum last May indicate that the number of students who have access to online education is less than 50% and access to television and radio is not good in rural areas. The condition of the urban poor, especially with the pandemic induced financial crunch, means spending money on cell phones and internet recharges are least of priority. Pune-based Learning Loss Recovery Programme by the District Institute for Education and Training said 89% of parents and 94% of teachers feel there has been loss of learning in 2020-21. Meanwhile, institutes on their part are going that extra mile to make students comfortable in their ‘home schools’. Right from taking feedback from students to bringing in physical school-like discipline, schools want students to make the most of virtual learning. At the Laxmibai High School in Mulund, teacher Abhishek Kulkarni will conduct online lessons from the classroom, at least thrice a week. “Students were missing their school. When they saw me interacting with them from their classroom, they were thrilled,” said Kulkarni. He used a projector and the blackboard while conducting his orientation sessions with students on Monday. But schools have stressed on maintaining discipline during online school hours. Many are telling students to treat virtual classrooms like the physical ones. “Being on time in class, tidying up before sitting in front of the laptop/mobile have to be inculcated in students to bring a sense of seriousness during e-learning,” said Ramesh Disle, a Chembur school teacher. What schools may have to compromise on is uniforms. “Many of our students won’t fit into their pinafore uniforms, and parents are worried. We will have to allow students in casual outfits,” said Zarine Nizamuddin, a teacher at St Joseph’s school in Vile Parle.

AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, “Crores of people made offerings at the feet of God because of their faith and devotion.

Most malls recorded footfalls in the range of 15-20%, with about 85% shops open for business. Shops catering to fashion, beauty and electronics attracted most customers, many of whom came with an intent to purchase something. “Malls are generally not crowded on Mondays, and due to the pandemic, there were even fewer visitors,” said a visitor at Pheonix Marketcity, Vimannagar. Kinjal Radia, centre director, The Pavillion, said, “There was excitement among retailers and customers, and we saw a quick turnaround in terms of business.” Mahesh M, chief executive officer, Creaticity, Yerawada, said, “We received quit a few enquiries regarding home makeover or work from home furniture.” Unlike malls, where the footfall was low-key, there was buzz at restaurants. “We weren't expecting many people today, but the turnout was good,” said Somesh Narwani, manager, High Spirits, Koregaon Park. Sandy Singh, partner at Swig, Euriska and Prem's, said, “We had touched 50% capacity, and could not accommodate many people.” Sayali Joshi, who took her family out for dinner at a restaurant on FC Road, said, “Many people were out and about in the evening.

---||Mumbai||Barge disaster may be outside India’s labour laws’ purview||NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Onus of the Mumbai barge disaster could end up at the door of Durmast Enterprises Ltd under the international regulatory regime for seafaring vessels and personnel as the incident took place outside India’s territorial boundary extending up to 12 nautical miles from the shore. Durmast owns the ill-fated barge Papaa 305 that was chartered by Afcons Infrastructure for an ONGC contract. Seventy-five persons died as the barge, carrying 261 on board, broke anchor in Cyclone Tauktae and sank on May 19, after hitting a nearby ONGC offshore platform off Mumbai coast. Another 11 died as tugboat Varapada capsized. A panel set up by the oil ministry and Mumbai Police are separately investigating the disaster to find possible lapses and fix responsibility. Sources said the probe will be guided by International Labour Organisation’s Maritime Labour Convention and International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). These are two of four pillars of global maritime regulatory regime and deal with safety of seafarers and vessels. “SOLAS puts the onus of safety of vessel and personnel on the head (captain/master) of the maritime crew manning a ship and its owner. The incident took place beyond the territorial boundary, where Indian labour laws or Industrial Disputes Act do not apply. Even though ONGC may be considered principal employer, it will be difficult to pin the onus on the company unless lapses by it are established,” a source said. ONGC suspended three senior executives handling offshore operations to ensure a fair probe but has not debarred Afcons and its partners from working in other ONGC projects. Mumbai Police had summoned five companies for statements after lodging a complaint of culpable homicide. ONGC and Afcons have announced cash and other relief for the family of deceased and those rescued. The workers were hired by contractors. Afcons on May 21 appeared to blame the barge master’s misjudgement. “The barge moved only 200 metres away from the unmanned offshore platform where it was working, a distance the master appears to have considered safe as per projections of Tauktae’s wind speed and depression,” the statement said. Other than MLC and SOLAS, there are International Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) and International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping (STCW). Meanwhile, seven families of the barge’s deceased have again been called to Mumbai to give fresh blood samples of the deceased’s parents to tally them with the bodies’ DNA results. Earlier, the brother or son of the deceased had given blood samples for matching with the deceased’s DNA. But in some cases either the DNA test report did not match the family or in few cases the families were not satisfied with DNA report results. “Blood samples of seven close family members like mother/father of a person have been taken to match it with bodies. In some cases, blood samples’ reports did not match with any body. Hence, parents were called,” said a police officer of Yellow Gate police station. The parents were taken to Nagpada police hospital, where their blood samples were collected. ONGC has arranged travel and accommodation of families here. “Two bodies were identified by Navy officials based on certain documents but families did not claim it since they were not satisfied. One body was from P305 and another could be a crew member of the tug Varaprada, which sank the same day. Barge P305 and Varaprada sank on May 17 during Cyclone Tautkae in the Arabian Sea at separate spots. While two crew of Varaprada were rescued by INS Kolkata, 11 drowned. “We handed over 64 bodies of P305 workers. Seven are lying at JJ mortuary. Besides, eight bodies were brought from Raigarh, and some could be Varaprada crew,” police said. Raigarh police registered accidental death cases and are probing them. On the other hand, Yellow Gate police registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against P305’s deceased captain, Rakesh Ballav, and several others. Ballav’s family had claimed his body last week. A male body, washed ashore at Marine Drive on June 9, was also sent to JJ hospital and its DNA sample has been collected to find out if it was part of P305 or Varaprada. “It’s decomposed. A DNA test may help establish the person’s identity,” a police officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-barge-disaster-may-be-outside-labour-laws-purview/articleshow/83522629.cms||Sanjay Dutta

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Nirbhaya home to get Rs 15-lakh facelift||Thiruvananthapuram: The Nirbhaya shelter home for women and children at Poojappura will soon get a facelift. According to a government order issued in this regard, Rs 15.50 lakh has been allocated for the renovation of the shelter home, which started functioning in 2013. “Though the building that houses the shelter home looks stable, the roofs are leaking and bathrooms are in a dilapidated and untidy condition. Also, the inmates don’t have a proper space to dry their clothes. Considering all these difficulties we had proposed a plan and we expect to initiate the works without much delay,” said Nirbhaya Cell state coordinator Sreela Menon. As part of the renovation, the officials are planning to construct new bathrooms and to avoid congestion they have decided to build a dormitory, by joining two rooms. A separate area will be constructed as an entertainment space, damaged doors will be replaced, a new dining hall will be provided with benches and desks. In order to ensure space to dry clothes, roofing will be done in a small portion and the building will be painted. According to officials, no major revamp of the building was carried out since 2015. Nirbhaya shelter homes under Kerala Mahila Samakhya Society was launched by the department of social justice to house the victims of sexual abuse and human trafficking. As the building is located on a marshy area, it has affected the stability of bathrooms. “The walls of the bathrooms are cracked and it will collapse any time,” said an official. Another major threat the inmates and the officials in the shelter home face is issues related to the bad electrical connection. According to sources, though, a year ago, the PWD had carried out works worth Rs 50,000, it remain incomplete. “We used to get electric shock when we touch the walls, including the bathroom walls. Also, the electrical problems will affect the lifespan of our electronic appliances, including fridge, and the chance of short-circuit is also high. The last time when the fridge stopped functioning, we didn’t repair it as it has become a regular affair. Until the wiring issues are rectified, there is no point in repairing these appliances. The workers can’t resume the work without getting an order from the authorities. As the electrical work was initiated through a different proposal, it can’t be included in the present renovation programme,” said an official. The single-storey terraced building consisting of five rooms, including an office room, houses nearly 40 inmates against its capacity to accommodate 15 to 20 persons. Hence, the authorities are planning to shift some of the inmates to a similar home at Venjarammoodu. According to officials, besides five rooms, the building has a kitchen with a small storeroom, a dining area and a hall. The kitchen roof is leaking. Owing to lack of space, nearly 10 children sleep in the dining area and the same space has been used as the entertainment area. Also, out of eight bathrooms, only three to four are usable. Bathroom doors damaged and lack safe latches too. Majority of the rooms do not have doors, the kitchen door also is on the verge of collapse. Apart from the inmates nearly six to seven staff stay in the building. As the building doesn’t have proper storage facilities like shelves and cupboards, the inmates find it difficult to store their personal belongings. The shelter home without a compound wall has severe drainage issues too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nirbhaya-home-to-get-rs-15-lakh-facelift/articleshow/83522533.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Parks to open for 3 hours, morning walkers need double-dose vaccine proof||KOLKATA: The state government on Monday issued orders to reopen city parks and lakes for three hours in the morning, with a rider. Only fully vaccinated people will be allowed inside the green spaces. While addressing the media, the chief secretary clarified the same. “We have been demanding that parks be reopened in the morning and evening as it is tiresome to stay locked up at home. This is certainly a welcome move. But the requirement to display the vaccination certificate at the entrance complicates matters unnecessarily. How does it protect walkers from infection if we don’t follow social distancing protocol,” asked Ramen Ghosh Dastidar, a retired banker who has been a regular at Deshyapriya Park. A Kolkata Municipal Corporation parks department official said efforts were already on to reopen the gates of city’s major parks from Wednesday. “We will see how to conduct the checks at the entrance. But it may be difficult as most guards may not be able to read what’s written,” the official said. “Many people come at the lakes in the morning and it will be very difficult for the security guards to keep constant check at all the gates of Rabindra Sarobar to ensure that all have completed their Covid vaccine doses,” said a KMDA official. Hidco is opening Eco Park from June 16. “There are security guards at all the six gates and people who will come for morning walks will be allowed to enter by showing the second dose of vaccine certificate message on his/her mobile phone,” said a Hidco official. Morning walkers at Central Park expressed disappointment, pointing out that very few had completed both the doses as the minimum gap between two Covishield doses had been increased to 12 weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/parks-to-open-for-3-hours-morning-walkers-need-double-dose-vax-proof/articleshow/83522552.cms||Saikat Ray

The proposal of the hotmix plant will be tabled before the standing committee meeting on Tuesday. Sources said the civic body had never audited the patch work done earlier with road patcher machine. In 2019, the NMC had hired a machine as it could be used during the rains too. The technology was supposed to help in repairing potholes quicker. Materials available in readymade bags for repairing potholes was set in the potholes and compressed with the machine. Sources said though the machine was supposed to fix the potholes for at least a year, the material hardly remained intact for a week. The potholes repaired during the rainy season or wet condition failed to last for even a couple of days. The NMC’s hotmix department and jet patcher machine is also being used to repair potholes. TOI has earlier reported about bad condition of tar roads and over 2,234 potholes being repaired in the first two months of this financial year. The standing committee will also decide on appointing a new agency for mobile phone network. For this, the civic body will spend Rs50 lakh per annum, the proposal of the general administration department stated. The health department’s proposal to shortlist a firm for setting up 12 small sewage treatment plants in gardens alongside nullahs too will be presented for the panel’s approval. The NMC will spend Rs1.14 crore for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-plans-to-spend-rs2cr-on-road-patcher-machine/articleshow/83524833.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Land a concern for WTE plant in corporation||T’puram: The proposal to establish waste-to-energy (WTE) plant in Thiruvananthapuram is very much alive and land seems to be the only concern. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in his reply to a question on progress of major projects in the assembly dated June 7 said that waste-to-energy plants were proposed in eight clusters and in Thiruvananthapuram, and steps are being taken to identify the plot. The city corporation had earlier passed the agenda to find land for setting up WTE plant in the city without any discussion. However, while all other decisions were included in the minutes, the issue of the energy plant was put on hold since officials opined that it needed an elaborate review. The state government’s continuous insistence on WTE plant, coupled with mounting pressure from PCB, had forced corporation to consider centralized plant despite its ongoing decentralized waste management campaign. Incidentally, the interim report submitted to national green tribunal by Justice A V Ramakrishna Pillai, chairman, state-level monitoring committee on waste management, flagged concerns regarding WTE project at Brahmapuram. In the report sent to NGT regarding the progress of implementation of environmental laws in Kerala, the chairman said that announcement of WTE at Brahmapuram created a scenario where all stakeholders started thinking that there is no necessity of waste segregation as all the materials can be incinerated. Massive protests forced the government to abort the idea of establishing a WTE plant at Peringamala. The government then turned to the civic body to identify a plot for centralized plant following which it was included as an item in the agenda for corporation council meeting. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/land-a-concern-for-wte-plant-in-corporation/articleshow/83522590.cms||---

Officials from Pune Municipal Corporation and police personnel have pulled up errant shopkeepers and citizens. Data about the action taken was being compiled at the time of going to press. The authorities said they would intensify action in the coming days. PMC has set up flying squads to crack down on violations, while police have dispatched beat marshals at markets. Markets and other places in the city witnessed higher footfalls, with shops allowed to remain open till 7pm. “Our teams have been told to regularly check vulnerable locations that record high footfalls. Roadside eateries have been told to avoid unnecessary crowds and smaller shops have been told to control the rush at the counters,” deputy municipal commissioner Nitin Udas said. Sanjay Gawde, deputy municipal commissioner (Zone 1) said they had intensified action since last week. “We are also educating people on following social distancing and wearing masks,” Gawde said. Joint commissioner of Pune police Ravindra Shisve said teams of police visited different shopping districts in the city. “We told shopkeepers to maintain social distancing among customers and many were compliant. Beat marshals made random visits to malls and checked for violations,” Shisve said. Deputy commissioner of police (special branch) Mitesh Ghatte said they fined shopkeepers on Monday for neglecting Covid-appropriate behaviour and allowing too many customers on their premises. “We are compiling the figures of such cases,” he said. Suresh Shinde, who runs a small eatery near the Pune railway station, said that the extended timings will boost business. “We are expecting customers to return, but it could take some time. We will follow the necessary precautions,” Shinde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-civic-body-police-step-up-vigil-set-to-intensify-action-soon/articleshow/83524823.cms||---

The bull elephant will be used for patrolling with the 24 other elephants after completing a six-month quarantine. Veterinary experts of Dudhwa found the jumbo to be fit, but it will be kept under observation for any signs of anxiety caused by the new environment. Mahout Asif and fodder cutter Tinku Rai, who were taking care of Mithun in Varanasi, would stay in Dudhwa till it is trained by a local mahout. The elephant is currently lodged in Gulara forest outpost in Sonaripur range away from other camp elephants. Dudhwa field director Sanjay Pathak told TOI, “The bull elephant has not displayed any aggressive behaviour and remained calm since it arrived here. Dudhwa’s veterinary officer, Daya Shankar, along with a veterinarian from Wildlife SOS, Mathura, Dr Rahul Rajput, have examined Mithun and found it fit and healthy. Now, we have 25 camp elephants for patrolling in the reserve.” He was of the view that the elephant’s record of trampling a man to death could be an accident “as it didn’t harm anyone else or caused damage”. “Elephants are extremely sensible and do not attack unnecessarily. As per standard procedure, we will keep Mithun at a separate location with its mahout who was taking care of it in Varanasi. The local mahouts will also try to build a rapport with it. This may take six months or more or may be less. We will be giving it the same food which it was getting in Varanasi. We feed over 2.5 quintals of fodder, sugarcane and other items every day to ensure the elephant remains healthy,” Pathak added. The elephant is said to have belonged to one Ashok Tiwari of Jaunpur district who rented the animal at fairs and gatherings. In 2019, Mithun was sent along with another elephant to perform at the Ramlila fair in Chandauli. After the fair was over, on their way back home, its mahout Tulsiram stopped over at Paranpurkala village. He made Mithun bow and accept money with its trunk from people. But something annoyed the elephant when a local businessman offered money and it wound its trunk around the man, swung him up, threw him on the ground and trampled him to death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/jumbo-mithun-confined-in-varanasi-for-trampling-man-finds-new-home-in-dudhwa/articleshow/83522597.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Smooth drive for 15 lakh as learner’s licence now online||MUMBAI: More than 35 lakh citizens in Maharashtra will benefit annually from the new online learners’ licence system for four-wheelers and dealer point registration of vehicles, said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray while launching the two services on Monday. He said RTOs issued 15 lakh new learners’ licences every year, and registered over 20 lakh vehicles, but unfortunately the road space was almost the same. With a large number of drivers and vehicles on roads every year, the issue of parking needed to be tackled too, he pointed out at the online event. Thackeray said the online system has taken the burden off 200 RTO officials who will now focus on other work including enforcement on city roads and state highways. “As for citizens, the online system will save a lot of time, energy and money and you can get a learner’s licence sitting at home,” he said. The system will also save citizens and the RTO over Rs 100 crore annually, said transport minister Anil Parab. “There will also be no more waiting time to get appointments for a learner’s licence,” he said. “Of the 110 services offered by the RTO, 85 are now online and the remaining will also be made online with digital signature and artificial intelligence soon,” said transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne. Sources said that over 100 applicants had applied for the learner’s test with an Aadhar card till afternoon. RTO officials said a few cars were also registered on Monday in the completely online mode. As far as dealer point registration is concerned, Parab said till now purchasing a car meant a wait for delivery as the vehicle had to go to the RTO for inspection, registration etc. “Now, all formalities will be completed at dealer level through an online process.” Thackeray said driving has become easier today. “Taking a driving test was both challenging and fun during my days. I remember going on a steep slope when the RTO inspector told me to stop the car mid-way, and subsequently drive forward ensuring the car does not move an inch in the reverse direction,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-smooth-drive-for-15l-as-learners-licence-now-online/articleshow/83524830.cms||Somit Sen
---||Chandigarh||200 days on, tide ebbs on farmers’ protest||Bathinda: As the protest against the contentious farm laws at the borders of Delhi completed 200 days, many sections are wary about the outcome of the struggle. Despite activity ebbing, protesters say they are determined to take the struggle to its logical end by making the Central government repeal the farm laws. However, the past 100 days have been rather subdued as compared to the first 100 days. The only solace for protesters is BJP losing assembly elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Farmers had campaigned against BJP in Bengal and decided to do so in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, where assembly elections are due early next year. Mobilisation on the ground also slowed down considerably over the last 100 days. The primary reason for this is perceived to be the incidents at Red Fort on January 26. Many sections feel that this delivered a major blow to the movement. In the wake of the tractor parade, farm leaders first deferred and eventually cancelled the foot march to Parliament. Also, farmers did not get a response from the Union government to their letter to Prime Minister asking for resumption of dialogue. Inside sources said the letter itself came in for criticism within the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha as a few farm organisations raised questions on the authority of nine leaders writing to the PM. This was in stark contrast to the incidents of the first 100 days when 11 rounds of talks were held between farmers and central ministers. Many programmers lined up in the first hundred days were restricted later. On the brighter side, participation in the protest in the initial days was generally restricted to farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh but later, farmers from Telangana, Uttarakhand and a few other places also participated. “Despite the farmers facing many hardships while sitting on the roads as the Central government continues to ignore their key demands, protesting farmers are getting more and more determined and resolute in their peaceful struggle. They have faced bone-chilling cold, storms, scorching summer and now, rain. Despite the paddy sowing season, farmers are coming to the borders. They are ready to be drenched in rain and staying in flooded tents,” said the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha leaders. Farm leader Jagmohan Singh said, “Surely some impact was felt over the happenings on Republic Day, but the protest overcame that and had to take some hard steps in keeping aside some forces in the protest with some agenda other than repeal of farm laws. There was less vibrancy due to second wave of Covid turning lethal, wheat harvesting season and now paddy transplantation but despite all this, farmers continued coming from far more places like Uttarakhand, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and even from Maharashtra, Karnataka to some extent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/200-days-on-tide-ebbs-on-farmers-protest/articleshow/83528300.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Bareilly||No salary to government employees without vaccination certificate: Lakhimpur Kheri DM’s diktat||BAREILLY: Lakhimpur Kheri district magistrate (DM) Arvind Kumar Chaurasiya has instructed the treasury department not to release the salary of the government employees who fail to provide Covid vaccination certificate. In a statement, the DM said vaccination is the only protection against Covid and the results have proved that there was no mortality among those who got both their jabs in the district. Employees’ association heads in the district called the move “unreasonable” and said that DMs should remember they are not lawmakers and cannot impose such decisions on state staff. “We do agree that vaccination is important for protection against Covid infection. But, in the middle of the month, they are suddenly asking all of us to get vaccinated, which is not possible for most of us,” a union head said. Later, the DM released another order in which he said that the people who recently recovered from Covid, pregnant women and other exemptions as per vaccination guidelines would be entertained. Rajendra Pushkar, district president of state employees’ association, told TOI, “The DM has given this order without speaking with the employees. The ministry of health and family welfare had clearly replied to an RTI query that vaccination is voluntary and it has no connection with government jobs, nationality or government facilities. I will speak with the DM on Tuesday and request him to withdraw this order.” Teachers are the most affected group as they were not considered frontline warriors and didn’t receive vaccination during the early phase of vaccination. After the lockdown was called, most of the teachers returned to their hometown and worked online. Sanjeev Tripathi, district president of a teachers’ association, told TOI, “We had requested the district administration to organise camps where we could get vaccinated along with our family members, but we are yet to receive a response. Now, this order is really difficult to implement in such a short period of time.” When asked if directions are given after receiving instruction from the government, Kheri DM Chaurasiya said, “Someone has to take such an initiative to ensure vaccination as it is the only shield against Covid as of now. I have not heard that anyone who got both the jabs died of Covid in Kheri. Policemen remained in the field all the time but vaccination saved them. As a government employee, we should ensure vaccination and encourage others as well. Most government employees remain in the field or remain exposed to the public every day which makes vaccination imperative. We will later issue the same orders for rickshaw drivers and medical store workers to ensure 100% vaccination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/no-salary-to-govt-employees-without-vaccination-certificate-kheri-dms-diktat/articleshow/83522631.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The boy, Mayank Urane, suffered a fracture on his arm and is undergoing treatment at a hospital. On getting a call for help from the boy’s father, residents of Pakirewadi village — Suresh Pakire, Sachin Pakire, Ananda Pakire and others — swung into action. They braved the slippery path and fog and tracked down Mayank to a clump of bushes. “The boy was first taken to the hospital in Wai and then shifted to Satara. He is safe and has since been sent to Pune for further treatment,” sub-inspector Sanjay Motekar of the Wai police said. The father-son duo were part of an eight-member trekking group, Suresh said. “After reaching the top, the boy’s father was walking. Visibility was poor at the top due to clouds. To catch up to his father, the boy started running, when he slipped and fell into the gorge,” Suresh said. The father and others tried to search for the boy. They could hear his cries but were unable to find him. “They came to our village and alerted us. Ten of us (accompanied by constable Suresh Dhule from the Wai police) went to the fort immediately and found him in 15 minutes,” Suresh said. “In our tehsil, we still have Covid positive cases and it may be risky for visitors. Considering the potential risk, we have banned trekking completely in the tehsil. A separate order in this regard has been issued,” Bhor tehsildar Ajit Patil said on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/10-year-old-boy-survives-fall-into-400ft-gorge-at-kenjalgad/articleshow/83524837.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The meeting between Pawar and Shahu Maharaj that took place at the New Palace raised many eyebrows as Rajya Sabha MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati has announced an agitation against the state government over demands made for the benefit of the Maratha community. The protest will be held on Wednesday at the Shahu Samadhi Sthal in Kolhapur. Terming the discussion as positive, Shahu Maharaj said, “Everyone needs to study the Supreme Court order. The court has rejected the reservation. I am of the opinion that if Centre takes interest, then a constitutional amendment should be made that will help clear the path for reservation. I have been saying this for a long time.” The state’s law granting reservation was crossing the 50% limit, and it was one of the reasons the Marathas could not get the reservation. “The state government is positive about the demands. The demands that are practical will be met,” said Shahu Chhatrapati. “We have referred the issue of reservation to the central government. It was on top of our agenda when we recently met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We are ready to resolve pending issues related to the Maratha community,” said Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-way-to-reservation-via-constitutional-reform/articleshow/83528351.cms||---

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor on Monday adjourned the hearing till first week of July as per the request made by petitioner’s counsel M Anil Kumar. Earlier, vacation judge Avinash Gharote adjourned the hearing while asking the petitioners to amend the petition with supporting documents on the civic body’s move. The judges refused to issue notices to the respondents, which surprisingly included the Maharashtra governor, besides the Union ministry for environment, forest and climate change, and NMC commissioner. Union ministries of railways, posts and communication, road transport and highways, along with Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL), collector, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), commissioner of police (CP) and chief forest conservator (CCF) are other respondents in the PIL. According to petitioner Shweta Burbure, NMC’s notice was issued without placing on record the tree census, its committee’s report and that of a tree officer as mandated by the provisions of ‘Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975’. Moreover, it provided only five days to respond to the notice. She contended that she sought various information from NMC for supporting her case, but officials failed to provide it. While praying for quashing the notice, the petitioner demanded directives to NMC to place on record IMS details and its stage wise implementation. She also demanded the committee report, inspection report of tree officer, identification and nature of trees species, its impact on environment, the feasibility of transplanting trees, the need for their felling, and availability of finance for the mega project. Burbure insisted on appointment of an expert committee to determine the need of tree felling in terms of similar guidelines mandated by the Supreme Court in case of Association For Protection Of Democratic Rights versus the State of Bengal. She further demanded directives to NMC to complete the tree census within three months and till then defer the hearing of May 29 notice. She also wants railways, postal department and police to disclose the availability of lands with them lying idle, unoccupied and/or encroached. The petitioner prayed for NMC to investigate felling or cutting of 24 trees in Ajni Vann by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) through Nagarjun Construction Company without seeking any permission and take appropriate action as per law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-adjourns-hearing-over-nmc-notice-on-tree-felling-for-ims/articleshow/83524846.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

He lives in Ghaziabad. “I got the death certificate almost a month after my uncle’s death. The death summary, essential for transfer of money from his account into the nominee’s name, is still awaited. My uncle was a government employee. And Tuesday is the last date of submission of death-related documents for securing compensation. I have been sitting in the hospital since morning but I don’t see any chance of getting it even today. They keep on making excuses like the doctor is on leave, staff has resigned, etc.,” says Ravi. People may have moved on in their lives after the death of their loved ones, but they are still making rounds of hospitals to get all the documents needed by banks and government offices for various reasons -- including issuing of compensation, transfer of money stuck in accounts, property transfers etc. Vikram Pandit (32) died of Covid-19 in the same hospital on May 19. Almost a month on, his family members can be seen standing in queues or sitting outside in the shades of trees waiting for his death certificate. According to Yogesh Kumar, Pandit’s relative, “I have come to the hospital over 12 times only to get empty promises, because of which we are not able to procure any benefit which his widow and six-year-old son are entitled to.” There are scores of others making rounds of the government hospital to get death certificates and summary. Some are even coming from different districts. The hospital authorities denied it. “It is not true. We are giving certificates to everyone. But we too face problems. One relative takes away the certificate and the other one turns up and asks why it was given to someone else and not to him. So we have decided to give the certificate only to the spouse or parent which takes some time,” said Dr Gyanender Kumar, principal of LLRM Medical College. LLRM, an L3 facility, saw hundreds of Covid-19 deaths in April and May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/after-bodies-ambulances-kin-of-dead-now-wait-for-death-certificates-at-government-hospitals/articleshow/83522662.cms||Sandeep Rai

Police said Gaurav Raj worked at a set-up similar to a call centre in Sheikhpura. The complainant owns an acre in his hometown and was interested in getting a pump distributorship. He searched online and found a site operated by the fraudsters. An accused introduced himself as Rohit Gupta over the phone and offered to help the complainant get a licence. Gupta created a user ID and password on the portal on the complainant’s behalf and filled up a form for him. He then gave him forged documents. Between March 11 and May 14, Gupta demanded Rs 45 lakh under various pretexts. The complainant soon realized he had been duped and complained to north region cyber crime police. When officers checked the site and found the fraudster was based in Sheikhpura, they visited the place on June 5 and seized seven phones, cheque books of six banks, 11 ATM cards, three passbooks, besides Rs 3 lakh. Raj was booked under provisions of IPC and IT Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-petrol-pump-licence-fraud-leaves-victim-rs-45l-poorer/articleshow/83524843.cms||---

SDM, Phagwara will take a decision on the said representation within two weeks,” the HC ordered. A division bench headed by Justice Ritu Bahri of the HC passed these orders while disposing of an appeal filed by Wahid Sandhar Sugars Ltd against the order dated May 24, 2021 whereby all the accounts of the appellant/sugar mill have been directed to be attached and no money can be withdrawn by the mill except for paying farmers’ dues and workers’ salary. In its appeal, the company argued that apart from salary to the workmen and farmers’ dues, there are other payments required to be made by the sugar mill every month. These payments include provident fund dues, GST deposit, electricity bill, TDS deposit, bank interest, bank instalments, contractor and plant creditors and administrative expenses. The total amount, including the salary, comes to around Rs 5,35,00,000 every month, the appellant had argued. On May 24, a single bench of the HC had ordered attachment of the bank accounts of Punjab-based Wahid Sandhar Sugars Ltd after finding that the company had not paid farmers for their sugarcane crop for a long time. The HC also directed chief secretary (CS), Punjab to file his personal affidavit as to what is the amount of total outstanding sugarcane dues of farmers payable by all sugar mills operating in Punjab. “It is ordered that all the accounts of the petitioner sugar mill shall remain attached and no money from the accounts of the petitioner sugar mill shall be withdrawn by the mill for any purpose and in any form except for the purpose of making payment of farmers’ dues and salary of the workmen employed with the mill. Needless to say that workmen shall not include the officer grade employees working in the mill or the officers/directors in the management of the petitioner sugar mill,” the single bench had ordered. The single bench had passed these orders while hearing the petition filed by the company, which had approached the HC seeking directions for protection alleging that they faced a threat from farmers. During hearing of the case, the judge found that the company had not paid dues worth crores to farmers for their sugarcane crop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-haryana-high-court-asks-sugar-mill-to-approach-sdm-on-payments/articleshow/83528356.cms||---

Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC) had set up CCTV cameras at the municipality building and also at specific locations in the town, including Gandhi circle, entry and exit points of the KTC bus stand, sub-registrar’s office and Aldona taxi stand, among other places. However, a camera installed at the Gandhi circle is hung up to a wire while another camera is pointing downwards instead of facing the road. At other places, the cameras are not functioning and fail to capture images. Shekar Naik, a local, said, “In the recent infant kidnapping case, police needed CCTV footage as the woman was spotted in Mapusa. But they had to get the footage from a nearby hotel as the cameras installed by the municipality are not functioning.” “There is an urgent requirement for more CCTV cameras in Mapusa and the existing cameras should be made operational again,” said another local Digambar Pednekar MMC chairperson Shubhangi Vaingankar admitted that the cameras were non-functional and said that she would hold a meeting on the issue and on installing additional cameras.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-no-maintenance-most-cctvs-in-mapusa-not-working/articleshow/83526553.cms||---

Sahyadri Hospital authorities on Monday said they have ordered 5,000 doses (including the first and second sots) of the Russian vaccine and would start to administer the jabs after June 21. A hospital source said another 10,000 doses were also in the pipeline. Dr Sidram K Raut, director of Noble Hospitals, told TOI, “We have booked 10,000 doses of Sputnik. The company will raise an invoice and payment will be made subsequently. Doses are likely to come after June 20. Dr Reddy’s is working on logistics, as the vaccine has to be transported and stored at -18ºC in India.” Abrarali Dalal , chief executive officer of Sahyadri Hospitals told TOI, “We are in talks with Dr Reddy’s for Sputnik doses and hope that the process will be completed in a few days. Vaccination with Sputnik could begin after June 21. The cost for common people is expected to be around Rs1,145 per dose as per the government rules.” Procurement cost of per dose of Sputnik V for private hospitals is Rs995, including GST. Private vaccination centres such as Bharati Hospital, which had inked a formal agreement with Dr Reddy’s, are yet to decide on procurement of the Russian vaccine after union government put a cap of Rs 150 per dose as service charge on vaccination. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Hospital, told TOI, “We need to invest and create new infrastructure for Sputnik V storage like cold chain facility of minus 18 degree Celsius. We have received a communication from the company that they would be able to supply in the fourth week of June.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sputnik-v-shots-likely-in-city-after-june-21/articleshow/83524859.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: After wedding procession video goes viral, cops swing into action||AHMEDABAD: After a video of marriage procession showing hundreds of people dancing on loud DJ music went viral in a village of Sabarkantha district of North Gujarat, police swung into action and registered an FIR against about 100 people. The video of Nada village in Poshina taluka of Sabarkantha district went viral on Sunday in which hundreds of women and men were seen dancing without maintaining any social distance. Covid protocols went for a toss at the marriage procession where no one was seen wearing a mask and people were seen dancing while holding each other’s hand. Neeraj Badgujar, SP Sabarkantha district, said, “As this happened in a remote village in Poshina taluka of Sabarkantha, cops learned about it later through the social media. Usually, we patrol those areas.” “But as and when we knew it, we took actions against the persons in whose house the marriage was solemnized and made all the other persons – who participated in marriage procession, accused in the case,” said Badgujar. He said that a case under charges of violation of notification which prohibited large gatherings along with charges under epidemic act and disaster management act has been lodged with Poshina police. Sources in police said that the organizer had taken permission for the wedding, but he was granted permission to invite only 50 guests. As he exceeded the number of people, he was booked along with 100 others. Earlier in April and May, various complaints were filed in villages of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar where people held religious processions and violated Covid protocol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-wedding-procession-video-goes-viral-cops-swing-into-action/articleshow/83524870.cms||---
---||Pune||District-level weekly review of curbs to continue: State official||Pune: The district disaster management authorities in the state have been asked to conduct a weekly review every Friday of the restrictions due to the pandemic, based on the weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed availability. The decisions taken at the review meeting would translate into orders to be made applicable to areas at the local level.Speaking to TOI, Aseem Gupta, principal secretary, state relief and rehabilitation department, said the Maharashtra government will, therefore, not need to issue periodic orders, even as the existing lockdown order ends on June 15.However, Gupta said the government may issue orders to fill some gaps in its June 4 diktat regarding certain sectors like tourist and religious places, besides education. Gupta said the local-level orders would be applicable from Monday to Sunday after the Friday review. He said it was decided to have a seven-day reconsideration period, and not 15 days, as the latter could prove to be too long should cases begin to rise and fresh restrictions need to be imposed.Asked whether this weekly “stop-and-start” method would cause confusion among citizens and traders, Gupta said, “The local administration may think of keeping a 15-day reconsideration period when the Covid positivity trend is downward but a 7-day period when the trend is upward.” The guidelines are basically a balancing act between the virus spread and the economy.Earlier, the restrictions were uniformly applied across Maharashtra, Gupta said. “This lead to a fresh debate each time restrictions were imposed, leading to speculation and also delay in reacting to the virus spread. The June 4 order has tried to resolve such issues,” he said.“Now, different districts are treated differently depending upon the seriousness of the spread in their jurisdictions. The levels of restrictions are tied to parameters that are known to citizens, who appreciate that the government imposes curbs only when the situation goes out of hand,” Gupta said.On traders getting affected by periodic reviews, Gupta said the state understands their problems but does not expect they would be required to switch on and off every week. “For places falling in the first three levels, most shops would be allowed to stay open. The only changes are the time for which they can stay open and weekend restrictions. These levels will not fluctuate every week. However, if the Covid spread goes out of hand, restrictions will be back,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-level-weekly-review-of-curbs-to-continue-state-official/articleshow/83524855.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The case was registered on June 9 after a news channel discussion on June 7 in which she allegedly commented that the central government had used bioweapon against the natives of Lakshadweep. Approaching the court through senior advocate P Vijayabhanu, the 26-year-old film maker said she was invited to the discussion in the backdrop of the relaxation in Covid-19 quarantine protocol for visitors to the island. She had only intended to say that it was due to the reforms by the administrator that people of the island are facing a serious threat to their lives and she had not intended to cause any disaffection as alleged. As her statement gave rise to several controversies, she had explained her stance and apologized for the statements through social media and in further news channel discussions, the plea said. The offence of sedition is not attracted as her words did not cause imminent violence. Criticism on political matters and candid and honest discussions do not constitute the offence of sedition, she contended. Meanwhile, Thrissur MP TN Prathapan and Ernakulam MP Hibi Eden have also approached the high court questioning denial of permission to travel to Lakshadweep. Denying them the right to visit, citing quarantine restrictions, when such restrictions are not applicable to the administrator is illegal, they contended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/aisha-seeks-pre-arrest-bail-in-sedition-case/articleshow/83520715.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Smells like money: The business of garbage in Jaipur||JAIPUR: It was a call for a ‘Swacch Bharat’ by the Prime Minister. But for the Pink City, notorious for its heaps of stinking garbage, the call became a money spinner — one that threw up business worth Rs 100 crore per annum in its mere disposal. From instances in the past where an executive and a contractor were arrested for paying a bribe of Rs 1 lakh for clearing the bills to the cases where a sanitary inspector was booked for providing attendance to workers, money changed hands at almost every step that proceeded the lifting of garbage from households or from the street side to its disposal at the dumping yard. But the exact scales of the business came through this time when the controversial video went viral of JMC-Greater mayor’s husband Raja Ram Gurjar being offered a kickback of Rs 20 crore for clearing backlog payment of Rs 290 crore due to BVG, the firm entrusted with lifting of the garbage. An official at the corporation said, in December 2016, the state government appointed the Pune-based firm for door-to-door garbage collection after dividing the city into three divisions. As per the tender document, the company had to collect 1,340 metric tonne and JMC fixed to pay Rs 1,650 per metric tonne in one division and Rs 1,670 in remaining two divisions. The initial billing of the firm was approximately 70 lakh per month. As the city’s population rose, the company also hiked it bill claiming increase in garbage. At present, the firm is charging Rs 1,792 metric tonne as per wholesale price index, 2018. It is believed the city’s population is approximately 37 lakh at present. As per municipal solid waste (management and handling) Rules 2016, one person produces 450 gram of garbage. In the current scenario, the firm comes up with Rs 29 lakh bill per day, which compounds to approximately Rs 9 crore every month and approximately 100 crore in a year. A member of sanitation committee, who wished not to be named said, “The garbage is lifted only on papers. The firm claims approximately 1500 metric tonne is lifted from the city, but there is no transparency. The firm lifts less garbage and produces inflated bills in connivance with municipal corporation staff. The amount of profit in the business can be gauged that company is working on approximately 50% payment since starting.” After the appointment, the awarded firm had to put in its resources including machinery and manpower to lift the garbage in the city. Though company representatives claim that for collection work it has deployed 540 hoopers , 82 tractors and trolleys and 14 refuse contractors, vendors associated with firm said it had no resources of its own and saving the cost after outsourcing the work. A firm owner to whom BVG firm sublet the work in 2017 said, “I was associated with the firm since December 2016. However, the garbage work started on May 17. The company, since the beginning, is acting as a middle agent and subletting work on reduced costs to local vendors. There were more than eight vendors who deployed their garbage collection vehicles. They were paid between Rs 900-1,050 per metric tonne. The company without investing much is earning an approximately profit of approximately 12-15 lakh per day.” The firm also allegedly segregating the garbage at transfer stations and selling it to garbage collectors. “There are at-least 12 yards in the city. The firm earns Rs 15,000 to 20,000 from each dumping yard after selling plastic, rubber and other garbage items. Ideally, it should be taken to JMC’s plant in Sewapura for recycling.” Refuting the allegations, Omkar Sapre, head-Jaipur, BVG India said, “ Our company maintains transparency. It is the JMC officials who are shying away from an independent audit. To carry out the audit of garbage collection occurred in 2019, the officials sent revised guidelines in 2021. Moreover, the JMC should deploy its resources to stop lifting of garbage from transfer stations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/smells-like-money-the-business-of-garbage/articleshow/83524864.cms||---

Then I was appointed MPCC president, I accepted that assignment. I am following orders of the high command,’’ Patole said. Patole said Congress will contest elections of local bodies and state assembly on its own and establish it is the biggest in the state. “NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s statement appears he is keen on contesting Lok Sabha and assembly elections jointly.

---||Pune||Antibody test after jab not recommended: ICMR-NIV||PUNE: Avinash, 45, was taken aback when he recently tested negative for antibodies, despite taking both doses of the vaccine. Bhumika's case is different — the 30-year-old was elated when a test showed she had optimum antibody levels after just the first shot. Six months into the vaccination programme, such examples are now plenty. But the Indian Council of Medical Research National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) does not currently recommend antibody testing after Covid vaccination. The reason is antibody levels can vary according to a person's genetic make-up and even the type of antibody test used. And if a post-vaccination antibody test comes back as negative, it does not mean the vaccine has failed. The shots can stimulate memory cells and still confer protection. Experts also said presence of post-vaccination antibodies should not be treated as a "license to be careless". People with antibodies can still contract Covid, even though it'll mostly be mild. "Post-vaccination antibody testing is not recommended due to the variable sensitivity and specificity of the commercially available antibody assays (tests)," Priya Abraham, ICMR-NIV director, told TOI. Also, the commercially available kits cannot differentiate between vaccine-induced antibodies and antibodies after natural infection or break-through events. "Besides, the minimum level (threshold) of protective antibodies in the blood is not yet precisely defined. Many breakthrough infections have been reported after one or two doses, despite presence of antibodies. Most are mild cases and require no hospitalization. So checking antibodies post-vaccination or natural infection serves no purpose," said virologist Deepak Gadkari, former director of NIV. Other key variables in antibody assays are labs and timing of the tests after the jabs. "It takes two to three weeks for a robust antibody response to build after vaccination," said infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag. Commercially available test kits can detect antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein as well as the spike. "Nucleocapsid antibodies are generated only after natural infection, while the presence of spike protein antibodies (IgG) could mean past infection or response to the Covishield vaccine," Prayag said. Covishield uses only the spike protein and not the whole virus. "We perform a spike protein IgG antibody test, which is quantitative, qualitative and indicative of the presence of S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein of the novel coronavirus. These spike protein IgG antibodies are seen in blood after natural infection or after Covishield vaccination," said pathologist Avanti Golwilkar-Mehendale, head of A G Diagnostics - one of the city's designated private Covid labs. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody will not, therefore, be detected following the Covishield vaccine. But it can be detectable after natural infection or maybe after vaccination with Covaxin, Golwilkar-Mehendale said. So, taking the wrong type of antibody test can also shift the result. Experts said citizens should consult their physicians to better understand antibody dynamics. "If your spike protein IgG is negative post-vaccination, your healthcare provider will consider the test result together with other aspects of medical history such as symptoms, possible exposures and geographical location of places you have recently traveled to before deciding how to care for you," Prayag said. Presence of antibodies after the first dose and increase after the second is proven in different studies. Besides, there are commercial kits available to determine presence of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies. But these kits do not detect 'neutralizing' or protective antibodies. "Neutralization test requires live infectious virus or pseudo-virus to detect 'protective' antibodies. Private laboratories are unlikely to have such facilities," Gadkari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/antibody-test-after-jabs-not-recommended-niv/articleshow/83524873.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The SC appreciated the inauguration of the portal, a state government statement said on Monday. The court’s observations were made during the course of a hearing on June 11. The e-nirman portal was launched by CM Vijay Rupani on June 8. Gujarat became the first state in the country to launch such a digital platform to register unorganized-sector workers through a common service centre. The state labour department indicated in its affidavit that an online portal and mobile application have been set up for the registration of construction workers. This is to ensure seamless and smooth grant of various central and state-sponsored welfare schemes. The portal is operational. Registrations will be done through about 21,300 service centres, which were previously limited to 33 board offices. Labourers can also register through the mobile app. The Supreme Court has asked the state government to start community kitchens for unorganized-sector and migrant workers at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sc-appreciates-gujarats-e-nirman-portal/articleshow/83524897.cms||---

The Lucknow bench of the tribunal passed these orders after the Union government had denied this pension to a veteran who had been injured in Italy in 1944 during the WW-II.  AFT’s Lucknow bench, comprising Justice Umesh Chandra Srivastava, judicial member, and Vice Admiral Abhay Raghunath Karve, administrative member, has passed these order while allowing a petition filed by Rifleman Govind Singh Rawat of Patty-Khatsyyum village of Pauri Garhwal district of Uttrakhand, who is currently residing in Dehradun. Rawat was enrolled in the Third Royal Garhwal Battalion of British Army on September 6, 1941, and was injured in a battle in Italy during World War-II. As per the discharge medical certificate issued on January 31, 1947, he had received ‘splinter wound of the right knee of the femur and skull on October 3, 1944.” He was invalided out from service on April 6, 1947, and granted disability pension for life from April 7, 1947. Rawat, however, wanted a war injury pension instead of disability pension. War injury pension is much higher than the disability pension. As the government had not responded to his representations, he had approached the AFT to get war injury pension.  Strongly opposing the plea, the Union government submitted that Rawat is not entitled to war injury pension as per the ministry of defence letter dated February 24, 1972, which stipulates that policy is applicable to disabled veterans wounded during wars and operations of 1971, 1965 and 1947-48. “Since applicant has sustained injury during World War-II, i.e. pre-Independence, he is not entitled to war injury pension,” argued the government. It was further argued that the present case pertains to pre-Independence and medical documents related to applicants have already been destroyed after holding for 50 years. Therefore, in the absence of relevant medical documents the case cannot be decided at this stage. The tribunal, however, held that due to law of limitations applicants shall be entitled to war injury pension along with arrears from three years prior to filing of this application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/aft-clears-war-injury-pension-for-ww-ii-veteran/articleshow/83528924.cms||Ajay Sura

Raju said the CBI cases booked against him at the behest of banks are still at FIR stage and when compared with the CBI cases against Jagan they pale into insignificance. He was urging the court to cancel the bail granted to Jagan in the quid pro quo case on the ground that several actions of the CM were aimed at influencing or coercing the witnesses in the cases against him. “When he is accusing me of facing cases and suppressing the same from public glare, he should have mentioned the latest CID case filed against me,” he said, charging Jagan with suppressing this case. “The AP CID cops tortured me and finally, I got justice from the Supreme Court which sent me to Secunderabad Military Hospital that confirmed the injuries I suffered at the hands of AP cops,” he said. “The way the AP CID cops registered an FIR against me, the way they manhandled me and the message that was driven home from this was simple. Whoever is critical of AP government, such voices of dissent would be crushed with the help of police in a brutal manner is the essence of this message and this was precisely my case before the CBI court too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/raju-why-didnt-jagan-mention-cid-case/articleshow/83524939.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: GIFT City had most polluted air in India on Monday||AHMEDABAD: The city of Gandhinagar, ranked among the greenest in India, turned out to have one of the most polluted areas in the country on Monday — Gift City. The report was generated by Safar (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research). The 03 value at GIFT City was the highest in the country at 232, according to Safar that has 35 monitoring areas in Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Pune. As for Ahmedabad, PM2.5 was the highest among all the four cities monitored. Track the pollution level in your cityGPCB (Gujarat Pollution Control Board) officials said that high pollution levels can be attributed to the construction of town planning roads, apartments, and Metro work within a 6km radius of Gift City where the SAFAR station lies. However, the GPCB officials refused to come on record, saying that they had not seen the data because Safar numbers are monitored by municipal corporations. Of the top five polluted areas in terms of PM2.5, four including GIFT City and Lekawada in Gandhinagar, come under the Ahmedabad Safar monitoring centre. Senior GPCB officials said that because of various under-construction projects, trucks and other vehicles are constantly on the move around GIFT City and push up PM2.5 levels. Also, dust winds in the area are raising PM10 values, the officials said. The 630MW thermal power plant in Gandhinagar is also spurring an increase in PM2.5 levels, the officials said. They added that the increased 03 levels can be traced to the rising temperature and to the presence of nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere. The higher the level of PM2.5, the greater the O3 numbers. Officials in the AMC said that pollution levels were higher in the city of Ahmedabad during the day as the lockdown has been relaxed and normalcy is returning. Vehicle movement in Satellite and Raikhad was the highest during the day, especially during peak hours. This added to the pollution. During the lockdown last year and also when vehicle movement was restricted later, pollution levels had crashed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gift-city-had-most-polluted-air-in-india-on-monday/articleshow/83524931.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Mumbai||A year on: Congress, NCP question CBI on Sushant Singh Rajput case||MUMBAI: Congress and NCP on Monday expressed shock and surprise over the failure of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to disclose cause of death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, who died a year back. Mumbai Police contended that Sushant died by suicide, while NDA government said it was not and entrusted the probe to CBI. “Sushant died a year ago, 310 days have passed since CBI took over the probe, while 250 days have passed since an AIIMS panel ruled out murder. When will CBI declare final conclusion? Why has CBI kept a lid on it? CBI appears to be under immense pressure from political bosses,’’ Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said. Sawant came down heavily on National Investigation Agency (NIA) for its failure to nab the mastermind who planted explosives outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani. “We were expecting police personnel involved in the planting of explosives were working under then Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, he will be interrogated by NIA. Narendra Modi-led government is misusing central agencies, including CBI, NIA and Enforcement Directorate to defame the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government,’’ Sawant said. Endorsing Sawant’s views, NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik said on the eve of Bihar assembly elections, NDA government utilized CBI to defame the MVA. “It was a biggest conspiracy against MVA. If Sushant did not die by suicide, who killed him? CBI must come out clean on the episode,’’ Malik said. Launching an attack against BJP, Malik said when Mumbai Police were moving in the right direction, for obvious political reasons, the probe was entrusted to CBI, which has failed to come to a conclusion. “CBI took over the probe, even Bihar police registered a criminal case, but there is no progress after a year, CBI has maintained a discreet silence over cause of death,’’ Malik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/a-yr-on-cong-ncp-question-cbi-on-sushant-case/articleshow/83524917.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Pune||Pune: Call on weekend dine-ins at restaurants after Friday review||PUNE: A decision on keeping malls and dine-ins in restaurants open on weekends is likely to be taken on Friday after determining the city’s positivity rate and oxygen supported bed occupancy at the end of this week, municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar told TOI on Monday. After reports that dine-ins could be disallowed during weekends in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits despite an extension in the restaurants’ operational deadline till 10 pm, the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers’ Association (PRAHA) said it would send a letter to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, mayor Murlidhar Mohol and the commissioner about the massive losses the industry could face if dining services were disallowed on weekends. Kumar told TOI, “We have still not decided on the weekend operations for the restaurants and malls. With the level 2 protocols coming into force in Pune city on Monday, we will wait for another review meeting on Friday to determine if the malls and dine-ins in restaurants are to be allowed during weekends. Clarity is expected this Friday, after which we will issue an order.” Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner, told TOI, “Though Pune is in the level 1 of relaxations as per the state government’s 5-level unlock plan, we are going cautiously and still following maximum protocols of level 2. Only essential shops are being allowed to function in the city on weekends. We are still waiting to decide on the weekend operations for restaurants and malls.” Agarwal, however, said the restaurants, bars and the malls might have to follow the same restrictions as non-essential shops on weekends if positivity rate/ bed occupancy rise. The PMC had in its latest order on relaxing restrictions in Pune allowed non-essential shops to operate till 7pm on weekdays. PRAHA president Ganesh Shetty said, “Around 60% of business happens during weekends. No dine-ins on weekends will cause major losses to the industry. We have told all restaurant staff to return to Pune on an urgent basis and spent thousands on their flight tickets. If dining is disallowed on weekends, many restaurants may not reopen this service during weekdays also. It is not viable to operate only on weekdays.” He added, “The period from Monday to Friday generates only 40% of the restaurant revenues. Working professionals and citizens in general visit restaurants during weekends on account of weekly holidays.” Lovely Narang, president of the United Hospitality Association, told TOI, “The latest PMC order had nowhere mentioned that dine-ins will be disallowed in restaurants on weekends. We still await clarity from PMC on the order. If dine-ins are not allowed on Saturday and Sunday, the industry will once again be doomed because 50% business happens on weekends.” He added, “Revenue generated during the weekend (be it restaurants, bars or five star hotels) is equivalent to that generated during the rest of the week (Monday to Friday). We request the administration not to disallow weekend business, as all our members are strictly following the Covid protocols.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/call-on-weekend-dine-ins-at-restos-after-friday-review/articleshow/83524910.cms||Neha Madaan

Tourism drives several economic activities, supports many jobs and the hospitality industry fully depends it, said the chief minister while urging the officials to spend the money for developing sustainable tourism. Gehlot, who is the finance minister and keeps the tourism portfolio with himself, allocated in the Budget 2021-22 a record Rs 500 crore for tourism. He said the department should interact with the stakeholders and understand their pain brought upon by the Covid pandemic and lay out a path where the state can also lend a helping hand. About relief to the sector, Gayatri Rathore, principal secretary tourism, said the department is working on it and will send the proposals to the finance department for consideration.

"Though six persons have been named in the FIR, we are trying to ascertain their role in the murder. The woman's father has been arrested. More action will be taken as the investigation progresses," Arvind Chaurasia, circle officer (Kotwali) said on Monday. This development comes a day after her body was exhumed from the grave and was sent for postmortem following a complaint by Farman who had alleged that Saina was killed by her family members for marrying him against their wishes. A resident of the city’s Lisari Gate area, Saina got married to Farman last month. And they got their marriage registered on May 17. But, Saina died under mysterious circumstances on the night of May 31, in Meerut. Farman claims he was told by his in-laws that Saina developed a stomach ache and later succumbed to it. However, recently, he was tipped-off that his wife could have been killed by her parents who were unhappy with the marriage. In his complaint, Farman claimed he is in possession of an audio recording which is “testimony to the torture on his wife when the first attempt was made to kill her”. A case of murder, disappearance of evidence and criminal conspiracy has already been registered at Lisari Gate police station. Investigating sleuths have now arrested Manzoor, father of Saina, in the case while rest of the family members are in hiding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/woman-who-died-days-after-love-marriage-was-murdered-confirms-postmortem-report/articleshow/83522862.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The court imposed a penalty of Rs 50,000 on Mohanlal Nama for filing an application seeking to become a party to the petition treating it as a frivolous and publicity stunt. The amount has to be deposited in the Covid relief fund. Rajendra Prasad, counsel for Gurjar, told the court that she had been removed on the ground of ‘misconduct’ under Section-39 of the Municipalities Act, which has not been properly defined in the Act. The name of the petitioner was not mentioned in the complaint sent by the corporation commissioner to the state government nor in the FIR. There was no specific allegation against the mayor in the investigation report. Referring to Sections 38, 39 and 43 of the Municipalities Act, he pleaded that the suspension proceedings be declared illegal. Prasad said even sufficient time was not given to the petitioner by the investigating officer to respond to the charges. On the basis of the illegal inquiry report, the state government ordered an immediate judicial inquiry and suspended the petitioner from the post of mayor and three councillors which should be set aside, pleaded Prasad. Advocate General MS Singhvi, on behalf of the state government, told the high court that the suspension of the mayor was legal under the Municipalities Act. Action could also be taken on the basis of preliminary inquiry. The investigating officer in the matter was the regional director, local bodies, and he had conducted an independent and impartial investigation. Notice was served to the petitioner but no reply was given. The petitioner could now present her case during the judicial inquiry. Advocate general also defined the misconduct of the petitioner as per the Act. In the petition, the acting mayor Sheel Dhabhai sought three weeks’ time from the high court to respond in support of the petitioner, which was rejected by the court. During the earlier hearing, her counsel Shiv Charan Gupta had supported the points raised in the petition.Vimal Cahudhary, counsel for Mohanlal Nama, pointed out that in the case of Jan Mohamamnd Vs state of Rajasthan, May 12, 1992, Justice J R Chopra and Y R Meena had allowed the present advocate general M S Singhvi to became a party as an intervenor on a similar petition.

After receiving leopards from Assam, the rescue centre in Jamnagar is expected to receive leopards from Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Officials in the state said that Uttarakhand had proposed to send six leopards to Gujarat in the first phase. However, the Jamnagar rescue centre has still not been informed by the Central Zoo Authority of India of this decision. The Greens Zoological Rescue and Rehabilitation Kingdom, which is owned by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), is said to be the first public-private partnership (PPP) between a state government and a private entity in managing the leopard population. Parimal Nathwani Director, Corporate Affairs, RIL said, “The centre already has 71 big cats of which two black leopards were sent from Assam. We can accommodate 108 leopards at the centre which is spread over 14 acres.” When asked about new additions, he said, “We have not received any communication from Uttarakhand. However, we did get verbal communication from Himachal Pradesh and are waiting for a written one. Recently, we also got an inquiry from Maharashtra government, asking if the centre could house leopard rescued in Maharashtra.” The centre has doctors, caretakers and a laboratory to take care of the big cats, he added. CZAI sources said that they have got several requests from various states to transfer leopard to other rescue centres in other states. The officials said, “As cases of man-animal conflict rises in Nainital in Uttarakhan, the number of leopard rescued was much higher. Hence, we are forced to transfer it to other states.” Officials in the state said, “Gujarat is also facing an issue of housing leopards as the state has been rescuing over 400-odd leopards in a year. Many of them had attacked humans and cannot be released into the wild. The increasing leopard population and rise in man-animal conflict has the state worried. The state wildlife board has approved a proposal to neuter captured leopards and then releasing them.” The officials said that the leopard population in the wild is estimated to be about 3,200 in Gujarat. This is more than double the number in the last census carried out in 2016. Gujarat has a total population of 1,395 leopards as per the statewide census carried out in 2016. The official said that the census is due any time but due to corona, the department has still not begun any process for the census.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ril-rescue-centre-likely-to-get-leopards-from-hp-uttarakhand/articleshow/83524951.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The commission also sought status of eight suo motu cases, including those in which police personnel were named as accused and 276 complaints on which no Action Taken Report had been received from police. Rajasthan DGP M L Lather and Jaipur Police Commissioner Anand Srivastava appeared before the NCW during the hearing. The commission while taking cognizance of the Parshuram Circle incident had directed to take immediate action in the matter and had sought explanation over mishandling of women by concerned officers. The Jaipur police commissioner said that the proceedings were followed as per orders of the court to remove encroachment. He denied allegations of any lathicharge on women. Apart from this, NCW raised the incident of PA of a Rajasthan minister raping a woman on the pretext of marriage. To this, the DGP submitted that the matter was investigated, but the victim did not come forward to register a complaint, rather police registered the complaint on suo motu basis. The commission sought information about the safety and security of the victim from DGP, in reply DGP stated they could not locate victim anywhere. Further, the commission took up the matter of an Army jawan, his wife and 2 daughters being beaten up by drunk policemen while he was taking his wife to hospital. The DGP stated that the guilty police personnel have been suspended and a charge-sheet has been filed in the matter and further action is under process. On the matter of a video wherein a woman before committing suicide had stated that she was raped and blackmailed by Sri Ganganagar police constable and further harassed by his wife, the DGP submitted that the policeman has been booked for abetment to suicide and has been dismissed from service. On enquiring about the action taken against the accused’s wife, the DGP mentioned the victim was in affair with the said accused and the reaction against the victim coming from his wife was natural and therefore, this specific matter of accused’s wife does not come under the purview of police. The DGP further added that that police force was involved in Covid duty with even senior officials being deputed for pandemic duty in the second wave of corona, therefore policing work was not being done and normal policing has suffered due to which the respective reports supposed to be sent to the commission are still pending, though reports of the cases will be submitted within 15 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/top-cop-denies-lathi-charge-on-women-at-parshuram-circle/articleshow/83524999.cms||---

The total number of cases reported in the city so far stood at 14,31,270, while over 14 lakh patients have recovered from the virus. Delhi now has 3,226 active cases. The occupancy of Covid beds also reduced to 7%, with only 2,013 of the total 27,546 beds currently occupied. According to data shared by hospitals on the Delhi Corona App, of the 6,685 ICU beds, only 1,018 (15%) are occupied at the moment. “Most of the ICU beds are occupied by patients who were admitted a fortnight ago or before and were suffering from complications caused by the viral infection. This includes patients with secondary infections including mucormycosis,” doctors said. Dr A K Grover, chairperson of department of ophthalmology at Apollo Hospital said they were conducting a study to assess the spread of mucormycosis in the first and the second wave. “Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the fungal infection is affecting younger patients and early in the disease course this time, as compared to the previous peak,” the doctor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/131-cases-lowest-single-day-tally-in-almost-four-months/articleshow/83522906.cms||---

The case involves one Shaf Shaikh alias Pintu, who was roaming around on the road in Sarkhej during the curfew that was imposed due to communal disturbances on May 14, 2002.  Shaikh was stopped by a police party deployed at the point and he got agitated, abused the cops verbally and attacked one of them, Amrabhai Revabhai, with a knife. Shaikh was arrested and charged with assault on the policemen during curfew hours. He was prosecuted and the prosecution demanded exemplary punishment for assaulting cops. The court awarded two years imprisonment after holding him guilty and with the observation that if such an act is taken lightly, it would jeopardize the law and order situation in society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-year-jail-term-for-assaulting-policemen/articleshow/83524990.cms||---

"That was the time of Covid peak and I realised a lot of people were helping those in need via social media. It inspired me to do something for the students, a neglected lot. I began sending out messages via Twitter and Facebook and soon received hundreds of requests," Singh told TOI. The young officer, who is now joined by his friends and batchmates, is ready to take up the cause of those financially affected by the pandemic. He started reaching out two months ago. One of the beneficiaries, Vivek Kumar, from Koderma district in Jharkhand, told TOI, "My entire family was down with the virus and my father's practice as a homeopath suffered. I am preparing for civil services and desperately needed a book on Indian polity. I came to know of Shashank sir through a friend and sent him a request. The book arrived within a week." Another student from Prayagraj, Sachin Tiwari, is all praise for Singh. "My father is a security guard. I want to crack the competitive exam. Books are costly, though. I came to know of his work through social media and I made him a request. He sent me the books." "It was not possible for me to be physically present in far-off places. So, a network of colleagues and friends helped me out in this task to reach out to students in need. During peak days we were able to send medicines and food as well," Singh said of the role of his colleagues and friends. At present there are around a dozen active members in the group. Most of them are his batchmates. Speaking to TOI, one such associate Kumar Sambhav, an IRS officer posted in Kolkata, said, "I cater to the needs of students belonging to West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. It feels good to work for the students' cause. Now, we are planning to develop an app to take this service to the next level." Messages of gratitude are also pouring in on Singh's Twitter handle @Shashank_s3. One Aditya Wakhare wrote, "Sir I got the book. Thanks for the support. This gift will be of great help to me in cracking UPSC. Keep helping, keep supporting like an elder brother." While another beneficiary NJ Kennedy messaged, "Sir, received the book. Thank you so much for the kind assistance to aspirants. Your kind gesture will never be forgotten."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/young-irs-officer-uses-social-media-to-reach-out-to-hundreds-of-students-in-times-of-covid/articleshow/83522889.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Ahmedabad||PIL objects to shifting of Camp Hanuman site||AHMEDABAD: A public interest litigation in the Gujarat high court has taken exception to the possible shifting of the Camp Hanuman temple from the cantonment area to the riverfront and demanded that the rationale behind the decision, if it is taken at all, should be revealed by the authorities concerned.  A citizens’ group, Tulja Yuvak Mandal, has filed the PIL through advocate Amit Panchal and cited news reports on the possibility of the transfer of the temple to the riverfront. The petitioner highlighted the objections raised by the the priest of the temple and urged the HC to direct the cantonment board authorities and state government to reveal the reasons behind the decision to shift the religious place, which devotees throng in large numbers on Saturdays. The PIL contended that the temple was created because of the swayambhu (self-manifested) idol of Lord Hanumanji at the place more than 150 years ago, and since the place of the temple falls in the jurisdiction of the cantonment board, the public’s visits are managed with the discipline of the cantonment board. Moreover, the place has also been safe and secure because of its location or it could have been an easy target during the 2008 terror strike where the nearest bomb blast was at Civil Hospital. Besides seeking the reasons for the possible shifting of the temple, the PIL has also sought to know the plans of the authorities with regard to management of the new place and whether there are proper parking arrangements for vehicles of devotees and who are likely to be affected by the shifting. The PIL urged the HC to stay the authorities from shifting the temple at least till the pendency of the petition in the court, which is likely to take it up for the hearing soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pil-objects-to-shifting-of-camp-hanuman-site/articleshow/83525016.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Folk singer Geeta Rabari’s husband also took jab at home in Kutch||RAJKOT: The Kutch district administration on Monday described as ‘regrettable’ the act of famed Gujarati folk singer Geeta Rabari and her husband taking Covid-19 vaccine at their house even as thousands had adhered to the government guidelines and stood in the queue to get the jab. The administration will also transfer the female health worker who administered the vaccine to the couple at their house in Madhapar village near Bhuj on Saturday. However, the letter holds little significance as there is no provision under the law to take action against any private citizen getting the jab in the comfort of their home. Rabari had stoked a controversy by posting a picture of hers taking the vaccine at home on social media. However, she deleted the photo on Sunday after the row. Meanwhile, officials said looking at the good work done by the female health worker during Covid-19, she will be transferred to another center. Sources said Rabari knew the health worker, so she asked her to come home despite getting the slot at a vaccination centre. Dr JO Madhak, chief district health officer (CDHO), Kutch, said in a statement: “Around 5.28 lakh people in Kutch have been inoculated and people including women and old people went to the vaccination centre even as the location was far from their residence. They stood in the queue to get inoculated.” “You are a folk singer and being the citizen of the country, you are bound to follow the guidelines of the government. You and your husband got the first dose of vaccine on Saturday at your home by violating the guideline, which is extremely regrettable. This kind of act doesn't befit a folk singer like you and it has created an adverse impact on the minds of the health department, administration and common people,” the letter states. “The situation demands an explanation from a health worker who is tirelessly working for a long time,” the letter stated. CDHO warned Rabari not to repeat this act while taking the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/folk-singer-geeta-rabaris-husband-also-took-jab-at-home/articleshow/83522944.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune municipal body reduces staff on Covid duty, plan ready for recall||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has reduced the number of employees from other departments on the Covid-19 duty following a recent dip in cases. However, a plan is in place to recall them if the cases go up. When the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak in April-May, around 5,000 PMC workers including those from other departments, were on Covid-duties. The workforce has been reduced by about 50 per cent since then. The authorities from the PMC said, “Managing the Covid-19 outbreak was the top priority and the staffers from other departments were roped in as per the requirement. Other necessary functions like road development, waste management, water supply, drainage and sewage management were carried out with the minimum required staff, and the additional workforce was diverted for Covid work.” Currently, civic wards and their respective health staffers are looking after most of the Covid duties. The PMC officials said that reduction in staff is not hampering existing Covid work and there is an adequate staff to carry out contact tracing, follow-up of patients, managing Covid Care and swab collection centres. “The Covid-19 cases have gone down in the last month, prompting us to release the staff. The heaths teams at civic wards are now handling that work. The administration has temporarily closed down some Covid care centres because of a fewer number of patients. Thus, even the staff requirement on Covid-duty has gone down compared to the past two months,” Sunil Indalkar, deputy commissioner, General Administration Department, said. Officials have been instructed to get timely updates from civic wards. Based on that data, more employees will be deployed in a phased manner on Covid duty if there is an increase in positive cases. Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) staffers and primary teachers were asked to help out as both public transport and schools were shut in that period. Indalkar added, “The administration recently asked all primary school teachers to resume their education department duties, while some staffers from other departments were also sent back to their original departments. Some PMPML workers are still on Covid duties. We will take out people from departments with larger staff members if cases increase.” Another PMC official said that the administration has been appointing staff on Covid-duty on a rotational basis so that the staffers can resume duties in their original departments after a few days. So far, we have not received any demand for additional manpower for Covid-related work. The PMC limits have been recording less than 500 new daily cases, bringing down the active caseload below 3,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-reduces-staff-on-covid-duty-by-half-plan-ready-for-recall-if-cases-increase/articleshow/83525011.cms||---

The petitions included the quashing petition against an FIR filed by a police inspector, Bhimrao Ghadge, under the SC/ST (prevention of atrocities) Act. Former advocate general Darius Khambata made the statement extending the protection after the bench presiding said the regular bench headed by Justice S S Shinde would resume next Tuesday. But he said there would be no further extension of such assurance. Khambata similarly extended the state’s assurance that it wouldn’t arrest former Maharashtra commissioner (SID), Rashmi Shukla, as her quashing petition too was adjourned to June 22. Shukla had filed a plea to quash an FIR registered by the cyber crime police station at BKC against unknown persons over “leaking” of her confidential report on the alleged politician-police nexus on transfers and postings. The bench of Justices P B Varale and S P Tavade had before it two quashing petitions by Singh, one against Ghadge’s FIR and the other challenging the state’s orders on a departmental enquiry against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-former-police-chief-gets-protection-from-arrest-till-june-22/articleshow/83525064.cms||---

---||Pune||Amphotericin B stock lying idle for almost a week: Distributors||PUNE/NASHIK: A handful of distributors in Pune and Nashik have admitted that the stock of about 1,800 vials of amphotericin B has been lying idle with them for almost a week, when mucormycosis patients are grappling with severe shortage of the key drug. “We have been approaching the officials to purchase the stock from us by meeting them in person and sending them emails, but none of them have responded to us positively. We cannot even sell the drug directly to patients as the distribution is under the control of the district administration,” said a distributor from Nashik, requesting anonymity. Currently, the Union government allocates the drug to the states and Union territories according to its availability in the country. The state government purchases the allotted quota of drugs directly from the manufacturers and supplies them to the treating hospitals through the district civil surgeons. Some of the private hospitals have to purchase the drug from civil surgeons, while some designated hospitals providing free care to the patients under the state-sponsored health scheme get the drug for free from the civil surgeons. “We have been contacting the officials concerned to either purchase the conventional amphotericin B vials from us or allocate the stock among the treating hospitals, but we received a cold response,” said another distributor, who refused to come on record. Sources from the chemists’ association have revealed that there are close to 800 vials of conventional amphotericin B available with a few distributors in Pune and another 1,000 vials of the drug with some distributors in Nashik. When TOI brought this to the notice of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials in Pune, they said they were aware of the stock. “There were technical issues involved as currently Maharashtra government is purchasing amphotericin B and providing the drug to district civil surgeons for equitable distribution to treating hospitals in their respective jurisdiction. We held a meeting with the district collectorate officials on Monday and it was decided that the district collector will allocate such stock to treating hospitals and hospitals will purchase the allotted number of vials from these distributors,” said Shyam Pratapawar, assistant commissioner (drugs), FDA, Pune. Nashik district collector Suraj Mandhare said, “I would ask the deputy collector to take the stock into consideration for issuing it to the treating hospitals based on the formula given by the state government.” Pratpwar said the district collector on Monday allocated a major chunk of the conventional amphotericin B lying with some pune distributors to hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/amphotericin-b-stock-lying-idle-amid-crisis-claim-few-distributors/articleshow/83525057.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The massive monitor lizard later made its way into a toilet stall. Monitor lizards are listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act. With monsoon approaching, sighting of snakes is also expected to go up. After the authorities sighted the monitor lizard on their premises, they alerted NGO Wildlife SOS on their helpline number. A three-member team from the NGO soon rushed to the location with the requisite equipment, which included a customised transportation unit and protective gear. The reptile’s sheer size made the rescue operation challenging. It took the team nearly 30 minutes to safely transfer the monitor lizard into a transport carrier. A senior shift officer at Badarpur Thermal Power Plant said: “We saw the monitor lizard moving from the powerhouse and into the toilet. It was quite shocking to see such a big reptile and we thank the Wildlife SOS team for helping us out in this emergency situation.” Wasim Akram, deputy director-special projects, Wildlife SOS, said, “Though monitor lizards are non-venomous, they are often believed to be venomous and aggressive. In reality, they are very shy and prefer to stay away from humans. However, it is most advisable to not approach a monitor lizard as they might react to being cornered or when provoked.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/four-feet-long-monitor-lizard-rescued-from-power-station/articleshow/83523017.cms||---

The accused are organizers of Banay Trophy — Players of Banaskantha tournament at Lalbhai Contractor Stadium. Video of the celebrations after the final match went viral in social media soon after the event. Police arrested Bhavesh Shah, Snehal Gandhi and Jayesh Shah for allegedly organizing the event in presence of the crowd. They were charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for violation of public notification and acts likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life. They were also booked under The Epidemic Diseases Act. In the viral video, the accused are seen celebrating the victory of a team and dancing to music. The complaint was lodged by a police officer. It is stated in the complaint that the event could have been organized without the presence of an audience, but many people were present at the venue. After the video went viral on Sunday evening, police verified it and registered the offence against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/three-arrested-after-victory-celebration-video-goes-viral/articleshow/83523057.cms||---
---||Delhi||No grand reopenings as Delhi tests waters||NEW DELHI: There was enthusiasm in the city’s markets on Monday, having fully opened after almost 55 days of the Covid-19 lockdown. While business owners went about busily disinfecting their premises and polishing their wares, buyers weren’t so ecstatic, if the low footfall in a majority of the commercial hubs was an indication. However, Connaught Place, Sarojini Nagar, Khan Market and Sadar Bazar enjoyed a semblance of normality with a fair number of shoppers. “I am sure that from Tuesday, we will get more people,” said Ashwani Marwah, general secretary, Traders’ Association of Lajpat Nagar. “Now that the markets are permitted open for full-fledged activities, we will request the district authority to deploy volunteers empowered to take appropriate action against those not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. If required, we will engage our own guards to educate, guide and alert customers.” Times ViewThe positivity rate in the city is at its lowest. But the virus has only been temporarily controlled, not reduced to insignificance. Only Covid-appropriate behaviour and speedy vaccination can help us minimise future damage. Those violating protocols should be taken to task. The second wave has shown us how costly — in human lives — any lowering of the guard can be. Let us not repeat the mistakes and invite a third wave.This would be a prudent measure given that people could be seen ignoring anti-Covid requirements. A vendor at Pushpa Market, unmasked, cheekily said he would wear one once the Civil Defence personnel started patrolling the market. “We don’t work in air-conditioned outlets and in this humid weather, a mask is uncomfortable,” he pleaded. The eateries and the stores in Khan Market were geared up for action on Monday. “Unlike in congested wholesale markets, we have open areas and maintaining physical distances is not difficult. Also, customers coming here belong to a social class that is aware and alert and will enter the stores only if they are satisfied with the anti-Covid arrangements,” asserted Sanjeev Mehra, president, Khan Market Traders’ Association. In Connaught Place, in a departure from the ban on trial rooms in apparel stores, customers were allowed their use but with certain restrictions. “We have also kept apparels of various sizes for people to check in all sections, but if they want, they can try out clothes in the trial room. After every use of the trial room, it is sanitised,” said Atul Bhargava, president, New Delhi Traders’ Association. Sarojini Nagar Market, the popular gathering for bargain hunters, opened on Monday, normally the weekly closure day. It was a good strategy for the business hungry shops. Ashok Randhawa, member of the market association, disclosed that around a quarter of normal business had been restored. "The pace of recovery is faster than after last year's unlock,” he said. Social distancing circles and civil defence marshals enforcing mask wear were present, but some customers walked around brazenly unmasked. Anita Devi from Munirka had come to Sarojini Nagar with her family to purchase clothes and undergarments for her kids. "We have bought enough to last us even if another lockdown is announced," Devi smiled. The eateries, allowed to seat half their capacity, too enjoyed good business on Monday though many remained shuttered. In the more upmarket areas of Greater Kailash I and II and South Extension, there were not too many shoppers present. Vikram Bhasin, who heads GK II M Block market association, said, “It will take a month or two for consumer confidence to recover. Everyone now has a friend or relative who passed away in the second wave, and fear is a deterrent.” Vijay Kumar at South Extension Market claimed that markets that attract top-drawer clientele were yet to be patronised. He said the stores had vaccinated their salesmen and if the daily new Covid cases remained low, more customers would be emboldened to return to the market. Perhaps because of the sweltering heat, malls had better turnouts. At Saket's Select City Walk, Mukesh Lalwani said he had come for lunch to experience a sense of normalcy. “It has been a tough two months for everyone and members of our family were feeling claustrophobic at home. Now, with infection rates dropping, the parks should also be opened,” Lalwani opined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-grand-reopenings-as-city-tests-waters/articleshow/83523109.cms||Vibha Sharma

The BJP delegation submitted to governor Jagdeep Dhankhar the memorandum on continuing post-poll violence and urged enforcement of the anti-defection law that debars MLAs elected on a party symbol from switching sides unless such defectors form one-third of the assembly’s total member strength. “Initially, we thought of taking 30 MLAs to the governor, keeping the Covid-19 situation in mind. But the number increased gradually and the 50-member delegation met the governor,” said BJP leader Manoj Tigga. “We will write to the speaker of the assembly, Biman Bandyopadhyay, and urge him to enforce the law in the state that has been glossed over for the past 10 years. We will wait for 10 days and might take to legal recourse later,” Suvendu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/suvendu-meets-governor-with-50-of-75-mlas/articleshow/83529144.cms||---

The deaths occurred at a time when the owner of the hospital conducted a mock drill to see how many patients would survive if the oxygen supply was cut. Amit claimed that neither his father, Vasudev (71) nor wife, Manisha (37), were critical. He alleged that they were “murdered” by the hospital management by cutting off oxygen supply. Amit’s family has filed a complaint with the police and administration, seeking murder charges be slapped against the hospital owner, Arinjay Jain, based on videos of Jain that surfaced on social media and in which he is bragging about cutting oxygen supply of serious patients on April 26. Amit’s said, “My father and wife died due to oxygen supply cut off by the hospital. It is clearly a case of murder. Several other people died at the hospital on April 26 and 27. Authorities, despite repeated pursuits, have not taken any action based on our complaint. We want the hospital owner to be booked under IPC 302 (punishment for murder).” Amit’s elder brother, Ashok Chawla, said, “I was informed about my father’s death in the evening on April 26. I saw six other bodies being taken away in an ambulance from the hospital. On April 27, my sister-in-law died at the same hospital.” “It was shocking to see the owner of the hospital narrating the inhuman act of switching off oxygen supply to the patients in critical condition. It is a murder. If authorities don’t act on our complaint, we will go to court for justice.” Superintendent of police, Botre Rohan Pramod, said, “On the basis of a complaint received from the office of the chief medical officer, an FIR has already been registered at New Agra police station against Shri Paras hospital’s owner, Arinjay Jain, under the sections of the IPC, Disaster Management Act, 2005 and Diseases and Epidemic Act, 1897. A joint team of the district administration and health department is conducting a probe.

The survey was started on April 12 and around 10,000 samples were collected from different parts of the city. The initial plan was to collect 28,000 samples to detect the presence of antibodies against coronavirus in the population, but the collection stopped within a week of launch as the lockdown was imposed in Delhi on April 19.Health dept officers did not reveal the findings of the survey. It was carried out by Delhi government with technical support from Maulana Azad Medical College. The government is likely to announce the result soon.The last sero survey in January had revealed that 56.1% people in Delhi had antibodies, which meant that more than 56% of the capital’s population was infected with coronavirus and had recovered. Experts said sero prevalence in 50-60% of the population or over that indicated herd immunity because when such a large section of the population develops antibodies against the virus, the chain of transmission is broken and the spread diminishes. Three months later, the most-devastating wave of Covid hit the city.The first such survey was carried out in July last year and every month since then. Sero prevalence was 22.8% in the first survey, 28.7% in second, 25.1% in third and 25.5% in the fourth survey. The fifth survey was conducted after a 45-day gap after advice from experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/report-of-6th-sero-survey-submitted-to-delhi-govt/articleshow/83523050.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Salons and barber shops reopen, but confusion reigns||New Delhi: Amid confusion about whether salons were allowed to open under the new guidelines, a few barber shops and salons reopened in Delhi on Monday. Salon owners said they received several calls from clients regarding safety measures and to fix appointments on day 1.Ankit Mundra, owner of Looks at Connaught Place, said: “We started sending messages to our regular clients as soon as the reopening of salons from Monday was announced. However, compared with last year, when people were more apprehensive and keen to know the safety measures adopted by us, the number of queries is less this time. All our staff wear PPE kits and sanitisation is done after every use.”Nearly half of our staff are vaccinated and the rest, who migrated to their hometown and have now returned, are likely to get inoculated by June-end, stated Mundra.Looks and Geetanjali outlets in Connaught Place and Khan Markets were found to be open, while Jawed Habib’s outlet in Sarojini Nagar was closed. Most of the barber shops have resumed operations.Md Saleem, who runs two salon shops near JNU and Munirka, said that he kept both the shops closed on the first day as a precautionary measure. We will open the outlets from Tuesday for cleaning and other preparations, he added.At Galaxy Salon outlet, staff were seen wearing PPE kits and tools were being sanitised after each customer’s turn. “We are using protective separator screens and leaving seats in between to maintain social distancing,” a staff member said.The customers were happy to get a haircut from their trusted salons/barber shops after a long time. “I was waiting for my haircut and facial for a long time. The first thing in the morning I did was to call my salon and confirm whether they are open or not. I initially thought of calling someone home through online service providers but I was not sure if they would have the kind of products available which are used at my salon,” said Sakshi Kapoor, a resident of Nirman Vihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/salons-and-barber-shops-reopen-but-confusion-reigns/articleshow/83523063.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Patil said they plan to link up with the National Institute of Virology to carry out the sequencing. He said sequencing will play a key role Covid prevention and containment policy. There are 32 electoral wards within PCMC limits. He said, "We saw this during the second wave. It's easier to trace contacts when cases are low. But when cases increase, the task becomes difficult. For example, we have to track at least 15 people for every positive patient. Now, imagine the scale if there are 1,000 new cases every day. To avoid all this, we plan to keep the virus in check." Genome sequencing can detect new variants by comparing current and older samples drawn from patients. Experts have said that sequencing is key to effective disease surveillance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-plans-ward-level-genome-sequencing/articleshow/83525103.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The party also said Eatala had deceived the people of Huzurabad constituency by joining the BJP. Energy minister G Jagadish Reddy said Eatala owed an explanation to the people of Huzurabad as to what prompted him to join the BJP. “He had criticised the Centre on farm bills earlier and has joined the BJP now. He has no moral right to talk about KCR or TRS as the Telangana government has been implementing welfare schemes for the last seven years,” he said. Addressing a press conference along with party MLAs Gadari Kishore, Malliah Yadav, P Sekhar Reddy, Bhaskar Rao and MP Badugula Lingiah Yadav, Jagadish Reddy said: “The BJP is a sinking boat and whoever boards the boat would also meet the same fate.” He said there would be no impact on the TRS with Eatala leaving the party. “People of the constituency are with KCR and the TRS.” At another press meet in Karimnagar, BC welfare minister Gangula Kamalakar called Eatala a liar. He said the TRS party’s B-form is like a Bhagvadgita and the party leadership did not have the culture to defeat a candidate to whom a B-form had been given to contest in the elections. Speaking at a party workers’ meeting in Huzurabad, the minister alleged Eatala tried to split the party with his ‘covert politics’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatalas-bluff-stands-exposed-before-people-trs-says/articleshow/83525094.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Construction projects still short of hands||New Delhi: Over a week after construction activity got the go-ahead, PWD officials said that while the number of workers had started to increase, they were still short of hands to complete projects in time. Private construction firms were also struggling to get all their labourers back to the capital.Shyam Prasad, a construction worker, said that he came back only after his employer insisted and promised him a higher salary. “We were a total of 30 people who used to work at a site but towards the commencement of work again, there were just five of them. This is when he realised that there is a dearth of labourers here in Delhi and that he has no option but to lure back those who had gone back to their villages,” said Prasad. A contractor Sajid said, “We are running short of capacity, but then we have to really request people to work extra hours.”A PWD official said that after the first wave too, it took them some time to get all the construction workers back. “Some fresh workers were later hired by the contractors and work was going on in full swing. Projects were on the verge of completion as well but with the second wave being so damaging, it is taking all the more time for things to come back to normal. Normalcy may return in the coming weeks but as of now, we are certain that the deadlines will not be met this time,” said the official.“When the first lockdown was lifted, there was a major crunch of labourers as most of them had gone to their respective villages during the migrant exodus. Even though most of them said that they wouldn't be returning to work, they did and we were soon operating on full capacity. However, we did not expect a similar problem to arise through the second wave as well,” he further said.Delhi government’s PWD is helming key projects such as the construction of 1.2-km-long tunnel between Purana Qila Road near Mathura Road and the Ring Road, which is part of ITPO Pragati Maidan Redevelopment Project; Barapullah phase-3 elevated corridor; Ashram underpass; and Benito-Juarez Road underpass, which is also called RTR Phase 2 project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/construction-projects-still-short-of-hands/articleshow/83523089.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Mumbai||Can’t junk case of cruelty against minor: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has declined to quash an FIR and chargesheet against a city couple booked for employing a minor to work in their home. “…the outcome of cases which have impact on society cannot be disposed of or allowed on the basis of amicable settlement”, a bench of Justices S S Shinde and Nitin Borkar said on June 10 while rejecting petitions by Ranjit Kumar Mishra and his wife Rishi Prabha. The Chembur police station charged them with cruelty and exploitation under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and for trafficking on a complaint by the cleaner of the housing society. The girl often chatted with him and his wife. The couple’s advocate, Vishal Kanade, argued that they are innocent. He said the cleaner admitted there was a misunderstanding and he does not wish to prosecute them any further, after meeting the girl’s parents. Kanade said both families have a longstanding relationship and the girl was sent voluntarily to them for her wellbeing and welfare. The parents’ reply said they have five children. The father is a farm labourer in Bihar. Their daughter seemed happy. “Prima facie financial condition of parents of victim is not good to pull on the needs of family and therefore, under said circumstances, the girl was given in the custody of the petitioners at Delhi,” the judges noted. Prosecutor Deepak Thakare said that the minor was brought to Mumbai under the pretext of admitting her to school, but was made to do household work. The judges referred to her two statements recorded in September 2018. She was woken up early, had to clean the house, wash utensils, dry clothes, drop and pick the couple’s daughter to the bus-stop and carry her school bag. She was occasionally beaten when she committed mistakes. She was given only two chapatis which was not sufficient food to meet her hunger and if she asked for more she was told “to eat less otherwise she will become fat”. The judges said it is true that the complainant and parents do not object to quashing the case. “However, statements of the victim cannot be ignored. At the relevant time her age was 10 years,” they noted, adding that merely because parents and complainant have joined the couple to quash the FIR and chargesheet on the basis of amicable settlement, it cannot be quashed. Also, there is sufficient material including witness statements and CCTV footage to proceed with the trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-cant-junk-case-of-cruelty-against-minor/articleshow/83526871.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Statistics show that drivers fall asleep is one of the causes for mishaps on highways. “During a road safety event earlier this year, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had asked the transport department to come up with technology which keeps drivers awake and prevents such mishaps. Now, we have tied up with NIC and have software with AI and cameras to alert drivers in case he is falling asleep or even if he yawns aloud,” Dhakne said. He further said that finishing touches were being given to the software and a demo will be given to the chief minister and other officials by the month-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-intel-cams-to-keep-truckers-awake-pre-empt-accidents/articleshow/83528467.cms||Somit Sen
---||Delhi||Delhi: AIIMS starts screening of kids in 6-12 age group for Covaxin trials||NEW DELHI: The All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, has started screening of children aged 6-12 years for the clinical trials of India’s first indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine — Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. Sources said the recruitment and clinical trials of children will start from Tuesday. The trials on children aged 6-12 years has already started at AIIMS Patna. The trials would ensure if Covaxin is suitable for children. AIIMS Delhi has decided to start the trial drive after the recruitment and clinical trials for single-dose Covaxin for 12-18 age group is completed. After the recruitment of those in the age group of 6-12 years, AIIMS would will be conducting trials for the age group 2-6 years. The trials are taking place at 525 centres. Screening of children for the trial of single-dose Covaxin among those aged between 2 and 18 years started at AIIMS Delhi on June 7 after India’s drug regulator granted permission for conducting the Phase II and III clinical trials of Covaxin for the age group 2 to 18 years on May 12. AIIMS Patna and Mysore Medical College and Research Institute in Karnataka have also been selected to conduct clinical trials on children. Covaxin is being used on adults in India’s ongoing Covid vaccination drive since January 16 this year. The government last week cautioned that even though Covid-19 had not taken a serious shape among children till now, its impact could increase among them if there is a change in virus behaviour or epidemiology dynamics, and said preparations were being strengthened to deal with such situation. “A national expert group has been formed to review Covid infections among children and approach the pandemic in a renewed way to strengthen the nation’s preparedness, NITI Aayog Member (Health) VK Paul had said at a presser.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aiims-starts-screening-of-kids-in-6-12-age-group-for-covaxin-trials/articleshow/83523117.cms||---
---||Delhi||Councillor to rescue of women cab drivers in Delhi||NEW DELHI: There was a time when women taxi drivers on city roads were a rare sight. Today, there are hundreds of them on the roads. However, this is not a happy time for them, with more than 150 of them having lost their jobs during the pandemic. Luckily for them, Abhishek Dutt has proved a guardian angel for the beleaguered women. Dutt, spokesperson of Indian National Congress, has distributed a month’s ration to the distressed drivers after some of them reached out to him after losing their work contracts with two app-based cab companies. In addition, he also wrote to National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma, saying the women drivers were unable to earn their livelihood and weren’t getting any support from any organisation. “I feel the government must come forward and provide support to them and safeguard all working women and ensure they aren’t asked to leave due to the lockdown, his letter said. “The government must ensure that they are given jobs or some monthly stipend so they can support their families.” Speaking to TOI, Dutt said that in most of the cases, the women were the sole breadwinners in their family. “I have tied up with two big firms and have enrolled 120 women in the counselling session with them so that they have an alternative job option,” he said. Dutt has also distributed rations to car cleaners, newspaper vendors and other people with similarly low-income levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/councillor-to-rescue-of-women-cab-drivers/articleshow/83523139.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Mumbai||Adani stocks tank as NSDL freezes accounts of 3 FPIs||Mumbai: The stocks of six Adani Group companies, run by billionaire businessman Gautam Adani, went into a tailspin on Monday after it came to light that accounts of three key foreign investors were frozen by depository NSDL, resulting in the conglomerate losing around Rs 70,000 crore market value at one point. The stocks, however, recovered later in the day after the group cited a mail from NSDL and said the accounts of the three FPIs that were shown as frozen on May 31 on the depository’s website, remained active. “The investment accounts of these three FPIs for investing in India and the ones relating to investing in Depository Receipts are completely separate. Hence, the freezing of DR accounts in no way hampers their operations in India as an FPI,” a source said. “As may be verified from the said system, the status of demat accounts …are held in ‘Active’ status in (the) NSDL system,” a document from Adani group quoted from the mail it received from NSDL. All group companies informed the bourses that their registrar and transfer agents have also clarified that the demat accounts “in which the aforesaid funds hold the shares of the company are not frozen”. The three foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) whose accounts were frozen as of May 31 were Albula Investments, APMS Investment and Cresta Fund. Their combined investment in the listed Adani entities add up to Rs 43,000 crore. Sources said the accounts of these three FPIs, along with several others, were frozen as a result of a Sebi order of 2016 relating to depository receipts (DRs), that is Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) and American Depository Receipts (ADRs). At the end of each month, depositories come out with the list of demat accounts which are frozen by it due to various reasons including regulatory directives and non-disclosures. Since the distinction between the accounts was not made on the NSDL site, the markets got jittery. As a result, in early trades, all the group companies -- Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports & SEZ, Adani Power, Adani Transmission, Adani Green and Adani Total -- were at their respective lower circuit levels, after falling up to 20%. The sell-off in one of the most talked-about groups in India, which saw its total market valuation jump multiple times in just a couple of years, weighed on market sentiment. As a result, the sensex was down by about 450 points but after the company's clarification, the index finally closed marginally higher, at 52,552 points, up 77 points on the day. On Monday, there was panic among investors on Dalal Street in early trades since the sell-off in these stocks was strong. This was more so because of the smart rise in group stocks in recent months, a dealer with a local brokerage said. For example, so far this year till Friday, the stock price of Adani Enterprises has gone up more than three times -- from Rs 479 to over Rs 1,600. On Monday, after touching an intra-day low at Rs 1,441, the stock closed at Rs 1,501, mainly because of the end-of-the-session pull-back rally, the dealer said. Most of the other Adani group stocks too witnessed such pull-back rallies, BSE data showed. However, Adani Power, Adani Transmission and Adani Total Gas all closed at the 5% lower circuit level. At the close of the day’s trading, the group’s total market was down nearly Rs 54,000 crore to Rs 8.97 lakh crore, BSE data showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/adani-stocks-tank-as-nsdl-freezes-accounts-of-3-fpis/articleshow/83526925.cms||---
---||Delhi||Unlock phase-3: After sour experience, Delhi eateries are happy to be back in the mix||NEW DELHI: After quickly sourcing supplies, service staff and sanitising his restaurant, chef Jatin Mallick finally reopened Tres after a prolonged closure due to the Covid-19 lockdown. He didn’t have great business numbers on Monday, but the day still fired his enthusiasm. A few tables at his European eatery were occupied for lunch, and as he watched the diners, he silently prayed that the worst was behind him. Shut down for eight weeks, the coronavirus still lurking in the air, the impending third wave of infections and asked to reopen on a ‘trial’ basis with time restrictions and sans permission to serve alcohol, the food and beverage industry has the odds stacked against it. No wonder most restaurant operators responded with a ‘fingers crossed’ circumspection when asked how they felt on resuming business on Monday. Kabir Suri termed it a good start and said things were positive for the first day, encouraging him to open most of his Dhaba, Mamagoto and Sly Granny outlets across NCR by the weekend. Deepak Bhatia, VP operations, Lite Bite Foods, also reported heartening occupancy at his Punjab Grill and YouMee outlets. Hotels had a steady footfall. The Lodhi saw guests at its alfresco eatery Elan, Shangri-La’s Eros New Delhi found diners trickling in for coffee shop at Mister Chai, Shang Palace and Tamra, Taj Palace New Delhi welcomed a few regulars back to Capital Kitchen and The Tea Lounge, while Hyatt Regency witnessed a somewhat populated lobby with diners headed for TK’s Oriental Grill and La Piazza. What most hotels received queries for though were about the salons — and majority were fully booked on the day. Curtailed operating hours and no serving of alcohol put off the resumption plans of a few eateries. Sidecar was one of them. Minakshi Singh claimed running her bar simply as a food outlet wasn’t commensurate with the expenses of opening the place. Resuming without alcohol service meant taking on an unwanted financial burden, said Singh, who added that she would reopen the moment alcohol was permitted. Akshay Anand of Ophelia questioned the logic of not permitting alcohol in restaurants when liquor stores were allowed to open. Most restaurants with bars are putting off reopening till next week to be able to gauge the response and await permissions to operate without restrictions. Zorawar Kalra of Massive Restaurants pointed out that dinner sales accounted for over 70% of a restaurant’s revenues and the operating hours need to be extended for businesses to be viable. The authorities’ “trial basis” admonition also added an element of uncertainty. This made work difficult for chef-owned spaces, explained Jamsheed Bhote of Plats. “We have to call back our service team from their hometowns and also restart without the remunerative dinner service because of the limit of 8pm. And then there is a chance we will be asked to close again,” he grumbled. Bobby Gujral of Wok in the Clouds said operating with these restrictions meant that a restaurant was neither able to plan its business beyond a day nor was the diner able to get the complete food and beverage experience he would have hoped for. “Yes, we need to strictly implement the instructions about seating capacity and social distance, but we shouldn’t limit the timings and ban alcohol service,” Gujral said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-sour-experience-eateries-are-happy-to-be-back-in-the-mix/articleshow/83523210.cms||Amin Ali
---||Delhi||Delhi: At special centre, a jab and a ticket to fly out||NEW DELHI: From a young man who has to report to a merchant navy base in Canada and a chef who had to reach Ireland in May but got stuck in Delhi to a Mongolian couple stranded in the city due to the pandemic and, of course, students who have got admission in undergraduate and degree programmes overseas, the people milling around the special vaccination centre at Navyug School on Mandir Marg on Tuesday were all impatient to roll up their sleeves. The facility set up by Delhi government to vaccinate those who need to undertake international travel within August 31 saw a big rush on Tuesday, the second day of operations there. With just 200 jabs to be administered during the day based on a token system, many reached the centre early so as not to be denied their bio visa, without which they could be denied permission to reach their foreign destination. One of the early birds was Ashok Vihar resident Jaikrith, who is headed for Canada to pursue a bachelor’s degree in business administration. “I reached the centre around 8am, got the token and then the vaccination,” Jaikirth grinned. “As the dosage gap for the Covishield vaccine had been increased, I was very worried, thinking that I would have to reschedule everything. I am glad Delhi government made an exception for foreign students and created this special inoculation centre.” With pre-travel vaccination now a possibility, many other relieved students were at Navyug School, more reassured now that they will be able to fly abroad to their universities. Standing in the queue was the couple from Mongolia. Pleading they were foreigners, they refrained from talking. An official who interacted with them explained to TOI, “They got stranded in Delhi due to the lockdown. And then they could not travel without being vaccinated.” Saurabh Sharma got his second dose at the vaccination centre. “I have to join the merchant navy base in Canada soon. It was mandatory to be vaccinated before I could travel,” Sharma said. “Thankfully, the government realised this problem and saved a lot of us trouble.” Sharma had come on Monday too, but had to return since he wasn’t among the earliest 200 who got tokens. With some arriving at the school as early as 5am, many others who came later did not get a chance to be injected. Tanima, a student who has to reach Columbia University in the US, came only after 9am and couldn’t get a token. Neither did Shreya, another student who had come all the way from Dwarka. Said Tanima: “I didn’t know that we had to report before 9am or that there was a token system. I thought it would be crowded in the morning and bided by time.” Sunny Singh too didn’t realise that as a dependent traveller he couldn’t be given the vaccine. His wife, though, got the jab because she is enrolled for a master’s degree course in a UK university. “I have a dependent visa and work permit too, but apparently under the rules they cannot give me my second dose,” he sighed. “We have a four-year-old daughter and that is why both of us had to leave together.” He is worried because his visa expires on August 1 and his regular vaccination slot is later than this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-special-centre-a-jab-and-a-ticket-to-fly-out/articleshow/83557645.cms||Shradha Chettri

Tak is accused of killing Khan and five other family members. The defence sought the case to be tried by one of judges before whom some of the earlier witnesses had deposed.

However, on Monday, the citizens thronged the streets to buy essentials.Many people had stepped out to buy vegetables. The vendors were not allowed to sit in markets, instead, they were allocated space in open areas along the streets. The vendors were seen on the streets till late afternoon.ASHA workers were assisting the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) staff to carry out rapid antigen test of those found moving on the streets without masks and violating the social distancing norm. In the morning, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s tour to Kolhapur city led to strict implementation of the restrictions by the police particularly in the areas he visited.Non-essential shops to remain closedThe owners of non-essential shops decided to wait for a couple of days to reopen their shops. They were planning to open the shops from Tuesday irrespective of permission, however, after Pawar said there will be no relaxations, the traders decided not to adopt a confrontational mode. The police administration will be active for some days and action such as penalty or sealing of shops will not be affordable for the traders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-residents-rush-to-buy-essentials-after-weekend-curbs/articleshow/83518673.cms||---
---||Bhopal||As curbs bite their business, traders and vendors seek relief in Bhopal||BHOPAL: A roadside eatery in Shahpura used to be crowded all the time till Rameshwar, its owner, would ask his customers to leave at 9pm, the time he closed his shop. After the lockdown in 2020, when he opened the eatery, it took time before his customers started coming to him for snacks and food that they once liked so much as to keep the place bustling with the crowd all the time during the day. As his business was coming back on track, areas under Shahpura police station were declared ‘containment zone’ and later, lockdown was clamped in entire Bhopal. After 50 days of lockdown, restrictions were eased on June 1 when eateries and restaurants were allowed to take orders for delivery at home or customers taking their stuff and leaving. Rameshwar has not opened his eatery as yet. “Everthing is gone. Pata nahin kiski nazar lag gayi. We have to start wrapping things more than an hour in advance to meet to the 9pm deadline. Things are not usual now,” says Rameshwar. Rameshwar is not alone to suffer. Hundreds of roadside vendors and small traders are in repenting due to the restrictions put on the market from time to time. “When you talk of vendors or small traders, what business do they do? Tea stall, pan shop, snacks, food, vegetables, fruits, ice-cream, chat and such things. Majority of them are in business related to food stuff and not only steps like lockdown or covid curfew hit them hard but also people avoiding eating outside, greater emphasis on hygiene and a perception among them that food at a roadside eatery or a snack shop will not be hygienic. Apart from closure of shops from time to time, this perception has also affected their business,” said Virendra, who had a tea stall which he closed during the first lockdown itself and is now working as a driver in a private firm. There are sizable number of people, who believe that it's “callous” attitude of vendors and their customers towards observing Covid-19 protocol, which spreads infection when the markets open up more than anything else. “Most vendors do not to wear masks. They seldom ask their customers to maintain distance. During the lockdown, when a lot of people started wearing masks due to fear, many vendors as well as customers were keeping their mask on their chin. After the lockdown, when other vendors have also opened their shops, you can see for yourself they are not wearing masks properly nor they are asking their customers to keep a safe distance. If they don’t adopt Covid-appropriate behavior, there will be lockdowns and they will suffer losses,” said Sanjay Pathak, a resident of Arera Colony. Vegetable and fruit vendors are often seen on roads during the lockdown giving an impression that they are not stopped by the police but during the recent lockdown, police was tough on them also particularly if they are seen with their handcart on the main road. “We come prepared to take the blows from policemen. They come and beat us randomly. But, if we don’t sell fruits, how will our families survive,” said a fruit vendor in Arera Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/curbs-eating-into-their-biz-traders-vendors-seek-relief/articleshow/83523214.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Mumbai||Private hospitals in districts with big cities like Pune & Thane caused toll backlog||MUMBAI: Private hospitals in Maharashtra’s districts that have big cities such as Pune, Nashik, Thane and Nagpur caused a backlog in data collection due to their failure to report Covid-19 deaths within the mandatory 48 hours, according to health department officials. The only exception is Mumbai, which figured in the state death data reconciliation exercise only once: the June 13 update mentioned that 67 deaths had been added to Mumbai’s toll. These additions are mainly deaths that occurred more than a week earlier. In the past five days, the state added 9,021 ‘extra’ and ‘older than a week’ deaths (between 1,300 and 2,300 every day) to its toll that, at 1.12 lakh, is higher than of most countries. Between May 17 and June 14, the state’s reconciliation exercise has added 19,116 extra deaths. “The main culprits are private hospitals in cities. The public hospitals in smaller or rural areas are not so far behind despite facing a worse manpower crunch and technical issues,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, head of the health department’s epidemiology cell. Districts with mega cities indeed are logging in the highest numbers: Pune, for instance, has added between 100 to 500 deaths on many days of this nearly month-long data update. In the last month, Pune district has added 2,586 ‘old’ deaths to the toll. Nashik, Nagpur and Thane are the other urban culprits with three-digit additions on most days. The additions in smaller districts such as Chandrapur, Latur, Sindhudurg and Wardha are in single digits on most days. District collectors have stated that the backlog is mostly from private hospitals, and they have been asked to complete the exercise in the next few days. “Of the total old deaths that are being added under the data update, 70% are from the private hospitals,” said Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare. The district has so far added nearly 700 old deaths, some even two months old, taking the cumulative death toll to 6,200. The main reason for the delay in reporting of these deaths was manpower crunch during the second wave’s peak, when everyone was busy with patient care than the record books. While reconciliation between data calculated by the state and various districts takes place every week or fortnight, the intensity of the second wave upset the discipline, according to state officials. The reconciliation exercise started after the second wave caseload subsided in most parts of the state. “When cases were at the peak, the entire healthcare system, from labs that collected swabs to hospitals that treated patients, was overburdened and priority was to ensure timely patient care,” said a senior bureaucrat. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare was unaware about the 67 extra deaths added to Mumbai’s toll. “It could be deaths of Mumbaikars that occurred in other districts or some delayed reporting. We will look into it,” she said. Mumbai has a dedicated team, including IT specialists, looking at data management to avoid a recurrence of last June, when the death data in Mumbai had been upwardly revised by 862 deaths. The BMC then found private hospitals were the culprit, with some hospitals reporting deaths after weeks. The state government has earned praise from various quarters for being transparent about data. “We are continuously asking districts to update figures so that the second wave’s impact can be analysed and planning for the third wave can be done,” he added. The exercise is nearly complete. “Reporting of old deaths is slowly reducing as the reconciliation process is at the fag end, we are hoping that in the next 2-3days, our district data will be clean and up-t-date,” said Nashik collector Mandhare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pvt-hosps-in-dists-with-big-cities-like-pune-thane-caused-toll-backlog/articleshow/83526980.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Delhi||Challans rise by 45% as Delhi doesn’t heed advice||NEW DELHI: As the capital has gradually opened up in the last two weeks, the number of people on the streets, at the markets and in offices has gone up as has the number of prosecutions for violations of Covid guidelines. On June 7, when the second phase of the lockdown relaxations came into effect, 3,366 fines of Rs 2,000 each were levied by the nearly 250 enforcement teams to those not wearing masks, not maintaining distancing or spitting in public. On June 13, the figure had climbed 45% to 4,884 booking, as per Delhi government figures. According to sources, close to 5,000 challans were issued on Monday when further relaxations came into effect. In May, when Delhi was in lockdown, a total of 77,715 challans were issued, an average of 2,507 \a day. With manufacturing units and construction sites allowed to operate from May 31, the first week of June saw 20,966 challans issued, 3,870 a day on average. The week after June 7, when shops were allowed to open on odd-even basis and private offices with 50% staff, saw 29,343 bookings, the daily average being 4,192. “Our focus on the first two to three days after the relaxations on June 7 was on dissemination of information and creating awareness rather than stringent penalties for violations,” a district official said. “However, our enforcement teams were deployed to keep a hawk eye on markets, malls, office complexes and other public places and the number of bookings started going up.” The official added, “Most of the violations are detected in the markets, which have the highest number of people gathering. Our teams are also keeping a close watch near liquor vends but no major violations have been noticed. We have also deployed teams at major intersections and at places where the pedestrians cross roads.” The district official claimed that the monitoring teams were extremely vigilant and were also visiting all places where crowding was a regular occurrence, apart from the more obvious places like office complexes, markets and mandis. “For instance, even though religious places are open but no visitors are allowed in, we still find people around these areas and our teams ensure that guidelines are not violated,” he said. Other officials said the district authorities had held meetings with market welfare associations, mall owners and private offices to ensure Covid norms were enforced. Among the 11 revenue districts of Delhi, the South East district saw the highest number of challans — 4,930 — being issued last week, with more than 700 challans being issued on average every day, with the peak being 756 challans on Friday, June 11. On the other hand, the South West district saw the least number of bookings — 1,607 — the highest number of challans on a single day being 318 on Sunday, June 13. A distant second to South East district is Shahdara (4,047), followed by North (3,967) and North East (2,982) districts. Districts apart from South West that saw fewer than 2,000 bookings last week are South (1,927) and North West (1,921) districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/challans-rise-by-45-as-city-doesnt-heed-advice/articleshow/83523219.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||IMA chief’s comments: HC won’t stay order||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday refused to stay a district judge order asking Indian Medical Association (IMA) president J A Jayalal to refrain from using the organisation’s platform to propagate any religion. The trial court judge had also cautioned the IMA chief that loose comments can’t be expected from a person chairing a responsible post. Justice Asha Menon said the court will not pass any ex parte order and posted the plea for June 16, to hear the stand of the person on whose complaint the trial court had passed the order on June 4. The high court said it will have to look into the order passed by the trial court and cannot take a superficial view. The court, however, issued notice on the appeal filed by Jayalal challenging the trial court’s order. In his plea, the IMA president sought to stay the observations made against him saying they were affecting his reputation as he was heading a body of 3.5 lakh doctors as its members. He contended that there was no television debate between Jayalal and Yoga guru Ramdev and that he was not propagating any religion, including Christianity, and that the suit before the district court was based on fake news. If anyone promotes allopathy, this does not mean that the person was asking for conversion into Christianity, Jayalal’s counsel argued, adding that he is not against ayurveda but against mixopathy. The counsel said Jayalal never uttered any remarks against Hinduism nor ever tried to force convert any Indian of any religion to Christianity. Additional district judge Ajay Goel had, earlier this month, passed the order on a plea filed against Jayalal for allegedly starting a defamatory campaign against the Hindu religion “by way of promoting Christianity, in the garb of proving superiority of allopathic medicines over ayurveda in treatment of Covid-19 patients.” Complainant Rohit Jha had alleged before the trial court that Jayalal was misusing his position and misleading the nation and its citizens in order to convert Hindus to Christianity.  Goel concluded that no injunction is needed based on the assurance given by Jayalal that he will not indulge in such kind of activity and had noted that the plea seemed to be an offshoot of a verbal duel with respect to allopathy vs ayurveda. He had also quoted in his order, a couplet written by poet Mohd Iqbal - “Mazhab Nahi Sikhata Apas Mein Bair Rakhna; Hindi Hai Hum Watan Hai Hindustan Humara; Saare Jahan se Acha Hindustan Humara.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ima-chiefs-comments-hc-wont-stay-order/articleshow/83523261.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Vaccination for 18+ comes to a screeching halt again||New Delhi: The Covid-19 vaccination drive for the 18-44 years old has been hit again in Delhi, with half of the centres for them being closed from Tuesday while the rest to be shut from Wednesday. Only 31,000 vaccine doses — less than one day’s stock — are left for this group, slowing down the drive again, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi said in a press conference. She appealed to the Centre to provide the required vaccines. The vaccination of the 18-44 years age group resumed at the government centres on June 9 after remaining suspended for 15 days. So far, 61.5 lakh people have been vaccinated in Delhi, out of which 46.87 lakh have got the first dose and 14.63 lakh both doses. In Delhi, 60,734 people received the jab on Monday. The count was less than usual due to the low vaccine stock, said a source. More than 50% of the people in the above 45 years age category have been vaccinated. “Now those who have not been vaccinated in the 45+ category, they are being contacted by Delhi government on a door-to-door basis for vaccination. But, many people still have some hesitation about the vaccine,” Atishi said. “Apart from this, many people have just recovered from Covid-19 and are not eligible to take the vaccine.” The MLA claimed, “The only way to eliminate vaccine hesitation in the age group of 45+ is to vaccinate the youth. When the youths come to get the vaccine, they will bring other family members along with them.” The special vaccination drive at the polling booth level has entered the second week and has helped in expansion of the coverage, she added. Delhi received 60,200 doses of Covaxin and 2 lakh doses of Covishield on Monday for the 45+ age category. So far, 56,20,110 vaccine doses have been received for this group. Delhi currently has a stock of 7.95 lakh vaccine doses. “Covaxin’s stock is left for 22 days and Covishield’s for 43 days,” Atishi said. When Delhi is being unlocked, the vaccination of youth is most important, she pointed out. “The youth are going back to office. That is why our appeal to the central government is to provide the vaccine to the youth of Delhi at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vaccination-for-18-comes-to-a-screeching-halt-again/articleshow/83557718.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A total of 43 surgeries have been carried out so far. The black fungus mainly attacks the nose and throat and sometimes the eyes and brains. The hospital has experienced surgeons at its disposal, however, with the rise in cases of mucormycosis, there is a shortage of surgeons.S S More, the dean of the hospital said, “We have started two operation theatres. Currently, four to five surgeries are carried out every day. We expect the help of surgeons especially ENT surgeons to speed up the surgeries. They can carry out surgeries at their facility or in the CPR Hospital. It takes four to five hours to carry out surgery of mucormycosis patients.”In recent days, the private hospitals empanelled under Mahatma Phule Jeevandayee Yojana have started admitting patients suffering from mucormycosis, however, most of the private hospitals with surgeons available are not admitting. The cost involved in the surgeries is high and the government has capped the cost of various surgical procedures to be done.“We do the surgeries free of cost. Most of the patients are referred to us from private hospitals. We are increasing the number of beds to accommodate the increasing number of patients,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/black-fungus-cpr-admin-appeals-to-surgeons-to-treat-patients/articleshow/83518782.cms||---

Although the government has allowed 20% of the supply of oxygen to industries, the industrial associations have sought 50% supply. The district authorities are yet to allow greater allocation. Industrialists said the price of oxygen has increased from Rs 250 per cylinder to over Rs 500 per cylinder. The prices will get regularized if at least 50% of the oxygen supply is allowed. “We have started getting 20% of the total oxygen supply. The daily production of oxygen in Nashik district is around 90 metric tonnes per day. Although industries have started production, the demand for oxygen is comparatively more,” said Nikhil Panchal, vice-president, Ambad Industries & Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA). “Moreover, higher rates of oxygen cylinders is another major issue. Before the second wave of Covid 19, industries would get oxygen cylinders at Rs 250 each. Now, the price has gone over Rs 500 per cylinder,” said Panchal. He said they are planning to meet district collector Suraj Mandhare seeking higher supply. Industrialist M G Kulkarni said the cost of production has increased due to rise in oxygen price. “Hence, there is a need to increase the supply of oxygen and reduce the cost of oxygen to make production cost-effective,” he said. Santosh Gawli, general manager of District Industries Centre (DIC), Nashik, said, “We have started 20% supply of oxygen as per the state government guidelines. We will seek approval from the state government on the issue if we get demand from industrial associations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-inc-hits-oxygen-supply-cost-hurdles/articleshow/83518820.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Delhi||Day 1 of unlock 3: Minding the gap inside Delhi Metro stations, long queues outside||NEW DELHI: Some of the busy Delhi Metro stations like Rajiv Chowk, Chawri Bazar and Barakhamba Road saw massive queues and an average waiting time of around 30 minutes to enter the station on Monday evening as unlock relaxations came into effect. During the morning rush hour on Monday, stations like Dwarka and Nawada saw waiting time of up to 40 minutes. At many places, social distancing was found to be completely missing as queues kept getting longer, but stringent restrictions meant limited commuters could be allowed inside at a time. Delhi Metro resumed its services on June 7, four weeks after operations were completely suspended to contain the spread of Covid-19 and 48 days after its doors were closed to passengers not engaged in essential services. However, with only 50% seating capacity and no standing passengers allowed, the carrying capacity of trains have reduced by more than 80% Taking to social media, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation tweeted that apart from drastically reduced carrying capacity to maintain social distance, entry of passengers is allowed in a limited and controlled manner to have manageable crowds in trains, at platform and inside station premises. As the number of entry points are limited, DMRC advised commuters to keep sufficient time in hand for travel. With all the standalone shops, markets and malls allowed to open on all days and restaurants allowed to function with 50% seating capacity, people started flocking back to markets and attendance in private offices, which have been allowed to operate with 50% staff, also seemed to have increased. Apart from entry points of Delhi Metro stations, a large number of commuters could be seen at bus stops too. Buses are also allowed to carry only 50% of seating capacity and no standing passengers. When Delhi Metro reopened for the general public on June 7, it witnessed 6.4 lakh “passenger journeys”. Before the lockdown, Delhi Metro witnessed around 20 lakh passenger journeys a day, but passengers were allowed to stand with a distance of one feet back then. The number of passenger journeys grew to 9.1 lakh, 9.5 lakh and then 10.3 lakh on Friday. The number dipped to 8.8 lakh on Saturday and 6.2 lakh on Sunday as weekends always see lower footfall. Along with the number of passengers, the number of challans issued by the nine flying squads of DMRC also increased. While on the first day 86 passengers were fined Rs 200 for not wearing face masks properly, 106 passengers were “counselled” for not maintaining social distance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/minding-the-gap-inside-stns-long-queues-outside/articleshow/83523231.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kolkata||Curbs to help raze Posta flyover: Kolkata cops||KOLKATA: The extension of enhanced curbs and the continuation with restricted market timings will help cops in managing traffic and facilitate razing of Vivekananda flyover in Posta from Tuesday. The extension of enhanced restrictions — with minor changes — will provide Kolkata Traffic Police the much required time to try out alternative plans around Strand Road. “The fact that no buses will ply will allow us to send more vehicles through MG Road. Similarly, with market timings seeing little change, we can continue with our plans regarding trucks and slow-moving vehicles (cycle vans) in the Posta area,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Kolkata Police had planned a trial run in the area before going for the final work execution. “However, several issues ensured that the plan never took off. But now with lesser vehicles on the road and the restrictions in place, we can fine tune our plans. Besides MG Road, we are keen to see how the truck movement through CR Avenue (from Vidyasagar Setu) affects normal traffic on the busy road. A third aspect is to ensure that certain roads reserved for slow vehicles — like Mirbahar Ghat Street and Nalin Seth Street — can cope with the pressure without hampering smaller vehicle movement on Maharshi Debendra Road. We might even use diversions through Brabourne Road if the traffic becomes too heavy on this sector. However, once the motorists become used to the traffic diversions, movement will be easier,” said an ACP. If the extension of restrictions will have an impact here, so will the KMDA and its executing agency’s decision not to hurry things. The agency on Monday clarified that it will carry out several tests and security drills from Tuesday along the 115m stretch between Nawab Lane and Posta crossing before it finally begins the razing work. The actual work will begin on June 20 after all necessary safety drills and precautions are in place. “This is important given that we can build confidence among local people and traders that all precautions are being taken. This will help us get more cooperation from them,” said a police officer from Posta police station. The authorities have already fenced off the selected portion that will be pulled down in the first phase. “From Tuesday, tools will be assembled and fixed. This would take some time to see that everything is in place. The dismantling work will be done following a new technology in which there will be almost no sound and pollution during work. Also, all the angles regarding the safety measures need to be thoroughly checked before the structure is pulled down,” said a KMDA engineer. In the first phase, the Nawab Lane area will be completed first. In all, a 180m portion of the flyover stretching from near Old Mint to Posta market on Strand Road will be razed in two months. Officials said that once this portion is pulled down, it would be discussed and chalked out with the police to take up the next phase of dismantling work that will be taken on the flyover’s stretch from Ganesh Talkies to Girish Park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/curbs-to-help-raze-posta-flyover-cops/articleshow/83523235.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav on Monday directed the health officials to conduct the sero survey and approach the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) of Aurangabad for its technical support. NMC officials said the findings of sero survey will help the civic body to prepare for the third wave of Covid. In January , NMC had conducted the sero survey with technical support and guidance from the GMCH Aurangabad. As per the findings of the survey, antibodies were found developed among 39.5% of the population. NMC officials said they will soon hold talks with the GMCH, Aurangabad and fix dates to conduct the survey. Avesh Palod, the Covid officer of NMC, said, “This will help us to know how many city residents have developed antibodies and this will help us prepare for the third wave of Covid,” said Palod. The second wave of Covid in the city was bigger than the first wave. NMC had registered 26,000 cases in September alone last year in the city. In April, this year, 71,000 new cases were reported. Now, the experts have projected the third wave of Covid anytime this year. NMC is already in the process of increasing the number of oxygen beds and setting up new oxygen generation plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-conduct-sero-survey-in-nashik-city/articleshow/83518893.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Five venues selected for zone-wise vaccination of school staff, teachers||KOLKATA: Five city schools across boards have been chosen by the state school education department for zone-wise vaccination of teachers and non-teaching staff from Wednesday. These vaccinations will be given by KMC free of cost at the designated schools. On Monday, KMC also started a free vaccination camp inside St Xavier’s College and another free drive kicked off at the Bhawanipur Education Society College campus in partnership with Kolkata Police and SSKM. The five schools that have been chosen are Purvanchal Vidyamandir, St Augustine’s Day School, Kolkata, DPS Ruby Park, Rammohun Mission and MP Birla Foundation. Each school has been assigned a zone and teachers of schools in that zone will have to reach the venue to get the jab. Purvanchal will deal with the schools in the north of the city; St Augustine’s will be the venue for schools in central Kolkata. Schools are registering via a common portal that is being monitored by the school education department. “We are providing the venue and the logistical support. The rest is being taken care by KMC and the school education department,” said St Augustine’s principal Richard Gasper. All the schools have been asked to arrange for an AC oxygen-supported ambulance with doctors on the campus. “We have been told to expect at least 500 teachers and support staff every day. As of now, the drive has been scheduled for three days,” said a senior member of the DPS-Ruby Park administration. “We are happy to be of help to the state at a time when the schools are shut,” said Krishna Damani, spokesperson for MP Birla Foundation. Speaking about Monday’s initiative, Father Dominic Savio, principal of St Xaver’s College said: “We are providing the venue and computers while the inoculation is being done by the KMC.” “Around 300 recipients took the jab,” said Miraj D Shah, vice-chairman of Bhawanipur Education Society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/five-venues-selected-for-zone-wise-vaccination-of-school-staff-teachers/articleshow/83523263.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Expressing surprise at the closure of parks even though all markets and malls, including restaurants with 50% capacity, have been permitted to open, Bidhuri demanded immediate opening of parks and gardens in the capital.“Parks are used by people from all walks of life for health benefits. They take a walk in parks and do exercises as part of their fitness regime. It is unfortunate that the Delhi government has decided to keep parks shut while malls and liquor shops have been permitted to open without any hindrance,” said Bidhuri.The BJP functionary urged lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to take an immediate decision to open parks and open spaces so that people can resume their morning and evening walk and other fitness activities. All Covid-19 norms should be followed while allowing parks and other open spaces to be open for the public,” said Bidhuri.Bidhuri suggested that restrictions on use of open gyms in parks can be issued while allowing the parks to open. “Even doctors and experts advise that parks and open spaces are much safer than the closed auditoriums or closed spaces when it comes to Covid spread” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-bjp-seeks-reopening-of-parks-gardens/articleshow/83523254.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In letters sent to President Ram Nath Kovind and PM Narendra Modi, Sawant has emphasised the need for the Centre to approve the bill passed by the Maharashtra legislature empowering Mhada to take over cessed buildings in the city for redevelopment. The amendments were passed last year after the collapse of two cessed buildings in South Mumbai. Disputes between tenants, landlords and developers often result in no redevelopment for years. Sawant has pointed out the bill was passed by both houses in September 2020 and has been pending approval, so the Maharashtra government is helpless and not in a position to carry out either repair or redevelopment of cessed buildings. He has also mentioned that the city has nearly 16,000 cessed buildings, which are in a dilapidated condition, while a few are on MbPT, NTC and LIC land. These are neither repaired nor redeveloped, and Mhada is not allowed to carry out redevelopment, he has stated. Sawant has said the Bombay high court had taken suo motu cognisance of the Malwani incident and ordered a judicial probe. This proves how approval of the amended Act is essential and important, the Sena MP has stated. Sawant has mentioned the bill’s provisions empowering Mhada to take over a building and complete development. Consent of 51% residents is needed for redevelopment, and Mhada provides compensation to the land/building owner, and the Act lays down rules to complete the procedure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sena-mp-asks-pm-and-prez-to-okay-maharashtra-state-bill-on-cessed-bldgs/articleshow/83528500.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||479 sandalwood trees cut, 593 damaged at Gautala in 2 yrs||Aurangabad: The Gautala-Autramghat wildlife sanctuary has been facing unprecedented threats from smugglers, who allegedly cut as many as 479 sandalwood trees and damaged 593 others at the biodiversity hotspot in the past two years. The shocking revelation has been made by the forest department itself, which carried out a thorough inspection of the Patnadevi area of the sanctuary located in Chalisgaon range upon complaints of tree-cutting from certain local elements. Divisional Forest Officer (Wildlife) Vijay Satpute on Monday said three staff members have been suspended in connection with the tree-cutting incident and will face departmental inquiry. “A team of forest department officials thoroughly inspected the Patnadevi area of the sanctuary between May 20 and May 29 and found that as many as 479 sandalwood trees were cut. It includes 424 trees having a stem diameter in the range of 10 cm to 45 cm. Besides, 593 other sandalwood trees were found badly damaged at the site with entire destruction taking place in the past two years,” he said. While a large amount of sandalwood was believed to be stolen from Patnadevi area, the forest department has recovered 6.37 cubic meters of sandalwood from different areas of the sanctuary. “The ground-level forest staff was so casual towards patrolling that smugglers had made the sanctuary almost their second home by carrying out cooking and temporary stays during their illegal activities. Even smugglers were in no hurry to take away the cut sandalwood due to serious lapses in discharging duties by forest staff,” Satpute said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/479-sandalwood-trees-cut-593-damaged-at-gautala-in-2-yrs/articleshow/83518940.cms||Prasad Joshi

The department has said that the grants will be held back if the colleges don't abide by the order. It also added that the colleges will have to pay the same deposit (security) money amount to Sri Dev Suman University as they paid to the HNBGU. Besides, the colleges will be given a discount if they apply for affiliation through the online mode. The officials of the higher education department had earlier met the representatives of these colleges in this regard. There are 18 government-aided colleges in Uttarakhand and a majority of them are hesitant to shift their affiliation from a central to a state university. Meanwhile, after receiving directions from the CM’s office, the state education department has taken up the task of completing all the unfinished infrastructural work in the schools by State Foundation Day (November 9). The chief minister's office had directed officials to ensure adequate furniture and PEYJAL connections in all the government-run schools apart from upgrading the basic amenities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/take-affiliation-from-sri-dev-suman-varsity-or-lose-grant-edu-dept-to-govt-aided-colleges/articleshow/83521354.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Mumbai||Scramble for visas freezes US portal, locks students out||NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: A scramble for interview slots among applicants who have to join US colleges this fall led to glitches on the embassy portal as it resumed processing student visas in India on Monday. “We are aware of the high demand for student visa appointments. Please remember, do not refresh too often, as you may be locked out of your account. Appointments remain available at all posts, and we will continue to add appointments as conditions allow,” the US embassy said in a tweet on Monday after it resumed the process of facilitating travel for those who have to join colleges in July and August. Students who kept refreshing in the hope of booking a slot were eventually locked out for “suspicious activity” for 72 hours. By afternoon, the site had a message that said: “We are down for maintenance”. The embassy’s tweet warning students not to refresh too often drew scores of replies, many of them seemingly desperate appeals. “My account got locked without a prior warning. Many others are facing this issue too. Request you to unlock the accounts, at least this time,” said one. The consulate had held a webinar on June 10 to hand out information on visas interviews and pre-boarding requirements. Officials had assured candidates that everyone would get a slot once the process opened. “Student visas remain a top priority for the US Mission to India and we are making every attempt to facilitate student travel in time for the fall semester,” the embassy had said. However, an aspirant who is flying out for a post-doctoral programme said, “There was no clarity on the time when the embassy would open appointment slots. Many logged in a little after midnight. When we realized the site was not accepting bookings, we slept for a bit and logged in again early in the morning.” Another candidate said slots did open initially for Delhi and Kolkata, but as demand surged and applicants kept refreshing, they were locked out. Study abroad counsellor Pratibha Jain said, “This is the first time the consulate website has crashed. I am surprised they did not anticipate the rush. Nobody was able to open the site. Going by the previous numbers about 80,000 to 1 lakh students must have logged in at the same time; it is like opening a two-by-two door for entry into a large stadium; there is going to be a stampede.” Another counsellor added: “Ideally, the process should have been staggered.” Students who have been locked out have requested the embassy to unblock their accounts. One applicant’s father tweeted asking for locked accounts to be reopened: “Please empathise and let not our kids go through more stress.” Another said: “The site kept crashing leaving us with no choice but to log in multiple times and now we’ve been blocked for 72 hours.” Meanwhile, France is wooing students from India and has resumed student visa processing. Emmanuel Lenain, ambassador of France to India, tweeted: “Looking to study in France? Student visa applications are now open at your nearest VFS centre! Get all the information you need on programmes & scholarships, plus free counselling at your nearest Campus France office: https://t.co/Typ1z2VtTk .” Several countries currently have restrictions on travel from India. The French ambassador’s tweet saw replies from students who wanted to know when they could travel to join colleges there. “Great news, can you please advise when borders are reopening? I have a student visa already and my classes start in three weeks. Waiting eagerly for some clarity,” a student tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/scramble-for-visas-freezes-us-portal-locks-students-out/articleshow/83527028.cms||Saurabh Sinha

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 41-year-old to go home after defeating Covid, black fungus||KOLKATA: When Sanjeev Kumar Chaudhury goes home on Tuesday, it will be a second homecoming for the marketing executive from Katihar. His family will heave a sigh of relief as he has not only defeated Covid-19 but also the dreaded mucormycosis, or black fungus, that stalked the 41-year-old. The patient had tested positive to Covid-19 in end-April. He had been on steroids and antibiotics during the treatment. Afer an uneventful recovery, Chaudhury’s life had started rolling back on the track when he noticed a swelling and pain on the left side of his face. Local ENT and skin doctors he consulted raised the black fungus alarm. “I spoke to my boss who is in Kolkata and he asked me to rush to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals with the assurance that he would help me get in touch with the doctors,” Chaudhury told TOI. He landed in Kolkata the very next day, on May 15. By the time to Shantanu Panja, consultant ENT (head & neck surgeon) at Apollo checked on him, the facial pain had aggravated along with pain in eye. “The patient also suffered from uncontrolled diabetes. We immediately conducted a life-saving surgery to remove the entire disease endoscopically to prevent infection travelling to the brain and damaging the eye,” said Panja. Unlike Covid-19, in which the fatality is about 3%, in mucormycosis it is as high as 50% to 70%. Even if the patients are saved, they can end up losing vision and the surgeries are often disfiguring. “Timely management, aggressive yet functionally conservative surgical approach, multidisciplinary teamwork, experience and above all perseverance are the key to success mucormycosis treatment. We are happy that we could give a new lease of life to the patient while saving his eye and avoiding any kind of surgical disfigurement,” said Panja. The state has reported 50 confirmed mucormycosis cases in addition to 123 suspected cases. The infection has claimed 12 lives while 26 patients suspected with black fungus have died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/41-year-old-to-go-home-after-defeating-covid-black-fungus/articleshow/83523269.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Delhi||Covid-19 helpline started by Chadha rings in hope||New Delhi: A Covid helpline started by Aam Aadmi Party MLA Raghav Chadha for his Rajendra Nagar assembly constituency has grown into a state-wide helpline with 40 volunteers managing the calls. The helpline team claims to have assisted more than 15,000 patients to get hospital admissions and to secure oxygen, medicines and counselling. Overall, over one lakh people benefited from the helpline, Chadha claimed. Chadha said that the mandate of the helpline team was to rescue helpless and clueless families and patients, from arranging beds in hospitals for them to calling ambulances, facilitating refilling of oxygen cylinders and the doorstep delivery of ration, food and medicines. The MLA said the 40 volunteers are headed by Abhishek Bhattacharya, Delhi Assembly fellow. Explaining how the 9910944444 helpline began, Chadha said, “The original helpline number is a cloud telephony service diverted to our personal mobile phones. Apart from this, eight party volunteers agreed to make their mobile numbers public to enable patients or families to contact us 24x7. We counselled people in distress and noted down details like their names, contact numbers, oxygen level and brief medical history.” The patient data was transferred to the hospital admission team, which liaised with hospital nodal officers and doctors across Delhi-NCR. “After receiving leads on bed vacancies, the team called the patient to inform about the hospital admission availability and managed ambulance service when required,” said Chadha. "We have been tirelessly working for a few years now to ensure our public grievance system is responsive and in real-time,” said Chadha. He added that he was coordinating efforts between the oxygen suppliers and the hospitals responding to SOS requests even as the helpline team was supporting him in monitoring the hospital admissions requests. Bhattacharya added, “Last year after the lockdown was imposed, the helpline team answered thousands of calls requesting hospitalisation help, food and other services, including rescue of two missing children. With the conditions worse than last year’s this time, Chadha decided to expand the team.” He claimed the volunteers had helped admit thousands in hospitals across NCR from April 19 till the end of May. “Though the demand for Covid hospital admissions has gone down, the helpline is still running,” Bhattacharya said. Bhattacharya said the team went without sleep on many nights at the peak of the crisis. “Our phones were continuously ringing and we weren’t able to sleep,” he said. “When you hear families weeping for their kin, it is bound to shatter you from inside. The situation was extremely depressing. The least we could do was to counsel the families so they remained strong in adversity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-19-helpline-started-by-chadha-rings-in-hope/articleshow/83557755.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nashik||Increased testing raises Nashik Rural’s Covid count||Nashik: In a reversal of trend after 15 days, Nashik Rural registered fresh Covid cases in triple digits for two consecutive days on Saturday and Sunday. This is in contrast to the scenario in Nashik city where the downward trend of daily new Covid cases continues and the daily positivity rate is around 5%. While 302 fresh Covid cases were reported on Saturday and number rose to 433 on Sunday. It may be noted that over the past 15 days the daily number of new cases had dropped to the double digits. According to district health officer Dr Kapil Aher, part of the rise can be attributed to reconciliation of the past Covid deaths on the ICMR portal. “In the government system, a separate RT-PCR report for every patient is not generated. It is difficult to locate some information from the testing laboratories for uploading of Covid death data. Therefore, such cases were recently added to the Covid positive cases through the Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT). These cases do not reflect in the active cases,” Aher said. He, however, added that not all positive cases denoted during the two days were related to reconciliation as there was also a rise in the number of fresh cases. “We have now ramped up testing as per the guidelines of district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal in the rural areas. This is to make sure that we are able to curb the spread of disease,” he said. The health department has asked all the taluka health officers to carry out 500 tests everyday — RT-PCR as well as RAT — to make sure that everyone who may have contracted the infection is on the health department’s radar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/increased-testing-raises-nashik-rurals-covid-count/articleshow/83518978.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Kolkata||Black fungus test starts at pvt hosp||Kolkata: Peerless Hospital has become the first private hospital in Kolkata to start an RTPCR test to detect mucormycosis or the black fungus virus. The hospital has launched the facility with three tests so far. RG Kar Hospital is the only other centre to have a black fungus testing facility. The result of the tests would be available in four-five hours. But since the test kits are expensive, the hospital authorities are planning to pool in samples. “We have done three successful tests so far. Histopathology can detect but can’t specify the virus. It takes at least five-seven days. Fungal smear also has a low sensitivity of 30%-40%. RTPCR has the highest sensitivity and accuracy by far,” said Peerless microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. Peerless is planning to pool in samples of two-three patients which will be tested and results declared in 72 hours. The state government has formed a committee to decide and outline the protocol for diagnosis and treatment of black fungus. It is head by School of Tropical Medicine professor Bibhuti Saha. Meanwhile, two more mucormycosis cases were confirmed in the state on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/black-fungus-test-starts-at-pvt-hosp/articleshow/83523270.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Cabinet rejig in limbo as CM Ashok Gehlot advised to avoid meetings||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has indicated he is in no mood to bow under pressure from his former deputy Sachin Pilot for a cabinet rejig. In a statement issued by the chief minister’s office on Monday, it was informed that doctors have advised Gehlot to avoid one-on-one meetings for at least one to two months considering his post-Covid condition. This puts a question mark on an early cabinet change, which would require the CM’s active physical involvement, senior Congress leaders said. Political appointments in municipalities, though, were announced on Monday. For the past one week, the Pilot faction has been daily issuing statements targeting the AICC committee, constituted 10 months back, to work out power sharing between Gehlot and the disgruntled group of MLAs in the state. Legislators loyal to Pilot have been pressing for cabinet expansion and state-level political appointments at the earliest since the present government has already completed half its term. In a tactical counter move, lawmakers close to Gehlot have clarified that their contribution in saving the state government during the Pilot’s rebellion last year cannot be ignored. Legislator Rajendra Singh Gudha called the Congress central leadership’s attention to the role played by the six BSP MLAs, who joined Congress on Gehlot’s initiative in 2019, and the 10 independent MLAs in neutralising the Pilot’s revolt last July. “Eleven months back, 19 MLAs had ‘left’ Congress. If it were not for us (six BSP MLAs) and the 10 independent MLAs, the state’s Congress government would have been preparing to observe its first death anniversary by now,” Gudha said on Monday. The Udaipurwati (Jhunjhunu) legislator said that Congress lacked majority on its own after the 2018 assembly election and, later, the revolt by its 19 MLAs almost doomed the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cabinet-rejig-in-limbo-as-cm-advised-to-avoid-meetings/articleshow/83525219.cms||Bhanupratap Singh
---||Shimla||Amid joy over tourist surge in Himachal Pradesh, worry over case spread||SHIMLA/MANALI/DALHOUSIE: The hill destinations of Himachal Pradesh came alive with tourists -- with 5,000 vehicles heading to Shimla alone during the weekend -- following the lifting of the condition of showing a negative RT-PCR test report on entry into the state. This has fuelled fears of Covid cases rising in the state. Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur assured on Monday that a mechanism is being developed to control the rush of vehicles. In Kullu-Manali, too, thousands of tourists thronged the tourist sites, bringing cheer to hoteliers and taxi operators, but frequent Covid-19 rules violations have become a headache for the authorities. Besides hundreds of tourist cabs registered in Himachal, over 500 vehicles from other states had entered Manali by evening on Monday. A large number of vehicles were on their way to Manali. With increasing tourist crowds, many people fear irresponsible behaviour of tourists may cause a sudden spike in the Covid cases. Many tourists are not wearing face masks, most of the tourists are crowding outside shops and at public places without maintaining physical distance. While interacting with media persons in Shimla, the CM said that in order to facilitate the people visiting the state, the government has waived the RT-PCR requirement, but it is ensuring that nobody is allowed to flout the norms. After free inter-state movement was allowed throughout the country, Himachal Pradesh has decided that the people visiting the state would be monitored through registration in Covid e-pass software. Manali sub-divisional magistrate Raman Gharsangi said, “All stakeholders of Manali have been requested to guide their guests that they should not go close to Beas which is not only dangerous but also a violation of Covid-19 protocols. Not wearing a mask or not maintaining social distancing cannot be taken lightly. And tourists should maintain a safe distance from the river. Police have been directed to take strict action in case of any violation.” A large number of tourists, most of them from Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and UP, also reached Rohtang pass on Monday and enjoyed with snow. Fed-up of being stuck at home due to coronavirus restrictions, many people from the plains of Punjab headed to the nearby hill town of Dalhousie. The surge of tourists led to joy and worry. Hotelier Ashish Chadha said, “We are strictly following the Covid protocols and all preventive measures are being taken to make the tourists, as well as local, feel safe.” However, others are not as happy as they feel surging crowds could push up the infection risk. “I share the financial concerns of hoteliers and those in the tourism industry, I am of the view that the HP government should have imposed restrictions for some more time,” said Darshan Buhi, a resident of Dalhousie. Another local, Ganesh said, “We are happy that Dalhousie will once again be buzzing with tourists but at the same time we are scared of a possible early arrival of the third wave.” Dalhousie Taxi Union Shiv Kumar Tandon said there wasn’t as much rush of tourists in Dalhousie as in Shimla. Welcoming the tourists’ arrival, he hoped more would come as it would enable him to pay installments and meet family expenses. No mask? Jail for 2-time violators Himachal Pradesh police issued a statement on Monday asking tourists to follow the Covid guidelines by wearing masks and follow social distancing norms. Police said that first-time offenders will be fined Rs 500 and repeat violators may be arrested and could face up to 8 days’ imprisonment and fine of Rs 5,000 fine or both.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/amid-joy-over-tourist-surge-in-hp-worry-over-case-spread/articleshow/83525208.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Indira Hridayesh’s death leaves a vacuum in Kumaon politics which will be hard to fill||NAINITAL: One of Uttarakhand’s tallest woman leaders, Indira Hridayesh was well regarded in both plains and hills. After her death, questions are being raised on who will take forward her legacy. Political observers say that while her son Sumit Hridayesh may seek to stake claim on her legacy and contest from her assembly constituency Haldwani, infighting within Congress may come in the way. “There is no other elected Congress leader who has the kind of stature that Indira Hridayesh had. It will be a big challenge for the party to replace someone like her,” said a Haldwani-based political analyst. With assembly elections in the state just months away, finding a successor for Hridayesh would add to the challenges being faced by the state Congress. In the last couple of months, Sumit Hridayesh, her son, was being seen as the front-runner to carry forward his mother’s legacy but that might not be easy, given factionalism in the party. “Sumit has been the head of Mandi Samiti of Haldwani and a member of the party. He may be a frontrunner for the Haldwani seat, but it is no secret that there are camps within Congress. Indira Hridayesh and Pritam Singh were part of one and Harish Rawat part of another. These two factions will surely clash for the seat,” said the analyst. A Congress leader from Nainital district expressed apprehensions about possible infighting in Congress, saying it would only benefit the BJP. “Haldwani is called the gateway to Kumaon and is an important seat. It is important for us to not lose the seat to infighting.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/indira-hridayeshs-death-leaves-a-vacuum-in-kumaon-politics-which-will-be-hard-to-fill/articleshow/83521378.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Nashik||Four sanctuaries in Nashik division reopen for tourists||Nashik: The state forest department has now decided to allow visitors at its four major sanctuaries in the Nashik division — the Nandur Madhyameshwar in Nashik, Aner dam sanctuary in Dhule, Yawal in Jalgaon and Kalsubai Harishchandragad in Ahmednagar. These four sanctuaries had been closed since April 14 due to the Covid restrictions, but they have been reopened following relaxations in the restrictions by the state government. “We have allowed tourists to visit the four sanctuaries in the district. However, they will have to follow the Covid safety protocols like wearing masks, maintaining physical distance and using sanitizers. Moreover, screening of tourists is also to be conducted at the entrance to the sanctuaries,” said A Anjankar, the conservator of forest (wildlife) “At present, tourist footfall is low at the four sanctuaries. There are no birds right now at the Nandur Madhyameshwar bird sanctuary as the migratory birds come here between October and March. Therefore there are few visitors here now. It is the same case at the other three sanctuaries,” he said. Nandur Madhyameshwar, which is located around 20km from Nashik city, had shot to limelight last year after it became the first Ramsar site (a wetland site designated to be of international importance under the Ramsar convention) in Maharashtra. It is known to be home to 536 species of aquatic and terrestrial plants, eight species of mammals, 265 species of birds, 24 species of freshwater fish and 41 species of butterflies. The Kalsubai Harishchandragad sanctuary in Ahmednagar is home to a variety of flora and fauna. Leopards, jungle cats, palm civets, wolves, jackals, foxes, wild boars etc. are found in abundance here. The Anerdam sanctuary in Shirpur taluka of Dhule district is known for rich natural vegetation cover consisting mainly of scrub forests. There are also various bird species found here. The Yawal sanctuary in Jalgaon is spread over 178 sqkm and has a wide variety of plant species.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/four-sanctuaries-in-nashik-division-reopen-for-tourists/articleshow/83519025.cms||Tushar Pawar

The accused has been charged with allegedly duping Rs 2.7 crore by promising jobs in the IAF and the Railways. “The allegations against him are serious, as 19 victims alleged to have paid him money directly,” noted additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana. Acting on the bail plea of a former corporal, Chakravir Chaudhari, the court said he could not claim parity with another accused, Than Singh, who had been granted bail by a magisterial court. “The applicant also cannot claim parity with Singh as the role ascribed to Chaudhari is much graver. Moreover, being a government servant, he is in a position to influence the victims during the course of trial,” the order stated. Chaudhari’s counsel also submitted that police had not conducted the investigation “fairly and legally”, which was apparent from the fact that the FIR was filed on August 20, 2015, but the first arrest took place on November 28, 2019, and Chaudhari was arrested after lapse of a considerable time. The prosecutor said the applicant issued forged call and joining letters and cheated people. He neither joined the investigation nor produce required documents despite being issued notices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-for-iaf-ex-officer-in-job-racket-case/articleshow/83557843.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Officers said Bharat holds the key to the investigation as cops are trying to find out if they had any other accomplice in Bengal. Four residents of Bhatinda in Punjab were picked up Bhangar in South 24 Parganas and Basirhat in North 24 Parganas in connection with the case on Monday. Cops said that one of them is a veterinary physician married to a woman at Bhangar for the last eight years. He gave a shelter to two men who had recently come to the village from Punjab. Another person was also picked up from Basirhat. The South 24 Parganas police, Bengal STF and Bidhannagar detective department questioned them for long on Monday and confirmed that none of them was arrested till late in the night.

---||Nashik||CoWIN stalls 2 vax dose for those planning trips abroad||Nashik: Despite the circular issued by the Government of India’s health and family welfare ministry, allowing the second dose of Covishield vaccine in some exceptional cases, the technical update required in the CoWIN application is preventing beneficiaries from getting the same. Students and others looking to go abroad for their studies/commitments can only board the flights if they have taken both the vaccine jabs. However, since people who have taken the first dose of Covishield cannot take the second before the mandatory 84-day period is over, it is further delaying travel plans. Administering the dose is not a problem, but getting the certificate is. Therefore, the second doses are not being administered right now, said deputy collector Ganesh Misal, who is also the nodal officer for the vaccination programme in Nashik district. “The Union health ministry has waived off the 84-day condition in ‘exceptional’ cases and such beneficiaries can be given the second dose after 28 days. The condition has been waived for all students, people who have to join their duties, take up new jobs, go on business trips etc,” the officer said. “The staff has been instructed to examine the papers required for the people looking to travel abroad and administer the second dose. However, CoWIN does not ‘allow entry’ for a second dose without a 84-day gap. As a result, the beneficiaries will not get the certificate required to be produced before they board the flights,” Misal said. The health agencies have taken up the matter with the state health department and a resolution is expected soon. Misal pointed out that vaccination for the ‘exceptional cases’ is being done only at the Mahakavi Kalidas Kalamandir on every Thursday. So far, 521 students and 21 service individuals have taken the first jab of the vaccine, the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cowin-stalls-2-vax-dose-for-those-planning-trips-abroad/articleshow/83519012.cms||Abhilash Botekar

A census conducted by the forest department recently has revealed that the number of striped hyenas has shot up over the last one year. Thanks to a minimal human disturbance due to Covid restrictions, this shy creature has flourished in the jungle and its periphery. It is good news for the wildlife lovers as striped hyenas have been categorised as a ‘near threatened’ species at global level by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In May 2019, just 77 hyenas were spotted in Jambughoda, Shivrajpur and Kanjeta range and in 2020 their number increased to 87. But this year’s census revealed that the population of striped hyenas has shot up to 123. “Hyenas are very shy creatures and they don’t like to be disturbed by humans. In fact, whenever they see any human including even a kid, hyenas just run away,” Baldevsinh Waghela, divisional forest officer (DFO), wildlife, Vadodara, said. “Over last one year, there has been minimal human disturbance as tourist footfall has gone down considerably due to the pandemic. There was complete lockdown for almost three months last year and after that too, not many turned up in or around the sanctuaries for wildlife excursions,” Waghela told TOI. “Villagers usually dispose of dead cattle or any other animal on the outskirts of their village. Hyenas mostly feed on dead animals, so they venture into the periphery of the villages to eat the carcasses. Before the pandemic, they used to get disturbed by the constant inflow of tourists and often fled without getting proper food,” Waghela added. But since March last year, the striped hyenas that are protected under schedule III of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, have been getting ample food without any fear of human presence including the locals. “Hyenas usually venture out at night and get scared by vehicle headlights and engine noise. There was hardly any disturbance of vehicle movement for many months and it gave them a free run. That clubbed with ample food availability must have led to an increase in their population,” Waghela said.

After chunks of the ceiling fell off in the vegetable, flower and meat ranges as well as the Gol Ghar in a series of mishaps over the past 15 years, KMC has decided to conduct a comprehensive structural stability study of the building and then commission a preservation project. A team of engineers, led by Gokul Mondal and Biswajit Som, who are from JU, and experts in structural engineering has started a detailed survey of the market building (old complex) from last week. The team will submit a detailed project report (DPR) in four months. Based on the recommendations, the civic body will take up necessary restoration work of the heritage market. According to Som, the preliminary work of the survey has begun and they will study in minute detail the existing strength of the market's structure. Architecturally, the market is unique with use of several stylistic influences — ranging from medieval India (Moghul period) and Europe (Gothic) — in its design and construction. “ We will take help of structural engineering to locate the flaws that may have developed over a century and weakened the structural stability of the prominent heritage building of our city,” Som told TOI. According to Amiruddin Bobby, a member in the KMC board of administrators (BoA) who looks after the market department, once the DPR was submitted, the civic body will engage a firm for restoration of New Market. While the chunks that had been falling off the ceiling had led to many narrow escapes, the tipping point was an incident in December 2019 when a seven-year-old girl who lived in quarters above the market fell through a gap that had developed and landed in the Gol Ghar. The KMC market department has also engaged the JU experts for a detailed structural study of the century-old Futnani Chamber building which has developed several cracks and is crying for urgent repairs. “We will also take up the structural study of Futnani Chamber and recommend measures for its restoration,” Som said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-to-refurbish-new-mkt-futnani-chambers/articleshow/83523337.cms||Saikat Ray

On May 1, the US suspended entry by non-immigrants who had been in India in the preceding 14 days. Students wanting to enter or return to the US were exempted. Washington also kept its doors open for ‘persons of national importance’. It wasn’t long before desperate parents started applying for visas under the category. A builder whose child will join the University of Southern California this August has decided to take a chartered flight to Dubai, and fly to the US from there. Study abroad counsellor Karan Gupta said a builder’s family is planning to spend a fortnight in Dubai and then enter the US to drop his son at his university in Los Angeles. “Some parents who have businesses in Dubai are staying put there and heading to the US from there,” said another counsellor Sonal Parekh. The trend of dropping off their children is very popular, especially among the parents of the thousands of undergraduate teens who head out every year. “There was a lot of heartburn when the US Consulate’s India office clarified that parents, even those holding US visas, could not travel with their children,” said Gupta. And creative travel plans emerged. If some are chartering flights, the budget-conscious could fly commercial to countries that are allowing Indians in and are simultaneously on the accepted list for the US. Several parents from the UK will route their trip to the US via Egypt. Some are planning to fly to Russia and from there to America. The US Consulate here has advised against booking flights with a stop in Europe as they have strict quarantine policies. “Parents are already stressed that in case of any emergency, they will not be able to enter the US till the travel ban is eased. Those like me, who hold valid US visas, feel the need to be with our wards to complete airport formalities, to navigate the new city, and reach the campus, set up their housing,” explained a parent. For students, the visa stress continued for a second day. After Monday’s fiasco, students applying for a visa appointment struggled to register on the US Consulate portal on Tuesday too. Many opted for the dial-in service to get an appointment. “After holding on for over an hour, I was told I could try logging into the appointment portal after 30 minutes,” said a frustrated candidate. The US Consulate sought to calm nerves with a statement on social media: “Since June 14, thousands of students have secured visa appointments for July and August. Thousands of appointments will remain available and we will open thousands more in coming weeks. We appreciate your patience as we diligently work to resolve the technical issues you have encountered.” Not many took this at face value. “Yesterday was complete chaos. The site was down almost the entire day. How were thousands of students able to secure appointments?” asked a candidate. Social media was also full of pleas by students to unlock their vusa application accounts that were frozen on Monday for too many tries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/parents-charter-flights-take-detour-to-drop-kids-in-us/articleshow/83559412.cms||Hemali Chhapia

Both the corporations have to provide 152 hoopers and dumpers in every ward for trash collection although that was supposed to be done by the company. In all, 52 hoopers are used in JMC-Greater while 100 are deployed in JMC-Heritage. Moreover, two dumpers and a JCB in every zone is also provided by the corporation. According to the terms of the contract, the firm is solely liable for picking up garbage and instead of dumpers, they were supposed to provide refuse compactors for closed transportation of garbage.A senior JMC-Greater official said, “According to the contract, the firm was supposed to pick up garbage in a segregated manner from houses and from the transport station, they should lift the trash from refuse compactors. But they are still using tradition transport medium. They have their own dumpers and hoopers, but we have to fulfill the shortfall.”Due to transportation of garbage in tractors and open dumpers, it spreads pollution in the city.Kishore Aggarwal, president of Rajasthan Nagar Palika Karamchari Union, said despite the company violating all the terms of the contract, the municipal corporations have cleared its bills without taking any action. “There should be an inquiry on the functioning of the corporation officials and how they cleared all the bills of the company,” said Aggarwal. There are more than 450 hoopers of the company functioning in the city, which are also said to be inadequate given Jaipur’s population. Ward councillors have blamed shortage of garbage collection vehicles (hoopers) as the reason for degrading sanitation situation. They said despite repeated requests, the number of vehicles has not been increased. Councilors said most of the wards have just one hooper, which also doesn’t serve every lane. Most of the hoopers just wander on the main road without going to the inner lanes because of which garbage depots have increased in the city. According to officials, every ward in the city must have five hoopers, but most have two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/not-enough-hoopers-deployed-by-firm/articleshow/83525272.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Speaking at the sidelines of an event held on the occasion of World Blood Donor Day in Rishikesh, Rawat said, “The Muslim community in our country, I am specifically naming them, is still hesitant about taking the Covid-19 vaccine. There are misconceptions and apprehensions among them regarding the vaccination.” The former CM urged NGOs and media to spread awareness regarding the need to get inoculated. “If people don’t take the vaccine, we won't be able to defeat the Covid-19 virus. The media must highlight this,” he added. The Doiwala MLA also pointed out how Pakistan’s government has cut the pay of those employees who were not ready to get vaccinated. “Recently, I heard Pakistan's health minister saying that the government will cut the mobile connections of those who are not ready to get vaccinated. These are some tough measures that show how awareness must be created among the masses,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/muslims-hesitant-to-take-covid-vaccine-trivendra-singh-rawat/articleshow/83521439.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Goa||If taxis don’t install meters, licences will be cancelled: Goa to high court||PANAJI: The state government on Monday tendered an “unconditional apology” to the high court of Bombay at Goa for its delay in installing digital fare meters in taxis, and said that taxi operators who do not cooperate in getting meters installed would “face the consequence of automatic cancellation of the permit”. Director of transport Rajan Satardekar said the state was “serious” about the installation, and swore on affidavit that the implementation would be done in six months. “I say that no option or discretion is left with any of the stakeholders, and the process of installation of the meters is in terms of a mandatory rule, which has to be followed by all without exception,” Satardekar, who is also ex-officio additional secretary (transport) to government, said. His apology was for not adhering to the court’s orders dated July 5, 2019 and January 20, 2020. In the second contempt petition filed by the travel and tourism association of Goa (TTAG) over the past two years over the non-implementation of the court’s orders, Satardekar admitted there have been “some protests and obstructions/objections by some persons” in the past to obstruct and derail the installation. Satardekar said the department “will take the help of the law enforcement machinery so that strict action is taken against any persons/ stakeholders making such attempts to obstruct the implementation” of the rule and the orders of the court. The court was told that although there had been some delay in commencing the installation, it was due to the “intervention of Covid-19, which was followed by other logistical and practical difficulties”. Despite the difficulties that were faced, the department took up the matter with the contractor and ensured that the process commenced from May 20, he said. The department issued a public notice on May 18 informing all stakeholders that fitment of digital fare meters with automatic tracking device and emergency systems is compulsory for taxis in terms of rule 140 of the Goa Motor Vehicles Rules, 1991, with rule 125-H of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, and that the department would start installation from May 20. In 2018, the high court imposed costs of Rs 10,000 on the department for “needless delay”, and asked the state to recover the costs from the concerned officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/if-taxis-dont-install-meters-licences-will-be-cancelled-state-to-hc/articleshow/83525257.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Udaipur||Cow vigilantes beat Madhya Pradesh man to death in Chittor, 10 held||UDAIPUR: A man from Madhya Pradesh was beaten to death and another seriously injured after a village mob attacked them in Begun of Chittorgarh district late Sunday night, alleging they were smuggling cattle in their truck for slaughter. Chittorgarh SP Rajendra Prasad Goyal said the police have arrested 10 persons and identified nine others in connection with the lynching incident. Police teams are on the look out for the culprits at large. Babulal, son of Dhannalal Bhil, joined the list of dozens of people lynched by cow vigilantes over the past few years. His injured and hospitalised aide Pintu Bhil denied the allegation that the animals were meant for slaughter and said they were bullocks purchased from the state and being taken home to MP for agricultural purpose. According to police, 28-year-old Babulal, a resident of Ramnagar, and Pintu from Ratamya village, both from Petlawad tehsil of Jhabua district in Madhya Pradesh, had purchased bulls from Begun and Rayati villages and were returning home when a mob of some 15 men stopped their pick-up van at Bhilkhanda chauraha. The mob accused them of smuggling cows and thrashed them. They snatched the mobiles of victims. A police team from the nearest chowki went to the spot after receiving information about the mob lynching two men. They rescued both and took them to a hospital where Babulal succumbed to his injuries. Extra forces have been deployed in the area to prevent any untoward incident. Udaipur range IG Satyaveer Singh went to Begun to take stock of the situation. “Our teams raided several places and some persons have been arrested. A detailed investigation will be conducted,” the IG said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/cow-vigilantes-beat-mp-man-to-death-in-chittor-10-held/articleshow/83525273.cms||---

Chief public relations officer (PRO) of SCR Ch Rakesh said rationalization of level crossing gates was progressing rapidly to provide safety to the road users. “A total of 81 level crossings were removed during last fiscal and another seven during the current financial year so far. The construction of Limited Height Subways (LHBs)/Road Over Bridges (ROBs)/Road Under Bridges (RUBs) in a mission mode ensured removal of level crossing gates,” he said. The SCR, which recently observed International Level Crossing Awareness Day, is also participating in the global campaign to sensitize road users to enhance safety at level crossings. “Railways ensures implementation of putting up caution/sign boards with statutory warning indicating road users on mandatory precautions to be observed when the railway gate is kept closed for approaching train. Railways also requests co-operation of all vehicle users in following all the safety procedures while crossing the level crossing gates like stopping and looking out for train in both directions before crossing the track at level crossings,” Rakesh said. At Nanded division, around 4 lakh SMSes were sent to public in order to bring awareness about following safety rules. SCR general manager Vijay Mallya said road users should remain alert while driving through railway level crossings. “The road users should not endanger their lives by ignoring the safety guidelines,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/scr-replaces-88-manned-level-crossings/articleshow/83519090.cms||---

GSL, which bagged the order to make 12 specialised boats for the Indian Army, plans to deliver the first boat by June end or early July, with three of the boats in advanced build stages. “We are constructing three hulls at a time and we hope to deliver the first boat by June-end or early-July. A team of Indian Army officers are in Goa at GSL oversee the initial tests,” a source said. The two Goan shipyards have been contracted by the Army to deliver specialised, high-altitude patrol boats and flat-bottomed boats to help it counter incursions by China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The Army had inked two contracts for the specialized boats towards the end of December 2020 after an urgent need was felt to augment India’s capabilities to match China’s heavier type-928B patrol boats. GSL bagged a Rs 65 crore contract to build and deliver the 12 high-performance crafts with advanced surveillance gear and other equipment. The second deal was for 17 flat-bottom fibreglass boats that Aquarius bagged. The fibreglass flat bottom boats can carry 20 soldiers at a time and can be used in shallow waters. GSL is conducting trials on the first high-performance boat and once the Indian Army gives the go ahead, optical sensors, weapon systems and other specialized surveillance equipment will be installed on the boat. Together, the two Goan shipyards will deliver 29 specialized boats by December, which will be used in eastern Ladakh. Divar-based Aquarius Shipyard Pvt Ltd has already started delivering the first lot of 17 boats to the Army. Around six to seven years ago, the Indian Army acquired 17 QRT (quick-reaction) boats for patrolling the Pangong Tso, which is located at an altitude of 13,900 feet. During the stand-off with China in eastern Ladakh in April-May last year, the Indian Army felt the urgent need for boats to patrol the disputed area and to quickly deploy troops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gsl-to-deliver-first-boat-to-army-for-pangong-tso-patrol-by-july/articleshow/83525276.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Don’t let mask, guard down amid dip in cases||HYDERABAD: Despite the second wave of Covid-19 having ebbed, with new daily cases across the state around 1,500 over the last few days, experts have warned against any laxity in precautions. They said that the decline in infections is largely due to the restrictions imposed during the lockdown. It was observed that even during lockdown, many were seen with masks drawn to their chin or below the nose, all the more reason to remain alert. “ “The second wave decline in Telangana has happened mainly due to the lockdown measures. However the reduced cases should not give a false sense of security to all and do the same mistake like we did post the first wave. It is also important to note that we faced severe crisis including shortage of beds and oxygen, Covid deaths in the second wave as well. The gradual unlocking and a laxity in Covid-appropriate behaviour could again lead to increased cases,” said Professor Subodh Kandamuthan, director at Centre for Healthcare Management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI). Covid-appropriate behaviour post-lockdown for the next six months however is the key to preventing a third wave. “Covid-19 appropriate behaviour after opening the societies is more important to prevent future rise of variants. One in three people are all ready affected with Delta variant in India as per Ahmedabad sero survey report. This shows that we can control future waves and variants only through masking and next six months are crucial to prevent further havoc. On the vaccination front, estimates indicate that vaccination can be completed by December but till then precautions are a must,” said Dr Kiran Madala, in-charge head of department of critical care at Nizamabad Medical College. From the two waves it has been clearly understood that masking is the primary protection from the virus and its future variants. Health officials too have stressed on the need to wear masks and follow all other Covid-appropriate behaviour once the lockdown is lifted. “We will have to lift the lockdown someday and whenever it is lifted following Covid norms will remain essential,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, Telangana director of public health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dont-let-mask-guard-down-amid-dip-in-cases/articleshow/83524082.cms||Amrita Didyala

While many colonies in the city have taken up Covid-19 vaccination drive for the residents, they have not included their support staff. About 200 people were vaccinated during the drive held at St Francis College, Umanagar. The four-hour vaccination drive was divided into four batches of 50 beneficiaries each. The heavy rain in the morning did not stop the beneficiaries from taking the jab. The residents’ welfare association tied up with a corporate hospital for vaccination. According to Sanghamitra Malik, one of the organisers, the RWA had ensured that everyone was registered on the CoWIN app before the vaccination drive was taken up. “We have taken care of not only our residents but also their support staff. We included domestic helps, security staff and drivers too. Everyone is now vaccinated and thus protected against the pandemic,” she said. Though the RWA does not have any prior experience, it planned the drive in a systematic manner so that there was no last-minute trouble. “We hoped to carry out the vaccine drive smoothly without any hitch,” Malik said, adding that the principal of the college had provided the campus for the drive. Local corporator Sarala Ketineni extended support to the drive.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: DRDO’s 2-DG shields from all variants, says Cellular and Molecular Biology||HYDERABAD: A research study by the city-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) has found that the 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) prevents the metabolic reprogramming induced by the novel coronavirus infection and works against all variants of Covid-19. The finding says that 2-DG not only inhibits the virus multiplication but also can be used as a treatment regimen for Covid-19 patients. This is the first research publication on the ‘wonder drug’ developed in India by the DRDO and tested for efficacy at the CCMB. The researchers said, “Although the effect of 2-DG has been analysed on only two different variants (B.6 and B.1.1.7), its anti-viral property is suggested to be universal on all the variants. This is because 2-DG interferes with the metabolic requirement of virus infected host cells.” The researchers found that 2-DG, which is a glycolytic inhibitor, makes coronavirus multiplication in cells of the patient less effective and also weakens the infective potential of progeny virions (virus). The team successfully demonstrated that 2-DG exhibits significant potential to be developed as a therapeutic drug to combat Covid-19. According to the research team, these experimental evidences and previous clinical trial experience of 2-DG made way for this molecule to reach clinical trials among Covid-19 patients in India. Besides the CCMB, researchers from the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, Delhi, and Academy for Scientific and Innovative Research, Ghaziabad, were also part of the research work. The team comprised Anant Narayan Bhatt, Abhishek Kumar, Yogesh Rai, Neeraj Kumari, Dhiviya Vedagiri, Krishnan H Harshan, C Vijaya Kumar and Sudhir Chandna. The result was published in the pre-print online server ‘BioRxiv’ on June 13. Research results showed that virus infection induces glucose influx and glycolysis resulting in selective high accumulation of fluorescent glucose/2-DG analogue in cells. According to the researchers, 2-DG treatment prevented the virus multiplication by 95%. The progeny virions from 2-DG treated cells showed visibly reduced cytopathic effect at 48 hours post-infection. This result was further substantiated by nearly 80% reduced virus growth estimated by RT-PCR in cells infected with virions 2-DG treated cells. “This observation validates the hypothesis that 2-DG treatment leads to the formation of defective novel coronavirus virions with low infectivity potential,” they said. Emphasising the importance of development of new drugs, the research team said while a lot of efforts are being invested in vaccinating the population, there is also an emergent requirement to find potential therapeutics to effectively counter this fast mutating novel coronavirus induced pathogenicity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drdos-2-dg-shields-from-all-variants-ccmb/articleshow/83524292.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Govt extends Covid Curfew by a week, allows locals of Char Dham districts to visit shrines||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand government on Monday extended the Covid curfew in the state by another week, that is, till June 22 morning. The government also opened the Char Dham Yatra for devotees of the three districts — Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi — where the four shrines — Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri — are located. It has been made mandatory for the devotees visiting the shrines to carry a RT-PCR-negative report. Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal told TOI that “after several considerations and many rounds of deliberations, the government has decided to start the Char Dham Yatra in a phase-wise manner.” “Initially, the yatra has been opened only for the people of those districts where the Char Dham shrines are located. Chamoli residents can go to Badrinath, Rudraprayag residents to Kedarnath and Uttarkashi residents to Gangotri and Yamunotri,” he said. A gathering of not more than 50 people has been allowed for funerals and weddings, according to the latest government directive. Earlier, not more than 20 people could attend such events. Also, sweet shops can now open five days a week, barring Saturday and Sunday. The decision to ease curbs on the markets in rural pockets has been left on the district magistrates who can take a call on how many hours the shops can be allowed to open in an area depending upon the prevailing pandemic situation. In another major decision, the government has decided to open the revenue courts which have been permitted to take up to 20 cases per day. The government has also allowed three-wheelers to ply. Also, grocery stores and liquor shops, among other commercial establishments, have been allowed to remain open on June 16, 18 and 21. Similarly, the stationery shops can open on June 16 and 18. Elaborating on the government's ‘unlock’ strategy, Uniyal said, “The infections have gone down and we are contemplating to start the ‘unlock’ process from June 22. At the same time, we would like to request the traders as well as the locals to remain cautious as we have been successful in bringing down the numbers but the threat Covid-19 is not over yet.” He added that the decision to unlock will ‘depend on the pandemic situation in the state on and around June 20’. The minister pointed out that people coming from other states are still required to register themselves on the Smart City portal and bring a Covid- negative report, not more than 72 hours old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-extends-covid-curfew-by-a-week-allows-locals-of-char-dham-districts-to-visit-shrines/articleshow/83521451.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Impact of possible third wave will not be severe, says officials||HYDERABAD: State health authorities on Monday said that while there is no certainty over a third wave of Covid-19, the possible impact of another wave should it occur, will not be severe. Telangana director of medical education Dr Ramesh K Reddy said it has been observed in earlier viral diseases that after a first and second wave of infections, people achieve some level of herd immunity and hence a third wave is not as severe as the earlier ones. “We can expect that the third wave will be low in its impact as we already have a lot of people who have been infected and have achieved immunity. Also, with the ongoing vaccination programme, we can expect 50 per cent of the population to be vaccinated in the next three months,” the director of medical education said. The authorities, however, explained that Covid-appropriate behaviour will remain the norm for a long time to come. Even as the number of new cases and positivity rate has reduced drastically, the state health department continues to receive a large number of complaints from Covid patients against private hospitals. “So far we have received 350 complaints for overcharging and other violations. The complaints are against 170 hospitals. We have served show cause notices to all and in all cases where overcharging was found in violation of the government order, we have directed refund of excess charges levied,” said director of public health, Dr Srinivasa Rao. The officials further informed that around 35 lakh will become eligible for the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in July. “13.58 lakh people falling under the high-risk (super spreader) category have been vaccinated between May 25 and June 13. In the next 10 to 15 days, we will be administering two lakh doses per day and will complete one crore vaccinations (cumulative doses),” the director of public health said. Dr Rao added that members of self-help groups will be vaccinated in the special drive following the completion of inoculations to 60 and above age group. The DPH also informed that Telangana has not recorded any malaria deaths in the last four years and will become a malaria free-state in the next three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/impact-of-possible-3rd-wave-will-not-be-severe-officials/articleshow/83524543.cms||Amrita Didyala

From dumping of untreated sewage and other pollutants to lack of dredging and blockage in the water flow caused by changes in the hydrodynamics due to Metro columns and construction work of several bridges across it, the filthy brackish water is not only making it impossible to sustain any aquatic life, it is also becoming hazardous to the health of people living along it. Along the entire stretch, WBPCB tests could not trace any dissolved oxygen, which is an absolute necessity for survival of aquatic life. For propagation of aquatic life, at least 4mg/l of dissolved oxygen is required. Biological oxygen demand (which should be less than 3mg/l) was almost eight times of the water quality criteria for outdoor bathing. The canal does not even qualify for propagation of wildlife and fisheries that requires dissolved oxygen more than 4mg/l. The coliform bacteria count of more than 300000 per 100 ml against the criterion value of 500 in the same scale for outdoor bathing. The river is in the condition of septic tank and immediately requires stoppage of inflow of a single further drop of municipal waste water, said Subhas Dutta, who is an amicus curiae of Adi Ganga case in NGT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/adi-ganga-water-hazardous-for-people-living-nearby/articleshow/83523349.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The meeting between Pawar and Shahu Maharaj, that took place at the New Palace, raised many eyebrows as Rajya Sabha MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati has announced an agitation against the state government over demands made for the benefit of the Maratha community. The protest will be held on Wednesday at the Shahu Samadhi Sthal in Kolhapur city. Terming the discussion as positive, Shahu Maharaj said, “Everyone needs to study the Supreme Court order. The court has rejected the reservation. I am of the opinion that if Centre takes interest, then a constitutional amendment should be made that will help clear the path for reservation. I have been saying this for a long time.” The state’s law granting reservation was crossing the 50% limit and it was one of the reasons the Marathas could not get the reservation. “The state government is positive over the demands. The demands that are practical for the state government will be met,” said Shahu Chhatrapati. “We have referred the reservation issue to central government. It was on top of our agenda when we recently met Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We are ready to resolve pending issues related to the Maratha community,” Pawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/constitutional-amendment-only-way-to-get-reservation/articleshow/83519232.cms||---

India Meteorological Department (IMD) said its progress into western Uttar Pradesh is likely to determine when the onset of monsoon is declared. The department had earlier forecast the arrival of monsoon in Delhi by June 15, but the rainfall activity on Tuesday is likely to determine the onset date. Track the pollution level in your cityKuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “The onset of monsoon depends on the rainfall activity in west UP. It has slowed down due to the less rainfall activity in some parts of west UP. The onset of monsoon may be declared on Tuesday, depending on the rain activity in west UP and Delhi.” The normal meteorological date of onset is June 27, but the earlier forecast of Met department said monsoon may hit Delhi two weeks in advance. According to the forecast of Met department, several parts of Delhi may receive light to moderate rain or thundershowers on Tuesday evening or night. The rain is likely to be accompanied by gusty winds at the speed of 40-50 kmph. Met department said there is a possibility of very light rain or thundershowers from Wednesday to Friday. However, the weather is likely to remain dry over the weekend. However, the pre-monsoon showers have largely eluded Delhi in the last three days. Only some stations recorded rainfall. Najafgarh reported the highest rainfall at 30 mm till 8.30 am on Monday while Ayanagar and Palam recorded 4mm and 1 mm, respectively, during the same period. On Monday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 38.6 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal. The minimum temperature settled at 25.5 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal.

---||Dehradun||Demise of Indira Hridayesh breaks Uttarakhand Cong 'trinity', power dynamics likely to change within the party||DEHRADUN: For several years, Harish Rawat, Indira Hridayesh and Pritam Singh formed what was termed the ‘trinity’ in the Uttarakhand Congress. While Singh and Hridayesh worked in tandem with each other, Rawat had a camp of his own within the party. Last week, the three senior leaders had met the party high command in Delhi to sort out differences and prepare for the upcoming Uttarakhand polls but after the demise of Hridayesh, Rawat is now consolidating his position within the party, say sources. He already has the support of all the nine MLAs of the party. He also holds the key post of All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and party's in-charge for Punjab. A party insider told TOI, “Despite their differences, there was a balance in the top brass as Rawat is party's national general secretary, Hridayesh held the key charge of the leader of opposition in the state and Singh is the state Congress chief. It was upon the three leaders to ensure a win for Congress in the 2022 assembly polls. While Hridayesh was influential in Kumaon, Singh has a hold in parts of Garhwal and Rawat has a good say in both Kumaon and Garhwal.” The party insider added, “Both Hridayesh and Rawat have remained a crucial figure in state politics for over four decades. While they had their share of differences, she stuck with him and did not leave the party during the 2016 political turmoil in Uttarakhand.” After Hridayesh's demise, the Rawat camp is likely to become stronger within the party, the source said. Another Congress source said that with Hridayesh’s demise, the party would have to name a new leader of opposition (LoP). “If Pritam Singh is given the charge of LoP, the state may get a new party chief. Therefore, a string of changes are likely in the party before the start of the poll campaign,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/demise-of-indira-hridayesh-breaks-ukhand-cong-trinity-power-dynamics-likely-to-change-within-the-party/articleshow/83521473.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Surat||Surat: Cops warn men against calls of sexual temptation||SURAT: Earlier this month when a BJP councillor from Bardoli was having a private video call with a woman on WhatsApp, he did not have an ounce of thought that the video call was being recorded and the obscene video clip will be shared widely leading to his defamation and suspension from the party. Lately, not just this councillor, but a few other men from Navsari too have been left embarrassed after similar videos of theirs were circulated on social media. Seeing a surge in such cases, Navsari police issued guidelines for men so that they don’t become victims of online honey trap. Police have been raising awareness through different mediums for women so that they are not victimized, but this is probably for the first time that cops have appealed to men to not get lured. A webinar too was organized for citizens by Navsari police where a cyber lawyer warned them of gang involved in cyberbullying and extortion. Among the guidelines issued, police have warned citizens to not react or respond to requests made by callers to strip themselves or get influenced by callers’ beauty. It was also stated that people should not get lured by the callers’ profile picture. “A very common modus operandi is that the gang involved in blackmailing sends pornographic video to the victim to influence him. A few minutes later they make a video call, but the caller’s face is not revealed, and the victim also starts responding to the pornographic act,” said inspector P N Khokhara of Surat Range Cyber Crime police station. In the Bardoli councillor’s case too, the caller had not revealed her face. Officials said that after the video is recorded, the gang then starts blackmailing the victim to shell out money through online payments application. “Due to the fear of getting shamed people send money but even then, the video gets circulated,” Khokhara said. “The best way to avoid this is that people should not accept any unidentified person’s friend request or respond to messages from unknown people,” said Chirag Lad, a cyber lawyer, who addressed the webinar. “We have been appealing to citizens to contact us and register their complaint if they go through any such incident. We will investigate it through all means possible,” said Rushikesh Upadhyay, superintendent of Navsari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/cops-warn-men-against-calls-of-sexual-temptation/articleshow/83523370.cms||Jay Pachchigar

The discovery, made on June 13, is seen connected to the discovery of 6,000 coins in 1942-43 by a British archaeologist. The state archaeology department said that the wall was three-feet-wide and around 40-feet-deep below the soil bed, which indicates more such structures. Neeraj Tripathi, circle superintendent, state archaeology and museum department, Ajmer division, said that following the discovery of the wall, the entire area has to be excavated thoroughly. “So far, the evidence recovered from the area since the last major excavation suggests that the area was part of the Malava dynasty, which ran parallel to the Gupta dynasty till 300 CE,” said Tripathi. He further said that the bricks appeared to be part of the wall structure. “Excavation using the latest horizontal technique of uncovering things layer by layer can solve several mysteries related to the medieval period,” said Tripathi. The department of museology and archaeology will send its team in the coming days to expand the plan of action. Sources said that the last major excavation in 1942-43 was unscientific with no emphasis on documentation. Officials said that it has become very important for them to study all evidence, including the coins, to plan the excavation. “So far, the excavation has been carried out in areas around 50-100 metres, but here a large area has to be taken into account. The help from satellite imagery and remote sensing will help in identifying the area for excavation,” said an official.

The community leaders have also announced a statewide agitation from July 1 to press for their demand. Leaders of political parties, including Congress, NCP, Janta Dal, among others, accompanied by different social groups on Monday submitted a memorandum to the state government highlighting the need for a quota for Muslims. Congress leader Mohsin Ahmed Khan said some key commissions constituted in the past had recommended separate reservation for Muslim community. “The state government is firm on its stand on Maratha reservation, but conveniently silent on the demand for reservation to the Muslims. Our community is among the most underprivileged sections of the society and need to be uplifted through organized measures, including quotas in education and jobs,” he said. AH Quadri of social organization Jamaat-e-Islami Hind said Muslims should get 15% reservation without further delay. “The demand for reservation has been pending for years and the government should no more test the patience of Muslim community. The desired quota will bring many Muslims into the mainstream and help the nation to progress further,” he said. On proposed agitation from July 1, Muslim leaders said the protest against the government would be held in a democratic manner. “Considering the pandemic situation, we would follow Covid appropriate behaviour while uniting and raising our voice for reservation,” Khan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/muslim-community-raises-voice-for-reservation/articleshow/83519268.cms||---

The startup has announced its plans to deploy some 12,000 bicycles over the next 12 months in the city, which would be made available to citizens on hourly, weekly and monthly rentals.Arjit Soni, founder and CEO, MyByk, said, "In the next 12 months i.e. by June 2022, we aim to deploy some 12,000 bicycles in Ahmedabad and expand the number of cycle stations to 800. Given the Indian weather and traffic, cycling longer distances for commute may be a challenge but our idea is to encourage short-distance commute. For instance, one can ditch one’s vehicle and cycle to the nearest BRTS station and then travel to their preferred destination and cycle further on."The startup which was founded in 2013, basically runs a mobile-app and web-based platform which facilitates people to rent bicycles based on their requirements. As on date, the startup has rented out at least 2,000 bicycles in Ahmedabad alone and has set up 150 stations. It has presence in Vadodara, Mumbai, Kochi and Udaipur and is also running a pilot project in Rajkot. Besides, it has deployed stations in campuses such as the Reliance Refinery in Jamnagar, SRS Chemicals in Surat, Meghmani Campus in Dahej among others."We recently raised funds to the tune of approximately Rs 7.5 crore in a pre-Series A round of funding from A-One Cycles and an individual investor, Sanjay Baweja, former group CFO at Flipkart. The funds will be used in procurement of new cycles and expansion in Ahmedabad itself," Soni further explainedMyByk has also been chosen for the Ahmedabad Public Bike Share project as part of the Smart City Ahmedabad initiative. Since the pandemic, the startup has doubled its business. "Till March 2020, we had a total of 3,000 cycles deployed (on a rental basis) across different centres. Since the pandemic, we’ve grown to 6,000 cycles as on March 31, 2021. Lockdown, restrictions imposed almost through the year and the pandemic did change public behaviour in a big way with a huge number of people turning to cycling not just to maintain a good health; many rather opted for it to retain their sanity."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amdavadi-firm-aims-to-make-city-countrys-bicycle-capital/articleshow/83509423.cms||Niyati Parikh

Ever since his contract ended, he had been buying the liquor from Punjab and selling it in Uttarakhand at lower rates", said the SSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/400-cartons-of-illicit-liquor-recovered-one-held/articleshow/83521489.cms||Aakash Ahuja

Earlier, the special operations group (SOG) of Valsad police had detained Zipru Bhoya, an auto-rickshaw driver. Bhoya was caught from Dharampur and 66 fake notes were recovered from him. Questioning him led the police to three other accused identified as Parse alias Parshu Pawar, Chitu Bhujad and Parth Shah, all residents of Dharampur. As many as 88 fake currency notes of 500 denomination were recovered from the three accused. The four told police that they used to print the fake currency notes and circulate it at village markets situated along the Gujarat-Maharashtra border. The accused used to mix authentic and fake currency notes to avoid raising suspicion. During interrogation the accused revealed that another gang member named Ajay used to print these notes. “He used to scan the original notes and would make it look like an original note by minor editing in some software and print them,” said inspector V B Barad of SOG. He added that Ajay too will be nabbed soon which can lead to seizure of more fake currency notes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/four-held-for-circulating-fake-currency-notes-in-valsad/articleshow/83523390.cms||---

Gehlot, in a series of tweets, said, “The people of Rajasthan had contributed the most in the construction of Ram temple with faith, but the news of embezzlement of donations at the very beginning of the construction work has shaken the faith of the common man.” No one is able to believe how the land price went from Rs 2 crore to Rs 18 crore in minutes, he said. The CM added, “Pink stone was being smuggled for Ram temple after illegal mining from Banshi Paharpur in the state. We tried that in this holy work, the illegally extracted stone should not go, so we tried to get the work of stone mining going on here legalised from the Government of India, which we are satisfied with. But devotees across the country are deeply hurt by the immoral activities of financial manipulation in this holy work by the trust, formed for the construction of the temple.” Reacting to Gehlot’s comments, BJP state president Satish Poonia said people of state have firm faith in lord Ram. "Your party high command has fielded a force of advocates to stop the construction of temple. Don't worry, the temple will be made," said Poonia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-seeks-probe-into-ram-temple-land-scam/articleshow/83525382.cms||---

The minister instructed officials of JDA and traffic police to put speed breakers to curtail speeding traffic. Following the inspection, the minister told TOI, “The accidents on the elevated road are a matter of great concern and it was due to this I inspected the stretch on which the recent accident occurred. While undoubtedly the elevated road is needed for increasing vehicles in the city, we have to ensure that people do not lose their lives. All the accidents took place in the morning hours and while traffic signals cannot be placed, I have asked the departments to at least put speed brakers so that motorists do not speed.” Apart from this, police personnel will be stationed at both the ends of the elevated road to discourage people from speeding, the minister added. On Friday, two friends were killed after their superbike skidded near a sharp turn and crashed into the barrier wall of the Sodala elevated road. Just six months ago, a police constable aspirant was killed in the morning hours when a luxury car hit him on the same elevated road due to which he fell off the flyover and landed on the roof of a house below. “The major cause of the accidents appear to be speed and cops cannot be placed on the elevated road itself because there is no space. But I have asked officials to take the necessary steps at the earliest,” added the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/put-speed-breakers-on-sodala-elevated-road-transport-min/articleshow/83525407.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Private schools & students provide assistance through social media||JAIPUR: A group of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh Vidyalaya students, Jaipur, has been providing all possible assistance to those in need of Covid-related assistance through social media. Students from class XI and XII have created a helpline — Jaipur Fights Covid — providing information related to hospital beds, oxygen and medicines to those approaching them on their platform. After running a campaign for two months, Jiyan Roytalukdar, Ripudaman Singh, Janya Sharma, Zohaib Abbas, T Simar and Adishree Kasliwal are now leading the front by dispelling myths around vaccination and helping people registering for it. “The idea is to provide assistance to people in the best possible manner under our limitations of being school students. Every success story has given much confidence to providing help to the next person as soon as possible,” said Roytalukdar. Similarly, Maharani Gayatri Devi School is running a donation drive to help those affected by the second wave of Covid in the state. The school students have collaborated with an NGO Smile to collect donations. The drive is based on the fact that low-income families have lost their livelihood to a great extent. The campaign runs with two-fold objectives of providing better treatment and rehabilitation along with digital education. They have been collecting donations through skillshare, workshops, open competitions and interactive talk shows. Harshita Bhandari, public relations manager of the campaign and the student of the school, said that they have been receiving a kind response to the campaign. “People are receptive to the idea of helping each other. It is something which I feel has motivated us to a great extent,” said Bhandari. Similarly, Cambridge Court High School in Jaipur has also set an example by providing help to those affected by Covid. “Since the second wave hit the state, my students have come forward to help the poor and needy. Some of my students were part of the helpline numbers passing on the leads to those looking for oxygen beds, ICU beds, medicines and any other assistance,” said Lata Rawat, principal of Cambridge Court High School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pvt-schools-extend-helping-hand-during-pandemic/articleshow/83523414.cms||---

---||Delhi||Dry run? Know what is in store for your district||New Delhi: On Monday, rains largely eluded Delhi, except for Najafgarh in southwest Delhi, where 30mm of rainfall was recorded in the morning. Similarly, only Aya Nagar in southwest Delhi recorded rains on Tuesday with other parts of the capital remaining dry. To capture such variations in rainfall across the city, India Meteorological Department has recently launched a district-wise forecast to accurately forecast the possibility of rain in each district of Delhi. While earlier, IMD would give forecasts for each station, including Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, Lodhi Road, Aya Nagar, Palam, Ridge, Narela, Delhi University, Pusa, Jafarpur and Mungeshpur, Met officials say the district forecast allows each district to identify how much rainfall it is likely to receive. Simultaneously, IMD has been running its ‘nowcast’ feature, which provides real-time updates of possible rainfall activity in the next three to four hours in and around Delhi, including Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. “This will be used along with the nowcast and while nowcast provides updates just hours before the rainfall occurs, the daily district-wise forecast is in place to provide more accurate information on rainfall possibilities in each district,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD. Srivastava says while the same concept is used in larger states, Delhi’s small area size makes it difficult for the accuracy to be extremely high, however, they are working on improving the forecast probability. “Only districts and parts of Delhi closer to the border sometimes receive rain while the central part remains dry. Chances are a shower may only pass through a few districts and move to a neighbouring state, so a district forecast is useful then,” said Srivastava. Last year, IMD on its website—rmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in—had also launched an experimental impact-based forecast predicting the possible impacts a heavy or moderate spell of rain may have on traffic and travel across the city. It suggests people to check routes in advance before setting out in case of heavy showers in the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dry-run-know-what-is-in-store-for-your-district/articleshow/83558009.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The incident took place early on Monday morning. The wolf attacked six people from Bawchi village. The seriously injured — Yashraj Phonde (15), Sukhdev Jadhav (60), Tanaji Chavan (32) — are admitted to the Civil Hospital in Solapur while three others — Anusuya Mali (35), Parwati Mali (32) and Bharat Mhamane — are being treated at a local health centre. A total of 14 villagers were injured in the incident in Bawchi, Salgar and other two adjoining villages. Dhairyasheel Patil, the divisional conservator of forests in Solapur, said, “On Saturday night, the wolf, which the villagers are claiming is rabid, entered Bawchi village and attacked several villagers along with two dogs, one cow and a buffalo. This continued till late in the night. The villagers stayed awake in search of the wolf.” Patil added that the villagers from Salgar too joined them and carried out a search operation. “The wolf was found in the Salgar village, where the villagers hit the wolf with their sticks till the animal died,” he said. The treatment of the injured villagers will be done and they will be given compensation as per the government law. “The primary investigation suggests that the wolf was rabid but the post mortem reports are yet to arrive. If the animal is not found to be rabid, then action might be taken against the villagers according to the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. Wolves have their natural habitat in the grasslands surrounding Solapur region and usually stay in packs and stay away from humans. The villagers are advised not to sleep outside of their homes as the region has many wild animals,” Patil added. Meanwhile, a leopard has been sighted at Alkud village in Kavathe Mahankal taluka of Sangli district, where tehsildar B J Gore has issued orders instructing villagers against coming out of their homes or near the place where the search operation is being carried by the forest department. The orders were issued after a video showing villagers of Alkud running behind the leopard on Sunday noon went viral on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/villagers-kill-suspected-rabid-wolf-in-solapur-search-on-for-leopard-in-sangli/articleshow/83519316.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

---||Agra||Muslims in Aligarh demand fair probe into case of discarding 29 Covid vaccines by auxiliary nurse midwife||AGRA: Muslims across Aligarh have demanded a fair magisterial inquiry into the allegations levelled against an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), who had been accused of disposing of 29 Covid vaccines, filled in syringes, without administering them to beneficiaries at urban primary health centre in Jamalpur last month. They claimed that the ANM, Niha Khan, had been falsely accused of disposing of the vaccines and demanded that her statement be recorded before a magistrate. They also submitted a memorandum to the district magistrate, claiming that the ANM was not responsible for the incident. The signatories to the memorandum include Aligarh’s Mufti Mohd Zahid. Talking with TOI, Zahid, who is also an associate professor at AMU’s Theology department, said, “Khan has been falsely implicated in the case. Some people want to create fissures between the two communities and action against her was part of that conspiracy. We will take up this issue at the international level. Strict action should be taken against those responsible for this act.” Chaudhary Ifrahim Hussain, chairman of the Bhartiya Samaj Sevak Sangathan, also aired similar views. On May 22, 29 syringes were found in a dustbin at PHC where vaccination for the 18-44 years age group was being conducted. A pharmacist, Arvind Kashyap, was the first to raise the issue and after a preliminary inquiry, an FIR was registered against Khan and the in charge of urban PHC, Dr Afreem Jahra, on May 30 by additional CMO, Dr Durgesh Kumar. Khan was accused of disposing of vaccines without administering them to beneficiaries while Dr Jahra was accused of hiding this information from the higher authorities. The health department has cancelled the contract of the ANM and transferred the medical officer in charge, Dr Arfeen Zehra, to Harduaganj community health centre and stopped her two salary increments. Other staff members have also been replaced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/muslims-in-aligarh-demand-fair-probe-into-case-of-discarding-29-covid-vaccines-by-anm/articleshow/83521510.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Taken for a ride, says tony housing society after private vax drive||MUMBAI: Worried that 390 of its residents got a “spurious vaccine”, an upper-crust housing society in Kandivli (W) has complained to police about being “taken for a ride” by a group of people who held a Covid vaccination drive on its premises on May 30. The drive cost Rs 5 lakh. In a letter to police on Tuesday, the Hiranandani Heritage Residents Welfare Association said some “unscrupulous elements” had played a fraud on it and “put the health and wellbeing” of its members in “serious peril”. Times ViewThe idea of doorstep vaccination was to reduce stress among people by getting the shot right into their housing colony. But fly-by-night operators spoil the script for all. The police should arrest the trickster immediately. The BMC must start a campaign to educate housing societies and corporate houses on the need for signing MoUs with vaccinating centres before planning a drive.TOI spoke to some residents who said there were red flags right at the start: None of the recipients got an invoice for payment and none allegedly suffered any common side-effects associated with the vaccination. “The team had no laptop or mobile app used for online verification in vaccination centres,” said one. “They physically checked and noted people’s Aadhaar card and said we would get an OTP a few days later that we had to convey to them,” said Gopal Sura, another resident. Concern turned to fear when 150 of the recipients got their vaccination certificates from different hospitals (Nanavati, Lifeline Hospital and BMC’s Nesco jumbo centre), carrying different dates. “The fraudsters collected around Rs 5 lakh from us and left us worrying about what has been injected,” said another resident who didn’t want to be identified. Most recipients were in the 18-44 age-group who needed vaccination for trips abroad. Additional commissioner of police Dilip Sawant said, “We will inquire into the complaint and take action.” A police source said the Covishield vials had ‘Not For Sale’ stamps in red on them. Deputy municipal commissioner Vishwas Shankarwar said, “When a society or corporate organises a vaccination drive in its premises through a private hospital, they must sign a memorandum of understanding and intimate the local ward office about it.” It is learnt the 150 certificates (100 bearing the name of Nanavati Hospital, which has since filed a police complaint) have names of genuine employees of the hospital named. “We don’t know how the employees’ password was acquired by these fraudsters,” said a police officer. In the case of HHRWA, BMC officials are not sure if an MoU was signed as the local ward office was not informed about the drive. “We have also not received any complaint. We will ask the society for details to examine the issue,” said Shankarwar. The association has alleged that a man claiming to be a sales representative of Kokilaben Ambani Hospital approached it for on-premises vaccination for its residents (Kokilaben hospital has clarified it doesn’t do housing colony drives outside Andheri). One Mahendra Singh arranged the vaccines and collected money from the society. “Singh claimed he had organised drives for 5,000 people of a corporate house. He also held a camp in an architecture college in Borivli on June 3,” said Sura. Kandivli police are inquiring about Singh. His phone has been switched off. Police are questioning a person whom Singh engaged for a day by paying Rs 1,000. The person has pleaded innocent, claiming he is poor and clueless about the vaccine. The residents contacted each of the hospitals, which clarified they were not involved in the drive. On Tuesday, many residents took to Twitter to complain. “This tweet is to bring to notice a SCAM,” said resident Neha Alshi. “There are doubts about whether we were actually given Covishield or was it just glucose or expired/waste vaccine,” said Alshi. A society resident, Dinesh Zala, whose wife and brother were vaccinated, said, “We are in a dilemma, to think about our safety first or catch the culprit as he’s the only person who can tell us if it was the genuine vaccine. The society residents, including a student planning to travel abroad, got the vaccination certificate but is not sure if it’s valid. We want some assurance from government authorities in this matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/taken-for-a-ride-says-tony-chs-after-pvt-vax-drive/articleshow/83559435.cms||Malathy Iyer

Apart from the donations, DORI has also reached out to large number of people by providing online consultations.” Srivastava said Rajasthan Foundation had been in constant touch with its diaspora through online meetings and sharing the difficulties the people in the state were through during the crisis. “They wanted to help the people of their state and did so through other platforms like Jaipur Citizen Forum and Rotary Club as well,” added Srivastava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthani-diaspora-extends-helping-hand-during-covid-crisis/articleshow/83523439.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Petrol races past Rs 100 per litre in Telangana, Rs 59 taxes fuel the oil flames||HYDERABAD: Upwardly mobile petrol prices finally breached the Rs 100-mark in Telangana on Monday, registering a record Rs 100.20 per litre. But have you ever wondered how much you are paying as tax on one litre of petrol? Consumers in Telangana pay Rs 58.75 towards taxes alone. While the state charges Rs 26.45 value-added tax (VAT), the excise duty levied by the Centre on one litre of petrol is Rs 32.30. In fact, Telangana’s 35.2 per cent VAT on each litre of petrol is second only to Rajasthan and Manipur which levy 36 per cent VAT. Experts said a high VAT leads to additional cost for consumers each time oil companies effect a change in the base price of petrol. Earlier, Telangana used to levy 33 per cent VAT on petrol but adjusted it to 35.2 per cent some time back. “This burns a hole in consumers’ pocket. Though the Centre’s excise duty is constant, VAT levied by the state goes up each time there is a change in base price forcing the consumes to shell out extra,” an expert pointed out. Karnataka collects 35 per cent VAT, closely followed by Tamil Nadu at 34 per cent. Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Assam are some of the states which levy 30 per cent VAT on petrol. “Varied petrol rates collected at different places within the state have a lot to do with petroleum dealer commissions and transport charges,” an industry source revealed. Marri Amarender Reddy, president of Telangana Petrol Dealers’ Association, said solution lies in following a uniform VAT structure across the country. “Consumers can get some relief if the states follow a single VAT instead of collecting varied percentages. The Centre should also give clarity on imposing various types of cess on consumers,” he said. The Centre levies additional excise cess, road development cess and agriculture cess, which also jack up petrol prices. Industry experts point out that states like West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh follow ad valorem tax (a form of taxation based on the value of a transaction or a property and is generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the property rather than on size, weight or quantity), giving some relief to the consumers. “Also, ad valorem tax system is followed to safeguard a state’s income in case of any fall in international oil prices,” an expert explained. Not just petrol, Telangana comes second in the country in taxing the diesel consumers by levying 27 per cent VAT, next only to Odisha’s 28 per cent. Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh charge 25 per cent VAT on diesel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/petrol-races-past-rs-100/lt-in-t-rs-59-taxes-fuel-the-oil-flames/articleshow/83527235.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

So far, since May first week, they have raised over Rs 11 crore and procured 881 concentrators and delivered them to 65 districts (21states/Union territories), including 7 districts in Rajasthan. These districts include Tonk, Jaisalmer, Jhalawar, Banswara, Bhilwara, Kotputli (Jaipur), Pilani (Jhunjhunu). These professionals have raised funds through GoFundMe and Milaap fundraising platforms. They have done it in Rajasthan with the technical and logistic support from the state’s health department. “We have supplied 69 oxygen concentrators to the district hospitals and community health centres (CHCs) in these seven districts,” said Dhruv Sogani, one of the 25 professionals and an alumnus of BITS, Pilani. “We had shared our plan to supply oxygen concentrators to the districts (where it was needed) with Akhil Arora (principal secretary finance and health) and sought state government’s logistic support and guidance,” he said. According to Sogani, while 797 units of oxygen concentrators and BiPaP machines have been delivered to the districts, 84 were in transit (as on June 12). “The 25 of us is a group of engineers, management graduates from IIMs and other institutions and various other professions. We got to know about the requirement of oxygen concentrators in the districts by directly coordinating with district administration through the network of professionals who were in touch with them,” he added. The 84 concentrators, which were in transit (as on June 12), were being delivered to Kargil, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tamil Nadu. Among the few districts where they have supplied oxygen concentrators are Majuli and Hailakandi (Assam), Churachandpur, Kamjong and Pherzawl (Manipur), Lunglei (Mizoram), Bastar (Chhattisgarh), Mon, Noklak and Kiphire (Nagaland), Lepa Rada ( Arunachal Pradesh) and Pithoragarh (Uttarakhand). “After the demand for concentrators depletes, we will focus on smaller districts and improve their medical infrastructure by providing them with equipment like CT scan and X-ray machines in the next 3-6 months,” said Sogani. Tina Dabi, joint secretary, finance (taxation) department, who is currently on deputation with Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation Limited (RMSCL) said, “The state government helped them in issuing certification for IGST exemption for donations. We also helped them in spotting the critical areas where concentrators could be supplied and providing guidance as to how to go about the process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/7-bits-pilani-alumni-among-others-supply-oxygen-concentrators-equipment-to-65-districts/articleshow/83523430.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 53 lakh to 13 lakh per day, MGNREGA labour work dips in 2nd wave||JAIPUR: Compared to last year’s engagement of over 52 lakh labourers under MGNREGA at the height of Covid pandemic on June 14 (2020), the numbers dipped to 13.48 lakh on the corresponding day this year (2021) at a time when the state was reeling under second wave. The highest labour engagement per day in the state last year (2020) was on June 15 at 53.45 lakh. According to officials and volunteers of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS), lakhs of labourers are not getting work under the scheme despite a huge demand for it. They said while there was a huge demand for employment under the scheme last year due to large-scale labour movement at the peak of first wave, this year the numbers (in terms of labour movement) are low because either most of them have not returned to their previous workplaces or they have come back again (in small numbers) and are still demanding for work under the scheme. According to state government's Raj Kaushal portal, 12.81 lakh migrant workers had returned to the state last year. “State government’s lack of monitoring, vision and commitment towards the scheme has led to a dip in labour engagement. If not 50 lakh labourers, they should have at least engaged 30 lakh labourers each day at this time of the year,” said an official. As per data received from rural development department, the labour engagement on June 15, 2019, was 33.29 lakh. “We have been demanding for work under the scheme, but the village secretary refuses to enroll us. My husband works as a driver. It is difficult to sustain a livelihood without NREGA work. I have been working under the scheme for the past two years, but never faced such challenges. Like me, there are many in the village demanding work under NREGA. But, all of us have been turned away,” said Dali Devi (45), a resident of Kachhwali gram panchayat in Rajsamand district. She has five daughters and a son. The state’s rural development and panchayati raj department had issued guidelines to resume community development work under MGNREGA on May 23, allowing a maximum of 20 persons at a worksite. In a recent order, the maximum limit was increased to 30 persons. “Thousands of people are staging dharnas at the gram panchayats demanding work. But the state government is doing nothing about it. How can you engage just 30 people at a worksite? Usually, at this time of the year, 200-300 people are engaged in work at a worksite in gram panchayats. Moreover, the 30 people who are getting jobs in a particular fortnight, are not repeated in the next fortnight,” said Mukesh Goswami of MKSS. “We have submitted a memorandum to the CM demanding that the upper limit of 30 workers be removed. The work at the sites should start in full capacity. We will also submit memoranda to SDMs and BDOs at 200 blocks across the state.” Krishna Kant Pathak, secretary, rural development department said, “This year the Covid risk factor was much higher (in rural areas) than last year. There was fear among people last year but the risk factor was less. In villages too, 30,000-50,000 people were diagnosed with ILI (influenza like illness) symptoms daily (this time). Keeping this thing in mind, strict Covid protocol was enforced, allowing only 20 workers at a worksite initially. We will maximise performance of the 100-day scheme in the remaining months of the year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/53l-to-13l/day-mgnrega-labour-work-dips-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/83525438.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

However, the trader dealing with food grains and vegetables had a narrow escape as the assailants missed their target. The whole incident was captured in a CCTV camera of a nearby shop. According to police, the incident took place at 11am when three of the six assailants came outside the shop belonging to Kailash Meena. “All the three took his name and when Meena came out, one of the assailants opened five rounds of fire. Luckily, he was unhurt,” said a senior police officer of Gumanpura police station area while talking to TOI on the phone. Meena is a commission agent who deals in fruits, vegetables and food grains at the mandi. The businessman informed the police that he has no rivalry or dispute with anyone and showed his ignorance on identification of any of the assailants. As the assailants missed their target they managed to flee from the scene on two bikes. Soon after the incident the victim intimated the police control room and a team of senior police officers rushed to the spot. “Six armed assailants had come, and they had fired five rounds. On the basis of CCTV footage available various teams are working to trace them. Any apparent reason behind the attack on the businessman is not yet known,” the officer added. When contacted, Vikas Pathak, superintendent of police, Kota, said, “It is known that the victim had a dispute in 2007 with a man identified as Liyaqat. But if this attack is related to that is yet to be known. We have identified all the six assailants and we will make possible arrests in this connection. Meena has a reputation of being abusive with his fellow traders and others,” Pathak added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kota-grain-trader-has-a-narrow-escape-after-six-men-fire-at-him/articleshow/83525473.cms||---

Police have seized 75 bags of green gram, 47 bags of soyabean, 39 bags of beans, eight bags of jowar and multiple bags containing grocery items stolen from stores. Osmanabad SP Raj Tilak Roushan told TOI: “Seven of the nine arrested accused are criminals on police record. Preliminary probe has revealed their involvement in a series of thefts carried out at different farms.” The officer said that it is rare for such hardened property offenders to steal grain and groceries. The arrested accused have been identified as Dada Chavhan, his siblings Anil and Vikas, Yuvraj Kale, Mahadev Chavhan, Aaba Shinde (all residents of Rajeshnagar), Pardhi Pidhi of Dhoki area, and Ankush Shinde of Itkur in Kalamb. The two accused who purchased the stolen grain from the suspects have been identified as Vaibhav Ashtikar and Sudhakar Jadhav. Local crime branch inspector Sudhakar Ghadge said the arrests have led to the detection of nine offences registered at police stations in Osmanabad rural, Dhoki, Vashi, Kalamb and Yermala. “The suspects are habitual property offenders but due to the lockdown, most people are staying at home, making it impossible for them (the suspects) to strike. To sustain themselves, the suspects started stealing grain, farm produce and started targeting grocery stores,” said Ghadge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/9-held-for-stealing-grain-grocery-items/articleshow/83519334.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Sarpanch Chandralal Khava has refused to eat or drink anything till he is assured that all the residents of the village are inoculated.Kudi, which falls under Jodhpur’s Luni constituency and shares border with the city, is neither considered a rural entity nor an urban part of Jodhpur. “This is the biggest farce of the system and we have been suffering for years due to lack of clarity,” said Khava. He said the identity crisis had affected the vaccination drive.He said if they go for vaccination as per rural guidelines, they are asked to follow guidelines for urban areas. “But on the contrary, if we demand facilities for door-to-door vaccination as in other parts of Jodhpur city, we are asked to go to the PHC,” said Khava.“As per the rural guidelines for vaccination, people from rural areas are registered on-the-spot at the PHC for vaccination but we are not being given this facility. There has been no slot for booking for the past one week for us,” Khava said.According to the administration, over 6,000 persons over 18+ category have been vaccinated in this region whereas according to Khava, only 612 persons of Kudi have been vaccinated. He demanded that vaccination should be undertaken in Kudi considering it to be a gram panchayat with immediate effect. Khava said that over 30,000 persons of Kudi are awaiting vaccination.TOI spoke to the Luni MLA Mahendra Bishnoi, but he expressed ignorance about the dharna. “I have no idea about any such dharna.

This is the highest single-day fund raise via bonds since the state's formation. This will also be the highest-ever total auction value in the April-June financial quarter. The auction on Tuesday will take the total amount raised by the state government in this financial quarter to Rs 11,500 crore. Sources in the government said that the funds would be used for the implementation of Rythu Bandhu scheme for this season. There is an additional requirement of Rs 1,000 crore for the implementation of the PRC recommendations for state government employees. Experts said this would be much more than what was indicated by the state government to Reserve Bank of India for the financial quarter. Telangana authorities said it would raise Rs 8,000 crore in this financial quarter as the government had already raised Rs 3,500 crore with the auction of bonds on June 1 and June 8 of this month. There is also a plan to raise bonds on June 22 and June 29 of this month. In addition to raising extra bonds, the government has also planned land auctions. When contacted, Planning Board vice chairman B Vinod Kumar said the auction was not worrisome as there has been a very good response for the auction at RBI for state development loans. “Depending on the response from the buyer, RBI allows the state their limits. We always had a good run with bonds, with long term repayment schedules and low interest rates,” he said. There is a dip in the revenues to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore due to lockdown in the month of May. Sources in the government said even if the state earns Rs 8,000 crore extra this year as GST and other taxes, there will still be some fund shortage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-hit-t-to-raise-rs-3k-cr-via-bonds-today-highest-in-a-day/articleshow/83527287.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Lungs got infected due to Covid and the patient is on extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine,” appealed one of the patient’s family member, who belongs to Kota and is currently undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Jaipur.It is not the only family which is searching for a donor for lung transplant. Due to Covid-19, a lot of patients have died due to severe lung fibrosis, while many are fighting battle against death.However, doctors say that fibrosis in lungs can be treated in some cases, but in terminally ill patients, lung transplant is the only option. “For the treatment of lung fibrosis, anti-fibrotic medicines are available, also through pulmonary physiotherapy lungs can be rehabilitated,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS medical college.While a lot of family members of patients who are suffering from terminal lung fibrosis are making an attempt to get lung transplant, SMS hospital may emerge as a hope for such patients. “SMS hospital is ready to perform its first lung transplant any day. Permission for lung transplant by appropriate authorities has been granted. Now, it is among the three hospitals which are authorized to perform lung transplant,” said Dr Manish Sharma, coordinator, organ transplant, State Organ Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO).The SMS hospital has performed three heart transplants so far, but it has not performed lung transplant yet. A team of doctors under Dr Anil Sharma, who is senior professor (cardiothoracic surgery) said, “We are fully prepared for our first lung transplant. We have started registry of recipient. We have also performed mock drill for lung transplantation and as soon as we get the donor, we will perform it.”Dr Sharma said, “Family members are approaching us for lung transplant. If a patient develops severe fibrosis, his lungs does not contract and expand which is why they require ECMO machine support.”For such patients, lung transplantation is the only option for survival. A donor is a person who is declared brain dead by a team of doctors while undergoing treatment.“Earlier, a patient with severe lung fibrosis post Covid was airlifted to reach Chennai, but he died before transplant. Even after recovery from Covid, some patients may require lung transplant,” said Govind Gurbani, organ donation counsellor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/patients-with-terminal-fibrosis-search-for-lung-donors/articleshow/83523459.cms||---

With the anguished doctor posting a video about the assault on social media, higher-ups intervened and the SI expressed regret over the incident. Veterinarian Dr P Ramakrishna of Mulakalapalli mandal took to social media to explain how he was treated by sub-inspector Suresh of Mulakalapalli police station. “He was not only harsh with me, refusing to understand the reason why I was out, but also slapped me,” Ramakrishna said in a video post, which went viral. In the video, Ramakrishna said on Saturday he was returning after attending a call for assistance at Kummaripadu village. On the way back, he stopped his car at Mulakapalli and no sooner a constable came and demanded that he drive away from there. “I said I would speak to the sub-inspector, but the SI was even more rude. Despite explaining who I was and on what work I do, he slapped me,” he said in the video. “If this is how a government servant doing his duty is treated by police and the sub-inspector in particular, I can well imagine the plight of common people,” the doctor said, showing the marks on his face. Sub-Inspector Suresh, however, claimed he had not assaulted Ramakrishna, but asked him to leave the place. With the video going viral, senior police and veterinary department officials tried to douse the fire. They tried to bring about a rapprochement between the veterinarian and the SI as the doctor said he would take up the issue with the SP as he felt the SI had deliberately treated him badly. With officials in both the departments intervening, the SI expressed regret over the incident to Ramakrishna in a meeting facilitated between them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/si-slaps-govt-vet-later-apologises-in-bhadradri/articleshow/83523480.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Doctors bank on tissue biopsy to find out if Delta variant causing mucormycosis||JAIPUR: After ascertaining that the second wave of Covid was dominated by the ‘aggressive’ Delta variant, SMS Medical College’s pathology department has begun a study on the role of the new strain verusus the surge in mucormycosis cases. The department has decided to conduct tissue biopsy of mucormycosis patients admitted to the hospital. Nearly 2,000 Covid patients contracted the fungal infection across state in the second wave. The doctors were linking sudden rise in mucormycosis to uncontrolled diabetes, indiscriminate use of steroids and oxygen therapy through unhygienic humidifiers. However, when the medical college team realised that Delta variant dominated the second wave, doctors suspected that the variant could be behind the sudden surge in mucormycosis cases. “A new concept has emerged that second wave was more aggressive, where a rise in thromboembolism phenomenon and blood clots were seen in Covid patients. Our research board wanted to know if blood clots are due to Covid or micro-blood clots are due to fungus in blood vessels causing mucormycosis. We have collaborated with our pathology department to conduct a study on it. The department will conduct tissue biopsy of mucormycosis patients to find if blood clots due to Delta variant are causing mucormycosis,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. The mucormycosis board has also conducted data analysis of patients admitted to SMS hospital which shows that 95% of them had uncontrolled diabetes and 70% had steroid history, which means that they had taken steroid during Covid treatment. Besides, 95% of the patients were found unvaccinated. Moreover, 70% of the patients had undergone surgery. Among all the patients, 10% to 15% patients had dental and jaw involvement, 10% had eye involvement and 10% had brain involvement. “Mucormycosis was not an issue in the first wave, but in the second wave, rise in such cases have been reported. Through tissue biopsy, we are trying to differentiate if Covid related thromboembolic phenomena which leads to thrombosis (blood clots) of terminal arteries of eyes or nose or is it fungus invading the blood vessels that causes mucormycosis,” said Dr Pawan Singhal, professor (ENT), SMS Medical College, who is treating such patients. SMS doctors said that such blood clots could affect brain and heart too, causing stroke, heart attack and even gangrene. On the sudden rise in mucormycosis cases, Dr Jaideep Dogra, senior chief medical officer at Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) hospital said, “Necrosis (death of body tissue) in the patient could be the primary event because of thrombosis (a process of blood clot) of the feeder artery, on this dead tissue the atmospheric fungus grows as it is now unprotected by the body’s immune defence.” Dogra said adding azithromycin for pneumonia may avert face artery thrombosis thereby preventing superadded fungus spread. Thus, the action of this anti-bacterial drug may lie in not curing a deadly virus (SARS CoV 2), but killing chlamydia (bacteria) and preventing the thrombotic phase mortality associated with the disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tissue-biopsy-study-may-reveal-if-covid-delta-variant-causing-mucormycosis/articleshow/83523478.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

The body of the woman with more than 25 stab wounds was discovered at her residence by her son who was out for work when the incident took place. Police have arrested a 30-year-old man for the crime. A sickle used in the crime was also recovered from the spot. According to police, the murder was reported to New Ashok Nagar police station from Dharmshila Hospital. The victim lived near Peepal Chowk in village Dallupura in east Delhi. During a preliminary probe, it was found that the elderly woman lived with her younger son Chandan who works as a security guard in a bank. She worked as a vegetable vendor and on Sunday afternoon, she had gone home asking her grandson to take care of the shop when she was targeted. Initial medical examination revealed the woman’s throat had been slit with a sharp-edged weapon. She also had multiple sharp injuries to her abdomen. A case of murder was registered to probe the death. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Priyanka Kashyap said that during investigation, the police team collected and analysed CCTV footage of the area as well as placed informers to gather clues. “With the help of CCTV footage, our team zeroed in on a suspect who was spotted leaving the woman’s house at the time of murder. He stayed inside the woman’s house for about 20 minutes. With the help of local intelligence, the suspect was identified as Vipin Dedha, a 30-year-old resident of the same village. Following a raid, Dedha was apprehended and interrogated at length during which he admitted to have murdered the woman,” the DCP said. The accused was drunk when the incident took place. He allegedly killed her after assaulting her as he feared she would recognise him since they were neighbours and acquainted with each other. The wife of the accused had left him and he resided alone. “He was arrested. On his instance, the weapon of offence, a sickle, was also recovered.

The seized items include body parts of a monitor lizard and nails of an unidentified animal. Monitor lizard is listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. “We received a tip-off that a man was trying to sell prohibited wildlife articles. We approached him as customers and managed to apprehend the accused, Sunil, from Uttam Nagar. A case is being registered under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act,” said a forest official. According to an official, the dry body parts of a monitor lizard have been seized, while the nails of an unidentified animal will be sent to a laboratory to identify the species. “We are interrogating the accused to find out the source of the animal parts,” said the official. According to the data of the forest department, nine monitor lizards were rescued this year from across the city after they were sighted in human settlements. Wildlife SOS, an NGO, rescued a four-feet-long monitor lizard from Badarpur Thermal Power Station on Monday. The massive lizard had made its way into a toilet stall from where it was rescued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-trying-to-sell-animal-parts-in-city-arrested/articleshow/83558147.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Raw material price surge a headache for some sectors||Surge in raw material prices triggered by supply-side disruptions continues to haunt some sectors. The second wave of Covid-19 further worsened the situation for real estate, engineering, textiles, ice cream, and brass industries. With business and margins getting squeezed, industry bodies have demanded reliefs from both the state and central government.Realty continues to reel from high raw material pricesFaced with a steep hike in raw materials such as steel and cement, real estate developers had observed a one-day strike on February 12 this year to protest the hike in raw material prices. CREDAI pegs the raw material price hike at 15-20%, due to supply disruption amid the second wave. "The raw material prices had shot up substantially in Jan-Feb. The current prices are higher even than those levels. At Rs 60,000-65,000 per tonne, the steel prices are at a lifetime high," said Ashish Patel, president, CREDAI-Gujarat. The real estate developers estimate their production costs have gone up 20% due to rising costs of raw materials, transportation and labour. "This will ultimately put a burden on end-users," added Patel. The realtors want the Centre to reduce GST on cement from 28% to 18%, and have asked the state government to allow an extension of at least six months in project completion deadlines.No respite for engineering industry amid a steep rise in steel pricesteel costs have gone up by 80% or even more since the lockdown eased last year and this has left manufacturers of engineering goods battling losses. Estimates by engineering goods makers suggest that steel prices have gone up by a minimum of 80% since June-July last year. "Doing business with raw materials priced so high is not sustainable. Recently in June, steel prices went up by 10%, making it next to impossible to fulfill past orders without taking losses. To stay competitive, our margins were as such wafer-thin and a surge in steel price will not just eat into our margins but also erode our working capital," said Niraj Shah, partner at an engineering goods manufacturing unit in Sanand. "Fulfilling past orders was already a concern over the past month and a half as industrial oxygen supply was halted for the time being. The recent surge in price is indeed a double-whammy," Shah explained.Brass parts makers struggle to manage working capital issuesrass part makers, especially smaller ones, are struggling with increased operation cost and thinning margins due to a 15% rise in the price of brass in the past couple of months. This is for the second time that a significant increase in brass prices was reported, only adding to manufacturers’ woes. The last time prices surged was at the end of October 2020."Cost of brass has gone up by Rs 70 per kg over the past couple of months. Being the key raw material, it hugely affects our margins. For pre-negotiated orders, we have no choice but to absorb the price hike. This way, our working capital is shrinking," said Lakhabhai Keshwala, president of Jamnagar Factory Owners’ Association (JFOA)."With payment cycles delayed and demand in the domestic market slowing, our business is suffering," Keshwala added. Jamnagar houses one of the largest brass parts manufacturing clusters.Ice cream makers’ woes far from overven as the ice cream industry is hoping for demand to open up after the erosion of back-to-back peak seasons due to the pandemic, high input cost continues to plague ice manufacturers. "The prices of kernel oil and skimmed milk had already shot up in March. The second wave fuelled them further," said Bhupat Bhuva, chairman, Gujarat Ice Cream Association. "The prices of palm kernel oil for one kilogram had shot up to Rs 110-120 in March, the same now have increased by 10% more to Rs 130-140 plus GST. The prices hovered around Rs 60-70 a kg last year," he added. Similarly, skimmed milk powder prices that hovered around Rs 180-175 per kg have bounced back to Rs 235 to Rs 270. The price of corrugated boards used as packaging material has also surged further by 15-20%. To ease their problems, the industry has demanded relief from the government. "The state government has exempted restaurants and water parks from paying fixed charges in their electricity bills. The same benefit should also be extended to the ice cream manufacturers and retailers as well," Bhuva said. "It will help reduce our losses by 5-10% if we get the relief," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/raw-material-price-surge-a-headache-for-some-sectors/articleshow/83509502.cms||Kalpesh Damor

A primary school teacher in the tribal-dominated Dahod district is out to bridge this gap and ensure students get a chance to study. The teacher noticed that there were several hamlets - locally called ‘falias’ - in the tribal district that did not have television sets. In several houses, these were not in a working condition. The end result was that students of his school were missing out on lessons imparted on television. The programming has been designed by the Gujarat Centre for Education Research and Technology (GCERT). Ravindra Prajapati, an assistant teacher of Dablara primary school in Fatepura taluka, who was in touch with the students and their parents, realized the hardship and decided to do something about it. He made an appeal to people in various WhatsApp groups to part with unused television sets, disc antennas and receivers. He explained the difficulties of the students to the members of these groups. The appeal was made on June 8 and by June 10, Prajapat had received five TV sets and seven disc antennas. These were given to a television repairer in Sukhsar who checked them and fixed those that were not in a working condition. These were then installed on dwellings in the hamlets. “A minimum of five students and a maximum of around 12 students study at seven locations now using these televisions. At two places which had TVs, but no antennas and receivers, we provided only antennas and receivers,” said Prajapati. He added that more donations were in the pipeline. Students come to the house where the TV has been kept and see the programmes. A timetable of the televised classes is also pasted on the houses. The effort has also been noticed by the top brass of the education department in the district. “The effort is one that can inspire other teachers too. If others start making such changes, education would definitely start improving,” said Dahod district education officer (DEO) Mayur Parekh. Lalubhai Baria, a resident of Savji Falia in Dablara, said there would be 20 to 30 houses in the area. “Eight to 10 children come to study on television. Most houses did not have television sets and some were not working. Three of my children attend school on television now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/teacher-gets-tvs-repaired-for-tribal-students-classes/articleshow/83523524.cms||Sachin Sharma

Mills Colony police station said the 31-year-old woman was first sexually abused by her 24-year-old relative. Later, he introduced a 15-year-old boy to the victim, who also sexually abused her. “To make things worse, a 14-year-old boy, who is the friend of the juvenile made a video. Later, the video was shared by the boys with more people,” Mills Colony inspector Ravi Kumar told TOI. Finally, it was the victim’s sister who came across the video and was shocked to see the survivor being raped in the footage. “Immediately, she brought the issue to the notice of her father, who lodged a complaint,’’ Ravi Kumar said. Two accused, including the minor boy, were booked under 376 (rape) of IPC, whereas the other juvenile was booked under Information Technology Act for making an obscene video and sharing it with others. While the 24-year-old accused was taken into custody, the minor boys will be sent to a juvenile home, police said. The entire incident took place at the residence of the victim, in the absence of her family members. “Knowing that the victim was alone, the accused raped her on different days,” the police officer added.

Holding placards, a group of parents gathered outside a private school in Bandlaguda. The parents told reporters that despite the Supreme Court’s directive on fee hike, private schools are increasing the fees and adding to their woes during the pandemic. “At a meeting, the school had assured parents that only 5% fee would be hiked but now they have increased the fee by 10%. The move will affect our children’s education and add to our financial woes,” said Zubair, a protester. The parents said that they have decided to take up the matter with the education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parents-stage-protest-against-school-fee-hike/articleshow/83523500.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana set to mop up Rs 12,500cr from revised land value||HYDERABAD: After deciding to auction unutilised government land, the state government is mulling to increase land values for property registrations. After GST and excise, revenue earned through property registrations is the third highest source of revenue for the government. Sources said the revised land market values will come into force from August 1 this year if chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao okays the proposal. The registration and stamps (R&S) department has kept the proposals ready, sources said. “Our department is aiming to achieve Rs 12,500 crore this financial year (2021-22) after revising the land values,” a senior official of the registration department told TOI. The government has plans to enhance market land values for non-agriculture properties between 30% and 50%. While the enhancement will be 30% in the rural areas, it will be 50% in Greater Hyderabad and other municipal corporation areas. For agricultural properties, the hike in the values would be about 20% on the existing rates. Though the government has powers to revise market values every year under the Indian Stamp Act, land values have not been revised after formation of Telangana. The last revision was done in August 2013 when the state was united. Official sources said the government could not enhance the land values for the past few years due to a series of elections in the last three years. Though there was a proposal for revision, it was again postponed due to Covid-19 first wave and lockdown. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar, who is also principal secretary of registration department, asked the officials to prepare proposals in February to implement them from April 1 this year. It was again deferred indefinitely due to second wave of Covid-19 and lockdown. In the last year 2020-21, the government had given a target of Rs 8,000 crore collections to the registration department, but it had earned Rs 5,260 crore through 12.11 lakh documents’ registrations, which was Rs 1,800 crore less than the 2019-20 revenue. The property registrations had to be stopped for three months as the government decided to have agricultural properties’ registration through tahsildars and non-agricultural properties through sub-registrar offices in September last year. “The state is hopeful of earning a good revenue this year as the real estate sector is set to bounce back within no time, especially in Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Medchal districts. After first wave of Covid-19, we had apprehensions, which were proved wrong,” a district registrar of R&S department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-set-to-mop-up-rs-12500cr-from-revised-land-value/articleshow/83523561.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Govt must release academic calendar: Schools association||HYDERABAD: The Telangana Recognized School Managements Association (TRSMA) demanded that at least this year the state should release an academic calendar and ask all schools to follow it irrespective of whether classes are conducted online or offline. They said that in the last academic year, there was not much learning, especially for class 1 to class 8 students, as there was no academic calendar. “No one took studies seriously as there were no assessments or exams. In the end, they were promoted to the next class without even learning much,” said Shekhar Rao Y, president, TRSMA. The managements said that the state had responded positively and added that it might release the academic calendar with the total number of working days, assessment schedule, among other details by July 1 as online classes will most likely begin from July 1. They, however, said that attendance will not be considered this year as many students do not have devices to attend online classes regularly. While budget private schools have tied with third-party apps to broadcast lessons, the government teachers have asked the state to telecast digital lessons through the TSAT channel for this academic year as well. “In the last one week, teachers were asked to monitor students and ensure that students of class 3 to class 10 have downloaded TSAT app on their smartphone and also submit a daily report. Before asking to implement such orders, the education department should first find out whether all students have access to smartphones or not. It would be better if the state continues to telecast lessons primarily through TV,” said K Ramana, president, Telangana Progressive Teachers Federation. He said that even for those students who have access to smartphones, data will be an issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-must-release-academic-calendar-schools-association/articleshow/83523590.cms||---

However, their luck ran out three hours later when police arrested two robbers and recovered the gold and cash. “We had a specific inputs on the route they took to flee and immediately informed Haryana police. At 6.30 pm, two of the four robbers were arrested. We have recovered the bags they had used to put the robbed cash and jewellery. We are bringing them to Churu and will check how much recovery has been made,” said Churu ASP Neeraj Pathak said. Sources said the robbers intimidated the staff and customers at gunpoint when they entered the branch and made their way to the chest. “After their entry, they pointed guns at the staff. After getting the keys of the chest, the robbers put all the available cash and gold in bags. Within some minutes, they managed to flee from the scene,” Churu SP Naran Lal Togas said.The robbers also locked some of the staff in the toilet before leaving the place. “In the complaint, the staff of the finance company said nearly Rs 8.92 lakh cash and nearly 17kg gold in the form of ornaments was robbed by the robbers,” said Togas. “All of them came in two bikes and fled towards Haryana.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Staff jabbed, malls set to reopen after 45-day break||KOLKATA: Operators at the 13 shopping malls in Kolkata and Howrah have sanitized their establishments and vaccinated their staff, all set to resume operations. But, they said, functioning with 25% of their total staff, as prescribed by the government, could prove to be a challenge since every individual had a specific role to perform that was not interchangeable. The other point of concern was the absence of public transport for the retail staff to commute to and from the malls. In the notification issued by the government on Monday, retail outlets in malls have been allowed to function from 11am to 6pm with 25% staff deployment, while restaurants inside malls have been allowed to be open till 8pm. All malls have been instructed to ensure only 30% of capacity footfall. The overall mood was buoyant and the vibes were positive over the restart of operations after being shut for a month-and-a-half. Only hypermarkets, like Spencer’s within malls, have been open. Last year, during the lockdown, malls were shut for two and a half moths between mid-March and June 7. Welcoming the government’s decision, Shopping Centre Association of India chairman (eastern region) Sushil Mohta said it was a progressive move and that malls were ready to abide by all Covid-safety protocols to ensure the facilities remained safe for customers and employees. Requesting the government to extend the mall timing till 8pm so that it could shut along with the restaurants inside, he also flagged concerns about restricted staff strength and their commute problems. “We recognise the challenge in opening up the economy and appreciate the measured approach the government has taken. The critical operational staff and nearly three-fourths of retail staff in all malls have been vaccinated. We will seek clarification on the 25% staff deployment and urge the government to enforce a 30% cap. We will also urge the government to allow app cabs and Metro to ply so that people can commute in reduced numbers,” said Mohta. Some restaurant owners, too, said it would be challenging as dining in Kolkata begins around 8.30pm and lunch is not a revenue-driver on weekdays. The operations head of all malls said 90%-100% of critical operations staff, including those in security, housekeeping and engineering departments, and 70%-80% of retail staff had been vaccinated. “As we start operations, only those who have received at least one dose of the vaccine will be deployed,” said South City mall vice-president Manmohan Singh. Among the 13 malls, at least three— Quest, Acropolis and Forum Rangoli (Belur) — will also have vaccination centres, where visitors can take a shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/staff-jabbed-malls-set-to-reopen-after-45-day-break/articleshow/83523848.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad scores the infamous ‘fuel ton’||HYDERABAD: With petrol price touching the three-figure mark, Hyderabad joined the other cities which scored the infamous ‘fuel ton’. Petrol on Monday sold at Rs 100.20 per litre while diesel, presently being sold at Rs 95.14 per litre, is fast approaching the century mark. Perturbed by this steep rise that is burning their pockets, many are lashing out at the BJP government at the Centre and the TRS establishment in the state. People got a minor relief when the fuel prices remained mostly stagnant during the Assembly elections in five states in April. Thereafter, the prices were increased almost every day. Several fuel outlet owners blame this hike on the volatile international crude market. The dealers also complain about the slump in sales during the lockdowns. “Pandemic and black fungus cases affected both consumption and supply. Sales have dipped owing to partial lockdown, which is in force in Telangana for the last one month. On the supply side, international crude market is affected by political and economic problems,” said a dealer, who is maintaining an outlet for the last two decades in Secunderabad. Consumers are bearing the brunt of this price rise. “We have to cut down our travel and look for other means. How can we surive as the prices of many products will increase with the steep hike in fuel,” said Ravindra, a resident of Uttam Nagar Colony.  Several auto drivers told TOI that their lives have turned from bad to worse due to the lockdowns and continuous increase of fuel prices. The auto drivers association urged the Telangana government to increase the fares from Rs 20 to Rs 30 per litre as it is difficult for them to make a living with a continuous rise in fuel prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-scores-the-infamous-fuel-ton/articleshow/83523591.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Mumbai||Mumbai got 70% of its June rain in just 5 days, BMC on toes||MUMBAI: After a week-long wet spell last week, the city is likely to experience only light rain activity over the next two days. The IMD has, however, forecast that rains may pick pace again from June 17, with heavy rains likely at isolated places in Mumbai and adjoining areas like Thane and Palghar. Also, Anticipating heavy rainfall in the days ahead and increasing probability of landslides, the BMC has asked residents at 10 locations in S ward, covering Bhandup, Powai and Vikhroli areas, to evacuate and move to safer places. With heavy rain in the first fortnight of June, the IMD’s Santacruz observatory recorded 719.3 mm of rain, which is way above its average rainfall of 505mm for the entire month. But more specifically, the five-day period between June 8 and 12 saw extreme rain activity, accounting for nearly 70% of June’s rainfall.  June 9 was also officially the first day of monsoons in Mumbai, coming two days ahead of its official onset date.  Shubhangi Bhute, IMD scientist, said rain activity will increase from Thursday owing to an active offshore trough in the Arabian Sea. But despite the heavy spell last week, the lakes supplying water to Mumbai have not recorded any significant rise in their levels. The total water stock in the seven lakes in the city stands at 1.86 lakh million litres or 12.85% of the total required stocks.Last year too, the total stock on the same date was around 1.82 lakh million litres. The lakes need to have over 14 lakh million litres of water till the end of monsoons for the city to go without a water cut. Meanwhile, the BMC warned citizens about flooding of nullahs and landslides in hill areas due to heavy rain, and made it clear that residents living in illegal structures prone to crashing during monsoon will have to evacuate on their own. BMC officials said residents have been asked to move out from areas like Suryanagar in Vikhroli (West), Indiranagar at Powai, Gautam Nagar, Paspoli, Jaybhim Nagar and Gautam Nagar. Residents of Ramabai Ambedkar Nagar Part 1 & 2 in Bhandup West, Nardas Nagar, Gaondevi Hill, Gavdevi Marg, among others, have also been asked to move out. BMC said residents continuing to live in these areas without relocating will do so at their own risk. “The BMC administration will not be held responsible in case of any accident or loss of life or property due to a natural calamity,” said senior civic official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-got-70-of-its-june-rain-in-just-5-days-bmc-on-toes/articleshow/83525986.cms||Richa Pinto

During the lockdown, footfall had dropped to around 20,000 passengers per day. Similarly, the frequency of trains is also increasing with a number of trains, which had been temporarily suspended due to low occupancy, being restored. A source at the airport said: “People are travelling once again to perhaps go back to their places of work. Some may even be travelling for business. Passenger footfall is currently around 40,000, which can be handled by Terminal-3 alone.” At one point earlier in the year, daily passenger footfall was over 1.1 lakh passengers . An airport official said around 500 flight movements per day were taking place of late. Prior to the pandemic, the airport operated over 1,400 flight each day. Northern Railway had resumed the sale of platform tickets at eight Delhi stations earlier this week, however, the price of a platform ticket has been increased to Rs 30 to ensure overcrowding does not take place. On Monday, it announced the resumption of a few trains, including the New Delhi-Habibganj Shatabdi Express and the Pathankot – Joginder Nagar special, while an additional stoppage has been added to the Pathankot-Baijnath Paprola special. On Tuesday, the trains restored included the Udaipur City to Delhi Sarai Rohilla special, Bikaner-Delhi Sarai Rohilla special and the Jodhpur-Delhi Sarai Rohilla special among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/footfall-up-at-airport-several-trains-resume/articleshow/83558242.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Through “Youth for Education” initiative, young people aged below 30 years will be providing career guidance to the children in future. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said, “When we look at how education is imparted in high-performing nations abroad, we see that the practice of one-to- one marking is used. Our Delhi government school teachers who visited Finland or Cambridge University mentioned the same. One-to-one mapping of each child and understanding their individual profiles were commended by our teachers but they expressed concerns regarding the scale in Delhi. We know that catering to 16 lakh government school students is a challenge, but we have made this challenge an advantage for us by introducing innovative programmes that will build the community into a school.” “Mentors can guide our school students and help them in building their careers,” added Sisodia. The programme has been piloted in 46 schools of east and south-east Delhi areas with the help of 4,000 mentors. Through another programme, the government plans to bridge the gap of communication between children, parents and schools by building a network of school management committee members and “School Mitras.” “Through this programme, better connectivity can be made through the channels of our SMC parents involved in school and community activities,” said Sisodia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-lakh-youths-to-mentor-govt-school-students-says-sisodia/articleshow/83523661.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Land auction: Kisan Congress flags concerns||Hyderabad: The state unit of the All India Kisan Congress on Monday raised concerns over the category of lands the TRS government is planning to auction to mop up revenues. “The TRS government has been acquiring agricultural and assigned lands from the farmers, SCs/STs and other people, in the name of public purpose. The state should immediately stop its preparations to auction land and order a comprehensive survey of government land available in the state and make the data public,” said M Kodanda Reddy, vice-president of the All India Kisan Congress. In a letter to chief secretary Somesh Kumar on Monday, Kodanda Reddy along with Kisan Congress state president Anvesh Reddy termed as ridiculous the state government’s justification that one of the reasons for planning to auction government land is to prevent encroachments. “The government can raise revenues through other means. Sale of government land is not acceptable as the government is custodian of public land and not an absolute owner of it,” Kodanda Reddy stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/land-auction-kisan-congress-flags-concerns/articleshow/83523605.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Chinese national held in Malda linked to fraud in Hyderabad?||HYDERABAD: Telangana police are verifying the involvement of an alleged Chinese spy arrested on the India-Bangladesh border in an investment fraud case registered in the city. Police are also verifying about his claim of visiting Hyderabad in 2010 and his association with a company registered in Pahadisharif. Chinese national Han Junwei was caught by Border Security Force (BSF) in Malda district of West Bengal on June 10 while he was trying to illegally cross the border from Bangladesh. According to police, the arrest was made based on information provided by Han’s associate Sun Jiang, who was arrested by Lucknow Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS). Currently, Han is in police custody of Kaliachak police of West Bengal. During questioning, Han confessed to cops that he was operating a hotel at DLF Phase-3, Gurugram. He also confessed to have visited India six times so far, including once to Hyderabad in 2010. During the subsequent probe, police realised that one of the directors of the hotel in Gurugram was also a director in a company registered in Pahadisharif and another company registered in Vashi, Navi Mumbai. Han Junwei is also a director in those two private companies. Rachakonda police along with state intelligence sleuths were verifying details of the company. Meanwhile, cyber crime sleuths of Hyderabad and Cyberabad were checking if Han Junwei was related to Power Bank money investment fraud. Delhi police had recently arrested a gang linked to the fraud amounting to Rs 150 crore and one case was also registered in the city based on the complaint of a group of victims. “By promising to provide exorbitant interest on the principal, the accused lure victims by paying promptly when the investment is small. Later, once the victim invests lakhs of rupees, the fraudster block his access to Power Bank investment app,” assistant commissioner of police (ACP), cyber crime KVM Prasad said. Police had registered one case where a group of victims lost over Rs 10 lakh. Hyderabad police along with their Cyberabad counterparts were gathering details about Han’s activities in the country, including possible involvement in investment frauds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chinese-natl-held-in-malda-linked-to-fraud-in-city/articleshow/83523638.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Based on a complaint of A Venkateshwarulu, 37, a mason from KPHB Colony on June 11, KPHB police registered a theft case under Section 380 of the IPC and launched a probe. Venkateshwarulu alleged that when he and his family members slept in the house leaving the main door open, unknown persons entered the house and stole gold ornaments and cash from their almirah. The incident came to light at 5am on June 11 when Venkateshwarulu woke up to get ready for work. When he went towards the almairah to pick up a fresh pair of clothes, he found the almairah door open. “The valuables in the almirah were missing,” the complainant alleged. During the investigation, police analysed CCTV camera footage near the crime scene and identified the accused, U Raj Kumar, 19. Police arrested him on Monday from his house in Sai Charan Colony of Shamshiguda in Kukatpally and recovered Rs 2.5 lakh worth gold.

---||Hyderabad||Harish: Cong, BJP govts started land auctions, opposition to move ridiculous||Hyderabad: Finance minister T Harish Rao said the trend of selling government land and properties was started by Congress and BJP and termed Congress opposing land auctions as ridiculous. He said the TRS government had clearly said that it is going to mobilise funds during the pandemic by selling unutilised government land in a transparent manner. “Former chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy, K Rosaiah and N Kiran Kumar Reddy were responsible for sale of 88,500 acres of government land in the state,” Harish Rao said at a press conference in Sangareddy on Monday. He said Telangana Congress leaders were silent when he opposed sale of prime government land in Hyderabad as a TRS MLA and diversion of funds to Andhra and Rayalaseema regions. “Now, the same leaders are resorting to Goebbels propaganda on the issue,” he said. It is ridiculous Congress floor leader Bhatti Vikramarka and other leaders are raising voice against land auctions and threatening to take back such land if Congress comes to power, the minister said. He said the government is selling away only unutilised government land as the state’s revenues took a beating due to Covid-19 and lockdown. “The entire land auction amount would be utilised for the welfare of the people. The opposition parties are always trying to stall welfare schemes in the state,” Harish Rao said. Harish Rao launched survey works of Sangameshwara lift irrigation project works at Lingampally in Munipalle mandal in Sangareddy district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/harish-cong-bjp-govts-started-land-auctions-opposition-to-move-ridiculous/articleshow/83523675.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Delhi||Delhi’s one nation-one ration card implementation woeful: Centre in SC||New Delhi: The Union government told the Supreme Court on Monday that Delhi government's lackadaisical implementation of the one nation-one ration card scheme had deprived a huge population of migrant workers of their rightful foodgrain under the National Food Security Act in contrast to most states that had implemented the scheme to deliver free ration to the poor. In its affidavit, the Centre said the Kejriwal government's "claim regarding launch of one nation-one ration card plan in the National Capital Territory of Delhi was misleading" as it was "implemented only in circle 63-Seemapuri". Delhi government had suspended e-PoS (electronic point of sale) biometric authentication at fair price shops (FPS) in 2018 citing technical glitches and started it on a pilot basis in Seemapuri in April. The Centre said though 2,000 ePoS machines were supplied to Delhi government for use in all circles, the AAP government was not able to implement the one nation-one ration card scheme that would have ensured free dry ration to migrant workers, from any state, under the NFSA. The scheme is intended to allow individuals and families to draw ration in states other than where they are registered under the PDS. "Only a handful of transactions conducted in a single circle with about 42 e-PoS machines cannot be considered implementation of one nation-one ration card scheme. Further, unless national portability transactions are rolled out formally in all FPSs of all circles of NCT Delhi, in which more than 2,000 e-PoS machines have been supplied and are waiting for operation, it cannot be considered implementation of one nation-one ration card scheme," the Centre said. A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M R Shah had taken serious note of non-implementation of the scheme by states and had ordered the four delinquents — West Bengal, Delhi, Assam and Chhattisgarh — that there could be no exception in implementation of the scheme. To rub it in, the Centre said, "It is pertinent to appreciate that a very large number of inter-state migrants are present all across Delhi (such as migrant workers, numerous street dwellers, rag-pickers, migratory labourers, construction workers, rickshaw pullers, auto/taxi drivers) who do not have access to their NFSA foodgrain, being away from their villages and hometowns. They are not able to take the benefit of their quota of subsidised NFSA foodgrain in Delhi — as there is no full implementation of one nation-one ration card scheme and reporting of such transactions or distribution details of NFSA/Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana foodgrain on central portals/dashboards." Delhi government said it was in the process of formulating a scheme of dry ration under NFSA — 5 kg foodgrain (4 kg wheat and 1 kg rice) — per person free of cost to needy people who do not possess ration cards, including unorganised workers, migrant workers, building and construction workers. It said the Delhi cabinet on May 25 decided that dry ration under non-PDS be provided at the same entitlement as NFSA free of cost to needy people who don’t possess ration cards from a school identified in each municipal ward. Sources in the food and public distribution department in the Union government told TOI that after continuous persuasion, Delhi government had assured full implementation of the scheme through e-PoS machines in the last quarter of 2020 but it implemented the scheme only in Seemapuri in April. The Union government, in its written submissions, told the SC, "Despite the multitude of Covid-19 related challenges in the past year, 32 states and UTs covering around 69 crore NFSA beneficiaries, ie 86% NFSA population in the country, were swiftly brought under the one nation-one ration card plan by December 2020."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhis-one-nation-one-ration-card-implementation-woeful-centre-in-sc/articleshow/83523705.cms||---
---||Delhi||Curbs on reopening of bars to stay: Delhi govt||New Delhi: Delhi government has clarified that, while liquor vends were allowed to open as part of the gradual unlock process, the restrictions on reopening of bars remain. An order issued by the office of the commissioner excise, Delhi government, on Monday stated that directions for opening of liquor vends and bounded warehouses were issued through an order on June 6. The fresh order makes two clarifications in pursuance of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) order issued on June 13. “All liquor shops/vends in malls, market complexes and markets (outside containment zone) are allowed to operate between 10am and 8pm,” the order stated, adding that, “Bars in the hotels, clubs and restaurants are not allowed to operate till further orders.” The order has been signed by Ajay Kumar Gambhir, assistant commissioner (Excise). Although DDMA order issued on Sunday separately mentioned bars in hotels, clubs or restaurants in the list of prohibited activities or activities that shall be permitted with restrictions, it very clearly stated that no consumption of liquor, pan, gutka, tobacco etc. in all restaurants, shops, malls, markets, among other places, should take place as part of ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/curbs-on-reopening-of-bars-to-stay-delhi-govt/articleshow/83558311.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Night parties: Hyderabad cops to write to techies’ bosses||HYDERABAD: The techies who were caught partying the night away at a farmhouse in Kadthal on the outskirts of Hyderabad on Saturday are in for another rude shock. Cyberabad police has decided to write letters to the employers of the party animals about the case registered against the employees for breaking lockdown rules. This will perhaps be the first time that employers will be informed about lockdown violation. As many as 68 people were booked by the police for the party. Among them, 60 were IT professionals. They were partying at the farmhouse well after the 6 pm curfew. “Since they had blatantly violated all the lockdown norms, a decision was taken that the accused’s employers should be informed about the case being registered,’’ deputy commissioner of police (Shamshabad zone) Prakash Reddy said. Police officials said the farmhouse was built recently and it has no permission from any of the authorities. The officers are requesting the tehsildar’s office to seal the farmhouse. The organizer of party illegally served liquor, arranged dancing facilities and stay at the venue. Officials added that they may make informing employers a norm if they come across more people violating lockdown rules at parties. Writing letters to employers, however, is not new for the Cyberabad police. They have been writing such letters when people are caught driving in a drunken state and have caused an accident. A senior police official said that they have continued with this norm. Now, if a drunk driver is found on the road during curfew, he is booked for lockdown violation apart from other laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/night-parties-cops-to-write-to-techies-bosses/articleshow/83523667.cms||Srinath Vudali
---||Mumbai||‘States should check ICMR portal, track those testing +ve via home kits’||PUNE: All states should check the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal to tra-ck and treat people testing positive via home Covid test kits, officials from the research body said. They were responding to concerns that states were missing out on cases testing positive via home test kits. MyLab’s Coviself—a home-based rapid antigen kit—hit pharmacies last week. The rapid test kit requires a nasal swab sample to provide test results within 15 minutes. State health officials said the data from the rapid kits is key as the five-level unlock process relies on testing information and positivity rates. ICMR officials said the home-based test kits are linked to the ICMR portal via software and states can access patient data—including home address—from the website. “All states have user credentials to access the ICMR test portal. They have to access the portal to update their data. The data can be found under home-based test kits. Officials can check for data from their respective states and local authorities can then contact the person who has tested positive,” a senior ICMR official said. After Coviself, two more home testing kits—PanBio and Covifind—are expected to hit the market soon. “All these home test kits will be linked to the ICMR portal, which will have data of positive patients and number of tests,” the ICMR official added. State health officials have raised concerns about tracking those testing positive via home kits bought over the counter. “All purchases of home kits should be strictly monitored. There should also be a mechanism that ensures local authorities, and not a centralised portal, are first alerted about a positive case,” a state official said. Representatives from Mylab, which makes Coviself, said local authorities in Pune have been able to reach out to people testing positive. “The system is in place and will be fortified further,” a Mylab official said. According to company officials about 30 lakh Coviself kits have been distributed to pharmacies and drug stores nationwide. The volume will be scaled up, they said. “We are ready with a capacity of 1 crore per week. We will react to market demand,” said a Mylab official. The firm’s MD, Hasmukh Rawal, said they plan to improve reach in rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-states-should-check-icmr-portal-track-those-testing-ve-via-home-kits/articleshow/83524443.cms||Nisha Nambiar

A senior police officer said the GFSL’s report was awaited and exuded confidence that the hacker would be traced soon after they analyse the report. Last October, Kavlekar had complained to the cyber crime cell that his cell phone had been hacked and an obscene video had been posted on a social media platform from it. In his complaint, he had claimed that some miscreants had sent a video containing such material to a WhatsApp group named, ‘Villages of Goa’. “The said video was sent to this aforementioned WhatsApp group where I am a member and it was intentionally masked in my name with criminal intention. It may be noted that the message was sent only to this group, out of the many WhatsApp groups where I am a member. Also, the time when this message was sent, I was nowhere near the phone. I was fast asleep,” he had stated. Congress had filed a complaint at the Panaji police station against Kavalekar for posting an obscene video on a WhatsApp group. The party demanded that an FIR be registered against him under relevant sections of the IPC and IT Act. “The said video posted by Kavlekar is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest and has effect as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who have seen the said video,” the complaint had stated. Later, Panaji police transferred the case to the crime branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cyber-crime-cell-sends-dy-cms-phone-for-analysis-in-2020-hacking-case/articleshow/83525783.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Ayodhya: Ram temple trust junks claim of irregularities in land deal||AYODHYA: The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra has dismissed as politically motivated and misleading allegations of irregularities regarding a land deal for the extension of the premises of the proposed temple. Issuing a written statement late on Sunday night, a few hours after AAP MP Sanjay Singh and former SP MLA Pawan Pandey levelled the allegations that the trust bought 12,000 square metre land valued at Rs 2 crore for Rs 18.5 crore, the trust general secretary Champat Rai said the rates of the land in Ayodhya shot up manifolds after the November 9, 2019 Ram Temple verdict of the Supreme Court. “The individual who sold the land to the Temple Trust had entered into an agreement with the former owner in 2017 to purchase the land for Rs 2 crore. After the SC order, the agreement between them was registered and the land was sold to the Trust at a higher rate, which was much below the market rate,” Rai said. “The present rate of the land in question is approximately Rs 5,000 per square feet. So, for the 12000 square meter, it’s price is around Rs 60 crore,” another trust member said, adding “Even with a Rs 18.5-crore deal, the trust is in profit.” Local property dealers confirmed to TOI that the price of the land in railway station area (where the land is situated) is between Rs 4,000 and Rs 5,000. In 2017, the original owners of the land - Kusum Pathak and Harish Kumar Pathak alias Baba Haridas - entered into an agreement with Sultan Ansari, Ravi Mohan Tewari and others to sell the said land for Rs 2 cr. Thereafter, Rs 92 lakh was paid to the Pathaks. This agreement continued for the next three years during which the Trust approached Ansari and Tewari for the purchase of the land. But without a formal registry with Pathaks, the two were yet to become owners of the land. So, on March 18, 2021, this agreement was cancelled and a formal registry was executed between the two parties after which Ansari and Tewari became the owner of the land. Thereafter they sold off the land to the Ram Temple Trust for around Rs 18 cr. “Although both the registries were done the same day, the deal between the trust and Ansari-Tewari duo had been finalised much earlier,” said a trust member. “The Rs 2-crore registry of land was done four years ago, when the temple town would remain under the shadow of communal strife for most part of the year and nobody would want to invest here,” he said, “but after the Supreme Court’s decision in favor of the Ram temple a year and a half ago, the price of land here has increased by more than 20 times,” the member said. “The AAP MP and former SP MLA, however, didn’t deliberately mention about the 2017 agreement,” he added. Late on Sunday night, the trust sent a report comparing the market value of the land it had purchased and the price it actually paid, to the trustees. The trust also announced that no matter how expensive the land is, it would be purchased for expansion of Ram Temple premises. “The trust is trying to make the temple premises safe and convenient for devotees,” Rai said in a series of tweets. Tweeting about the land in question, he said the present owner had agreement with different people in different times -- 2011, 2017 and 2017. “When the trust found this land suitable, the owner was approached and a rate of Rs 1,423 per sq ft was fixed, which is below market rate,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/temple-trust-junks-claim-of-irregularities-in-land-deal/articleshow/83525691.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Goa||Goa: Five-year exercise nod for shack business, but operators in a fix||PANAJI: Shack operators henceforth will not be required to obtain an excise licence afresh at the opening of every season. The government has extended the validity of such licenses issued to shacks to five seasons, counted from October to May. Shack operators have been making this demand for the past several years. While the announcement has come as a huge relief to the shack operators as they will not be required to run from pillar to post at the start of every tourist season to secure the excise permission, the development has put them in a quandary. The validity of the license issued by the tourism department to an allottee - to set up a shack on the beach - is three years, while private shacks are erected in private spaces beyond the boundary of the beach. The allotment process has been clearly stipulated under the three-year beach shack policy. The shacks are allotted through a draw of lots, entailing different operators, and those who fulfill the eligibility criteria get a chance to operate a beach shack. “Term of the licence issued by us (tourism department) to an allottee to set up a beach shack is three years, so the excise licence of five years will not hold good. When fresh allotment of beach shacks is done on the conclusion of three years, it is not necessary that the same (old allottees) people will be allotted shacks,” a tourism official said. The notification issued by the finance department, he said, will need to be corrected, as the order will create a confusion. A licence, whether excise or for setting up a beach shack, is not transferable. On the other hand, the primary authority to issue a permit to a private shack is a local body, which is issued at the beginning of the season, though clearance by Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) is also mandatory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/5-year-excise-nod-for-shack-biz-but-operators-in-a-fix/articleshow/83525717.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Ayodhya mosque trust’s bid to get foreign funds||LUCKNOW: The Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) Trust, which is at the helm of the Dhannipur project in Ayodhya district developing a hospital, mosque, museum and community kitchen, submitted its application for Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) account at Delhi based State Bank of India (SBI) bank on Monday. Once approved, the account will pave the way for foreign funding to the project which will also have a 300-bed hospital in the area. The IICF will also not be crowdfunding for the entire project, but will gather funds from identified donors. Subsequently, the mosque that will come up as part of the complex, will be “almost the same size” as that of the Babri Masjid. “The 300-bed hospital is IICF’s main goal and while we had envisioned the need for it back in 2020 itself, covid-19 has just made our resolve stronger. Almost 95% of our project cost and infrastructure paraphernalia is for the hospital only,” IICF spokesperson Athar Husain told TOI. After the FCRA account is registered in IICF’s name, the Trust will then move ahead to get clearances from the Ministry of Home Affairs, as is the norm, before the project can begin on ground. However, officials said that all said and done, the project will kick off on ground by year end. The hospital will also come with a community kitchen to feed around 1,000 people everyday, a green patch with exotic trees on the verge of extinction from around the world in Ayodhya, and a museum-library highlighting the shared Hindu-Muslim struggle of 1857 in Awadh against the British. “There will not be crowdfunding. We have donors already waiting,” said Husain, stating that the five acres of land allotted by the Supreme Court in Dhannipur was unexpected and while there was no preplanned thought for the project, unlike the Ram Temple, things are moving smoothly. “We are looking for experts skilled in setting up charitable hospitals and they will be involved in setting up the hospital from the scratch, like a turn-key project. For this we have identified some groups in the Gulf countries and in Mumbai but more discussions have to be held physically before we put a stamp on it,” added Husain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-mosque-trusts-bid-to-get-foreign-funds/articleshow/83525714.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Delhi||Delhi: Driving test for DL resumes, but slots restricted to half||NEW DELHI: Driving skill tests for those seeking a permanent driving licence resumed from Monday, after being closed for 55 days, but the slots have been restricted to 50% of the usual available slots to ensure social distancing. Also, applicants can choose any automated driving test track centre for the test, irrespective of which regional transport office (RTO) they got their learner’s licence from. “There were not as many applicants at the test tracks like usual, but the numbers are set to increase as tests were not conducted during the lockdown,” a transport department official said. “At present, however, only 50% of the slots will be available for online booking and even out of these, half the slots will be reserved for those applicants who got an appointment during the lockdown and are being given first priority for a rescheduled appointment,” he said. While booking an appointment for a test online, an applicant is able to choose from the available slots of all the zones to finalise any automated driving test track centre where they want to appear for their driving skill test. Most of the 13 RTOs of Delhi have an automated driving test track in the office complex or nearby and in some cases, two RTOs share the same track. A standard operating procedure for conducting the driving skill test has also been prepared for the safety of officials and applicants. “We are not issuing any learner’s licence at the moment though, as the department is working on tweaking the existing software to allow online tests for applicants. The system will be in place very soon and the priority right now is to carry out tests that have been pending for nearly two months,” he said. “Also, all important services provided at RTOs are now available online as part of ‘faceless services’ and only in an exceptional case someone will need to visit an RTO at all. The RTOs will ‘shrink’ with only the test tracks remaining to carry out the driving skill test for a permanent driving licence,” he said. From February 18, 2021, the transport department has been providing 12 of its most transaction-heavy services completely online and as part of the next phase of its faceless services, learner’s e-licence will also be provided. Applicants will first have to register on the department’s website and get an appointment to take the test. An online tutorial will be available, which they have to go through before the test. The 10-minute learner’s licence test has objective type questions and the applicant needs to score at least six out of 10 marks. Following this, a colour blindness test will also be carried out online and once the applicant clears that, an e-licence will be issued. The department’s website will have a dedicated web link for the e-licence service and all information regarding fees, minimum age, eligibility, necessary documents, etc., will be available on the website, apart from frequently asked questions and a question bank, with quizzes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/driving-test-for-dl-resumes-but-slots-restricted-to-half/articleshow/83523818.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Goa||Goa: Matruchayya ashram opens its doors to those orphaned by the pandemic||MARGAO: The Supreme Court, on May 28, had ordered district authorities across the country to immediately fan out and identify children in need of care, and provide them with basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter. Two months earlier in Dhavali, Ponda, Subhash Bhosale, pramukh of the Matruchaya Balika Kalyan Ashram, knew this was coming when 45 of its inmates tested positive for Covid-19, following which the premises was notified as a micro-containment zone on March 21. By the time the zone was denotified 41 days later, Bhosale mooted the proposal of throwing open its doors for children orphaned by the pandemic — an idea that received wholehearted approval and support from its trustees and management. Matruchayya has now appealed to people to identify children who have lost both parents, or families who have lost livelihoods owing to the pandemic. “We at Matruchaya are always ready to give a normal childhood to destitute, orphans and children whose parents cannot afford to take care of them due to genuine reasons,” said Bhosale. “Matruchhaya also lets parents take their children back home once their economic condition improves. Matruchhaya is a social organisation dedicated to the service of orphaned, destitute and abandoned children. It has three child protection homes — Matruchhaya Balika Kalyan Ashram, Dhavali, Bala Kalyan Ashram, Talaulim, and Balika Kalyan Ashram, Margao — which together house 110 children. Chairman of the trust Shrinivas Dempo said that the endeavour would focus on providing succour to children in cases where the pandemic has left them distraught. “Matruchaya has, over the years, been raising children with the right kind of traditional Indian values like respect to elders, discipline, etc,” Dempo told TOI. “We have seen that during the pandemic, many children lost their parents, grandparents, etc, and the entire family fabric got destroyed. As we already had a structure in place, we thought this was the right time for Matruchhaya to step in.” Expressing his appreciation for Matruchaya’s team, Dempo said, “Apart from finances required to support such a task, the biggest challenge lies in raising them on Indian values.” During the Covid-19 pandemic from March 2020 to May 2021, Bhosale told TOI that seven children were placed in adoption with the help and cooperation from the the state government’s child welfare committee (CWC). Matruchaya now plans to shift the Balika Kalyan Ashram, Dhavali, to a spacious premises 2km away, the construction of which is under way. This will facilitate more admissions, as the accommodation capacity could go up to 70 from the current 45. Bhosale, a professor in zoology at PES college, Farmagudi, and who has been offering voluntary services at the Matruchaya, said that the organisation meets its financial requirements largely through donations. Since its inception in 1976, Matruchhaya has given 800 children for adoption. Retired professor Madhukar Dixit, a founder-member of Matruchaya, said that the latest idea of admitting children orphaned by the pandemic was a testimony to the fact that the organisation, true to its name, has always been in the forefront providing the “warmth of maternal love” to children who have been deprived of it by a cruel turn of fate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/matruchayya-opens-its-doors-to-those-orphaned-by-the-pandemic/articleshow/83525701.cms||Govind Kamat Maad
---||Lucknow||Date gone awry: Boyfriend, aides stabbed BSc student||LUCKNOW: A date with her friend claimed the life of a first year BSc student whose body was recovered from a forest cover in Sarojininagar on Saturday night. Three youths, including the deceased’s friend, Mohammed Kaif of Sarojininagar, have been arrested in this connection. Besides, Kaif’s aides Akash Yadav and Vishal Kashyap were also arrested. The police have recovered a knife which the accused used in stabbing the victim. There were 24 stab wounds on the girl’s body, police said. DCP, central, Somen Barma said Kaif lured the girl to move with him on the fateful day. As the girl's father was not at home and her mother had gone to their native house in Sitapur, the girl readily accepted the offer. “Kaif told the police that his friends came to know about his meeting with the girl because when he was talking to her on phone on Saturday evening they were with him and all of them were drinking ‘tadi’. As per plan, Kaif used the bike of Vishal’s brother to reach the forest cover in Gahru village along with his friends. After dropping his friends there he went to SIL crossing to pick up the girl and then moved towards the spot where his friends were waiting for them. When Kaif along with the girl reached the spot they all overpowered her and tried to rape her,” said Barma. As per Kaif’s confession the girl was shell-shocked at the turn of events and she threatened to lodge a complaint with police against them, the officer said and added that the girl somehow managed to get out of their clutches and started running for her life. The accused gave her a chase and caught her at the place from where her body was recovered. Kaif told police that he and Akash pinned her down again and Vishal stabbed her several times, killing her on the spot, the police officer said.

Needing a point to finish third and seal a direct spot, India were gifted a goal by the Afghanistan goalkeeper as the teams finished 1-1 at the Jassim bin Hamad Stadium in Doha on Tuesday. India were far from their best against the sturdy Afghans but found themselves ahead in the 75th minute when Ashique Kuruniyan’s harmless cross was lobbed inside his own goal by goalkeeper Ovays Azizi, a semi-professional footballer who also works as an occupational therapist. A point behind India, Afghanistan now needed two goals in the last 15 minutes to grab full points and surge ahead. They pushed harder and got the equaliser in the 82nd minute through Hossein Zamani, the 18-year-old who spent his formative years at the Ajax Academy and represented Netherlands at the youth level. The next dozen-odd minutes, including those in added time, were concerning for India. They couldn’t afford any more slipups, and thankfully goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu displayed a safer pair of hands, nullifying threats largely from free-kicks with assured collections. Coach Igor Stimac made two changes from the team that put it across Bangladesh in the previous game. Rahul Bheke, back from suspension, returned at right-back, while Kuruniyan got the nod ahead of Bipin Singh. India were decent in the first 30 minutes, winning three corner kicks in the first 10. Captain Sunil Chhetri even had a decent attempt on goal after Glan Martins had robbed the ball. As the match progressed, Afghanistan grew in confidence. A majority of the Afghanistan players ply their trade in lower leagues of Europe. Three from the starting 11 -- Masih Saighani, Haroon Amiri and M Sharif – are familiar names in Indian football. But it was Omid Popalzay who grabbed attention with his smart moves. India remained compact at the back. By the hour mark, Stimac pulled out Brandon Fernandes, and with 20 minutes still left on the clock, Chhetri had to make way for Liston Colaco. With two of the most dangerous attacking players now on the bench, how would India get an opening? It came from the unlikeliest of quarters: the rival goalkeeper. As Ashique whipped in a cross from the left, it looked like simple collection for Azizi. He had three of his own players around him, while Liston was on the floor. However, instead of holding the ball, he simply bounced it into his own net. Afghanistan watched in horror. India said, ‘thank you very much’, never mind the equaliser they conceded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/afghanistan-keeper-gifts-india-a-decisive-goal/articleshow/83555964.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Hyderabad||Aerosol particles triggered by H2So4 pollute Hyd skies||Hyderabad: Researchers from the University of Hyderabad have found minute aerosol particles in the atmosphere of Hyderabad that could pose risk to human, animal and plant health. These particles, which are less than three nanometres in size, are triggered by sulphuric acid pollution and can have a long-term impact on the local climate. Aerosols are tiny solid or liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere.. According to the UoH team, observation of sub-3 nm (less than three nanometre) particles are scarce globally, particularly in India. The team presented a direct observational evidence of sub-3 nm particles in Hyderabad. The aerosol particles over Hyderabad ranged from 1.2 to 3 nm and from 10 to 514 nm. The team found frequent formation of sub-3 nm neutral aerosols in the city atmosphere. "This has critical importance as a major fraction of these newly-formed particles can reach sizes of cloud condensation nuclei where they have climatic impacts," says the report in the scientific journal, Atmospheric Environment. This is the first ever direct observation-based evidence of sub-3 nm aerosol particles in India. The formation of sub-3 nm particles occurred on about 63.9% of the total observation days in the city. Researchers comprising Dr Vijay Kanawade and Mathew Sebastian measured neutral sub-3 nm particle concentrations over Hyderabad and reported the formation rate of small molecular clusters, for the first time, in sub-3 nm size regime, where aerosol nucleation triggers. Dr Jeff Pierce from Colorado State University, USA, was also part of the research team, which showed that a pool of sub-3 nm particles is often present in the atmosphere, but how fast these clusters grow depends on various factors. "The formation of small molecular clusters of sub-3 nm and their subsequent growth to the large sizes is called atmospheric new particle formation (NPF). NPF occurs everywhere in the terrestrial troposphere, and therefore it is a large source of aerosol numbers to the atmosphere. Though extensively studied globally using field observations, laboratory experiments and modelling approach, it is largely unexplored in India," the researchers said. The team found a strong positive correlation between sub-3nm particle concentrations and sulphuric acid concentrations, confirming the potential role of sulfuric acid in the formation of sub-3 nm particles. While NPF often starts with sulphuric acid in the atmosphere, sulphuric acid alone fails to explain observed particle formation and growth rates in the atmosphere. Other vapours such as ammonia, amines and organics play a crucial role in the growth of newly formed particles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/aerosol-particles-triggered-by-h2so4-pollute-hyd-skies/articleshow/83523817.cms||Syed Akbar

While Monday's tally of new infections have been the lowest since April, the case mortality remained at 15%. A health officer said that perhaps may be due to adverse weather conditions, fewer people may have got themselves tested. Normally, the state conducts 3,000 to 4,000 swab tests a day, while throughout last week, daily cases were in the range of 300 to 400. Health minister Vishwajit Rane through his social media account said it is a great moment of relief that the daily positive cases are dropping. “My deepest gratitude to our doctors, nurses, frontline workers, and all the agencies and departments for their constant efforts in fighting the menace of Covid-19,” he said. With daily positive cases going downward, it is a moment of great relief. My deepest gratitude to our doctors, nurs… https://t.co/O6ZXOYqLkt— VishwajitRane (@visrane) 1623679874000Rane also thanked citizens for doing their bit and following the standard operating procedures (SOPs), but said people should not let the guard down and continue to take precautions. On Monday, of the nine deaths recorded, four deaths occured at the GMC, two were reported by South Goa district hospital and one died at a private hospital in North Goa. Two patients - an 80-year-old woman from Bandora and a 56-year-old Arambol – died within 24 hours of their admission. The day saw 36 hospitalisations, while nine patients were discharged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-infections-drop-to-lowest-since-april/articleshow/83525722.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: One lakh Covid tests during Kumbh fake, says probe report||HARIDWAR/ DEHRADUN: Just days after a preliminary probe by the Uttarakhand health department suggested that many of the four lakh Covid test results issued during the Kumbh festival in Haridwar were fake, a detailed investigation — running into 1,600 pages and accessed by TOI — has found that at least 1 lakh test reports were forged by a private agency. In one instance, a single phone number was used to register over 50 people while one antigen test kit (which has an exclusive number and is meant for single use) was shown to have tested 700 samples. “Addresses and names were fictional. Almost 530 samples were taken from ‘House Number 5’ in Haridwar. Is it possible for a house to have over 500 residents? Bizarre addresses have been given — House number 56 Aligarh, House number 76 Mumbai,” an official who is part of the investigation told TOI. The official added, “Phone numbers were fake too. People in Kanpur, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and 18 other locations shared the same phone number.” Kumbh Mela health officer Dr Arjun Singh Sengar told TOI, “The agency was supposed to submit the samples to two private labs. The labs are also under investigation.” According to health secretary Amit Negi, the investigation report has been forwarded to Haridwar district magistrate. “Several irregularities have been found. We will take action after receiving a detailed report from the DM in 15 days,” said Negi. Haridwar district magistrate C Ravishnkar said he was investigating the matter and pending payment of all agencies has been put on hold until further notice. The 200 sample collectors employed by the agency turned out to be students and data entry operators in Rajasthan, who had never been to Haridwar. “A sample collector has to be physically present to collect samples. When we contacted the sample collectors registered with the agency, we found 50% of them were residents of Rajasthan, many were students or data entry operators,” said an official. “One sample collector was someone enrolled in a skill development training programme at a government authorised centre in Hanumangarh (Rajasthan). Upon inquiry, he told us that he had never been to Kumbh. He said he had been given the data by his instructor who had asked him to upload it as part of his training,” according to the investigation report. According to officials, this is “just the tip of the iceberg” since eight more sample collection agencies were tasked to conduct tests by the state government after the high court directed Uttarakhand to carry out at least 50,000 tests daily during Kumbh. The festival was held from April 1 to 30 in Haridwar. The four lakh tests in this period were conducted by nine agencies and 22 private labs. Majority of these tests were antigen tests. The state department also conducted its own tests through government labs. Of the 1 lakh tests conducted by the agency under scanner, 177 were “Covid positive” — a positivity rate of only 0.18%. In contrast, the positivity rate in Haridwar in April went upto 10%. The scam came to light earlier this week after a Punjab-based man — who had not visited Kumbh— received a Covid-negative report on his phone from the Haridwar health department. He filed a complaint with the Indian Council of Medical Research which alerted the state authorities. The agency was paid Rs 350 per antigen test and higher for RT-PCR tests, which means the scam runs into crores. Test results by other agencies are also being probed now, said a health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/1-lakh-covid-tests-during-kumbh-fake-probe-report/articleshow/83521766.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Mumbai||Private hospitals outside Mumbai can’t give jabs here: I S Chahal||MUMBAI: BMC chief I S Chahal, in fresh orders issued on Monday, barred private hospitals located outside Mumbai to hold vaccination camps in the city. In case of an adverse event following immunization (AEFI), Chahal said, it would be difficult to shift the beneficiary to the hospital. “The patient may be gasping for breath till he reaches the hospital, which should not happen,” he added. The order also stated that BMC, state and private vaccination centres cannot have any political party hoardings, banners and posters on the premises. This directive comes in the wake of several politicians organising vaccination camps and even facilitating the same for large housing societies. The vaccination drive must not be politicised, Chahal said, therefore showcause notice will be served to errant private centre asking why their permission to give the jab should not be cancelled. “Earlier, ward level officers had been directed to pull down such banners at vaccination centres, but now we will ensure that a showcause notice is issued as well,” he said. Monday’s order also stated that the memorandum of understanding signed between a private vaccination centre and any workplace or housing society should have details like number of medical staff stationed at the vaccination site and ambulances in case of AEFI. Earlier, BMC’s detailed guidelines issued in the first week of May had also stated that private centres must have an anaphylaxis kit for management of AEFI and a basic life support ambulance for shifting beneficiaries, if required. —Richa Pinto||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pvt-hospitals-outside-city-cant-give-jabs-here-says-chahal/articleshow/83524437.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Rajkot||Probe reveals involvement of doctor and advocate: Rajkot cops||RAJKOT: The investigations in the suicide case of 60-year-old mahant Sadhu Jayramdas Bapu have revealed involvement of two more accused — a doctor and an advocate, informed deputy commissioner of police (Zone I) Praveen Meena here on Monday. Police had formed four teams to probe the suicide case of the mahant who was found dead in his room at the ashram in Kagadadi village near Rajkot on June 1 evening. “During the investigation, we found the involvement of a doctor of a private hospital who had not only hidden the information about the cause of death but also changed the time of mahant’s death in his report,” DCP Meena told media persons. “Mahant was taken to the hospital at 10:30 am. But the hospital records show that he was brought there at 6 am and was declared dead at 8.15 am. Despite knowing that it was a medico-legal case, the doctor did not inform the police,” Meena added. Police have also zeroed in on advocate Rakshit Kalola who is also one of the trustees of the Ashram. “Kalola was present at the Ashram when one of the accused Vikram Sohla had beaten the mahant. Moreover, Kolola reached the ashram immediately after mahant was found dead and got the deceased’s room cleaned and destroyed evidence,” a police official said. A few days after the mahant’s death, a suicide note was found at his ashram room. Later, police had booked the three persons — Alpesh Solanki, a resident of Pedhavada village, Hitesh Jadav, a resident of Prashnavada village, and Vikram Sohla, a resident of Gandhigram — whose names figured in the suicide note. Initially, his followers thought that he had died of cardiac arrest and cremated him the following day. But two days after his death, the mahant’s followers found a 20-page suicide note while cleaning his room. The suicide also had details about how he was being blackmailed by the accused using a video which showed him with a woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/probe-reveals-involvement-of-doctor-and-advocate-cops/articleshow/83523894.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow University finalises flexible 4-year UG course structure under NEP||LUCKNOW: The four-year undergraduate course structure finalised by Lucknow University on Monday will make learning fun for students by providing them opportunity to learn and acquire skills from a wide range of topics, covering all aspects of life – from traditional subjects, interdisciplinary research and vocational training to learning music, arts and social work. Developed in accordance with the National Education Policy (NEP)-2020, the new structure will be implemented in LU and its 524 affiliated colleges in Lucknow, Rae Bareli, Hardoi, Sitapur and Lakhimpur Kheri districts covering over two lakh students from the next academic session starting September. The four-year course will be divided into eight semesters – each having 24 credits – with the total of 192 credits. After every year (two semesters), there will be an option for the students to exit, take a break and join after a gap to complete the course. Depending on the duration of the course studied, a student will get certificate, diploma or a degree. “This means that even a year’s study will not go waste. A student will get employment despite leaving the course midway. The new structure also involves massive open online courses,” said dean, students’ welfare, Poonam Tandon. “Currently, a student gets a degree only after completing a three years’ course. Dropping midway means no benefit at all,” she added. In the first four semesters, a student will be allowed to study the core subjects of her/his choice along with the electives from another stream, besides vocational courses, internship and co-curricular activities. However, the last two semesters will be dedicated to thorough study, research and specialisation on the core subject opted by the student. NCC and NSS will also be a part of the curriculum. “The idea is to open the minds of the students by exposing them to a wide range of subjects through classroom teaching, projects and practical, vocational training, co-curricular activities and internship, thereby helping them develop critical thinking and employability skills,” said LU vice-chancellor Prof Alok Kumar Rai. Explaining the key difference between current course structure and the proposed four-year course, dean, academics, Prof Rakesh Chandra said: “It is not just about the number of years or flexibility of entry and exit, but also a choice to learn from wide range of subjects, thus giving wings to the imagination, dreams and abilities of students.” “Earlier, a student had to drag with three subjects of a stream – arts, science or commerce – through three years, but now subject combination will allow an arts student to learn commerce or science subjects, besides integrating classroom and vocational education. While studying core subjects, a student may also develop skills like photography, museology, rural and urban cartography, food processing, tribal art and hospitality etc,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-finalises-flexible-4-yr-ug-course-structure-under-nep/articleshow/83525748.cms||---

The accused is Nallamothu Anil Kumar, from Mumbai. In April 2021, Anil Kumar went to Alipore branch of ICICI bank in Kolkata posing as a cop. He gave a fake letter saying that the officer in-charge, cyber cell police, Lal Bazaar, Kolkata, has directed the bank to unfreeze 12 accounts and transfer the amount to an SBI account in the name of Anand Jannu in Hyderabad. As soon as the bank officials transferred Rs 1.18 crore to the SBI account, the accused transferred it to multiple accounts at various places and withdrawn the amount immediately, police said. Based on the complaint of ICICI bank, Hyderabad cyber crime police registered a case and arrested Anand Jannu on June 2. Anand told police that he received only Rs 1 lakh from the main accused. Police team subsequently, went to West Bengal and arrested Anil Kumar few days ago. He was brought to Hyderabad on a transit warrant and remanded in judicial custody on Monday. “We have seized Rs 2 lakh cash, eight debit cards, three cheque books, three mobile phones and a laptop from the accused,” ACP KVM Prasad said. Anil Kumar was earlier arrested in January 2015 by Cyber crime police for providing bank accounts to Nigerian cyber crime gangs to transfer the proceeds of fraudulent transactions for commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fraudster-who-swindled-rs-1-1cr-from-frozen-a/cs-arrested/articleshow/83523859.cms||---

Even as the government has taken the vaccination drive to the prison, many inmates have already received their first jab, including some foreigners. “We don’t know why, but they (the Africans) have refused vaccination, but we have taken up counselling of all inmates, including Nigerians who are unwilling to get vaccinated, to remove their misconception about the vaccine,” said a jail official. Most of these are either serving time under the NDPS Act or are undertrials The counselling sessions were conducted last week, and the officer said that more jailbirds will be willing to get inoculated after counselling, and (another) session would be held for them. The jail has put in place measures to keep everyone safe from Covid-19, but also want all inmates to get vaccinated, he said. The vaccination is conducted within the jail premises to avoid security hassles of moving prisoners in and out. The jail houses over 500 persons, including undertrials. The jail has a separate cell to isolate prisoners who may test positive, and since March last year, visitors are not allowed. While the jail does not have a single case currently, last month, about 20 prisoners tested positive, and they have all recovered. Few jail guards had also tested positive, and two died. One convict had died after he contracted the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/colvale-prison-grapples-with-african-jailbirds-refusing-vax/articleshow/83525728.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa education department proposes to commence new academic year for schools from Monday||PANAJI: The directorate of education (DoE) has sent a proposal to the state government to begin the new academic year 2021-22 for school students as scheduled from June 21, sources said. Given the persisting pandemic situation, the DoE has proposed to conduct classes in the online mode only. Almost 2.8 lakh students enrolled from Class I to XII in state schools are expected to start the new academic year from Monday. The DoE is now awaiting the state government nod. Though the state curfew due to the pandemic has been extended by the government upto June 21, teaching and non-teaching staffers have already resumed duty in schools. And with classes planned to be conducted in the online mode, the curfew is unlikely to affect the teaching. Also, the academic year, which usually begins, in the first week of June has already been pushed DoE to June 21 by revising the academic calendar. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed. The DoE sent its proposal to the state government, as per sources, to start the academic year from June 21, before the announcement by chief minister Pramod Sawant that the state curfew has been extended till June 21. Besides the curfew, with cancellation of the Class X and XII public examinations, teachers of these higher classes in schools will remain engaged until at least mid-July in preparing the results for these students of the 2021 batch. The results are likely to be tabulated at the school level by teachers themselves based on students’ internal assessments, which will keep the teachers busy. “These issues remain and it is now for the government to take a call on reopening for the new academic year,” said an official. Sources said that there will be no change in the method in which online classes are conducted in the new academic year as well, at least in the first half of the academic year. “Due to pandemic, classes will have to be in online mode itself. Classes will take place just as they were being conducted during the last academic year. For primary school students, worksheets will be handed out to be completed at home, while for students of high schools and higher secondary schools live classes will be conducted using platforms like Google Meet,” said a DoE official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/edu-dept-proposes-to-commence-new-academic-year-for-schools-from-mon/articleshow/83525732.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Deaths reported late due to staff crunch at peak of wave||MUMBAI: Districts with mega cities are logging in the highest numbers of ‘old’ deaths: Pune, for instance, has added between 100 to 500 deaths on many days of this nearly month-long data update. In the last month, Pune district has added 2,586 ‘old’ deaths to the toll. Nashik, Nagpur and Thane are the other urban culprits with three-digit additions on most days. The additions in smaller districts such as Chandrapur, Latur, Sindhudurg and Wardha are in single digits on most days. District collectors have stated that the backlog is mostly from private hospitals, and they have been asked to complete the exercise in the next few days. “Of the total old deaths that are being added under the data update, 70% are from the private hospitals,” said Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare. The district has so far added nearly 700 old deaths, some even two months old, taking the cumulative death toll to 6,200. The main reason for the delay in reporting of these deaths was manpower crunch during the second wave’s peak, when everyone was busy with patient care than the record books. While reconciliation between data calculated by the state and districts takes place every week or fortnight, the intensity of the second wave upset the discipline, according to state officials. The reconciliation exercise started after the second wave caseload subsided in most parts of the state. “When cases were at the peak, the entire healthcare system, from labs that collected swabs to hospitals that treated patients, was overburdened and priority was to ensure timely patient care,” said a senior bureaucrat. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare was unaware about the 67 extra deaths added to Mumbai’s toll. “It could be deaths of Mumbaikars that occurred in other districts or some delayed reporting. We will look into it,” she said. Mumbai has a dedicated team, including IT specialists, looking at data management to avoid a recurrence of last June, when the death data in Mumbai had been upwardly revised by 862 deaths. The BMC then found private hospitals were the culprit, with some hospitals reporting deaths after weeks. The state government has earned praise from various quarters for being transparent about data. “We are continuously asking districts to update figures so the second wave’s impact can be analysed and planning for third wave can be done,” he added. The exercise is nearly complete. “Reporting of old deaths is slowly reducing,” said Nashik collector Mandhare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deaths-reported-late-due-to-staff-crunch-at-peak-of-wave/articleshow/83524433.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand Multi-crore cyber scam: Crypto-currency exchanges under STF scanner||DEHRADUN: The Special Task Force (STF) of Uttarakhand Police has served a notice to two well-known crypto-currency exchanges operating in India for potential violations of foreign exchange rules by them. The move follows the unravelling of the Rs 350 crore cyber fraud done by Uttarakhand Police a few days ago through lucrative schemes floated on mobile applications like 'Power Bank'. Till date, STF has arrested two directors of shell companies for siphoning off invested money of Indian nationals to foreign countries through cryptocurrency. "We have served notices under section 91 of CrPC to Wasir X and CoinDCX--both crypto-currency exchanges--regarding the suspicious transactions and sought details which may help in further investigation," said Ajay Singh, senior superintendent of police (SSP) STF. Incidentally, Enforcement Directorate (ED) had recently issued a show-cause notice to Wasir X in a matter involving digital currencies worth over Rs 2700 crore. Ajay Singh further added that prima facie, it appears, on the basis of preliminary investigation, that the money was routed to China. “Both companies are co-operating in the investigation. More details are expected to come out soon ,” Singh said. STF has also served notice to online payment gateway Razorpay in connection with a few dubious transactions done by a few companies registered with it. Following the notice, Razorpay filed a complaint against 13 people, all senior executives of the companies, stating that they defrauded the payment gateway by deviating from the original category of business for which they had registered and started routing their transactions to collect payments from the 'Power Bank' app.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/multi-crore-cyber-scam-crypto-currency-exchanges-under-stf-scanner/articleshow/83516344.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Grocery shops will be allowed to stay open from 7am to 6pm. The short business hours posed a challenge for the supply line, said sellers. “We brought a small quantity of vegetables so that nothing would go waste. Now, vendors can bring more vegetables for the extra morning hour,” said Barisha Bazar Vegetable Vendors’ Association secretary Manas Das. “The revised timings will help ease supply bottlenecks. In the existing schedule, it was difficult to get the stocks replenished. The business window being limited to only three hours, we had to cater to customers and handle the suppliers as well. This led to some stocks running out fast and people returning empty handed. But the 7am to 6pm timeline will now resolve this issue,” said a Behala grocery store owner. Another shop owner said, “In the 7am-10am slot, we were facing difficulty as suppliers never came so early in the morning.” Gariahat market retailers felt relived at the extension of the window for business. “We could hardly sell things as it was only three hours to build stock and to sell them. Now, we can do some business with seven hours in hand,” said Biren Ghosh, a member of the Gariahat Retailers’ Association. Store owners in New Market were happy that their timings had been extended as it would be better than the “open-and-shut” affair of earlier three hours. “We have asked our staff to join, with the promise of vaccination,” said Vinay Mangalani, a member of New Market Traders’ Association. The KMC has promised its market associations that vaccination on wheels will go and ensure all the employees who join afresh are inoculated. But many fear the absence of public transport might pose a commute challenge for the staff and act as a deterrent for customers to visit. “Many of my staff stay far away and will not be able to join without public transport. I am arranging for a car pool,” said Mangalani. “Many of us will ask our family members to help out,” said Sunil Aswani, a store owner. New Market embarked on a mega sanitation programme immediately after the announcement. “Some owners did not open shops given the short window. Now, everyone is like to join the trade,” said Arup Basak, committee member of New Market Tenants’ & Traders’ Committee. Very little business had been taking place, rued store owners at Hatibagan and Sovabazar. Most would buy their staples and leave by 10am and not go to other stores that would open from noon to 3pm, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/extra-hour-to-firm-up-supply-line-say-stall-owners-at-city-markets/articleshow/83523974.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Thane||Maharashtra: Deaths reported late due to staff crunch at peak of wave||MUMBAI: Districts with mega cities are logging in the highest numbers of ‘old’ deaths: Pune, for instance, has added between 100 to 500 deaths on many days of this nearly month-long data update. In the last month, Pune district has added 2,586 ‘old’ deaths to the toll. Nashik, Nagpur and Thane are the other urban culprits with three-digit additions on most days. The additions in smaller districts such as Chandrapur, Latur, Sindhudurg and Wardha are in single digits on most days. District collectors have stated that the backlog is mostly from private hospitals, and they have been asked to complete the exercise in the next few days. “Of the total old deaths that are being added under the data update, 70% are from the private hospitals,” said Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare. The district has so far added nearly 700 old deaths, some even two months old, taking the cumulative death toll to 6,200. The main reason for the delay in reporting of these deaths was manpower crunch during the second wave’s peak, when everyone was busy with patient care than the record books. While reconciliation between data calculated by the state and districts takes place every week or fortnight, the intensity of the second wave upset the discipline, according to state officials. The reconciliation exercise started after the second wave caseload subsided in most parts of the state. “When cases were at the peak, the entire healthcare system, from labs that collected swabs to hospitals that treated patients, was overburdened and priority was to ensure timely patient care,” said a senior bureaucrat. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare was unaware about the 67 extra deaths added to Mumbai’s toll. “It could be deaths of Mumbaikars that occurred in other districts or some delayed reporting. We will look into it,” she said. Mumbai has a dedicated team, including IT specialists, looking at data management to avoid a recurrence of last June, when the death data in Mumbai had been upwardly revised by 862 deaths. The BMC then found private hospitals were the culprit, with some hospitals reporting deaths after weeks. The state government has earned praise from various quarters for being transparent about data. “We are continuously asking districts to update figures so the second wave’s impact can be analysed and planning for third wave can be done,” he added. The exercise is nearly complete. “Reporting of old deaths is slowly reducing,” said Nashik collector Mandhare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-deaths-reported-late-due-to-staff-crunch-at-peak-of-wave/articleshow/83530046.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Goa||Goa: We will do what BJP government is refusing to do, says AAP||PANAJI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday launched a Covid relief campaign to distribute free ration packets to every house in Goa to help families affected by Covid lockdown and economic downturn. State convener Rahul Mhambre said the party took the step after CM Pramod Sawant didn’t heed to the party’s multiple appeals for financial relief to the common man. “The one-point agenda of this unprecedented campaign is to ensure that no Goenkar remains hungry. We have witnessed first-hand the anguish of the common man during our Covid relief work for the past two months. Our Goan brothers and sisters need support, and It is the government’s responsibility to provide that support. AAP will do what the BJP government is refusing to do,” Mhambre stated. Venzy Viegas said that the campaign is beingundertaken not just through a helpline number 7504750475, but also with on the ground teams going door to door in every village to ensure no one is left out. “Because of the scale and complexity of the campaign, pilot projects were carried out in three constituencies to streamline the process before launching today. A total of 40 vans have put in service, and more than 1,000 volunteers will be coordinated by village pradhans who will personally deliver the ration packs. Each pack contains about 10 kgs of dry grocery essentials such as flour, pulses, sugar, salt, etc,” Viegas said. Mhambre flagged off the first 20 vehicles on Monday from the party office in Panaji, along with state leaders Adv. Pratima Coutinho, Adv. Surel Tilve, Capt. Venzy Viegas, Shubham Shivolkar, Valmiki Naik, Manuel Cardozo, Sandesh Telekar, Shripad Pednekar and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/we-will-do-what-bjp-govt-is-refusing-to-do-says-aap/articleshow/83525776.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Cluster approach to scale up vaccination drive next month||LUCKNOW: To scale up vaccination drive against the pandemic virus in July, the Uttar Pradesh government will be launching its cluster approach strategy to ensure that maximum persons in the target age group are covered. Under this, public mobilisation and vaccine facilitation activity will be intensified in small geographical areas which may be as small as 10-12 villages. The purpose is to go in phases and saturate the selected area to ensure that no one is missed out. Developed with the help of partners, including UNICEF, UPTSU, WHO, Rotary, CSOs and NGOs for the state government, the strategy was formalised through an official order issued by additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad on Monday. A dry run of the strategy would be undertaken in selected clusters from June 17. The tactic aims to augment and accelerate the existing recommendations made by the Union ministry of health and family welfare besides promising to give the much needed shot in the arm to UP’s pace of Covid-19 vaccination. According to experts, if UP wants to vaccinate its entire eligible population of 13.6 crore by the end of the year, then it needs to increase its daily capacity by nine times. The strategy comes in wake of huge targets set by CM Yogi Adityanath under ‘Mission June’ and ’three-months-10 crore vaccinations from July’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cluster-approach-to-scale-up-vaccination-drive-next-month/articleshow/83525806.cms||---

They want the fees to be reduced to 50% since the infrastructure such as libraries, laboratories, transportation, classrooms were not utilised for an entire year and the situation would remain similar due to Covid restrictions for some time. The members of Aam Aadmi Party parents’ union who were at the office of the commissioner of education submitted a letter stating that schools have been cutting off online education of students whose parents had not paid the fees. The letter also demanded that the lack of utilisation of facilities minimised the cost of operations for the school and the benefit should be enjoyed by the students and parents. Mukund Kirdat of Aam Aadmi Party said, “Many parents who have lost their jobs and some children have lost their parents too. Parents have also suffered salary cuts. So, schools must reduce their fees and ensure that students do not suffer.” Kirdat said, “The discrimination has had severe mental health issues on the minds of the students. The new academic year is about to begin and hence it is demanded by the parents’ union that the fee structure must be revised and the new fee details with 50 % reduction must be charged to students. A Sorry Situation Orders by the education department warning schools on cutting off online education were not strict enough Schools are taking advantage of the situation, ignoring government instructions They continue to charge regular fees and discriminate against those who were helpless about paying the fees. quote The monthly budget of all families has collapsed. Even if there were a few families whose jobs were intact, the prices of all essential, non-essential and other items have increased tremendously. Those who have suffered due to the pandemic had to bear medical expenses too.

---||Lucknow||Activist talks to students about pride month, rights||LUCKNOW: From why we celebrate June as ‘pride month’ to what it is like being queer in India, activist Ritwik had a hearty chat with students on Monday. The activist shared how every movement, be it queer or feminist, is interconnected as the fight is for collective rights and not for the right of an individual or community. In an online session with students of Lucknow University on ‘queer politics in India: history and challenges’ organized by All India Students’ Association, Ritwik said, “People say don’t indulge in queer politics; let queer remain apolitical. I want to make it clear to them that queer movement was political as it was a ‘Jan Andolan’ in which voice was raised against injustice.” Ritwik added that the movement began on June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village neighbourhood of Manhattan, New York. Police had raided Stonewall Inn, a gay bar. Its patrons and those of other lesbian and gay bars had fought back when police became violent. Little did the police know that their actions would spark a movement that will reshape the lives of generations to come.” The activist said that queer people are still struggling for their rights. “The given constitutional rights still don’t empower us to chose gender on our own. It is decided by a third person or a committee,” said Ritwik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/activist-talks-to-students-about-pride-month-rights/articleshow/83525780.cms||---

Only a handful of fish vendors sold frozen fish sourced from factories and some shrimp sourced from local fishermen. The first day of sale, however, evoked lukewarm response from customers. “Staying away from the market for nearly six weeks was very difficult, but we had to follow the rules in the face of rising Covid-19 deaths. Even though cases are decreasing, the virus has not gone away, but we decided to restart fish sale for the sake of our survival. We requested the municipal commissioner to permit us to restart our business,” Deandrina Fernandes, a fish vendor, said. A few vendors have been allowed to operate, provided they follow Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing a mask and maintaining social distance while doing business. “Only 50% of the total strength of fish vendors were permitted in the market. Till the time Covid-19 is still rampant, we will ensure that this distance is maintained,” CCP municipal commissioner Agnelo Fernandes, said. With the heavy rainfall warning deterring traditional ramponnkars from venturing into the sea, only a small quantity of fresh fish was being sold. “There were barely 100 people who showed up at the fish market and even the few vendors who started operations were struggling to sell fish by 3pm – by which time the market was shut,” said fish vendor Manjunath Nayak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citizens-choose-safety-over-seafood-as-panaji-fish-mkt-reopens-to-tepid-response/articleshow/83525827.cms||Nida Sayed

Three teams have been formed to trace the missing family who had left a suicide note at their home. Vijay had left home with Kajal and Niyati on June 13 afternoon. His brother Kiran had informed police about him being missing with family and produced a note that Vijay had left behind. The note mentioned that Vijay was planning to end his life with his wife and daughter. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone II), Rajkot city, Manoharsinh Jadeja told media persons on Monday evening that three teams had been formed to trace Vijay and his family. “Teams consisting of personnel from Rajkot taluka police station, detection of crime branch and Malviya Nagar police station have been formed to trace Vijay and his family. We are contacting his close as well as distant relatives to find out his whereabouts and are also trying to track him using mobile phone location,” said Jadeja. Vijay, a teacher turned builder, had left a five-page note in which he has addressed three pages to the police commissioner and two pages to J P Jadeja, a city-based real estate developer. Police said that Vijay had entered into the construction business seven years ago along with his brother Kiran and they had constructed a high-rise building on Kalavad Road a few years ago. However, facing a fund shortage, Makwana took a bank loan and also borrowed around Rs 2.5 crore from J P Jadeja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/missing-builder-family-yet-to-be-traced/articleshow/83524035.cms||---
---||Surat||20,000 children in Surat can get infected: Study||SURAT: A study by the state-run New Civil Hospital, Surat (NCHS) has predicted that around 20,000 children (under 15 years of age) could be infected with coronavirus if the third wave strikes. The estimates have been drawn based on elaborate calculations involving the results of RT-PCR, HRCT and rapid antigen tests conducted in the government hospitals and private laboratories in the first and second wave of Covid-19. The study was undertaken after observations that a majority of mothers only in the families of school-going children had tested positive before the second wave peaked.  According to the study done by NCH’s Preventive and Social Medicine department, around 17,600 to 20,000 children in the city may get infected out of the 88,000 to one lakh cases estimated in the third wave. Of these, around 2,000 will require hospitalization and 200 of need treatment intensive care units (ICU), the study indicates. “The predictions are only for preparations and no one can tell exactly what will happen if a third wave comes. More infections are feared among the young population since they are not vaccinated,” said JK Kosambiya, professor and head department of PSM.  The department was closely monitoring both the waves and based on its daily findings they made predictions and projections for the next few days. The team of 50 including teachers and doctors advised health officials to expand the infrastructure during the past few months. “From the RT-PCR, HRCT and antigen test results, we found that 20% of under-15 will be infected if cases touch one lakh in the third wave. NCHS and SMIMER have already made preparations to manage young patients,” Kosambiya added. “Of the total cases in the second wave, 5.4% children had tested positive in the RT-PCR test conducted in government hospitals. This is higher compared to the first wave and if the trend continues, more children will get infected. If we consider the results of HRCT, antigen test and RT-PCR testing in private laboratories, 20 % children were infected, but majority of them recovered without medication,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/20k-children-in-surat-can-get-infected-study/articleshow/83521907.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Tolly cameras set to roll but cloud over 20 TV serials||KOLKATA: The state on Monday allowed the resumption of indoor and outdoor shooting of TV programmes and films and associated activities, but with not more than 50 people per unit at a time. The units will have to follow all Covid-safety protocols, such as wearing of masks, maintenance of physical distance, travelling with e-passes and getting at least one dose of vaccine. Welcoming the move to allow shooting, Eastern India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA) president Piya Sengupta said, “The health insurance of artistes and technicians need to be in order before shooting resumes. Talks have started for shooting of ‘Jatugriha’, starring Bonny Sengupta and Parambrata Chatterjee in June.” Multiple vaccination drives have been held by Bengali TV channels, production houses, Artists’ Forum and Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI). “We have given free vaccine to 2,000 technicians. Shooting of at least seven films, including those by Arindam Sil, Joydeep Mukherjee and Shiboprosad Mukherjee, is likely to resume,” said FCTWEI president Swarup Biswas. Sil hopes to start shooting from June 21 for ‘Mahananda’. “I had shot for three days and have 17 days left,” Sil said. Joydeep Mukherjee will start his production, ‘Ami Tumi o Maloti’ for TV on June 25. But problems might crop up over shooting of 20 serials, ‘Krishnakali’, ‘Titli’, ‘Aparajita Apu’, ‘Gramer Rani Binapani’, ‘Baran’, ‘Khelaghar’, ‘Jamuna Dhaki’, ‘Gangaram’, ‘Jibansathi’, ‘Mithai’, ‘Sanjher Bati’, ‘Khorkuto’, ‘Sreemoyee’, ‘Mohor’, ‘Desher Mati’, ‘Rimli’, ‘Ogo Nirupama’, ‘Felna’ and ‘Ki Kore Bolbo Tomae’. FCTWEI on Monday alleged the producers had been hiring lights, wigs, props, SLR cameras, and deploying trained professionals for “shooting at home”. “We have proof they have not adhered to the norms. Unless these producers give satisfactory answers, technicians will not cooperate with them. But we will cooperate with others,” said FCTWEI’s joint secretary Sujit Kumar Hazra. But director Saibal Banerjee, president of Welfare Association of Television Producers, told TOI producers of the 20 serials would give a call time to all on Wednesday. “We will shoot with those who come. As FCTWEI did not mail us, there is no question of replying,” he said. FCTWEI also alleged a serial, ‘Dhrubatara’, produced by Acropolis, illegally used child actors in the pandemic. Despite repeated attempts, the Acropolis management could not be reached. West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairman Ananya Chakraborti said, “Juvenile Justice Act says children cannot be exposed to a Covid situation. I need to know how this shooting with kids took place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tolly-cameras-set-to-roll-but-cloud-over-20-tv-serials/articleshow/83524050.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Auto-rickshaw, bus and tempo drivers, cabbies, rickshaw pullers and street vendors will be covered in the drive. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited the special centre set up at Municipal Nursery School in Lucknow to take stock of progress of the drive. After speaking to the heath staff on duty and also to those waiting for their turn to get the jab, the CM said: “Vaccination is extremely important to win the battle against the coronavirus. The anticipated third wave makes vaccination an extremely indispensable element of Covid-19 control,” he said. Earlier, reviewing the Covid-19 vaccination campaign at his residence, the CM expressed happiness over the state’s progress on the count. He reiterated that the state’s goal is to inoculate 10-12 lakh people per day from July and all arrangements are being made accordingly. The CM also directed officials to ensure that vaccine is not wasted and efforts must be made to achieve the goal of zero wastage. Officials stated that over 5,000 centres have been set up for vaccination in the age group of 18 to 44, while 3,000 centres are providing vaccination to those above 45 years of age. Additional 200 booths have been set up for parents of children below 12 years of age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vaccination-a-must-to-beat-virus-cm/articleshow/83525879.cms||---

The last season, 2020-21, which ended abruptly in March after the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases of the second wave, was the last year in the three-year licence period. “The last two seasons have been bad due to the Covid pandemic. We don't even know if there will be tourists in the coming season. So it doesn’t make any sense to issue fresh licences for the next three years,” John Lobo, general secretary of the Shacks Owners’ Welfare Society, told TOI. “In the last season, shack owners were told their licences would be cancelled if they did not pay the fees and erect their shacks. So to avoid that, they paid the license fee and put up their shacks, but for many in Candolim and other areas like Morjim, who are completely dependent on foreign charter tourists, there was no business. It was a complete loss for them,” Lobo said. “Nobody knows whether there will be charter tourists in the next season because of the Covid situation. People have to be vaccinated. There are all kinds of issues. Most probably there will be no charter tourists,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shack-owners-to-seek-licence-extension-for-one-year/articleshow/83525891.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Antibody test post-vax not recommended: ICMR-NIV||PUNE: Forty-five-year-old Avinash was taken aback when his Covid antibody test came negative despite taking both vaccine doses, while Bhumika (30) got elated when the test found her with optimum levels of antibodies after taking the first shot. Such examples are galore as mass Covid vaccination has entered its sixth month. However, the Indian Council of Medical Research National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) does not currently recommend testing for antibodies post-vaccination. Reasons being the amount of antibodies varies among individuals due to their genetic makeup and owing to the variety of antibody tests used. Also, if the antibody test after vaccination is negative, it does not mean that the vaccine is not giving any protection—vaccination can stimulate memory cells in the body and still confer protection. Conversely, the presence of antibodies after vaccination should not be used as a licence to be careless as antibody-positive people may still get Covid-19, though not serious forms of it, experts have said. “Post-vaccination antibody testing is not recommended currently due to the variable sensitivity and specificity of the commercially available antibody assays (tests),” Priya Abraham, director of ICMR-NIV, told TOI. Also, the commercially available antibody tests cannot differentiate between vaccine-induced antibodies and antibodies induced after natural infection or break-through infection post-vaccination. “Besides, the minimum level (threshold) of protective antibodies in the blood is not precisely defined yet. Many breakthrough infections have been reported post-one or two-dose vaccination despite the presence of antibodies. Most are mild cases and require no hospitalization. Therefore, checking antibodies post-vaccination or natural infection serves no purpose,” said senior virologist Deepak Gadkari, former director of ICMR-NIV. Antibody tests may also vary from one lab to the other and according to the timing after vaccination. “It takes two or three weeks post-vaccination to develop a robust antibody response. It may vary from person to person,” said infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag. Commercially available ant-ibody tests detect antibodies ag-ainst the nucleo-capsid protein as well as the spike protein. “Nucleocapsid antibodies are generated only after natural infection, while the presence of spike protein antibodies (IgG) could mean past infection or response to the Covishield vaccine,” Prayag said. Covishield is a vaccine incorporating only spike protein and not the entire virus. “We perform spike protein IgG antibody test, which is both quantitative and qualitative, and indicative of the presence of S1 and S2 subunits of the spike protein of the novel coronavirus. These spike protein IgG antibodies are either seen in blood post-natural infection or post-vaccination with Covishield,” said pathologist Avanti Golwilkar-Mehendale. “The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG antibody test will not, therefore, be detected following Covishield vaccine, but can be detected post-natural infection or maybe after Covaxin shot.” Commercial kits are availa-ble to determine presence of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies, but they don’t detect ‘neutralizing’ or protective antibodies. “Neutralization test requires live infectious virus or pseudo-virus to detect ‘protective’ antibodies. Private labs are unlikely to have such facilities,” Gadkari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/antibody-test-post-vax-not-recommended-icmr-niv/articleshow/83524417.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The workers demanded that their services be regularised and they should get Rs 15,000 salary instead of Rs 5,000. Dr Vikas Kuwelkar, medical superintendent of the hospital said he had to divert some of his hospital staff for the registration work. However, since the contractual workers had logged off the hospital computers with passwords, hospital staff could not use the system, and patients had to be issued handwritten forms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/strike-by-data-operators-hits-ponda-hospital/articleshow/83525902.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Class 10 teachers launch ‘ticketless travel’ protest||MUMBAI: Teachers across Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) launched a unique protest on Monday morning as they boarded trains for Class 10 assessment work. Not only did they travel ticketless, but they even went up to the ticket examiners and paid fines. Teachers doing assessment work are not allowed train travel as they do not fall under the essential services category. The marking process for Secondary School Certificate (SSC) began in schools from Friday. The state cancelled the exams in April and students are being marked on their Class 9 and 10 scores. Several teachers travelling to schools in Mumbai and Thane reside in distant areas of Palghar, Vasai-Virar, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli. On Friday and Saturday, teachers were turned away from ticket booking counters at train stations, forcing many to take buses and taxis. On Monday, over 200 teachers protested by holding placards on railway platforms and travelling ticketless on local trains. Those who travelled ticketless approached ticket examiners on alighting and paid the fines. Dayanand Kharat, a teacher travelling from Panvel in Navi Mumbai to his school in Kurla, was among the protesters. He urged the government to allow teachers to travel by train to complete assessment work. Teachers have to complete assessment and tabulation of marks by June 20. The results committee in each school will then take up final tabulation of marks and send it to the state board by June 30. The state is expected to declare SSC results by mid-July. Shivnath Darade, secretary of the Maharashtra Rajya Shikshak Parishad, who teaches in a Vile Parle school, said teachers won’t be able to complete assessment work if they end up spending eight to 10 hours on travel. Darade travelled ticketless from his Chembur home and paid a fine of Rs 260. Teachers said despite not being paid salaries for over two months, they are keen to complete assessment for the welfare of the students, but travelling by buses and taxis is not feasible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-class-10-teachers-launch-ticketless-travel-protest/articleshow/83527790.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Trichy||Boozers crowd Tasmac, people from dry districts throng border shops||TRICHY: Reopening of Tasmac outlets came as a relief for tipplers in 27 districts where lockdown norms were relaxed on Monday after a gap of 35 days. However, the outlets in these districts bordering 11 other districts that are under lockdown faced a huge rush for booze. In the districts, where Covid-19 cases came down substantially, Tasmac outlets were reopened amidst protest from the opposition AIADMK, PMK and BJP. There was a heavy influx of people from other districts, where the lockdown is not eased, on motorcycles. In the central region, except Trichy, Tasmac shops remain closed in all the delta districts including Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinnam and Mayiladuthurai. People from the temple town of Kumbakonam in Thanjavur district didn’t bother to visit the nearby Vanchur in Karaikal for liquor. As many as 144 Tasmac shops reopened in Pudukottai district and many among them, especially those bordering Thanjavur district, witnessed huge crowds. People from Peravurani and Sengipatti in Thanjavur took their motorcycles to Gandharvakottai in Pudukottai district to buy some liquor. Liquor shops were opened in almost all the southern districts, where most of the outlets were crowded. In the western region, outlets in Coimbatore, Tirupur, Salem, Namakkal and Erode districts remain closed because of the surge in Covid-19 cases. While shops in Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri were open on Monday, tipplers from Salem drove to these districts to buy liquor. On Monday, roughly 2,000 people from Salem gathered at a Tasmac outlet at Thoppur in Dharmapuri. While police had a tough time managing the crowd, they heaved a sigh of relief for the fact that opening of shops in Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri will help reduce smuggling of liquor from Karnataka. Police had seized liquor smuggled from Karnataka and filed more than 50 cases in the last two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/boozers-crowd-tasmac-people-from-dry-dists-throng-border-shops/articleshow/83524117.cms||---
---||Patna||5 LJP MPs ‘dump’ Chirag, elect Paras as party president||PATNA: The political script being written in Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) since the announcement of Bihar assembly elections last year reached its climax with a coup in the party Sunday night.Five of the six Lok Sabha members of LJP “dumped” party president and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan under the leadership of Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras, the brother of party founder late Ram Vilas Paswan.The five MPs submitted their signed letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, who on Monday accepted their plea and named Paras as the LJP leader in the House in place of Chirag. The Lok Sabha secretariat issued a circular in this regard in the afternoon.Chandan Kumar, the LJP MP from Nawada and brother of don-turned-politician and former MP Surajbhan Singh, on Monday told TOI from Delhi that Paras has been elected the parliamentary party leader of the party in the Lok Sabha. “We have made him the party president as well. The party is intact. Only the leadership has changed,” he said.There are, however, technicalities involved whether the party has split 21 years after Ram Vilas laid its foundation or only Chirag has been left in the lurch, as Paras said he has saved the LJP by his decision rather than breaking it.“We had no option. The party was in disarray and on the verge of losing its existence. Chirag was the party president and he is welcome to remain in the party,” said Paras, who did not meet Chirag when the latter visited his house on Monday reportedly with an offer to step down and make his mother Reena Paswan the party president. The move has also put a question mark on the survival of smaller parties as former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha recently merged his RLSP with JD(U) and CM Nitish Kumar made him the president of the party's parliamentary board. Even the state’s lone BSP MLA, Jama Khan, joined JD(U) and became a minister in the Nitish cabinet. The sudden political development amid speculation of Union cabinet expansion is significant. The BJP central leadership as well as Nitish’s JD(U) is in a win-win situation as they will be no more in a dilemma about accommodating LJP’s Paras in the central cabinet after the death of Ram Vilas, who was the cabinet minister in the Modi government till he breathed his last.Had Chirag been at the helm of the party affairs in the Lok Sabha, BJP would have found it difficult to accommodate him in the ministry at the cost of inviting the ire of its now largest ally JD(U) and its leader Nitish. Significantly, Paras praised Nitish at a press meet in Delhi on Monday and said LJP was and will remain a part of the NDA.Taking a swipe at Chirag, JD(U) national president RCP Singh said, “As you sow, so you reap. Chirag was heading a party which was with the NDA. Yet, he took a stand that damaged his party in the state assembly elections.”Vaishali MP Veena Devi also told TOI over the phone that all the LJP Lok Sabha members, except Chirag, signed the letter to the Speaker in favour of Paras. “We contested the Lok Sabha election as an NDA partner and all MPs want development in their constituencies. There is no break-up in LJP,” she said, pointing out that the grass is greener on Nitish’s side. In fact, the LJP MPs in any form are important for BJP as it could ill-afford to lose them in the possible case of PM Modi’s ‘Hanuman’ (Chirag) joining hands with the opposition after denial of a cabinet berth in the next expansion. LJP, minus Chirag but Ram Vilas’s brother Paras and nephew Prince Raj (Samastipur MP) at the helm, will suit JD(U) also because of the party’s vote bank among the 4% Paswans in Bihar. The fifth LJP MP to support Paras is Choudhary Mehboob Ali Kaiser from Khagaria. Either Chirag fell prey to the political power game of BJP before the assembly elections by opposing Nitish’s policies and decisions to the extent of saying that he will be jailed on corruption charges and fielded his candidates, including some important “rival BJP men” on 115 seats against his party JD(U) or acted oversmart without assessing his ground reality. LJP could win only one seat in the assembly elections and, later, its lone MLA too joined JD(U), which had lost at least 30 assembly seats to RJD and its allies due to Chirag and had to finish as the junior partner of BJP, which won 74 seats against JD(U)’s 43 only.In fact, LJP had somehow skipped a split before the Bihar assembly elections as most of the rank and file were not in tune with Chirag’s political line to oppose Nitish, but they remained with him under the dilemma that weakening of JD(U) and boosting the chances of BJP electorally will ultimately be rewarding for the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/5-ljp-mps-dump-chirag-elect-paras-as-party-president/articleshow/83520116.cms||Jai Narain Pandey
---||Lucknow||Govt tells technical varsities to hold final yr exams in July||Lucknow: Amid demand for cancellation of examinations, the Uttar Pradesh government on Monday issued directives to technical universities to hold online examinations from July 15-22 for final semester students and from July 23-31 for remaining students. The examinations will be objective type and students can take the test from their homes. There are nearly 5 lakh students enrolled in over 750 technical institutions and 1,372 polytechnics across UP. The decision came after the recommendations by a five-member committee set up to work out modalities for conducting examinations during Covid-19 pandemic. A government order said a software, purchased through GeM portal, would be used to conduct the examinations. The software will work on all devices and processors, including smartphone, tablets, desktops and laptops with minimum connectivity. Reviewing preparations, secretary, technical education, Alok Kumar said, “We will make sure that the syllabus gets finished within next five weeks. If needed, we will ensure classes are held on weekends and in evenings.” As per the government directives, three technical universities – APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (Lucknow), Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology (Gorakhpur), Harcourt Butler Technical University (Kanpur), and the Board of Technical Education (BTE) which gives affiliation to polytechnics — will hold mock tests to acquaint students about the online examination pattern. Soon after the government directives, AKTU announced a tentative examination schedule for final year students. Nearly 2.3 lakh students are enrolled in various courses in over 750 colleges affiliated to AKTU. The examination for final semester engineering students is scheduled from July 24, while final year pharmacy students will take examinations from July 20. “We will hold a computer-based test which will comprise of 50 questions that students will have to answer in 90 minutes,” said AKTU vice-chancellor Prof Vinay Pathak. Officials at MMMUT, which has around 5,200 students, said they were ready with all options. “Students will be able to take the examination even with low connectivity. In case of loss of connectivity, their previous solved questions will be saved,” an official said. Meanwhile, students complained of incomplete syllabus and poor connectivity in rural areas. Chandresh Maurya, a student, said: “When it is mandatory to run classes for 90 days according to BTE calendar, not even 20% syllabus is complete through online medium. How can I take the exam?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-tells-technical-varsities-to-hold-final-yr-exams-in-july/articleshow/83525933.cms||---
---||Delhi||Man held for making hoax call about bomb on Delhi-Patna flight||NEW DELHI: A 22-year-old man was apprehended at Indira Gandhi International Airport soon after boarding a Delhi-Patna SpiceJet flight on Monday morning. Police said the man had allegedly made a hoax call regarding presence of a bomb on the flight. The 22-year-old, who was a passenger on the same flight, is said to be mentally unstable. The airliner said the man claimed that he had an “intuition” about a bomb on the flight. Security agencies were sent into tizzy after a call was received by the airport around 7.45 am, informing them about a bomb being on the flight. Cops said the call was tracked to a flyer who was on the same flight. Meanwhile, other agencies were placed on alert, and Central Industrial Security Force’s bomb squad was also called in. “A call was received around 7.45am, which said there was a bomb inside the aircraft, which was flying to Patna. All agencies were alerted and the flight was evacuated. We identified a 22-year-old behind the call, which was placed from the plane itself, but the reason is unknown. His mental condition is said to be unstable,” said DCP (IGI) Rajeev Ranjan. A SpiceJet spokesperson said the passenger who reportedly placed the call informed them he had an “intuition” that there was a bomb on the plane. “SpiceJet flight SG 8721 scheduled to operate from Delhi to Patna on June 14, 2021, was delayed after a passenger post boarding the aircraft inquired about its safety, including the possibility of a bomb. The said passenger repeatedly told the crew that he had an intuition that there was a bomb on board the aircraft,” a spokesperson of the airliner said. “The crew informed the captain and the aircraft was moved to a remote bay. All passengers were deboarded and their baggage screened again. The said passenger and the one accompanying him were handed over to CISF and Delhi Police for further investigation after the flight departed,” the spokesperson added. An airport official confirmed the incident, stating the flight was isolated soon after around 70 passengers and crew members were made to deboard the plane. “Thorough checks were carried out by CISF’s bomb squad, but nothing was discovered. Police, meanwhile, were able to track the caller and have taken him into custody,” said the official. The 22-year-old was reportedly travelling with his father, who is said to have informed the cops about his son’s mental condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-held-for-making-hoax-call-about-bomb-on-plane/articleshow/83524157.cms||---
---||Pune||Municipal flats to be sold to tenants||Pune: The city improvement committee (CIC) of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has approved a proposal to sell municipal corporation-owned flats to tenants. As many as 1512 flats will be sold in the first phase. The tenants are project-affected people, who have lost their properties due to land acquisition for various projects. They were given the flats on a rent of Rs 450 per month. Now, they can own theSE flats by paying Rs12lakh to Rs15lakh, said officials. The PMC officials said that the recovery of rent had been pending from many tenants, in some cases, for years. The decision to sell the flats will solve the issue of monthly rent recovery. “The income of the civic body has gone down during the Covid pandemic. Selling the municipal corporation-owned flats will help the PMC to generate revenue,” said a civic official. “The civic body will be able to save money on maintaining these flats. Even after these flats are sold, they will come under the property tax net, which will help the PMC to fetch income,” said Anand Rithe, the CIC chairman. As per the PMC data, 1081 flats are monitored by the central estate department, while 431 are looked after by the ward offices. These flats are located across ward offices in Kothrud, Ghole Road and Kasba-Vishrambaug.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/municipal-flats-to-be-sold-to-tenants/articleshow/83525935.cms||---
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Government, aided schools reopen for admission after 12 weeks||TRICHY: Government and government-aided schools reopened for admissions on Monday after remaining closed for almost three months following the surge in Covid-19 cases in the state. Like last year, more admissions are expected to be in government and aided schools. The trend was reflecting on the first day of the admission on Monday. While primary and middle schools are closed for more than a year, high and higher secondary schools were opened for a few weeks in February and March before they were closed after Covid-19 cases increased. The state government had asked the headmasters and administrative staff to visit schools from Monday to conduct the admission process for the ensuing academic year. Students were declared ‘all pass’ without conducting examinations following the pandemic. Many schools had to carry out cleaning work till the afternoon as they remained closed for almost 12 weeks. However, a few schools, where vaccination centres were functioning, had not much cleaning work on Monday. Block education officer, Trichy, K Marudhanayagam said that parents who could not afford the fee in the private schools in the last one year had come for admission to government schools. Last year, 300 students from private schools had joined the 72 government and aided schools in Manikandam block in Trichy district. This year, the numbers will be increased to 500, he said. Many parents come without transfer certificates, but government and aided schools can admit such students. Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, they can admit students up to Class VIII without any documents including transfer certificate. Some of the higher secondary schools with high intake capacity have restricted admissions to Class XI alone on Monday. Government Model Girls Higher Secondary School in Manachanallur, which has an intake capacity of more than 500 students for Class XI, was among the very few schools that invited applications online. It received applications from 218 students, out of which 97 had applied online. Headmaster S Anbusekaran said that he started working on the online application process as soon as the order on undertaking came from the state government. As many as 26 students came for admission from private schools, the headmaster said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/govt-aided-schools-reopen-for-admission-after-12-weeks/articleshow/83524098.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Lucknow||BJP cadre to help plug loopholes in implementation of government schemes||LUCKNOW: After sending out its senior functionaries to meet the families of pandemic-struck party workers, the BJP is all set to roll out its organisational machinery to fix loopholes at the ground level in implementation of schemes of the Centre and UP government. This is being seen as a strong indicator of the saffron party ramping up the political spade work ahead of the UP assembly elections due next year. UP BJP organisational leadership is learnt to have underscored on the need of stepping up grassroots implementation of schemes of the Modi and Yogi governments, which got hindered in the wake of the pandemic. The move is being seen as an attempt to counter the potentially charged up Opposition which has been seeking to corner the BJP over alleged failure of promises. A top UP BJP leader told TOI that the party functionaries have not only been asked to meet the families of prominent people and party workers hit by the pandemic but also to visit the vaccination centres for effecting monitoring of the inoculation drive and free distribution of food grains to the poor under PM Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana. This will be followed by the party workers fanning out in the state with a set of handbooks on achievements of the BJP government at the Centre and the state. “As a political party, we need to keep our cadre active unlike the Opposition leaders who have not been able to step out of their homes since the outbreak of the pandemic last year,” said UP BJP vice-president Vijay Bahadur Pathak. Pathak maintained that the effective implementation of government schemes would play a decisive role in deciding the political fortunes of the BJP. The development comes close on the heels of the party’s decision to continue its ambitious ‘Sewa Hi Sangathan’ campaign—entailing helping the pandemic-hit people—till July 15. The drive has been at the epicentre of the saffron party’s political discourse with top party leaders including BJP national president JP Nadda and national general secretary (organisation), BL Santhosh pushing for an aggressive public outreach to dispel the Opposition-driven counter narrative about alleged mishandling of the pandemic. Experts point out that even as underlying trouble brewed before the BJP ranks, CM Yogi reacted quickly and led the charge by visiting all divisions personally around the peak of the pandemic—that too soon after recovering from the infection. Party sources said that Yogi’s decision to get into an overdrive charged up the party organisational machinery even as UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and general secretary (organisation) and Sunil Bansal stormed the BJP bastions including PM Modi’s parliamentary constituency of Varanasi and Yogi’s home turf of Gorakhpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-cadre-to-help-plug-loopholes-in-implementation-of-govt-schemes/articleshow/83525958.cms||Pankaj Shah

Confirming the development, Trichy MP Su Thirunavukkarasar told TOI that Union defence minister Rajnath Singh will be approached to avail the enter upon permission within a week to launch the construction work to complete the work. Owing to the non-availability of defence land for an extent of 0.66 acres, the Chennai arm, one of the six arms of the Trichy junction RoB remains incomplete since 2016. In June 2020, the district administration identified the equal value of land in TN special battalion police property adjacent to the defence land as compensatory land. To assess its suitability, a board of officers from field units of the army, defence estate and state highways department studied the compensatory land in April. Since the compensatory land is adjacent to the defence land, the board was said to have been convinced. The recommendations of the board were forwarded to the southern command in May. “The compensatory land was accepted. Will avail enter upon permission in 10 days to launch the work,” Trichy MP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/work-on-trichy-robsoon-as-deadlock-on-defence-land-ends/articleshow/83524154.cms||Deepak Karthik

As many as 700 defaulters have not paid water tax amounting to Rs15 crore, officials said. “The civic administration has published a list of defaulters on the website. These defaulters need to make the payment within the given time,” said Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of the PMC’s water department. Most of these defaulters had taken commercial connections and installed water meters, officials said. In general, water tax forms a fixed component of the property tax and is not collected separately. As per the civic officials, defaulting on tax has resulted in misuse of water. The officials said that misuse of water has also aggravated due to illegal connections. The civic areas have almost three lakh illegal water connections. Majority of them are in old city limits, where commercial water connections are more as compared to residential ones. The civic administration had fixed rates in 2015 for regularising illegal water connections. The rates range between Rs 500 and Rs 20,000, based on the type of connections and locations. The rates for commercial connections are high. Officials said that it has become a tough task to take action against illegal connections due to opposition from the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tap-connections-of-defaulters-owing-more-than-rs1l-in-water-tax-to-be-cut/articleshow/83525984.cms||---

Under the initiative of the district administration to facilitate vaccination of those who could not travel to vaccination booths, a drive-in vaccination camp was held near a hotel close to zone 5 and 6 of the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC). The first drive in vaccination camp of the differentlyabeld was inaugurated by district collector Avinash Lavaniya. Soon after the officials left, the vaccination booth remained deserted and only a handful of people got vaccinated. “A total of around 15 people were vaccinated at the camp. This was the first day and probably many did not know about it,” Dr Rajendra Yadav of Katju hospital whose staff were deployed at the camp told TOI. Sources, however, said that even among these 15 there were a few normal persons, who got vaccinated as vials of vaccines were opened and it would have been expired. As such, others also got vaccinated. Dr Yadav however refuted the claim. “All of the beneficiaries had some or other disability,” he said. Overall, there are 8,617 differently-abled persons in the limits of BMC. “All the information is also available with BMC,” said joint director social justice, Bhopal, R K Singh. BMC commissioner, K V S Chowdhary said, “Now, we will be calling each of them to come for vaccination.” The officials said that this was the first day and camps will be held zone wise in other areas too. “It will be convenient to organise zone-wise camps for differently-abeld,” said additional commissioner, BMC, (incharge-health services) M P Singh. In an official statement, the district administration said that special camps are being arranged with the co-ordination of social justice department and BMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/15-get-the-jab-at-special-centre-set-up-for-differently-abled/articleshow/83524150.cms||Amarjeet Singh

He was booked after a complaint was lodged by Dias. The hearing in the bail matter was held on Friday. Judge Irshad Agha while pronouncing the order on Monday granted bail and asked the singer to report at the police station when required by the investigating officer. As soon as court granted the bail, the tiatrist’s lawyer Antonio Clovis da Costa told reporters that they were forced to file for anticipatory bail as two jeeps of police turned up at the singer’s house, “with the intention to arrest him but fortunately he was not at home”. “I must say today is a victory for the stage artist as the voice of people of Goa and a stage artist was suppressed by using the police machinery. I request politicians not to abuse the process of law, not to misuse the police for their own game and not to suppress the voices of people,” Da Costa said. Reacting to the bail plea, Dias told TOI that his lawyer is also in the process of filing a criminal and defamation case against the singer in the district and session court. “Freedom of speech doesn’t mean to defame anyone without any valid proof,” said Dias. Quepem PI Deepak Pednekar said that the investigating officer will call the singer at the police station to conduct further inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tiatrist-gets-bail-in-case-by-cuncolim-mla/articleshow/83525962.cms||---

Clearly, assets under management (AUM) grew by Rs 4,855 crore in May, according to the data released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). AUM rose from an estimated Rs 1 lakh crore in April to Rs 1.05 lakh crore in May. Analysts said fresh investments poured into equity-linked MFs, while the net asset value of existing investments too grew, augmenting AUM in May. “Despite the gloom due to the second wave of Covid, people have stuck with their investment plans in May,” said Mumukshu Desai, director of an Ahmedabad-based financial consultancy firm. “Inflows into Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) not just continued but increased too — a positive sign.” Desai added: “Moreover, equity-linked investments continued as planned and fresh inflows were reported. As a result, the overall AUM for equity MFs went up significantly.” In fact, financial analysts said that positive net inflows were seen after a long time. “At least seven months later, net inflows were positive, and this is a good sign,” said Jayesh Vithalani, an Ahmedabad-based financial consultant. “No market correction is expected in the near future and as a consequence, sentiment among investors remained bullish.” Financial analysts also said that many who had exited the market earlier are now re-entering with fresh investments. “A lot of people who had withdrawn money from March 2020 onwards were waiting for the uncertainty to end,” Desai said. “People are expecting some certainty in recovery with vaccinations picking up well. This has improved the sentiment, encouraging investors to get back to equity-linked investments.” AMFI data also suggests that overall AUM in Gujarat has grown from Rs 2.15 lakh crore in April 2021 to a record-high level of Rs 2.23 lakh crore. This, however, is primarily driven by equity-linked MFs followed by investments in debt mutual funds too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ditching-pandemic-equity-investments-get-growth-shot/articleshow/83524163.cms||Niyati Parikh

Trichy Corporation sources said that they are awaiting approval from the non-conventional energy sources wing of Tangedco to start generation. The project is aimed at reducing the operational and maintenance cost of the corporation by selling the electricity generated to Tangedco. Though the facility was expected to start producing electricity from January 2021, sources confirmed that the park is idle, costing the exchequer the monthly maintenance. For the purpose of cleaning the dirt accumulated in the panels, four borewells were established. “Due to the pandemic, there was a delay in obtaining the approval,” a source with the corporation said. Corporation had erected the 2.4MW plant on the Trichy-Madurai national highway. The work, which began in December 2019 was completed in December 2020. With about 7,200 solar panels, the plant will supply electricity to the Crawford substation. Even the subsurface transmission lines between the park and the substation for more than 2km stretch, have been installed. Meanwhile, the delay also derails the progress of the phase II proposed in the adjacent land. Around 26 acres of land was identified for the 7.2MW plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichys-first-solar-power-project-awaits-tangedco-approval/articleshow/83524237.cms||Deepak Karthik

Taking cognizance of the submission, a division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi directed the CB-CID to diligently conduct the investigation in this case by nominating competent officers. The judges also directed the CB-CID to submit a status report on the progress of the investigation before the court during the next date of hearing. Since the counsel appearing for four people - Athi Narayanan, Ramesh, Loganathan and Kathir who were allegedly responsible for withdrawal of a case filed by the victim’s father Muthukaruppan, sought time to file counter affidavits, the judges adjourned the case to a further date. It maybe recalled that the victim Balamurugan, one of the accused in the abduction of R Parthiban, a resident of Villapuram Housing Board for a ransom of Rs 20 lakh, was arrested by the police. Balamurugan who sustained injuries in police custody at the Avaniyapuram police station succumbed at the Government Rajaji Hospital in 2019.

Akhilesh cited instances where SP leaders were booked for purely political acts and alleged that administrative authorities were going out of their way to deploy government machinery to serve private interests of ruling party leaders. “The government has already attracted a lot of criticism for having lost its goodwill globally because of its anti-people policies and the people have conveyed their disapproval in the recent panchayat poll. Rattled by the pace at which the BJP is losing ground the government has started targeting the SP leaders,” Akhilesh said, adding that the government was adopting double standards in handling a similar set of situations when it comes to opposition leaders. “Police lodged an FIR against a former SP district chief and 13 of his associates along with 120 unidentified people when they gathered for a meeting in the Paali area of Hardoi. In Auraiya, revenue department officials reached house of district panchayat member Avnesh Khatik and misbehaved with him and his family. In Etah despite a court stay on the market complex owned by SP leader Joginder Singh, the administration demolished the structure, throwing the court order to wind,” Akhilesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-sp-men-being-targeted-in-up/articleshow/83526019.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

According to gold analysts, prices declined here due to the weakened dollar in the international market and the consequent decline in international gold prices. Nearly a month after the curbs on retail trade were lifted, demand for the yellow metal continues to be muted. “Bullion demand has taken a hit due to weakened sentiment. The prices are fluctuating of late and there is a correction and therefore people are waiting for the right time to invest in gold,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). “Demand is purely need-based and people who need to get jewellery repaired or place fresh orders for weddings scheduled in December tend to visit stores. Overall sentiment is muted to a great extent,” said Jigar Soni, president Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA). The government is set to implement mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery and artefacts from Tuesday i.e. June 15.

Kurla police said on Saturday around 9am, Candice Pinto (40) picked up her mother from Kalina for the latter’s dentist appointment in Kurla. “It was raining heavily. Around 11am, when we were returning home, the road was submerged under 3ft of water. We were heading from Kalpana theatre to Air India Road, when the steering wheel of the Mercedes got jammed and then the engine and doors got locked,” Candice told TOI. “Fortunately, we had kept the front seat windows partly open as a precaution.” Scared, she called the police control room. “Within 10 minutes, constables Himmatrao Ingole and Kishore Bhavle reached the spot and identified the red Mercedes. They managed to open the doors and move the two women and their driver to a safe spot,” said senior inspector Shashank Shelke. “They sent the two women home in an autorickshaw, while the driver stayed back to take the car to the garage.” Zonal DCP Pranay Ashok appreciated the efforts of the two constables. The incident is a grim reminder to the 2005 Mumbai deluge tragedy in which two youths suffocated to death in a centrally locked car as floodwaters began to rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-cops-rescue-3-locked-in-merc-on-flooded-lbs-marg/articleshow/83526062.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Bhopal||Cricket academies struggle to survive during pandemic||Bhopal: There are over 15 good cricket academies in Bhopal; many of these have produced players for domestic cricket like Ranji etc. But due to back-to-back lockdowns, they are struggling for their survival these days.With coaching having come to a standstill, players are also worried about their training. They are afraid as to what will happen if the academies aren’t able to resume training after witnessing heavy losses in the lockdown.Former SAI cricket coach, Tarique Khan, said that he started his academy in 2019 and it was shut down barely after a month of training. “I retired from SAI in 2017. After that I wanted to start an academy, which could provide all kinds of cricket facilities at one place. With the help of friends and family members I started it on a 2-acre rented land. However, the project collapsed after a month of its opening due to Covid,” said Khan.He went on to add, “Even after pumping huge money, nothing could be done as it was shut down in such a short span,” added Khan. He claimed that it will take long time for him to resume training after incurring such huge losses.Mohsin, another owner of a cricket academy, said that he also had to bear heavy losses. “I missed out on two summer camps in the last two years. I do not know how to resume training after such heavy losses. This is a situation that can’t be explained in words,” said Mohsin.He added that he had almost 350 players in the academy with six turf wickets. “It is a big loss for players too. We have several expenses; running an academy may appear an easy task but it is not that easy. I hope that academies start soon; more delay means longer wait for the players,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cricket-academies-struggle-to-survive-during-pandemic/articleshow/83524295.cms||Ramendra Singh

When asked by a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni if the Centre had sought to prohibit states like Kerala and the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir which plans to commence door-to-door vaccination for the elderly and bedridden, additional solicitor general Anil Singh appearing for the Central government reiterated that its policy was advisory in nature and states were “expected to follow it.”  HC in its order, after a hearing via video conferencing on a PIL by two lawyers, said, “From such reply of …Singh, it clearly appears to us that there is no categorical prohibition…” BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) through its counsel Anil Sakhare said the civic administration would follow the state’s directives if it permits a door-to-door protocol for vaccinating the homebound. He said it would await the state’s directions. Sakhare requested that a short time limit be set for the state to issue protocols which ought to also mention the number of people who would need home vaccination to ensure there is no wastage of the vaccine once a vial is opened. The PIL seeking a policy to enable the elderly aged over 75 and other specially abled who are bedridden to receive a vaccination at their bedside was filed by lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari. Kapadia had submitted a compilation with a news report about the state working on protocols for door-to-door vaccination as announced by public health minister Rajesh Tope. The state government lawyer read out the news report and sought time to take instructions on what the minister said. The HC has adjourned the PIL proceedings to June 22, “to enable the State Government to take an appropriate decision on the issue...’’ The HC order added that if the state’s decision comes before the next date, all concerned were free to implement it immediately. The Centre has, however, said as a ‘national policy’ at this stage, its expert group has advised against ‘door to door’ vaccination due to risks in managing adverse effects following immunization and maintaining protocols for a cold chain, to ensure no wastage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/centres-policy-is-an-advisory-bombay-hc-asks-state-for-its-stand-on-door-to-door-vax/articleshow/83524333.cms||Swati Deshpande

Along with the reshuffle, the party is also working on a new media strategy to take on BJP and rebuild the party’s image in Goa. Panjikar has been relieved of his post as state party general secretary in line with the party’s one-man one-post policy. All India Congress Committee (AICC) had dissolved Goa communication and media department days after its media cell convenor Trajano D’Mello criticised opposition leader Digambar Kamat and Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginald Lourenco. As part of the rejig D’Mello has been appointed the party’s media panellist, a post that has been created by the party leadership. State party president Girish Chodankar said that the new media team has AICC’s approval. The party has brought in new and young members into its media cell. The new entrants are journalist Mahadev Khandekar, advocate Shrinivas Khalap, Dr Ashish Kamat, Altone D’Costa and Pallavi Bhagat. “The new team will take the BJP government head on and expose all its misdeeds. We are in the process of finalising the media strategy and the consultation process for this has already begun,” said Chodankar. Congress had recently appointed Himanshu Tivrekar as the social media in-charge while Sandesh Narahari Khorjuekar, Anjuna-Kaisuva panchayat member was appointed the chairman of the party’s Other Backward Class (OBC) department. The changes come at a time when the party itself is on the cusp of a major organisational revamp in Goa with strong suggestions that Chodankar will be dropped as the party president. Speculation that one of the party’s senior leaders will take over has been rife for the last two years since Chodankar put in his resignation in July 2019. Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro, south Goa MP Francisco Sardinha, opposition leader Digambar Kamat and former minister Aleixo Sequeira are in the race for the post of state party president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-continues-organisational-rejig-in-goa-changes-media-cell-setup/articleshow/83526112.cms||---
---||Madurai||Madras high court denies relief in plea to reclassify land parcels in Tirunelveli||MADURAI: The Madras high court on Monday took a serious view over the manner in which the commissioner of Tirunelveli Corporation had dealt with unauthorised constructions at Palayamkottai by classifying certain areas as continuous building area and economically weaker section area. The court said that it is not inclined to pass any direction on the commissioner’s resolution for reclassification, on the ground that it is a matter where policy decision has to be taken by the government. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by S Bala Vignesh seeking to implement the resolution passed by the commissioner dated March 7, 2019. A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that it is not clear on what basis such a resolution was passed by the commissioner. The reclassification of an area by making it as a continuous building area or an economically weaker section area are policy decisions which are to be taken by the government. There are several factors which have to be taken note of before a decision is taken. The judges said that furthermore the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act also provides for a detailed procedure in this regard. The prayer sought for by the petitioner is premature and based on his representation the court cannot compel the authorities to take action. Unless the government takes a decision, reclassification cannot be done. “The reclassification of an area as continuous building area would ensure to the advantage of certain residents who genuinely want to put up construction within the permissible limit. Equally, it would pave the way for persons to further violate and make illegal constructions. In fact, there would be very many cases where applications would be made for regularisation of the construction made earlier on the ground that the area has been reclassified as continuous building area,” observed the judges. The judges said that it is left open to the petitioner to pursue his representation in accordance with law and disposed of the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-denies-relief-in-plea-to-reclassify-land-parcels-in-tirunelveli/articleshow/83524342.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Nagpur||Only 1 police complaint about machinery theft of Rs26k from MAPL unit||Nagpur: The mystery of heavy machinery worth crores missing from the plant of Maharashtra Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals Limited (MAPL), Nagpur, turned murkier after it came to light on Monday that only one police complaint was filed about machinery theft so far, in 2016. The FIR said the cost of stolen machinery was just Rs Rs 26,000. Interestingly, the FIR was not lodged by Pune-based Hindustan Antibiotics Limited (HAL), the parent company of the MAPL and a government of India undertaking, but by Bombay Security Services, Amravati, which had deployed guards at the plant. TOI on Sunday reported that heavy machinery was found missing from the plant after an inspection by joint director of industries AP Dharmadhikari, former employee and union leader of the plant Suresh Gotmare, representative of former nominee director in MAPL—Environmental Engineering Inc (EEI)-- Sudhir Paliwal on May 17. They visited the plant on directives of guardian minister Nitin Raut who was exploring the possibility of resuming the plant for production of vaccine, oxygen and medicines related to Covid. Gotmare and Paliwal said the cost of missing machinery, equipment and materials is worth around Rs Rs 50 crore as per market value today. After TOI’s report, MIDC police headed by PI Yuvraj Hande on Monday verified the FIR lodged by Bombay Security Services owner Ramesh Upadhyay on April 14, 2016. In the FIR, Upadhyay said that security guard Chandrashekhar Shelke between April 1 and 11 observed gate and windows of the plant broken and parts of machinery stolen from the first floor. The police then conducted inspection and reported the cost of stolen machinery as Rs Rs 26,000. An offence under section 454, 457 and 380 of IPC too was registered against unidentified persons, according to the police records. Another complaint was lodged with MIDC police by guard Shelke on December 30, 2020, which was related to theft of scrap. He also identified number plate of the vehicle and informed the police. An offence under section 379 of IPC was registered and the thieves were nabbed. As per Gotmare and Paliwal, the plant was shut in 2003. HAL appointed Bombay Security Services in 2002. Gotmare told TOI, “First of all missing of such heavy machinery is itself suspicious. Now, it is very much clear from the records of MIDC police that majority of machinery were not stolen. Also, the HAL, which never lodged any complaint with police, should bring back the machinery and resume the plant for the pandemic,” he said. HAL managing director Nirja Saraf did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages. On August 21, 2015, the then union minister of state for chemicals and fertilizers, Hansraj Ahir, had announced revival of the plant. Ahir, the then CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari, Paliwal and former employees had found the machineries intact. As per report of the Committee on Public Undertakings submitted in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on January 29 this year, the HAL had informed the committee of MPs that MSTC Limited was appointed as auctioning agency for MAPL’s plant. Even, the committee had recommended to sell the MAPL assets and repay dues.

---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Scribe found dead, kin claim murder by liquor mafia he had exposed||PRAYAGRAJ: A Pratapgarh-based news channel journalist was found dead in mysterious circumstances late on Sunday night. As the incident took place a day after the victim had expressed apprehensions of being attacked by the liquor mafia, police registered a case of murder in connection with the death on the complaint of his wife. Initially, the case was being treated as that of an accident after some eye-witnesses told the police that they saw journalist Sulabh Srivastava’s motorcycle hit a roadside pole late on Sunday night and then rammed into the hand pump before the victim hit the ground. He was rushed to hospital where he passed away. However, the police lodged a case of murder after Sulabh’s wife in her complaint stated that he was receiving threats from a local 'unidentified' liquor mafia whom he had exposed in his online stories in the recent past. Additional Director General of Police (ADG) Prayagraj Zone Prem Prakash said the threat angle would be thoroughly probed and action initiated accordingly. Prem Prakash admitted that Sulabh had sent him his complaint on WhatsApp about a threat from the liquor mafia a few hours before the incident -- at around 1.40 on Sunday afternoon -- which he had forwarded to the SP for further action. The ADG said Sulabh had met the SP thereafter and was satisfied with the assurance given to him by the officer. The incident saw opposition leaders including AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and TMC president Mamata Banerjee take to twitter to attack the government over the law and order situation in the state. The Editors Guild of India, too, issued a statement criticizing the UP Police for not taking Sulabh's complaint seriously. Reports said it was around 11 pm on Sunday when Sulabh was found lying by the roadside near a brick kiln in Sukhpal Nagar by some labourers unloading some material from the truck. One of the labourers told the police that he saw Sukhpal’s motorcycle first hitting a pole and then ramming into a hand pump. Sulabh suffered injuries on his forehead and mouth and was rushed to the hospital where he passed away. On the basis of the eye-witness account, the police initially summed up the incident as that of death in a road accident. What came as a twist in the tale was a letter that surfaced in the social media that Sulabh had addressed to ADG, Prayagraj Zone, and apparently written on Saturday in which he expressed apprehensions of a backlash from the local liquor mafia whom he had exposed in his online stories for his channel. In the letter he said he was being followed by some unknown individuals whenever he ventured out of his house and expressed concern about the security of his family and himself. Subsequently on Monday morning Sulabh’s wife Renuka also told the police that her husband was under stress because of the ‘threats’ and talked about the letter that he had sent to the ADG. “On Sunday night, Sulabh had gone to cover an illegal arms factory that was unearthed in a village in Lalganj police circle. At around 11 pm, I received the news about my husband’s accident. Later, he was declared dead at the hospital,” Renuka said. In her written complaint Sulabh’s wife cited the contents of same letter as a possible reason behind her husband’s death which she described as a murder. She also stated that the crime was dressed up in a manner to make it look like a road accident. On the basis of this complaint Kotwali police police lodged a murder case against unidentified accused. A team of senior police officials, including ADG (Prayagraj zone) Prem Prakash and SP (Pratapgarh) Akash Tomar, on Monday inspected the incident site and carried out investigations. Meanwhile Pratapgarh MP Sangam Lal Gupta has written a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath urging him to offer compensation to the kin of the deceased and government job to his wife. He also sought a detailed probe into the incident. On the other hand, AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi and SP national president Akhilesh Yadav took to Twitter to attack the government. Priyanka said liquor mafia is on a murder spree from Aligarh to Pratagarh and the government is silent. SP president Akhilesh Yadav also asked the BJP government to order a high-level probe and tell the people why security was not provided to Sulabh apprehension of an attack from the liquor mafia. TMC chief Mamta Banerjee also attacked the UP government on the issue. "Sad to see that despite "democracy & freedom" being a part of our ethos, we are unable to save lives who are working tirelessly towards unfolding the truth," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/scribe-found-dead-kin-claim-murder-by-liquor-mafia-he-had-exposed/articleshow/83526066.cms||Kapil Dixit
---||Lucknow||Ayodhya to get Rs 400 crore bus station, 4-lane road to airport||LUCKNOW: Expecting a massive inflow of people into Ayodhya once the Ram Temple is ready, the UP government has announced two key infrastructure development projects for the city which were given a green signal by the cabinet on Monday. These are a bus station for which Rs 400 crore has been sanctioned and expansion of the road from Ayodhya-Sultanpur stretch to the upcoming airport to a four-lane road. Government spokesperson and MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh said the bus station will be located near the upcoming cultural centre. “The land in question, a 3.64 acre plot, belongs to the culture department which will be transferred free of cost to the transport department for the development of the bus station. It will link Ayodhya with excellent bus service to important centres like Gorakhour, Azamgarh, Ballia, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Shravasti etc,” he said. The cabinet approved Rs 20.17 crore for the expansion of the airport road to a four-lane road. Singh said the Ayodhya-Sultanpur road is already congested and once the airport becomes functional along with the completion of the Ram Temple, the road will witnesses very heavy traffic. The road which is to be expanded is a 1.5 km stretch which bifurcates towards the right from the Ayodhya-Sultanpur road at the 140km mark. This is also the main connection to the Maharshi Dashrath Medical College, CRPF Camp, RAF Camp and the proposed plastic engineering college. The land is currently with the department of secondary education which will be transferred to the transport department. This land will also be transferred free of cost to the transport department by the Anupshahr nagar palika parishad for construction of a bus station. The cabinet approved of the transfer owing to the “poor financial condition of the transport department”. With the construction of the bus stop, transport on the Kaushambi, Ghaziabad, Delhi, Meerut, Bareilly, Haldwani, Haridwar, Aligarh, Badaun routes would be strengthened. The cabinet also gave nod to expenditure of Rs 284.21 crore for two flyovers in Prayagraj. One is a four-lane flyover at the Subedarganj railway station near the GT Road to Airport road. Another two lane one will come up at the GT Road junction, from Chaufatka in the direction of Kanpur. For development of tourism infrastructure in cities like Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Ayodhya, Prayagraj and Agra, the cabinet approved a proposal to authorise local development authorities to take up construction and repair work of tourism related infrastructure. They earlier had to wait for construction agencies to carry out work which was leading to a delay in implementing projects. The cabinet also gave nod to the funding for the upcoming 120 MLD sewage treatment plant on the Ghaziuddin Haider canal to the Gomti river near 1090 Crossing in Lucnow under the AMRUT scheme. Under this, the central contribution to the project will be Rs 88.53 crore, state contribution Rs 129 crore and that by the Lucknow Nagar Nigam about Rs 80 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-to-get-rs-400crore-bus-station-4-lane-road-to-airport/articleshow/83526100.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: ‘Revenue department order was erroneous’||KOZHIKODE: The controversial order of revenue department dated 24-10-2020, which allowed felling of trees on assigned land and led to mass felling of centuries-old rosewood trees in Muttil in Wayanad and other places, was opposed by the law officer while giving a legal opinion to forest and revenue officers in Wayanad. Government pleader and public prosecutor in Wayanad advocate Joseph Mathew had given a legal opinion to the query by south Wayanad DFO on Jan 4 stating that the revenue department order was ‘erroneous and went against legal principles as it attempts to override statutory provisions by executive orders’. He had stated that the GO violated the provision and purpose of the enactment of Section 4 of Kerala Preservation of Trees Act 1986 (KPT Act) which states that no person shall, without the previous permission in writing of the authorized officer, cut, uproot or burn, or cause to be cut, uprooted or burnt, any tree. As per Section 2 of the act, the word tree includes sandalwood, teak, rosewood and other trees. He also stated that the points raised in para four of the revenue department order stemmed from a misreading of Section 22 of KPT Act which said that the assignee shall not cut any tree standing on such land at the time of assignment without previous permission in writing of the authorized officer. Mathew pointed out that KPT Act did not exempt those trees for which value (price) has already been paid under Rule 10(3)(a) and Rule (10) (3) (b) at the time of assignment under Kerala Land Assignment Rules 1964 and it does not exempt those assignees who had paid value for trees reserved and those who have not paid any value for trees reserved. To the query by the DFO whether the ownership of trees, which were present at the time of assignment of land and which have been reserved by the government, rested with the government in the wake of the revenue department order, the legal opinion had clearly stated that any tree which existed in such land during the time of assignment will be the property of government and cutting and removal of such trees will be subject to permission from the authorized officer. "The circular does not permit to cut and remove the trees reserved to government which is mentioned in the Pattayam," read the legal opinion. It also stated that para five of revenue department order had made a serious error by failing to recognize Section 6 of the amended Kerala Promotion of Tree Growth in Non-Forest Areas (Amendment) Act, 2007 which says that every owner of non-forest land in a non-notified area shall have the right to cut and transport any tree other than sandalwood tree, standing on his land provided that the provision of this sub section shall not apply to trees, if any, reserved by the government at the time of assignment of such land or trees standing on any land notified under Section 5 of KPT Act or area notified by Custodian under Kerala Forest (Vesting and Management of EFL Lands) Act 2003. Mathew is learnt to have given a legal opinion to Wayanad collector along similar lines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/revenue-dept-order-was-erroneous/articleshow/83535730.cms||---

A crime branch team, headed by inspector Vinayak Gaikwad of the anti-narcotic cell, arrested Prasanna Balasaheb Shinde (22) of Wadgaon Budruk and Saurav Lahu Umare (21) of Hingne Khurd. “It is suspected that the duo had purchased the narcotic drugs from a Nigerian peddler in Mumbai. Shinde is pursuing his BCom final year studies and Umare is a second-year BBA student,” Gaikwad said. “The duo had become addicted to drugs during their college days. They started peddling such banned substances to make some money for buy drugs,” the officer said. A case under the provisions of The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act was registered against them with the Sinhagad road police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-students-arrested-with-drugs-worth-rs1-3-lakh/articleshow/83526120.cms||---
---||Navi-mumbai||Navi Mumbai: Contractor for fort restoration had warned watch tower would crash||NAVI MUMBAI: Officials of Savani Heritage Conservation Pvt Ltd, engaged to restore and beautify Belapur fort, claimed its watch tower portion collapsed due to delay in granting permission to restart work. The contractor had written to Cidco in April last year that work had to be carried out, as they had removed the roof of the 40-ft watchtower and sought permission to restart pre-monsoon work. The contractor obtained an NOC Archaeological Survey of India. Aabhas Prakash, a business associate with Savani, said, “Our firm was allotted work in May 2019. But actual work started in December 2019. But some political activists objected to the work, and brought a stay order from archaeology department. Hence, Cidco told us to stop work.” Prakash said, “For periodic inspection, a committee was formed of officials of ASI, Cidco and consultant Kimaya Architects, appointed by Cidco. Even after inspection, there was a delay in granting permission to start work.” “After MLA Manda Mhatre wrote to minister of cultural affairs Amit Deshmukh to intervene, we received an NOC from ASI on March 4, 2021. But, due to Covid’s second wave, ASI officials were not available for inspections. Hence, from March 22, work came to a standstill. As we had opened the watch tower roof, rain water seeped through its ruined structure, and a huge portion collapsed during heavy rain on Saturday,” Prakash added. “Allegations that we are using cement to fix stones are baseless. We set up a plant for manufacturing lime concrete and lime water, whose mixture is used to fix the huge stones. We completed only 20% work,” he said. A Cidco official said, “We alone cannot be blamed for delay. From May 28, 2019, till December 11, 2019, only preparatory work was done, as drawings for heritage structures were issued only on December 11, 2019. Then lockdown started from March 23, 2020, till September 22, 2020, and as per government norms, minor activities could be carried out. Work was again suspended from January 1, 2021 till March 11, 2021 for want of an NOC from archaeology department. Thereafter, work stopped from April 23, 2021, till date after a representative of archaeology department directed that work stay suspended.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-contractor-for-fort-restoration-had-warned-watch-tower-would-crash/articleshow/83527925.cms||George Mendonca
---||Amritsar||Punjab: Anil Joshi aides’ ‘meeting’ with SAD leader sets rumour mills abuzz||AMRITSAR: Rumours of BJP MLA Anil Joshi’s associates meeting a senior Akali leader over the possibility of him joining the SAD and contesting elections from a “safe and suitable” constituency did the rounds on Monday. Incidentally, Joshi also skipped the core committee meeting of the state BJP held here on Sunday. Sources said the meeting was held in Amritsar, where, if he joins SAD, he may be fielded from Tarn Taran, to which he belongs and where he started his political career. “The situation is not very favourable for Joshi in the BJP since he not only censured the Central leadership but also gave an ultimatum of 15 days,” sources said. When contacted, Joshi said these were just rumours spread by those who “were scared of his influence and the developmental work carried out by him in Amritsar-North assembly constituency.” Earlier, it was rumored that Joshi would contest on SAD ticket from Amritsar North constituency and when they gave North seat to BSP, it was now being rumoured that he would be given ticket from Tarn Taran, he said. “Why would I go to Tarn Taran? I live in Amritsar, my family and my constituency is in Amritsar,” he said. When asked whether he would contest the 2022 assembly elections on BJP ticket, Joshi said, “Let the party first make a conducive atmosphere for elections, I am not keen to contest elections but to save BJP.” Amritsar BJP president Suresh Mahajan said, “Yes, I have heard the rumors but these are just rumors and there is no evidence so far.” However, he said that the party had invited Joshi to attend the state core committee meeting chaired by state BJP president Ashwani Sharma on Sunday but he didn’t come. SAD spokesman Daljeet Cheema denied having any information about the meeting. Another BJP leader from Majha who didn’t wish to be named also dismissed the possibility of Joshi leaving the BJP and joining some other political party. “As far as I know Joshi, he is a staunch member of the Sangh Parivar and can’t leave BJP. Maybe he has some difference of opinion over the farmers issue,” he said. He added that Joshi’s outburst, which came after almost an year of the farmers’ agitation and at a time when parties were distributing tickets to their candidates, was surprising.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/joshi-aides-meeting-with-sad-leader-sets-rumour-mills-abuzz/articleshow/83527922.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Senior inspector Krishna Indalkar said, “Waghmare, a resident of Shewalewadi, was detained in April in a murder case registered with the Bharati Vidyapeeth police. As he was a minor, he was released from the observation home.” “On Sunday night, one of the arrested men, who was on friendly terms with Waghmare, called Waghmare to his house at Parvati foothills for collecting a mobile phone which the latter desired to have. The unsuspecting victim reached Parvati foothills for collecting the phone but soon realised that it was a trap set up by the arrested men and their absconding aides. They launched a brutal assault on him,” said Indalkar. The senior inspector cited preliminary investigation and said revenge was the motive behind the attack as the attackers held the victim responsible for their friend’s murder in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/six-arrested-on-charge-of-teens-murder/articleshow/83526098.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid ‘The Silent Tormentor’ has upped risk of abuse for elderly||MUMBAI: “The days seem to last too long.” “I want someone to just be with me.” “I find myself waiting for people to call more than ever before.” An increasing sense of despondency and fractured communication with family members were among the chief feelings conveyed by senior citizens in a recent nationwide survey titled ‘The Silent Tormentor —Covid-19 and the elderly’ released by the NGO HelpAge India on World Elder Abuse Awareness Day on June 15. In the report, over 60% said the risk of elders suffering abuse had increased during the pandemic. Conducted through telephonic interviews in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Chennai in April and May, the survey aimed to understand the toll of the pandemic on senior citizens and included not only the voices of 3,000 elders living in both households and old-age homes, but also over 500 caregivers, including family members, nurses and old-age home attendants. More than half the elderly interviewees had family members who ‘worked/studied from home’ during the lockdown, but nearly a third of them felt alienated despite the proximity. Almost six out of 10 elderly respondents reported their daily routine was getting affected by the WFH or study-from-home set-ups of their family members. Dr Arun John of The Vandrevala Foundation said lockdown-induced claustrophobia translated into a number of calls from senior citizens on their mental health helpline, particularly between the first wave and the second wave of Covid-19. “Some asked if they should write a will. Some said they didn’t know if they would be able to survive the second wave,” said 67-year-old Dr John, who himself felt boxed in by protective kids who didn’t let him step out during the recent lockdown. Rohit Prasad, CEO, HelpAge India, said while the focus has been on the physical health of the elderly, “few have noticed the dreadful impact the pandemic was having on their mental health and well-being.” A recent news report mentioned the total number of calls received by Elderline, the new central-government-led helpline, had increased from 475 calls on May 17 to 20,000 on June 3. Many of these were about health and emotional issues. In the HelpAge India survey, too, emotional abuse (60.1%) emerged as the main form of abuse, followed by physical abuse (58.6%). Acknowledging this increase in verbal abuse, the study attributed it to the pressures of working from home or the impact of job losses and the responsibility on caregivers. In fact, salary cuts and job losses, the survey found, made caretaking more challenging for family members. In old age homes, nearly 44% of the respondents said the staff shortage was a source of stress. “What was disturbing was the misinformation about vaccination most elders had,” said Prakash Borgaonkar, head, Maharashtra & Goa, HelpAge India. He said over 41.8% of the respondents expressed unawareness of any vaccines. Delhi reported the maximum percentage of respondents believing the vaccine was not really important for them (22.6%), while another 23.8% reported not knowing about it. Almost 40% respondents who had not got the second dose in Bengaluru said they feared more side-effects, while 22.2% of such respondents in Mumbai stated “there is no such thing as Corona”. Prasad underlined the need for the government, community and private sector to work together to bring in elder-friendly policies and programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-the-silent-tormentor-has-upped-risk-of-abuse-for-elderly/articleshow/83524408.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

While residents were thrilled to visit these stores, shopkeepers were also happy to see them. Tea stalls opened in many parts across the city, but in some places people did not adhere to Covid-19 norms and were sipping on tea in the shops, though it is not allowed. Some even brought vessels to buy tea, which is being sold at a higher price at about Rs 15 each cup. “Rising prices are making it difficult to welcome our customers with a rebate, or price cut,” said S Pandi, a tea stall owner. Salons saw a large turnout in the morning as people were desperately in need of a haircut or shave. Some offered sweets to the customers as a welcome gift. However, customers and shopkeepers were extra cautious. For instance, many departmental stores in K K Nagar had ropes tied across the entrance. People also brought their electrical goods to service centres for repair work. “The coil of my ceiling fan burnt off during this summer and I couldn’t replace it or buy a new one. Some online sites had the products, but I have not received the fan I ordered a week ago,” said S Shanthini of Kamarajar Salai. Customers of Tasmac shops maintained social distancing in the queues since morning. The crowds grew bigger in the evening when the shops were about to close.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/unlock-madurai-gradually-opens-up-on-a-happy-note/articleshow/83524406.cms||---

The MP has written to the Union minister of culture asking him to strengthen the epigraphy wing of the ASI. There are many stone inscriptions and sculptures at the museum attached to the Thirumalai Naicker Mahal, which are a treasure on their own. Venkatesan said that this particular inscription, which was brought down from Chennai is priceless in terms of the ‘Tamil’ language. This was inscribed under the guidance of a British officer, F W Ellis, who had made the scripter include a couplet from Thirukkural, which begins with the word ‘Irupunalum’ and ends with ‘Kuruppu’ and speaks on the importance of water. Ellis was an ardent lover of Tamil and translated the Thirukkural into English. “An Englishman’s love for Thirukkural, he even minted gold coins with Thiruvalluvar’s image on them, is an immeasurable treasure,” he said. The inscriptions talk about the drought in Chennai in 1818, when 27 wells were dug to overcome the crisis, and this stone was put on the wall of a well dug on the premises of Periyapalayathamman temple at Royapettah in Chennai. The stone inscription has attracted the interest of late chief minister M Karunanidhi as well. Venkatesan said that this inscription was lucky that it had found a place in a museum, and had been deciphered because there were more than 80,000 inscriptions found in the country, which were not properly documented. More than 70% of them are in the Dravidian languages of Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. On Monday, Venkatesan wrote to minister of culture Prahalad Singh Patel seeking that the epigraphy branch of the ASI, which has a legacy of 135 years, be strengthened. Estampages of the inscriptions have become fragile and hence the 80,000 inscriptions have to be digitized. The epigraphy branch of the ASI should be strengthened by creating new posts, as it is important for framing the true history and culture of the country. Awareness programmes should also be conducted to save the inscriptions due to ignorance of people, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/british-era-inscription-in-limelight-again-after-mins-visit/articleshow/83524394.cms||---
---||India||Maharashtra govt inclined to undertake door-to-door vaccination, HC told||NEW DELHI: The Bombay HC on Monday gave the Maharashtra government time till June 22 to take an appropriate decision on door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination for the elderly and disabled. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni also said that if the state government took a decision to begin such a drive before June 22, then it was free to implement the drive “immediately” without waiting for the court’s order. The court was hearing a PIL filed by lawyer Dhruti Kapadia seeking door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination for citizens above 75 years of age, and for those who were specially-abled or bedridden. The order came after the state and the BMC told the HC that the Maharashtra government had expressed an inclination to begin door-to-door vaccination drives for the disabled, bedridden, and such citizens, and for formulating a separate protocol for the same. The state’s counsel, Gita Shastri, told the HC that while news reports had quoted state health minister Rajesh Tope expressing a willingness to begin such doorto-door vaccination drives, she was yet to take instructions on when a final decision would be taken. The HC then asked BMC if it would follow the Centre or the state’s guidelines in case Maharashtra began a door-to-door drive.  BMC’s advocate, senior counsel Anil Sakhre, told the HC that the civic body would follow the state’s guidelines. Earlier, during the day’s hearing, the Union government’s counsel, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, had said it was not possible to make such door-to-door drives part of national policy, though some states, by ignoring the Centre’s advisory on vaccination, were holding such drives. He said the Centre’s standard operating procedure on the issue permitted “near-to-door vaccination”. “We accordingly adjourn the proceedings to June 22 to enable the state government to take an appropriate decision on the issue of door-todoor vaccination for the elderly and disabled,” HC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-govt-inclined-to-undertake-door-to-door-vaccination-hc-told/articleshow/83529386.cms||---

An officer from the Talegaon MIDC police told TOI that the 43-year-old woman was working at the mess when the incident occurred. “Two men on a motorcycle came to the mess and asked whether cigarettes were available. When the woman turned to tell them that she did not sell cigarettes, the pillion rider on the motorcycle snatched her gold chain and the duo rode away,” the officer said. In another robbery, which took place on Saturday evening in Nigdi, two youths in an autorickshaw entered into a brawl with a 21-year-old man alleging that the latter had caused damage to their vehicle and demanded Rs5,000 from him. When he refused to give them the money, the duo snatched his cellphone, worth Rs7,000, and a sum of Rs1,000. The Nigdi police have arrested the duo under Section 392 (robbery) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-snatch-gold-chain-worth-rs-60k/articleshow/83526125.cms||---
---||Kochi||Logs of illegally felled trees seized in Thrissur, Palakkad||THRISSUR: The forest special squad officials seized about 100 cubic meters of logs of illegally felled trees from eight locations in Thrissur and Palakkad districts on Monday. Forest officials said the detailed estimates of the seized logs were being taken and this would be completed in a day. The seized logs included teak and rosewood. Officials said the seized logs were of trees illegally felled from Machad and Pudukkad forest areas of Thrissur. The locations where seizures were made included Chowur, Wadakkanchery, Thrithala and Nenmara in Palakkad, Pattikkad and Amayur near Elanad. The logs were stacked mainly in sawmills. The raids were conducted by six teams, comprising a total of about 30 officials, simultaneously. Forest officials said only seven rosewood trees were found illegally felled from the Machad forest area and those logs have been seized. They said the reported burning of the stumps at Machad would not affect the investigation as the logs of those trees have already been seized. A team of BJP leaders, including the national executive member P K Krishnadas , visited the areas where the trees have been felled on Monday. Speaking to reporters later, Krishnadas alleged that chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and former revenue and forest ministers could not wash their hands off from the tree felling scam. In fact, the LDF had sourced much of its election funds from the illegal felling of trees. KPCC secretary John Daniel inaugurated a protest organized by KSU activists in front of the conservator’s office at Paravattani against the alleged illegal felling of trees, on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/logs-of-illegally-felled-trees-seized-in-thrissur-palakkad/articleshow/83520363.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Nagpur||Vaccine In Your Locality stopped, Nagpur muncipal corporation begins on-site special camps||NAGPUR: After implementing Vaccination In Your Locality for three weeks, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Monday discontinued the drive. The civic body has, however, started to hold on-site special vaccination camps for eligible people. Aimed at increasing the number of vaccine beneficiaries, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar had launched Vaccination In Your Locality in the last week of May and continued it till the second week of June. Joshi told TOI, “Our staff working at 98 permanent centres visited community halls, indoor sports stadiums etc situated in localities and inoculated eligible people. Not much people have remained unvaccinated now in selected areas. Therefore, we have stopped Vaccination In Your Locality from Monday.” On the same lines, zilla parishad (ZP) has started Vaccination In Your Village from the last week of May. Despite this, the number of beneficiaries has not increased to the desired level in the district. Joshi said, “Vaccination has been resumed at 98 permanent centres. We have started to organize special vaccination camps on-site. But the number of beneficiaries should be more than 50. We held the first camp in a hall of masjid in Itwari. One such camp will be organized in the auditorium of Bank of Maharashtra and at a hall in RBI Colony. Any government or private establishment can avail the benefit of the on-site camp. This facility is for the first and second dose of 45-plus people.” On the other hand, even as only one week is left for resumption of vaccination of 18-44 years group, the NMC and ZP are yet to receive any guidelines or instructions in this regard. Meanwhile, the number of vaccine beneficiaries further dropped in the lone private centre in Nagpur division — Kingsway Hospital. The state government had stopped vaccination of 18-44 group on May 12 after commencing it on May 1. Kingsway Hospital had started inoculation of 18-plus by directly procuring doses of Covishield from Serum Institute of India from May 31. Average vaccination there was 1,700 per day in the first six days. After the Centre, on June 7, announced resumption of free vaccination of 18-plus at government centres from June 21, the number of beneficiaries has started to decline at Kingsway. Vaccination reportedly did not take place in Kingsway on June 12 as less than 10 beneficiaries had booked appointment for the dose, while 21 were inoculated on Monday. The hospital is reportedly left with 7 vials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-in-your-locality-stoppednmc-begins-on-site-spl-camps/articleshow/83524498.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Delhi||Delhi: These online classes are helping people back on feet after Covid||NEW DELHI: Some members of Rising Riders, a cycling club, test positive for Covid-19 and some needed hospitalisation. To help them recover and not rush into their favourite rides around the city, the cycling club started Covid recovery online workouts, six days a week, with a trainer and nutritionist on board to advise recovering cyclists. Attended daily by 8-15 individuals, the online directions have provided a safer way for them to regain fitness with regular monitoring of vitals and overall health. Sumaya Dalmia too has been instructing fitness enthusiasts who have recovered from Covid to take it easy and not start on extreme exercises right away. The fitness expert had noticed people whose high-intensity workouts had been disrupted by the coronavirus wanted to get back to their routine quickly, leading to cardiac and pulmonary problems. Dalmiya and her team train close to 60 people a day. The fitness expert is happy to find that people want to resume their exercises under someone’s guidance and are taking post Covid recovery seriously. She regularly goes on social media to urge people to listen to their body, do breathing exercises, go for slow walks and constantly monitor their physical parameters. She has broken the workouts into phases: zero-four weeks, four-eight weeks and 12 weeks. She also recommends a six-minute walk test to help people assess their recovery without burning out. Unlike last year, when many of those who recovered from Covid recovery and restarted their gruelling fitness sessions only to suffer lung and heart complications, this time, the people are keen to learn about post-recovery measures, concurred Rishi Baveja, cofounder, Boxfit. Along with the high-intensity workouts that Boxfit is known for, all content related to recovery exercises was a huge hit among social media followers,” said Baveja. He said people think they have recovered but there is an unknown factor about this coronavirus and how it impacts your system. “We tell people to take it easy. We have noticed people feeling guilty at not being able to match their earlier endurance levels, so tell them not to be too hard on themselves," Baveja said. Boxfit, which trains almost 1,500 people online daily, currently has over 100 individuals following its post-Covid recovery modules. Baveja, however, judiciously stresses that fitness chains should not make any unsubstantiated claims because the health impact of Covid is still a subject of research. People resuming fitness activity under guidance and taking it slow is the way forward, reiterates Dr Sujay Shad, senior cardiac surgeon and director for heart transplant at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Shad cites the advice of the United States’ Centres for Disease Control and Prevention US' CDC to wait for three months and consult the doctor before returning to rigorous fitness activities. “The entire body is affected by Covid in ways that we don’t know yet. It is best to give the body some time,” said Shad. “Three months is about right according to our current understanding of the disease. That’s also the time we are taking to suggest elective cardiac surgery after Covid with hospitalisation.” The Pink Lotus Academia, an online and offline tutorial platform focused on Indian classical artforms and yoga, too has suggested asanas to its members as a way to build immunity, relax the body and mind, leading to faster healing post-Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/these-online-classes-are-helping-people-back-on-feet-after-covid/articleshow/83524465.cms||Amin Ali

With elections of the zila panchayat chairperson expected to be held between June 15 and July 3, and assembly elections months away, the ministers have been asked to undertake a massive public contact exercise during June and July. Government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said that during the ‘Block mein pravaas’ programme, ministers should cover every single block in districts of which they are in-charge by July. “The ministers will cover a block a day or at least two blocks a day and take up both government work and party work. Their focus will be on sampark (contact) and samvad (dialogue) with local people,” Singh said. Among activities which the ministers have been asked to take up are reviewing ongoing government schemes, visiting fair price shops, community and primary health care centres, especially which they have adopted, distribution of scheme related goods or certificates and tree plantation. The ministers should hold review meetings to assess implementation of development and social welfare schemes as well and inaugurate projects which are ready. For party work, the ministers have been asked to hold small meetings with local office bearers, keeping in mind Covid protocols. They should also try and meet all booth level party workers and especially visit homes of those workers who have lost family members to Covid. Singh said that the CM has said that Yoga Diwas on June 21 should be organised properly in all booths. All ministers have also been told to ensure that all party workers watch Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann ki Baat on June 27 and should also be present at a booth to watch it with the workers. More programmes are being organised from June 23 to July 6, the most important of which is a massive tree plantation drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/spend-max-time-in-blocks-yogi-tells-his-ministers/articleshow/83526133.cms||---
---||Kochi||Controversial order result of a series of meetings||Thiruvananthapuram: The revenue department’s controversial order allowing felling of trees on land assigned to farmers, issued in October, was the outcome of a series of meetings between forest and revenue department officials, including one attended by the then ministers of these departments. A letter from principal chief forest conservator (forest management) to the additional chief secretary (forests and wildlife) on June 6, 2020, mentions the joint meeting between the then revenue minister E Chandrasekharan and forests and wildlife minister K Raju regarding the issue of permitting the assignees to fell the trees in the land assigned to them. It says that the decision on felling the trees planted by farmers in the assigned land was taken in the meeting of the revenue and forest ministers. It also says that in the meeting held on December 5, 2019, the revenue minister had said that the government has decided that the trees planted by farmers in the land assigned to them belong to them. However, the letter also says that the circular issued by the revenue department on March 11, 2020, does not read in tune with the decision taken in the joint meetings. The circular issued by the then principal secretary (revenue) V Venu had said that the ownership of all the trees planted by farmers in the assigned land “and those retained in the assigned land except sandalwood trees” rests with the assignees. The latest controversial order, issued by principal secretary (revenue) A Jayathilak on October 24, 2020, also refers to this circular of March 11, 2020. The order slightly modified what has been explained in the circular to clarify that in addition to the trees planted by the farmers, “the ownership of all those trees except sandalwood trees the cost of which have been remitted by the assignees to the government while getting the land assigned to them” also rests with the assignees. It was this order that was widely misinterpreted by the lawbreakers to mow down the centuries-old rosewood trees illegally. Meanwhile, CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran has summoned E Chandrasekharan, K Raju, revenue minister K Rajan and former forests and wildlife minister Binoy Viswom to the CPI state headquarters to discuss the facts related to the issue. The CPI, that has always taken a pro-environment stand in all policy matters, is yet to give any official explanation on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/controversial-order-result-of-a-series-of-meetings/articleshow/83520406.cms||---

Idhate, a class-I officer, is due for retirement by end of this month, the ACB officials said.

She demanded the bribe in order to provide a favourable opinion or remark.” Deputy superintendent of police (ACB) Shrihari Patil said “The businessman is seeking TDR against the land taken over by the PMC for a road project. Idhate was to give opinion on the title of the land and other legal aspects of the TDR. She had demanded Rs2lakh bribe last month and the businessman had paid Rs1.5 lakh to her. She was harassing him for the remaining amount of Rs50,000 and the businessman approached us with a complaint.” Patil said, “The PMC provides TDR to the affected parties On the basis of the opinion or remarks passed by Idhate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-law-officer-held-in-rs50k-bribery-case/articleshow/83526154.cms||---

For this purpose, authorities are conducting a vaccination drive at the markets this week. Officials from the agriculture marketing department told the farmers that all of them would have to take the vaccine if they want to move back to the market premises. Deputy director of agriculture marketing P Vijayalakshmi said they were preparing a list of traders at Anna Nagar, Palanganatham and Chinna Chokkikulam markets. “The traders and the helpers would have to be vaccinated, we cannot compel them, but we have told them that they would have to take the vaccines for the safety of the traders and the customers,” she said. The vaccination camps would start at the markets on Wednesday and will continue for the next two days, she said. Meanwhile, the farmers, most of them from the rural areas of Madurai rued the lack of profits. Pandi, a trader at the Anna Nagar farmers’ market, said that they were not making any profit because they were operating on the pavements outside the market, and as there was no shelter they were forced to give away the vegetables for very low prices. “Carrots, cabbage and even tomatoes lose their freshness under the scorching sun and customers bargain with us on the grounds that the produce is not fresh, and we have to give it away for the price they ask,” he said. "Carrots priced at Rs90/kg had to be given away for Rs 60/kg", he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/farmers-must-take-jabs-first-for-entry-to-markets/articleshow/83524440.cms||---

Maharashtra clocked 8,129, lowest in the 104 days since March 2 (7,863). Also, for the first time since the second wave began in February, the city registered its lowest daily tally (530). This is the lowest since 461 was recorded 118 days back on February 16. Daily mortality figures also reported a dip, but the state added 1,392 from previous weeks to the total toll in an ongoing data reconciliation exercise. Since May 17, the state has added 19,116 unreported deaths in this manner. Officials say the reconciliation exercise is coming to an end in most districts and the additions will start declining by the end of this week.Total caseload in Maharashtra has now touched 59.1 lakh while cumulative deaths rose to 1,12,696. 1.6 lakh tests were done on Sunday as against the average of 2.2 lakh tests conducted during the weekdays. In Mumbai too, the low tally could be a function of lower tests over the weekend due to unavailability of staff on holidays. 20,133 tests were conducted in Mumbai as against 25,000 plus daily for two weeks. Dharavi, considered the barometer of the infection’s spread in the city, registered zero cases on Monday—the first time in the second wave. Number of daily deaths in the city dropped to 19, taking the toll so far to 15,202. Number of critical patients in the city's hospitals has dropped to 1,088, with 40% of ICU beds meant for Covid cases vacant. The doubling rate in the city has improved to 672 days”While we haven’t let down our guard, we are now focusing on vaccination,’’ said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. In Mumbai circle covering adjoining corporation areas too, daily tally was 1,457 and toll was 30 on Monday. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said the state has left the decision to impose restrictions on district administrations if cases go up. Relaxations will be given if the indicators show improvement. Active cases in the state dipped to 1.4 lakh of which 18,205 were in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cases-lowest-since-mar-2-mum-numbers-least-since-feb-16/articleshow/83528058.cms||Malathy Iyer

The cops have also prosecuted 30,682 motorists at a daily average of 1,022 each day. In almost all these cases, the cops have forwarded the cases to court with the prayer of seizing the vehicle. With the extension in curbs till July 1, the cops are keeping an eye on new relaxations, especially related to movement to private offices and malls announced by the state on Monday. E-passes are now mandatory for movement of private company employees. Unlike last year, e-passes have rarely been issued this time around and complaints of rejections have grown in the past month. A section of citizens kept pointing out the technical issues that made the application process cumbersome but Lalbazar failed to address the concerns. On Monday evening, the city police headquarters stepped in saying that just like other emergency workers and IT employees, these private sector employees can move around using their IDs on the first day. Eventually, they will need to produce a permission or undertaking from the company stating he or she is part of the 25% workforce chosen to attend office. “Technically speaking, private cars are not to be used for any purpose other than emergencies. The onus of proving the emergency will lie with the motorist,” said DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha. The police said its nakas in the city will continue. “Data has revealed that violations in June were higher than violations witnessed in May,” said an officer. The daily average prosecutions for violating Covid laws are comparable to last year’s lockdown, said Lalbazar sources. Vehicle seizures have almost doubled from last year, Weekend figures are worse than the last with the number of vehicle owners flouting the norms growing at a steady pace. The cops said that bikes and private cars alone have constituted over 95% violations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/19k-booked-in-a-month-focus-now-on-e-passes-for-private-firm-staff/articleshow/83522258.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

One patient suffered a cardiac problem, requiring him to be shifted to intensive care unit (ICU), said doctors. Sources in the FDA stated that around 200 vials of the drug had been distributed in Nagpur district some days back. Of these, 42 had been used on patients. FDA then received information of several patients developing reactions at different hospitals on use of this batch. FDA then stopped sale, distribution and use of the rest of the stock of the injections of batch number HIVP2103 till the report of the government analyst from the Drugs Control Laboratory is received. Assistant commissioner of FDA (in-charge) PM Ballal said drug inspector Lohkare has collected samples from 28 vials of Health Biotech’s Amphotericin B emulsion, which were sent to the laboratory for checking, but the stock has been called back from hospitals until the government analysis report is received. Ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon Dr Samir Choudhari of Neuron Hospital narrated the scary incident of how a patient nearly collapsed due to cardiac complications after taking Health Biotech’s Ambibio -E (Amphotericin B emulsion) injection but was saved by his team. “This particular injection was brought by the patient’s relative from outside the hospital. The patient had to be salvaged with some quick efforts after he slipped into cardiac complications immediately,” he said. ENT surgeon, and also secretary of the Association of Otolaryngologist of India, Vidarbha branch, Dr Samir Thakare said he had received information from various sources regarding reactions suffered by patients after being administered the emulsion. “There is information regarding Amphotericin B emulsion injection procured from outside hospitals triggering reactions. Apart from heart problems, anaphylaxis conditions or allergic reactions too developed in some patients taking the lupid emulsion,” he said. Thakare said Amphotericin B Lupid emulsions without filter can cause such reactions if there is particulate material left behind in it. ENT surgeon Dr Prashant Kothalkar of Seven Star Hospital said he had some patients who came back from their home town outside Nagpur with reactions after taking Amphotericin B emulsions. Commenting generally, Dr Kothalkar said mucormycosis is a ‘medical disease’, which requires team effort to manage the complications. “Treatment with Amphotericin requires lot of care and teamwork as it can lower potassium, sodium and magnesium, and also induce kidney and liver complications which must be attended and tackled simultaneously,” he said. ENT surgeon Dr Swata Lohiya said a couple of patients had developed complications and reactions like fever and chill after being administered Lupid emulsion, after which her hospital decided to send back the entire stock. “These kinds of reactions happen when one of the ingredients in the drugs is not fit for use,” she said, adding some patients are prone to develop reactions while some tolerate drugs in a better way. Dr Lohiya suggested using drugs of same brands and companies be administered to patients rather than changing them frequently for whatever reason. Dr Choudhari also said, “Generally, these anti-fungal drugs require proper storage, the cold chain has to be maintained with ice boxes and such precautions are required to be taken otherwise there are chances of reactions, reduced efficacy and so on.” BOX DRUG REACTION 200 vials of Health Biotech Limited’s anti-fungal drug Amphotericin B emulsion distributed around Nagpur some days back Mucormycosis patients had been given 42 vials of the drug, and some developed reactions, with one suffering cardiac problem On receiving information, FDA stopped sale, distribution and use of the rest of the stock of injections of batch number HIVP2103 28 samples sent for analysis at Drugs Control Laboratory||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fda-recalls-158-vials-of-ampho-b-emulsion-as-patients-suffer-reactions/articleshow/83524346.cms||Soumitra Bose

The deceased have been identified as Inderjit Kaur (34), a resident of Lalton Kalan, near Ludhiana, and her daughter Gagandeep Kaur (6). The injured are Inderjit’s husband Sukhveer Singh and car driver Ravinder Singh of Dugri. Police said Sukhveer, a carpenter, along with his wife and daughter, was going to Machhiwara on a motorcycle to visit his relatives. The family left their home around 8am. When they reached near Kubbe Toll Plaza, Sukhveer slowed down his bike after a truck ahead of him did so at a speed-breaker. But a car that was behind Sukhveer’s bike could not jam on the brakes in time. Its driver lost balance and hit Sukhveer’s bike, which in turn rammed into the truck. Inderjit and Gagandeep died on the spot and Sukhveer and the car driver sustained serious injuries.

---||Pune||Armed duo rob fuel pump manager of bag containing Rs 8.8 lakh cash||Pune: Two men, riding a scooter and brandishing a sharp weapon, robbed the manager of a petrol pump of Rs8.74 lakh on Monday afternoon. The incident occurred at 12.30pm near the railway crossing at Sayyadnagar in Hadapsar, when the manager, Balasaheb Ambhore (36), was on his way to a bank to deposit the cash collected over the weekend, police said. Ambhore was riding a scooter when the duo overtook and intercepted him. They hurled abuses at him and, brandishing the weapon, snatched the bag containing the cash. The Wanowrie police are examining CCTV footage recovered from the spot, but the visuals are not clear, an officer said. “Ambhore was heading towards a public sector bank in Kalepadal when the suspects overtook his two-wheeler at a high speed and stopped in front of him. Both the suspects were wearing masks,” senior police inspector Deepak Lagad said. “The duo at first hurled abuses and then, the pillion rider pulled out a sharp weapon. Before Ambhore could raise an alarm, the duo snatched his bag and fled,” he added. Police said that Ambhore raised an alarm, but passers-by and other motorists did not help. “We are studying CCTV footage from different establishments located on the road,” Lagad said. Ambhore later lodged a complaint. A case has been registered under sections 397 (robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/armed-duo-rob-fuel-pump-manager-of-bag-containing-rs-8-8-lakh-cash/articleshow/83526182.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Act now to save Ajni trees, greens urge Aaditya Thackeray||NAGPUR: After announcing the new rules of the tree policy, the state government on Monday released the minutes of the cabinet meeting. While it is not known when the new norms will come into force, city environmentalists have appealed to state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray not to ‘wait for formalities’ and urgently intervene in the Ajni Vann case to save thousands of trees. TOI had recently reported that once rules come into force, they are likely to make things difficult for the ambitious Inter Modal Station (IMS) project, for which around 5,000 old trees at Ajni are scheduled to be cut in the first phase. The new norms state that if more than 200 trees aged 5 years or more need to be felled, the case will be referred to Maharashtra State Tree Authority. However, experts said the city should not lose such dense green cover just because implementing the new rules will take time. “The government has already recognized the fact that trees more than 50-year-old are heritage trees, and that the decision of felling more than 200 trees should not be in the hands of the local civic body. What if by the time the rules come into force, we have already lost Ajni Vann? It will be an irreparable damage and we appeal to state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray to immediately intervene,” said young green crusader Kunal Mourya. Stating that the new rules don’t state anything about pending tree-felling proposals, lawyer and activist Ankita Shah said, “To save green lungs facing immediate threat, the state should either expedite the process of implementing new rules or bring in a provision to put such projects on hold. Thackeray, being a youth icon and a champion for environment, should step in and save Ajni Vann like he did at Aarey.” In Nagpur, current projects that include felling more than 200 trees are IMS phase 1 at Ajni, felling 249 trees at Futala by MahaMetro, and felling 250 trees at the premises of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) for Ajni metro station’s parking area, besides some other projects. Environmentalist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani said that till the existing law is amended, state should put a stay on proposed projects involving felling of more than 200 trees. “Despite receiving thousands of objections, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has not conducted the mandatory public hearing. Now, all these cases should directly get transferred to the state tree authority,” she added. The last date for submitting objections for tree felling at Ajni is June 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/act-now-to-save-ajni-trees-greens-urge-aaditya/articleshow/83524493.cms||Manka Behl

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Zila panchayat chief polls to be held before July 3||LUCKNOW: Political temperature in Uttar Pradesh is set to rise on Tuesday when the State Election Commission (SEC) issues the notification for the election of zila panchayat chairpersons. The election commission has informed the Panchayati Raj department that it is ready to conduct polls between June 15 and July 3. Additional chief secretary (Panchayati Raj) Manoj Singh issued the notification to this effect on Monday on behalf of the Governor. The notification, however, did not mention the election for 826 kshetra panchayats. Sources said the department would soon seek inputs from the panchayati raj directorate before issuing a notification. Zila panchayat chairpersons for 75 districts will be elected by 3,050 members in various districts. Jaunpur has maximum 83 wards followed by Sitapur and Lakhimpur Kheri which have 79 and 72 wards, respectively. Gorakhpur, the home turf of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has 68 wards. Sources in the SEC confirmed that a formal notification for zila panchayat polls would be issued on Tuesday after which observers would be appointed. The elections for zila panchayat chairpersons has turned into a prestige issue for all political parties, especially the BJP which has decided to field its functionaries in zila panchayat wards. BJP faces a stiff challenge from the opposition, mainly the Samajwadi Party. The election has also attained significance for the BJP as it seeks to maximise its footprint in rural parts of the state to take on regional parties, SP and BSP, ahead of the state assembly elections next year. The issue is said to be at the core of hectic activities in the BJP camp during the recent visits by party’s national general secretary (organisation), BL Santhosh, and national vice-president, Radha Mohan Singh. BJP sources said the party had opened back channel negotiations with independent candidates who had won a significant number of wards. Their support to candidates backed by various parties will hold significance in zila panchayat elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/zp-chief-polls-to-be-held-before-july-3/articleshow/83526179.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Chandigarh||Post-matric scholarship ‘scam’: AAP holds protest||CHANDIGARH: Unruly scenes were witnessed as Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders were rounded up by the police as they staged a protest close to the official residence of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh in Chandigarh on Monday, alleging irregularities in the post-matric scholarship scheme for Dalit students. Chandigarh Police detained the AAP leaders and took them to the Sector 17 police station in buses. AAP had announced its plan to gherao the CM’s residence and launch a hunger strike chain. AAP leader Manwinder Singh Giaspura started the hunger strike in police custody itself. Later, there was sloganeering by AAP workers outside the police station when party leaders were released in the evening. Leader of opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema said, “At the behest of the government, the police violated our constitutional right to protest. We will go on hunger strike in front of the offices of deputy commissioners in all districts of the state on June 15.” Earlier, AAP MLAs Saravjit Kaur Manuke, MLAs Master Baldev Singh Jaito, Principal Budhram, Jagtar Singh Jagga Hissowal, Manjit Singh Bilaspur and Kulwant Singh Pandori had marched towards the CM’s residence. Cheema said in four years, the Congress has failed to conduct an audit and it has given a clean chit to cabinet minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot. “Two lakh students are unable to take exams as the finance minister has held back Rs 1,550 crore. The Congress government is anti-Dalit,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/post-matric-scholarship-scam-aap-holds-protest/articleshow/83528051.cms||---
---||Kochi||Sr Lucy Kalappura asked to move out of convent||Kochi: In a setback for Sr Lucy Kalappura, a prominent face in the historic nuns’ protest in Kochi demanding the arrest of Bishop Franco Mulakkal for allegedly raping a fellow nun, Apostolica Signatura, the highest judicial authority in the Catholic Church, has reportedly confirmed her dismissal from the Franciscan Clarist Congregation (FCC). Sr Ann Joseph, superior general of FCC, has written a letter dated June 13 directing the nun to vacate the convent at Karakkamala, Mananthavady. The letter said that there was no further legal remedy available to the nun to challenge her dismissal within the Catholic legal system. Meanwhile, Sr Lucy dismissed the reports and claimed that the statements of FCC were false and said that her petition was still pending before the Vatican. She said that she suspects whether the documents were true and that her advocate was yet to convey to her about the development. “Even if they have passed such an order, it is without hearing my side. It is a denial of justice and part of a conspiracy by FCC superiors. I will continue at the convent until my side is properly heard,” said Sr Lucy. The congregation had found fault in her for publishing a book of poems without permission, registering a car in her own name, availing a loan without seeking permission and for learning to drive and getting a license without the permission of her superiors, et al. “Please note that you have availed all the three levels of appeals possible within the Catholic legal system and in all these levels your recourse against the decree of dismissal are rejected. I would like to bring to your kind attention the fact that your right to continue as a member of the FCC is now definitively and irrevocably extinguished, and hence you lost your right to use the suffix FCC to your name and you no longer have the right and duty to wear the religious habit of the FCC hereafter,” said Sr Ann’s letter. The letter also said that apart from nuns only workers and guests can stay at convents and Sr Lucy, who doesn’t fall under either of the categories, has to vacate the convent within a week of receipt of the letter. It also warned the nun that any further continuation beyond the permitted time will be considered criminal house trespass and that FCC will seek legal recourse, if she decides to stay on at the convent. FCC also shared the news with superiors and nuns through a letter dated June 12 and termed the solution for the ‘heartbreaking’ issue as a gift from God.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sr-lucy-kalappura-asked-to-move-out-of-convent/articleshow/83520450.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Eatala Rajender joins BJP, says it is beginning of change in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Former health minister Eatala Rajender, who joined BJP in Delhi on Monday, dared the TRS government to order a probe by the CBI or a sitting judge into allegations of land grabbing by him and members of his family. Addressing a press conference in Delhi, Eatala said he will make every effort to strengthen the BJP in Telangana. He said many leaders and workers, who took part in the separate statehood moment, will join the BJP soon. “Our agenda is to end the autocratic rule in the state,” he said. “This is the beginning of a journey towards a big change in state politics,” he said. The former minister said Karimnagar has been at the core of any change Telangana has seen. “One or two ministers in KCR’s cabinet have told me that the change will begin from Karimnagar this time as well,” he said. BJP Telangana affairs in-charge Tarun Chugh described Eatala as “one of the biggest faces of southern India” during the joining of the latter into the party. Eatala came down heavily on the TRS government alleging that all the democratic systems have been dismantled. “There is no scope for protests or questioning in the state. There is no opposition. There is no free functioning of ministers in the government,” he alleged. “It (TRS government) has all the powers and the entire administration is under its control. There is no point in any investigation done by them and my wife has clarified enough on this. I am ready for an investigation by a sitting judge or the CBI.” Asked as to why he is raising his voice now if he felt there was no democracy when he was a minister, former minister said: “I have been speaking on this at various fora in the last few years. I am the one who said we are the true owners of TRS flag.” He said his comments on Rythu Bandhu scheme were wrongly interpreted. “I said there was no point in giving benefit to tax payers and instead they (government) can give more money to poor farmers.” Earlier, the former minister joined the BJP in the presence of Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan. The joining of Eatala was attended by all the state leaders, including Bandi Sanjay Kumar, and party national vice-president DK Aruna. Along with Eatala, Adilabad former TDP MP and Congress leader Ramesh Rathod, former TRS MLA Enugu Ravinder Reddy, former ZP chairperson Tula Uma, RTC employees’ union leader E Ashwathama Reddy and leaders from Osmania University Joint Action Committee also joined the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-joins-bjp-says-it-is-beginning-of-change-in-state/articleshow/83524482.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Ranchi||Ranchi residents comply with lockdown rules but fail to wear face masks||RANCHI: Residents of Ranchi city were among the most disciplined in following the rules during the complete lockdown imposed in the state on Sunday to stop the Covid-19 infection chain while Chaibasa and Giridhih fared poorly on this front. Ranchiites, however, were the highest violators when it comes to wearing of masks. During the complete lockdown, all commercial establishments barring the medical shops remained closed across the state. According to the figures issued by the state police headquarters, as many as 2,272 lockdown violations were reported from across the state. Three FIRs — two in Jamshedpur and one in Saraikela — were also registered against the violators while two persons were arrested from Saraikela. Of the 24 districts, Ranchi, Khunti, Simdega, Lohardgga, Saraikela, Latehar, Chatra, Dhanbad, Deoghar and Jamtara registered no case of violations like crowding, holding of events and movement without e-pass among others. SP (Ranchi city) Saurabh said, “People are much more cooperative now. We had also undertaken awareness drives, including the holding of flag marches, to ensure compliance of the norms.” SP (Khunti) Ashutosh Shekhar stated, “With the market remaining closed, people mostly remained indoors. There was no requirement to use force.” Meanwhile, Chaibasa with a figure of 41, recorded the highest number of lockdown violations followed by Giridih (27) and Jamshedpur (22). When it came to wearing masks, several districts, including Gumla, Lohardaga and Jamshedpur, registered no violation. In contrast, the highest amount of Rs 24,500 was collected for not wearing masks from 49 persons in Ranchi and Rs 23,000 from 46 persons in Giridih. It may be stated here that several districts, including Dhanbad, registered no incident of lockdown violation and non-wearing of masks. SSP (Dhanbad) Asim Vikrant Minz, however, said “The violation of the norms has come down sharply though it is not zero. Maybe some information reached the police headquarters late.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchiites-comply-with-lockdown-rules-but-fail-to-wear-face-masks/articleshow/83522241.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Santhal Pargana division accounts for only 10% of Jharkhand’s virus caseload, Pakur records lowest mortality rate||RANCHI/DUMKA: Despite the poor medical infrastructure, lack of ICU facilities and specialist doctors, all six districts of the Santhal Pargana division have effectively managed the Covid-19 pandemic than any other part of the state, data available with the state health department said. The six districts had contributed 10% of the state’s caseload and 7% of the total death toll. As of Sunday, Deoghar district under the division accounted for 3.10% of the caseload which corresponds to 10,646 cases while the remaining five districts had total cases in four digits each and contributed 23,026 cases to the state’s total of 3,43,304 cases. In terms of percentage, Godda recorded 1.67, Jamtara (1.58), Sahibganj (1.36), Dumka (1.34) and Pakur registered 0.73 of the state’s caseload. In the first wave, Pakur had earned the distinction of becoming the first Covid-free district on December 24, 2020. Even in terms of fatalities, the district had recorded 0.21% mortality rate, the lowest in the state during the first wave ending on March 31, 2021. Critics, however, believed that the fewer cases must be proportional to the testing rates in the division which has limited testing facilities and medical infrastructure. Refuting the claim, Pakur DC Kuldeep Choudhary said his district ranks sixth in the state in terms of conducting tests, most of which have been carried out on TruNat. “We were alert once the first wave started receding and long before the restrictions were clamped across the state by the health department, we had started screening people entering into the district. Those found positive were immediately sent to institutional quarantine as we were aware that the district had limited medical facilities,” Choudhary said. Though all six districts have one government-run hospital each, the standard of tertiary care is poor because of the lack of superspecialty centres and fully functional medical colleges. While Deoghar has a regional wing of AIIMS, only OPD services are operational there. Dumka, too, has a medical college and hospital with ICU bed facilities but it battles shortages of doctors and paramedical staff. It was because of infrastructure shortfalls that the Medical Council of India had restricted fresh admissions in the college. A Dumka-based social activist, who had extended help to families during the peak of the pandemic, said the death rate in the district is less because the government has recorded only institutional deaths. “When there is a lack of hospital, we cannot expect people to stay back in Dumka. Hundreds of people went to neighbouring Suri in Birbhum district of West Bengal, which is 60km from here, while several others went to Bhagalpur in Bihar for treatment. Some died on way and some others died in the course of treatment in neighbouring West Bengal and Bihar. These deaths are missing from the state records,” the activist said on condition of anonymity. Dumka civil surgeon A K Jha, however, contested the claim saying that under the NHM protocol, residents of Dumka have been registered with the district log, irrespective of the place they died during treatment. “Even if a patient was taken to Delhi and he or she died there, the entry was made in the district portal,” he said. At the same time, Jha admitted that there could be few cases in which the patients died at homes and never reached the hospital when the infection was at its peak. “To register such deaths, the state government is carrying out a survey in which the health department has no role to play and the district administration would collate all details. Once the survey is complete, we would be able to know if there is a large difference between reported and unreported deaths,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/santhal-pargana-div-accounts-for-only-10-of-jharkhands-virus-caseload-pakur-records-lowest-mortality-rate/articleshow/83521615.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: HEC slum-dwellers opposed to housing project seek MLA Pradeep Yadav’s help||RANCHI: Ahead of the state urban development department plans to restart the ground work for Centre’s ambitious Light House Project (LHP) at Jagannathpur in HEC area on Tuesday, a delegation of HEC Basti Bachchao Sangharsh Samiti met Poriyahat MLA Pradeep Yadav at his residence in Ranchi on Monday, seeking his intervention on the matter. Yadav has reportedly assured them that he will take up the issue with chief minister Hemant Soren soon. The Centre plans to help those whose annual income is below Rs 3 lakh through the project by building 1,008 flats for them in the HEC area. The total cost of the project is around Rs 133 crore. While the Union government will give Rs 5 lakh per flat, state will bear Rs 1 lakh while Rs 6.79 lakh is to be borne by the selected beneficiary. Mintu Paswan, the convenor of HEC Basti Bachchao Sangharsh Samiti, said, “We came to know that state urban development department is planning to resume work on the project tomorrow, following which we decided to meet Yadav to seek his help. In March, he had raised questions regarding the project in the assembly, stating that the beneficiaries will not be able to bear the cost. At today’s meeting, Yadav assured us of discussing the matter with the CM.” Asked why they are opposed to the project, Paswan said, “LHP is coming up on the only open ground in HEC area. Many are afraid of being displaced once the flats come up. We have been demanding the relocation of the site for a long period of time and will continue doing so.” On Tuesday, officials from the Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA), which is a unit of the state urban development department, are slated to visit the 7.5-acre site for soil testing. Apprehending resistance from the locals, DMA director J V Narayan Rao has allegedly written to Ranchi administration, seeking the deployment of cops. In April, the DMA officials’ plans to work on the project was met with resistance by the slum-dwellers who resorted to protest, forcing the officials to put the project on hold. Last week during a review meeting, the Centre came down heavily on the state urban development department for keeping the project on hold, sources said. According to Rao’s letter to the Ranchi administration, the Union ministry of housing and urban development has threatened to stall funds for LHP if there is any further delay in the commencement of the work. Although Rao didn’t respond to TOI’s calls, an official from the state urban development department said, “The foundation stone of the light house project was laid in January and the project is supposed to be completed within a year and the Centre is upset that nothing has been done yet. In April, soil testing attempts on two separate dates remained unsuccessful.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hec-slum-dwellers-opposed-to-housing-project-seek-mlas-help/articleshow/83521500.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand health department to conduct survey of Covid deaths to draw policy for relief package||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government is going to conduct a socio-economic survey in the state to assess the financial damages faced by families during the treatment of Covid-19 and the long-term impact of death of earning members on families. The survey has to be completed within a fortnight and is aimed at collecting information about the social and economic status of the families that have lost their earning members dued to Covid-19. The findings of the survey will be incorporated while drafting a welfare scheme which will be launched by the state government to provide assistance to such families. As per state health department records, a total of 3,983 people succumbed to the virus between March 15 and June 9 this year. The proposed welfare scheme which will be formulated based on the data collected in the survey aims at providing financial stability to these families. A letter in this regard was issued by additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh directing all deputy commissioners to monitor the survey on a personal level and send the collated information to the state unit of NHM by June 25. According to Singh’s letter, district-level representatives of World Health Organization (WHO) will also be pooled in for the work and a detailed questionnaire has been provided to districts to collect the exact information about the deceased and the status of the family members. Talking to TOI, Singh said: “The survey will provide us exact insights on the condition of families that have been hit due to Covid-19 and this will help us in forming a robust policy to help distressed families. I have also directed the authorities that during the course of survey if they come across a family which is in distress they should immediately make interim arrangements for them as per their needs.” The detailed questionnaire, which is a blue print for the survey, aims at collecting personal as well as health care history of the deceased. Apart from that, the survey will collect information like the annual income of the deceased, profession which he/she was engaged in and the number of dependents of the deceased. The survey will also capture details about whether the family has been covered under any social welfare schemes of state/central government and if not whether they are eligible for the same or not. Apart from this, the survey teams have also been directed to enlist whether the families are covered under National Food Security Act or not and do they own any agricultural land or not. According to sources in the health department, the proposed scheme will be a direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme. Meanwhile, distressed families that have been hit hard and have lost everything during the pandemic saw this as a ray of hope. “There have been three deaths in my neighbour’s family which include an elderly couple and their son who was around 38 years old. They have lost all their life savings on the treatment of the 38 year old but as his lungs had got damaged he couldn’t survive. He has a 15-year-old daughter who needs to be taken care of. So I think the government must bring in educational reforms, too, in the proposed welfare policy,” said Deepak Kumar, a resident from Lalpur area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/health-dept-to-conduct-survey-of-covid-deaths-to-draw-policy-for-relief-package/articleshow/83537949.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The department has also instructed all district education officers to start online classes on e-Vidya Vahini portal soon and asked all school principals to keep a tap on the attendance of teachers for the online classes. According to a government order, all teachers have to be present online though physical classes have been suspended after the outbreak of the pandemic. Salaries of teachers who do not attend the online classes will be put on hold, the order said. Vidya Murmu, the principal of a school in Musaboni area of the East Singhbhum district, said online teaching is very difficult in state-run schools as a large number of students do not have smartphones and internet connectivity is very poor in most places. She said since the outbreak of the pandemic, the government school students have suffered in terms of their education unlike their counterparts of private schools in urban areas, who usually come from financially sound families. She pointed out that the students have been trying to earn money to buy smartphones and cited the example of photographs that went viral on social media where young boys and girls were seen selling mangoes near the national highway in Ghatshila.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/in-kolhan-govt-to-provide-books-at-students-doorsteps/articleshow/83522031.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Tiger pugmark spotted in Lohardaga forests of PTR||RANCHI: The state forest department on Monday said it found fresh evidence of at least one tiger roaming around the Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR) command area. The news came as a huge relief for the forest officials who have been refusing to accept the 2018 nationwide tiger census which said there are no tigers in the PTR. The department said the fresh evidence included pugmarks and the killing of preys in the Lohardaga forest range of PTR last week. Following the findings, the state wildlife department is now in the process of installing close circuit television (CCTV) cameras at strategic locations between the forest corridor of Lohardaga and Latehar to capture visual evidence and pressed a team of trackers to locate its trail. State authorities kept refusing the 2018 census, saying the whole of the PTR was not properly covered during the exercise. Moreover, a tigress was also reportedly found dead in the reserve area after a tussle with a bison in February last year. The fresh evidence of a tiger in the area was found after this incident. Confirming the developments, the state’s chief wildlife warden, Rajiv Ranjan, said, “The pugmarks which we engraved on plaster of Paris (POP) established that it belongs to a female. The place of the pugmarks was located in the dense jungles of the Lohardaga district, which is connected to PTR range. We also found evidence of preys, the predator had killed. We are certainly excited with the developments as suggestive evidence has come after many months.” Sources said the department has ordered the installation of 10 CCTV cameras at strategic points. Ranjan said that while they are sure that the pugmark is that of a tiger, they are now trying to get visual evidence. “Tigers are generally shy animals and camera trapping is not always easy,” he said. Lohardaga’s divisional forest officer Arvind Kumar said they first got information that three cattle (two cows and an ox) were killed on May 24 in the jungles under Salaiya panchayat in Kisko block. “The following day, we sent a team to the spot to trace for pugmarks. Officials from PTR, too, had visited the area for the purpose. Later PTR officials confirmed that the pugmarks belonged to a female tiger,” he said. Kumar said although tiger movement in Lohardaga wasn’t uncommon in the past, but spotting of big cats in the district not reported in recent times. “Unlike elephants, tigers are territorial animals and are mostly restricted to their chosen place unless the ecosystem such as food and water are not available. While the summer was not acute this year, it may have ventured into this part for food,” he said. The next nationwide census is expected in 2022 but the state department is not in a position to provide the number of big cats in Jharkhand.

The birds were found dead near an under-construction building under Jageshwar Vihar police station in Gomia on Sunday. The incident has raised concerns of the residents and the local administrative officials. Following the incident, block animal husbandry officer Dr Suresh Prasad and forester Arun Bauri visited the spot to assess the situation. The veterinary doctor of the district health department, Mukesh Kumar, said that the swab, blood and cloacal samples of the dead birds have been sent to a lab in Ranchi for testing. A local doctor claimed that the birds could have died of Ranikhet disease. The disease is caused by a paramyxovirus of the genus Rubulavirus and affects the respiratory and nervous systems of birds. Sources said that Ranikhet disease is also known as Newcastle disease and is a highly contagious and fatal disease primarily found among poultry birds. Gomia BDO Kapil Kumar said, “The birds found dead are yellow-legged green pigeons, which are a common species found in the Indian subcontinent. It is the state bird of Maharashtra. The species feeds on fruit. They forage in flocks. They were found dead under a peepal tree.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/whiff-of-virus-in-death-of-four-green-pigeons-in-bok/articleshow/83521911.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand health department to conduct survey of Covid deaths to draw policy for relief package||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government is going to conduct a socio-economic survey in the state to assess the financial damages faced by families during the treatment of Covid-19 and the long-term impact of death of earning members on families. The survey has to be completed within a fortnight and is aimed at collecting information about the social and economic status of the families that have lost their earning members dued to Covid-19. The findings of the survey will be incorporated while drafting a welfare scheme which will be launched by the state government to provide assistance to such families. As per state health department records, a total of 3,983 people succumbed to the virus between March 15 and June 9 this year. The proposed welfare scheme which will be formulated based on the data collected in the survey aims at providing financial stability to these families. A letter in this regard was issued by additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh directing all deputy commissioners to monitor the survey on a personal level and send the collated information to the state unit of NHM by June 25. According to Singh’s letter, district-level representatives of World Health Organization (WHO) will also be pooled in for the work and a detailed questionnaire has been provided to districts to collect the exact information about the deceased and the status of the family members. Talking to TOI, Singh said: “The survey will provide us exact insights on the condition of families that have been hit due to Covid-19 and this will help us in forming a robust policy to help distressed families. I have also directed the authorities that during the course of survey if they come across a family which is in distress they should immediately make interim arrangements for them as per their needs.” The detailed questionnaire, which is a blue print for the survey, aims at collecting personal as well as health care history of the deceased. Apart from that, the survey will collect information like the annual income of the deceased, profession which he/she was engaged in and the number of dependents of the deceased. The survey will also capture details about whether the family has been covered under any social welfare schemes of state/central government and if not whether they are eligible for the same or not. Apart from this, the survey teams have also been directed to enlist whether the families are covered under National Food Security Act or not and do they own any agricultural land or not. According to sources in the health department, the proposed scheme will be a direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme. Meanwhile, distressed families that have been hit hard and have lost everything during the pandemic saw this as a ray of hope. “There have been three deaths in my neighbour’s family which include an elderly couple and their son who was around 38 years old. They have lost all their life savings on the treatment of the 38 year old but as his lungs had got damaged he couldn’t survive. He has a 15-year-old daughter who needs to be taken care of. So I think the government must bring in educational reforms, too, in the proposed welfare policy,” said Deepak Kumar, a resident from Lalpur area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-dept-to-conduct-survey-of-covid-deaths-to-draw-policy-for-relief-package/articleshow/83521516.cms||Gaurav Pandey

As per NMC data, 20 dengue patients have been reported in the city, while doctors say many more cases are suspected. Doctors also said that many cases of gastro and stomach infection too are being seen in people having history of attending social and other functions. Paediatric intensivist Dr Vivek Charde said with the onset of rainy season, cases of dengue and gastroenteritis are on the rise. “Children of all age groups, starting from a month to 18 years, are getting affected. The cases are rising because of increased gatherings in marriage functions and unhygienic food preparations.” “Dengue cases seem to be due to unchecked mosquito breeding in residential areas. We need to be extra careful about children for these illnesses along with Covid as rainy season has started and Covid restrictions have been lifted,” he said. Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said patients with complaints of viral fever, loose motion and vomiting can been seen these days, but it is not unusual. “The numbers are not at the epidemic level,” he said. Dr Amol Samarth, gastroenterologist and hepatologist, said it will take another two weeks to actually see the impact of water contamination or unhygienic food consumption among people. “As per my observation, people have become careful. They are maintaining hygiene and avoiding unhygienic food. The patient flow is routine for stomach infection, while jaundice cases are yet to be seen. It maybe that patients from neighbouring states have started coming to city,” he said. The prevalence of dengue has gone down by half until May first week as compared to the same period last year. The city has recorded six cases of vector-borne diseases from the 30 samples between January 1 and May 7. The highest number of suspects, 16, was reported to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) malaria and filaria department in May. Of these, only 14 tested positive. No dengue patient was reported in April, the peak of Covid. Also, no death took place this year from dengue while only one death was reported in June, 2020. In 2018 and 2019, the NMC had slapped notices and recovered penalties from schools, hospitals and other commercial establishments after mosquito breeding spots were found on their premises. The detection of new cases has, however, come as a surprise for officials as a survey had found people taking preventive measures during the lockdown period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/monsoon-spurs-dengue-gastro-stomach-infections/articleshow/83524631.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

For the first time, all these districts reported under 100 cases each, while none of them has more than 2,000 patients under treatment. With just 21,022 tests done, the region recorded 308 new cases. Fatalities increased by seven to 18 from a day before. Yet, the decline in cases was visible even with a higher number of per-day tests. On June 4, the region conducted over 45,200 tests, from which 1,451 came positive. Later, the number of tests too started coming down, correlating with the drop in prevalence of the disease. Three districts did not report any Covid death, and all reported three or fewer deaths barring Chandrapur, where six patients passed away. The day’s fewest cases were from Gondia (3), followed by Wardha (4). The highest came from Amravati (90). In contrast, the entire Nagpur division reported 95 cases. Recoveries continued to be higher than new cases at 1,155, with the highest coming from Nagpur (193). Wardha: The district recorded four Covid cases on Monday out of 624 test reports while 44 got discharged, leaving 325 under treatment. The caseload has now reached 49,027, while recoveries 47,388. The Covid toll remained unchanged at 1,314 as no death was reported on Monday. Yavatmal: One Covid death took the district’s toll to 1,788 on Monday. The administration received 1,083 test reports of which 10 were found positive. Currently, there are 445 patients — 105 in hospitals and 340 in home quarantine — under treatment. Of the 72,564 patients detected till date, 70,334 including 35 on Monday have recovered. The district’s test positivity rate is 10.90%, death rate 2.46% and daily positivity rate 0.92%. Amravati: Cases dropped to two digits almost after four-and-a-half months as the district posted 90 new patients on Monday. Barring a 50-year-old male from Astagaon in Morshi tehsil, the district did not post any Covid fatality. The caseload has now reached 95,150 while the toll 1,526. Recovery of 279 patients took the total to 92,001. The number of under-treatment patients as on Monday is at 1,623.

---||Nagpur||Eight more Dhanush for Army, misfire probe on||NAGPUR: After Dhanush — indigenous version of Bofors gun — suffered a muzzle brake hit in February this year, the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) expects to deliver eight more guns to the Army in a couple of months. The investigation report on the incident is also expected by that time. The incident took place when the Army was carrying out a pre-deployment firing exercise. This was kind of a test fire before the gun is actually deployed in given area. Dhanush guns have been already inducted in the Army. The first six guns were handed over in 2019. The guns are being made at the Gun Carriage Factory in Jabalpur. Its shells are made in different factories in Vidarbha. Muzzle brake is the front part of the barrel. The shell hits the component instead of shooting out the barrel. Muzzle brake hits have dogged Dhanush since beginning. The one in February is the fourth such incident after three muzzle hits took place before induction. The enquiry report is expected in a couple of months and by that time new guns would be ready too. If at all any modifications need to be made, it may be minor and quickly done in the new guns, said a source privy of the matter. Investigation into the muzzle hit incident and the work on the new guns is going on side by side, said sources. The gun that suffered muzzle hit was one of the six pieces first inducted in the Army. Muzzle brake hits are not new for artillery guns. Even as Dhanush has suffered four muzzle hits, the advanced towed artillery gun systems (ATAGS), being developed by private sector, and one of the US’s M-777 acquired by India have suffered muzzle hit too. Dhanush has been subject to much intense trials as compared to any other weapon system. During the trials itself, as much as 5,500 rounds have been fired, which can be equal or even more than wartime firing, said sources. The Army has been insisting on fresh tests at different stages. Apart from the regular user trials and general staff qualitative requirement (GSQR) evaluation, the Army also insisted for another round of trial fires named as user-exploitation. This was introduced for the first time for any system. After that, the pre-deployment firing exercise was again conducted on the guns when the muzzle hit took place. Firing 5500 rounds in trials itself is a record on its own said sources. Repeated tests can increase the chances of misfire in a normal course, said a source. Before delivery, the guns have to be fired for proving. Out of the eight, two have been proved and assembly is ready for the remaining six. The OFB has an order for 114 Dhanush guns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/eight-more-dhanush-for-army-misfire-probe-on/articleshow/83524828.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||Armed conflicts also pose threat to wildlife, 4,291 mammal & 9,056 bird species overlap regions with strife: Study||NAGPUR: Armed civil strife is not only a cause of widespread human suffering but such conflicts also pose a significant but under-recognized threat to thousands of mammal and bird species. According to a new study conducted by researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society-India (WCS-India), Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), and Panthera, about one-fifth of these species showed widespread overlap with conflict. The researchers analyzed maps of regions of armed conflicts spanning all countries (except Syria), species geographical range maps and information on conservation threats to terrestrial mammal and bird species across the world from 1989 to 2018. The dataset comprises the geographic locations and dates of 1,52,616 conflict incidents. The authors’ overlaid species range maps and conflict maps to find out the number of mammal and bird species having geographic overlap with conflict over the 30-year period from 1989 to 2018. They found that the geographical ranges of at least 4,291 mammal and 9,056 bird species overlap with regions that experienced armed conflicts during this period. About one-fifth of these species showed widespread overlap with conflict, meaning that conflicts extended over at least half of their geographic ranges. For around 225 mammal and 390 bird species, conflicts were not just widespread, but also persisted over 15 years or more. The authors extracted information on species population trends and conservation threats from the IUCN Red List of threatened species and examined relationships between population trends, conservation threats, and species geographical overlap with armed conflicts. They found that overlap with conflict was closely associated with population declines, particularly for species recognized by the IUCN as being at risk of extinction. They also found that species overlapping with armed conflicts were more likely to face threats from hunting, deforestation and various forms of habitat degradation. “The findings call for greater recognition of the armed conflict threat to wild species,” said Uttara Mendiratta, lead author and head of Counter-wildlife Trafficking at WCS-India. “In agreement with our findings, the IUCN independently just published a report referring to armed conflicts as an under-recognized threat to biodiversity. So hopefully a reexamination of species conservation assessments with closer attention to threats from conflict would follow,” she says. Results of the study, published in a Conservation Letters journal last month, also underscore the importance of viewing conflict not as a single threat but instead one that could potentially lead to or intensify various other threats to wildlife. Another key finding of the study is that range overlap with armed conflicts is consistently associated with threats such as hunting and habitat modification and degradation, including agricultural expansion, natural resource extraction, and pollution. “We found that these threats were more prominent in the threat portfolios of species that overlap with conflicts, while climate change, geological events, and invasive species were equally or less prominent, compared with the portfolios of non-conflict overlapping species,” said Mendiratta. “While gunfire and landmines are perhaps the most visible direct threats to wildlife, the more insidious threats arising from the displacement of human populations and disruption of socio-economic institutions in conflict regions, should not be ignored,” says Mendiratta. The researchers emphasize that the range of direct and indirect threats would need to be understood and addressed at multiple levels for effectively conserving species affected by armed conflicts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/armed-conflicts-also-pose-threat-to-wildlife-4291-mammal-9056-bird-species-overlap-regions-with-strife-study/articleshow/83524847.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||Ministry of environment, forest and climate change asks state for correct timber availability report||NAGPUR: The MoEFCC has asked the state government to review the decision taken by the state-level committee (SLC) to ‘hurriedly’ approve the timber availability report in Maharashtra submitted by the Institute of Wood Science & Technology (IWST), Bengaluru. The 19th SLC meeting held on January 21, 2021, had approved the IWST report submitted last year. According to MoEFCC, the report was flawed and erroneous and on February 2, 2021, the environment ministry’s integrated office here had raised a note of dissent in this regard. The report basically was a bid to cover up 50 additional horizontal bands saw (AHBS) licences issued illegally by the SLC led by ex-PCCF UK Agrawal on July 23, 2018. This decision has already been scrapped by the MoEFCC on October 30, 2020, and the state government too. “The IWST report speaks about consumption patterns and not about timber availability as told by the apex court. If you want to issue new sawmill licences you need to assess timber availability in the entire state but no assessment was done,” the MoEFCC dissent note said. “Only existing sawmills were randomly chosen and extrapolation was done about consumption. It was supposed to be examined by an internal committee of top officials which was not done. The report is completely flawed. We are not happy,” the MoEFCC added. On May 28, 2021, MoEFCC AIG CB Tashildar has written to the state to once look into the issue for the correct assessment of the timber availability for Maharashtra based on which the entire sector of wood-based industries will be regulated in the future. “It is not understood as to why the SLC was in a great hurry to approve the report. On October 30, 2020, while deciding an application filed by an environment lawyer Manish Jeswani, the MoEFCC had directed to thoroughly scrutinize the report by an internal committee which was not done,” the MoEFCC pointed to the state. The MoEFCC also drew the attention to NGT order of February 13, 2020, which struck down the assessment of timber availability report in UP for its wrong estimation of timber availability. As per the Supreme Court orders, additional sawmill licenses are issued by the SLC based on the timber availability report. The SLC on June 15, 2017, had requested the IWST to prepare a timber availability report. However, even before the report was prepared, the SLC led by Agrawal had issued 50 AHBS licences. According to then PCCF (production & management), information from 52% of sawmills only was collected and extrapolated. The data collected from the forest depots, sawmills, furniture shops, check posts, inter-states imports have the inherent possibility of their duplication. The forest officials from where data was collected were not aware of the findings of the aforesaid report. MoEFCC PICKS UP HOLES * The MoEFCC said the methodology used to determine the availability of timber for wood-based industries in the future has not been discussed in detail * Since the majority of the source for timber is trees outside forests (TOF), what methodology was followed to ascertain the timber from TOF is unknown. Survey of sawmills to ascertain the same is not proper * Definition of TOF has been misunderstood while drafting the report. TOF has been discussed to be ‘malki’ which is improper. Forest Survey of India (FSI) has not been consulted * The SLC has failed to initiate departmental inquiry and contempt proceedings against ex-PCCF Agrawal even after 8 months||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/moefcc-asks-state-for-correct-timber-availability-report/articleshow/83524861.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
