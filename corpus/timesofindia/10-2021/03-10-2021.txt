---||India||Changes in system not enough, need change in mindset: Bhagwat on first Jammu visit post abrogation of Article 370||JAMMU: Asserting that there is a change in system after the abrogation of Article 370, which scrapped the special status granted to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Saturday said people also needed to change their mindset.  Addressing a seminar at General Zorawar Singh auditorium of Jammu University, Bhagwat expressed his apprehension that although the special status has been scrapped, if it has gone from the people's mind or not.  “Mere changes in the system are not enough, we need to change our mindset,” Bhagwat said during his first visit to J&K after the abrogation of Article 370.  He added that the joy of seeing the sacrifice of Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee bearing fruit in the form of abrogation of Article 370 is fairly visible in the country.  "Since the days of Jan Sangh (which demanded one nation one constitution), it has been our dream to see the abrogation of Article 370," Bhagwat said.  It is to be noted that Mookerjee, the leader of Jan Sangh, the precursor to the BJP, died in custody in Jammu and Kashmir while leading an agitation against the provision.  Bhagwat further stated that India is a very diverse nation, and nobody has ever snatched the "indigenous culture of places having a cosmopolitan culture".  “India must set an example for the world in maintaining unity and communal harmony… we have different states, languages, communities… still we all are one.”  He said, “Our understanding of evolution and development is fundamentally different from that of the rest of the world as it is rooted in altruism and ecological balance.”  The RSS chief also said India is world guru and not a world superpower. “And this is a defining difference between us and the rest of the countries.”  “Our unity can pave way for safeguarding our country, he said.  Bhagwat arrived in Jammu on Thursday on a four-day visit as per RSS’s annual tradition of visiting the erstwhile state. He will address a group of intellectuals and hold meetings with prominent people of the UT.  Following Bhagwat's speech, RSS leader Indresh Kumar said, "I pray to God that wisdom dawns upon the Gupkar alliance leaders as Article 370 is not going to come back. Jammu and Kashmir is now on the path of development."  Hinting at the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits, Kumar said that times have changed in Jammu and Kashmir in the last seven years.  Kumar added that era of separatism and stone pelting is over and all those who were displaced from the valley will be rehabilitated soon.  There are no takers for separatism in the valley now, he said, and added that Jammu and Ladakh no longer face discrimination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/changes-in-system-are-not-enough-we-need-to-change-our-mindset-bhagwat-on-first-jammu-visit-post-abrogation-of-article-370/articleshow/86715071.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The applications have been received from South Asian and African countries for various undergraduate, postgraduate courses. Of them, 38 applications have been accepted by the university. The applications of 40 foreign candidates were cancelled as DAVV does not offer courses they wanted to take admission in to. “Although we had received nearly 80 applications from foreign nationals, not all applications could be accepted as some of the courses fall under the purview of All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE),” said DAVV official of admission committee. The varsity officials have already sent the accepted applications to the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) for further process since the applicants had applied for the courses via ICCR. The varsity has also been in process to begin with an office of international affairs to allure foreign nationals to opt for full time courses. It will play an extremely crucial role and help in dissemination of information related to admission process among foreign students. The varsity has five per cent of total seats available for the non-resident Indian (NRI) or NRI sponsored candidates in each programme. DAVV hasn’t witnessed foreign nationals opting for a full time course for over a decade, said DAVV media spokesperson Dr Chandan Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/davv-gets-78-applications-from-foreign-nationals/articleshow/86715419.cms||Laveena Francis
---||Hyderabad||Paddy crop in Telangana emits CO2 equivalent to 30 crore vehicles||HYDERABAD: Ever wondered what is the amount of CO2 emission by the paddy output in Telangana? It is 5.65 kg CO2 per acre (methane and nitrous oxide combined). Through the one crore acre of cultivation, the state produces 10 crore tonnes. According to the research conducted by the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA), it is similar to the emissions produced by more than 21 crore passenger vehicles in a year in the country with 30 crore passenger vehicles. As a result, it’d be around a tenth of that. These findings are quite significant in the wake of a recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which stresses the need to cut down CO2 emissions. The study pointed out that 10 crore tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions cancel out the good climate improvement brought by tree growth. Over a ten-year period, this is the quantity of carbon stored by 1,653,521,173 tree seedlings. And these emissions were merely from the field. If emissions from reservoirs utilised for lift irrigations are also taken into account, the CO2 is more than double of 10 crore tones calculated now. India agreed to cut the emission intensity by 33-35% from 2005 levels by 2030 through Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). As per international standards, a tonne of CO2 contains 32 tonnes of methane and 300 tonnes of nitrogen dioxide (N20). Agriculture is a major source of GHG emissions, particularly Nitrous Oxide NO2 (due to volatilisation loss from nitrogenous fertiliser use) and Methane CH4 (mostly due to water stagnation in paddy fields and dams, cattle enteric fermentation, and biomass decomposition). GV Ramanjaneyulu, an agriculture scientist who is engaged in the study said that the only way out is to reduce the paddy extent by more than half to mitigate the negative impact. “We need to reduce fertiliser use and migrate to organic farming; there is a pressing need to produce whatever rice can be grown aerobically,” he observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/paddy-crop-in-t-emits-co2-equivalent-to-30-cr-vehicles/articleshow/86715086.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||World||Pakistan Taliban declares 3-week truce after Imran talks prod||ISLAMABAD: The banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) announced a three-week ceasefire late Friday, hours after Prime Minister Imran Khan claimed his government was in talks with the terrorist outfit on the reconciliation process. Islamabad’s talks with TTP, a conglomerate of several Pakistani terrorist outfits, has been facilitated by the Afghan Taliban in Afghanistan. Around 6,000 TTP terrorists are said to have sanctuaries in Afghanistan’s east and west, besides the border with Pakistan. As PM Imran has said that talks are underway with only some factions of TTP, disgruntled elements within the larger organisation are feared to have joined Daesh-Khurasan, a regional affiliate of Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria. TTP said its ceasefire, set to end on October 21, could be extended if talks progressed further. The outfit was represented by an 11-member delegation in the dialogue with the Pakistan government, while some influential Afghan Taliban leaders and tribal elders played mediators. A tribal elder familiar with the government’s talks effort said TTP had spelt out three conditions to Pakistan — reversing the merger of the tribal districts into Khyber Pakhtunkwa province in the northwest, permission to TTP cadres to carry weapons in the tribal areas and release of prisoners associated with Pakistani terrorist groups. The pre-partition semi-autonomous status of Pakistan’s tribal regions had been changed after Pakistan merged them into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018 through a constitutional amendment that required a two-thirds majority in Parliament. Before the merger, the seven tribal agencies and six frontier regions had been directly governed by Pakistan’s federal government from Islamabad through a special set of laws called the Frontier Crimes Regulations (FCR), introduced during British rule in parts of India in the northwest along the border with Afghanistan. The British had never succeeded in completely calming unrest in the region, which is why they attempted to control the population in the area through FCR, giving considerable power to local nobles so long as they were willing to meet the needs of their masters. Tribal leaders of North Waziristan, involved with the ongoing "reconciliation" process, said talks between Islamabad and TTP started in Afghanistan about 20 days ago. The government, they said, had also been in contact with some non-TTP armed groups that had fought on the side of the Afghan Taliban against the US and its allies in Afghanistan, Formed in December 2007, TTP trained and educated its fighters at the same religious seminaries that produced the Afghan Taliban. The outfit has carried out some of the most horrific terror attacks against Pakistanis, targeting security personnel, officials and even schoolchildren. Its former top leadership was eliminated in US drone strikes on Pakistan’s tribal districts and parts of Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-taliban-declares-3-week-truce-after-imran-talks-prod/articleshow/86715639.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

India recorded 23,245 fresh cases on Saturday, around the same count as on the previous day (23,910). The highest cases reported this week was on Thursday, when the tally had shot up to 27,374. By contrast, India had last week logged more than 25,000 cases on all days except on Monday, with the tally crossing 30,000 on two days. The decline in numbers this week was mainly due to a big fall in fresh cases in Kerala. The state reported 13,217 new infections on Saturday, 57% of the country’s total. The state recorded a 13.64% test positivity rate on Saturday, still high but down substantially from close to 20% during the peak of the current wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-only-1-day-of-25k-cases-in-india-this-wk/articleshow/86715998.cms||---

Mohammed Khalifa, a Saudi-born Canadian citizen who was a leading figure in the Islamic State of Iraq, was captured overseas by the Syrian Democratic Forces in January 2019, federal officials said. He was recently transferred into FBI custody, at which point he was first brought to the Eastern District of Virginia.  "As alleged, Mohammed Khalifa not only fought for ISIS on the battlefield in Syria, but he was also the voice behind the violence," said Raj Parekh, acting US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. "Through his alleged leading role in translating, narrating and advancing ISIS's online propaganda, Khalifa promoted the terrorist group, furthered its worldwide recruitment efforts, and expanded the reach of videos that glorified the horrific murders and indiscriminate cruelty of the ISIS."  Khalifa served in prominent roles within ISIS starting in 2013 and continuing until his capture by the SDF in January 2019 following a firefight between Islamic State fighters and the SDF.  In addition to allegedly serving as an Islamic State fighter, Khalifa allegedly served as a lead translator in the group's propaganda production and the English-speaking narrator on multiple violent recruitment videos.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/islamic-state-figure-charged-with-supporting-terrorist-group/articleshow/86716906.cms||---
---||Delhi||Oktoberfest returns to Delhi NCR, but loses its sheen||Most Delhi resto-bars are uncertain about offering discounts due to limited alcohol supply, however those in Gurgaon are offering deals to celebrate the German beer festIn any pre-pandemic year, there would be many in NCR planning a German holiday between September and October to witness the Oktoberfest. But for the second year in a row, the popular beer festival in Munich is not being celebrated due to the pandemic. The good news, though, is that in NCR, Oktoberfest celebrations have made a low-key comeback. While Gurgaon is offering deals, in Delhi, many restaurants are either giving the celebrations a miss or planning to celebrate without any offers as they fear alcohol shortage. Most Delhi outlets uncertain about offering Oktoberfest discountsAround 40% private liquor vends in Delhi will remain shut for a month and a half, since businesses will have to switch to the new excise policy, by November 16. In such a scenario, restaurateurs say that they are uncertain about the supply of alcohol and do not want to run offers that might land them in trouble in this period. “Oktoberfest is a big celebration for us and each year we would plan something big. It was always a hit among guests. But this year, we are not sure if we can offer the same discounts and run other promotions that we usually do. We have some stock with us, but we can’t take a risk as we might face supply crunch in a month’s time. So this year, we might just do something in terms of décor etc, but offers seem unlikely,” says Saurabh Khanijo, owner, Kylin Experience. For the second year in a row, the popular beer festival in Munich is not being celebrated in NCR due to the pandemic“Where is the alcohol in Delhi to celebrate Oktoberfest? There is already limited supply and we can’t really plan anything,” says restaurateur Priyank Sukhija, who owns outlets like Plum By Bent Chair and Diablo. Varun Duggal, Head Alliances, Massive Restaurants, adds, “We have limited stock of beer right now and going by the situation at present, we are not sure if we can run attractive deals and offers, which is the idea behind Oktoberfest. In Delhi, there would only be a few outlets that would go ahead with celebrations.” Rahul Singh’s outlets are one of those few that will be celebrating Oktoberfest across NCR. “It’s the largest month-long festival for us and barring 2020, we have had the festival every year since 2012. With German food, music and beer, we try to create an experience close to the original fest. About supply concerns, we knew it was coming so we overstocked to last till November 16,” says Rahul, founder, The Beer Café. Best offers are brewing in GurgaonMost bars and pubs at Cyber Hub are already promoting offers that are part of Oktoberfest celebrations and will run till October 15. “In Delhi, we are not doing anything, but we have planned celebrations and offers at our Gurgaon outlet. In terms of business, Oktoberfest is truly the beginning of the festive season for us. Even people need a reason to celebrate and in Gurgaon we have always got a very good response for Oktoberfest,” says Goumtesh Singh, owner, Raasta. Rahul Khanna, co-founder, Azure Hospitality, that will be having Oktoberfest celebrations at Foxtrot, adds, “The audience has become increasingly globalized and international festivals like Oktoberfest and Halloween become important days that people want to celebrate. We like to do our part by making sure our offerings are in line with the holidays and that people have something to look forward to. Oktoberfest is big from both a brand positioning and sales point of view.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/oktoberfest-returns-to-delhi-ncr-but-loses-its-sheen/articleshow/86708563.cms||Divya Kaushik

The activist and designer wanted to spend her birthday with her close friends, some of whom she had not met for a long time. The dress code for the party was white as Sanjana said that “white is a symbol of purity, love and light.” A Friyay for guests: Though the party was a small gathering, it was a much-needed break for some guests. “I am someone who cannot stay at home, but we all had to for a long time. I am liking this feeling of finally being out, being with friends and listening to some good music,” said Sifat, a model and Sanjana’s friend. “It is a small celebration to spread some happiness and get friends to meet each other,” added Sanjana. Celebration for a cause: For Sanjana, her birthdays are meant to bring people together to send out a message. “This time, I wanted to gather my friends and show our support for women in Afghanistan. I feel for them. We have done a lot of shows with youngsters from Afghanistan, and I saw how amazing they were. I spoke to some of them, and one of the things that I think we should do is step up instead of keeping quiet,” she shared, adding, “This is a fun, happy get-together, but we are also celebrating strong women today, and the message is to stand and support each other. At this point, women in Afghanistan need our support. I hope we are able to reach out to them somehow.” Last year, Sanjana and her friends collected food for animals and went to different areas for distribution. “I got all my friends together to collect food for animals as there were so many pets being abandoned. So I always try and celebrate in my special way,” said Sanjana.

---||World||Women's March targets Supreme Court, with abortion on line||WASHINGTON: The first Women's March of the Biden administration headed straight for the steps of the Supreme Court on Saturday, as part of nationwide protests that drew thousands to Washington and other cities to demand continued access to abortion in a year when conservative lawmakers and judges have put it in jeopardy.  Many thousands of women filled a square near the White House for a rally before the march. They waved signs that said "Mind your own uterus," "I love someone who had an abortion" and "Abortion is a personal choice, not a legal debate", among other messages. Some wore T-shirts reading simply "1973", a reference to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which made abortion legal for generations of American women.  Elaine Baijal, a 19-year-old student at American University, took cellphone photos with her friends and their signs as the event started. She said her mother told her of coming to a march for legal abortion with her own mother in the 1970s.  "It's sad that we still have to fight for our right 40 years later. But it's a tradition I want to continue," Baijal said of the march.  Organisers say the Washington march will be among hundreds of abortion-themed protests around the country Saturday. The demonstrations just before the start of a new term for the Supreme Court that will decide the future of abortion rights in the United States, after appointments of justices by President Donald Trump strengthened conservative control of the high court.  "Shame, shame, shame!" marchers chanted while walking past the Trump International Hotel on their way to the Supreme Court. Some booed and waived their fists at the Trump landmark.  The day before the march, the Biden administration urged a federal judge to block the nation's most restrictive abortion law, which has banned most abortions in Texas since early September. It's one of a series of cases that will give the nation's divided high court occasion to uphold or overrule Roe v. Wade.  The Texas law motivated many of the demonstrators and speakers.  "We're going to keep giving it to Texas," Marsha Jones of the Afiya Center for Black women's health care in Dallas, pledged to the Washington crowd. "You can no longer tell us what to do with our bodies!"  Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of Planned Parenthood nationally, told of women forced to drive many hours across state lines - sometimes multiple state lines - to end pregnancies in the weeks since the Texas law went into effect.  "The moment is dark ... but that is why we are here," Johnson told the crowd packed into Freedom Square and surrounding streets. With the upcoming Supreme Court term, "No matter where you are, this fight is at your doorstep right now."  At an unrelated event in Maine, Republican Sen. Susan Collins called the Texas law "extreme, inhumane and unconstitutional" and said she's working to make Roe v. Wade the "law of the land."  She said she's working with two Democrats and another Republican, and they're "vetting" the language of their bill. Collins declined to identify her colleagues, but said the legislation will be introduced soon.  An opponent of women's access to abortion called this year's march theme "macabre."  "What about equal rights for unborn women?" tweeted Jeanne Mancini, president of an anti-abortion group called March for Life.  The Women's March has become a regular event - although interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic - since millions of women turned out in the United States and around the world the day after the January 2017 inauguration of Trump. Trump endorsed punishing women for getting abortions and made appointment of conservative judges a mission of his presidency.  With the sun beating down Saturday, Ramsay Teviotdale of Arlington, Virginia - who when asked her age said she was "old enough to remember when abortion wasn't legal" - was one of the few wearing the hand-knitted pink wool caps that distinguished the 2017 Women's March.  Without Trump as a central figure for women of varied political beliefs to rally against, and with the pandemic still going strong, organizers talk of hundreds of thousands of participants nationally Saturday, not the millions of 2017.  Teviotdale said this does not lessen the urgency of the moment. "This Texas thing - no way can it stand. It's the thin edge of the wedge," she said.  The march is part of "a fight to secure, safeguard, and strengthen our constitutional right to an abortion," Rachel O'Leary Carmona, executive director of the Women's March, said in a statement. "And it's a fight against the Supreme Court justices, state lawmakers, and senators who aren't on our side - or aren't acting with the urgency this moment demands."  Latina comedian and activist Cristela Alonzo hosted Saturday's rally in Washington, which featured speeches from many advocates and providers of abortion access. Actress Busy Philipps and swimmer Schuyler Bailar were to take part.  Security in the capital was much lighter than for a political rally a few weeks ago in support of Trump supporters jailed in the Jan. 6 insurrection. No fence was placed around the U.S. Capitol, with the Capitol Police chief saying there was nothing to suggest Saturday's rally would be violent.  .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/womens-march-targets-supreme-court-with-abortion-on-line/articleshow/86717679.cms||---
---||World||Khashoggi widow urges US to hold Saudis accountable 3 years later||WASHINGTON: Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi's widow on Friday questioned US President Joe Biden's commitment to hold the kingdom accountable, three years after the writer's brutal murder.  Marking the anniversary, Hatice Cengiz travelled to Washington for a demonstration outside the Saudi embassy and an evening vigil near the United States Capitol where she unveiled a portrait of Khashoggi made out of newspaper columns.  She voiced dismay that days ahead of the anniversary, Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who US intelligence says ordered the killing.  "Is this what the accountability that Biden promised looks like," she asked at the candlelight vigil organised by rights groups.  "MBS took Jamal from me and the entire world. Will you hold him accountable or will you reward these murderers," she asked, referring to the 36-year-old heir apparent by his initials.  Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi who lived in self-exile in the United States, wrote critically about MBS in columns in The Washington Post.  On October 2, 2018, he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to file paperwork to marry Cengiz who is Turkish. According to the US and Turkish officials, a waiting Saudi hit squad strangled him and dismembered his body, which has never been retrieved.  US president at the time Donald Trump played down the episode, saying it was more important that Saudi Arabia buys US weapons and shares hostility toward Iran.  Biden vowed a tougher approach, declassifying intelligence and imposing sanctions on Saudis although not on the crown prince himself.  US officials said Sullivan travelled to Saudi Arabia, where MBS is also the defence minister, largely to discuss the crisis in Yemen where the kingdom has led a devastating air campaign aimed at defeating Iranian-backed Huthi rebels.  Also addressing the evening vigil was the sister of Abdulrahman al-Sadhan, a Red Crescent aid worker who was arrested in 2018 and earlier this year was handed a 20-year sentence after criticising the Saudi leadership through an anonymous Twitter account.  "They tortured him so bad, they almost killed him. They broke his hand and smashed his fingers until they were disfigured, saying, 'Is this the hand you tweet with?'" said his sister Areej al-Sadhan, who lives in California.  She said she was hopeful the new US administration's pressure would win her brother's release but that changed after Biden let MBS "off the hook."  "That's how Saudi officials repaid President Biden's generosity, by committing more human rights abuses," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/khashoggi-widow-urges-us-to-hold-saudis-accountable-3-years-later/articleshow/86717693.cms||---

While the Abu Dhabi temple, which marks fulfilment of the aspirations of thousands of devotees of the Swaminarayan sect, attracted a lot of attention locally when the pavilion opened on Friday, the adjacent replica of the Ram Temple stood out for the message it sends out. It is perhaps the first instance of the Ram Temple, whose construction started last year after a vexatious legal battle and a huge socio-political upheaval, being projected as part of Indian heritage overseas. The decision to showcase it in Dubai indicates that the government is not coy about putting Ram Mandir on a pedestal as part of India's cultural heritage which is sought to be linked with the strategies for the future, with a key thrust being on the policies announced by the Modi government. The three-storied pavilion spread over 1 lakh sqft starts with yoga and environment in the front with replicas of Taj Mahal, Rani Ki Vav, the Sun Temple of Konark and Kashi Vishwanath Temple of Varanasi on the first floor, before visitors move on to what is being displayed by some of the Indian companies and the government—both the Centre and states. “The idea was to put the cultural aspects on the front part of the building and business on the other side. We opted to have the Ram Temple on the ground floor as visitors would leave the pavilion with that in their mind, since a large part may not be there for business,” said Dikshu C Kukreja, managing director at CP Kukreja Architects, which conceived the Dubai Expo Pavilion and is involved with the master planning of Ayodhya as well as East Delhi Hub, India’s tallest building. While the pavilion was constructed by state-run NBCC, industry chamber FICCI had been tasked with deciding what to show. The government provided key inputs with the decision to showcase Indian culture as a key element. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said even Prime Minister Narendra Modi too gave his inputs. Over the next six months, the display will keep changing every few weeks, the minister explained. “We have designed it like a jewel box, with the jewels inside,” said Kukreja, adding that the façade displays multiple images of India in the evening. So, why does India have so much emphasis on culture while the US has a replica of SpaceX and DP World, the UAE logistics giant, displaying hyperloop and other new technologies? “Technology is temporal, while culture never gets antiquated,” said Kukreja, explaining the rationale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ram-temple-ghats-of-varanasi-showcased-at-indian-pavilion-at-dubai-expo/articleshow/86718131.cms||Sidhartha

The joint task force will offer a common platform for continuous dialogue to remove bottlenecks that may come up from time to time and look at new opportunities,” commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said after meeting of the UAE-India high level Joint Task Force on Investments. The minister, who also met companies such as DP World and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, said UAE-based entities have moved beyond some of the legacy issues, such as the exit of Etisalat after the Supreme Court cancelled the 2G licences and problems encountered by Emaar, the real estate giant. “They have let bygones be bygones and look at the opportunities,” he said. He said some of the companies that he met have suggested that in the monetisation programme for sectors such as roads, the projects that are offered should be large, while also evincing interest in the railways and logistics segments. “There were some suggestions that logistics cost can be reduced by 0.5-1 percentage point,” he said, adding that the logistics cost added up to 13% in India, compared to 8-9% in several other parts of the world. Goyal said that the RBI has allowed Emirates NBD Bank to open two branches in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-uae-chalk-out-road-map-for-investment/articleshow/86718315.cms||Sidhartha

The 13th round of corps commander-level talks between India and China is likely to be held next week, even as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) continues to consolidate its military positions along the frontier with heavy weaponry as well as upgrade its airbases facing India, which have resulted in matching deployments on the Indian side. Speaking to journalists in Leh, Gen Naravane said the increase in PLA deployments in "considerable numbers" in forward areas all along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control, stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, continues to be "a matter of concern for us". A day ago, he had noted that military face-offs will be inevitable until the border question is settled between the two countries. Turning to the Line of Control, Gen Naravane said the situation is "regressing to pre-February days" with the Pakistan army supporting two infiltration attempts by terrorists through ceasefire violations in the last 10 days. On the Chinese border, the Indian Army has also undertaken matching measures, both in terms of troop deployment as well as infrastructure development. "We have also inducted advanced weaponry. We are strong, quite well-poised to meet any eventuality," he said after reviewing the operational situation and preparedness in the high-altitude region. An agency report said he noted that the K9 self-propelled howitzer had been deployed with some changes in the Ladakh region to boost firepower though the weapon was essentially meant for the plains. Indian and Chinese troops disengaged in the Pangong Tso-Kailash Range region in February and Patrolling Point-17A near Gogra in August, but the military stalemate over the other "friction points" at Hot Springs, Demchok and the strategically located Depsang Plains still continues. Noting the situation has been "quite normal" at the friction points for the last six months, Gen Naravane said he hoped the disengagement process will be taken further in the 13th round of military talks. "By and by, all friction points will get resolved," Gen Naravane told ANI. "When the talks had started, people were doubtful whether talks would resolve anything, but I am of the firm opinion that we can resolve our differences with dialogue and that is what has happened in the past few months," he added. The Pakistan army earlier used to provide "covering fire" to terrorists trying to infiltrate into J&K but had stopped after agreeing to a fresh ceasefire in February this year. The support to infiltrating terrorists, however, has started once again. "We have conveyed, through hotline messages and DGMO-level talks that take place every week, that they (Pakistan) should not give support to any terror-related activities," said Gen Naravane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/increased-chinese-troop-deployment-a-matter-of-concern-says-army-chief/articleshow/86718421.cms||---

Asserting that the nation has made “extraordinary progress” in the fight against the coronavirus in the past eight months because of vaccines, the president, in a statement, said the astonishing death toll is yet another reminder of “just how important it is to get vaccinated”.“Thanks to vaccines, hundreds of thousands of families have been spared the unbearable loss that too many other Americans have already endured during this pandemic,” Biden said, adding the doses will “help us beat the Covid-19 and move forward, together, as one nation”.On Saturday, Arizona added another 95 Covid-19 deaths, a day after the state's pandemic death toll passed 20,000. The state coronavirus dashboard also reported 2,942 confirmed cases, increasing Arizona's pandemic totals to 1.1 million cases. The confirmed deaths rose to 20,134.Meanwhile, as of Saturday, the United States administered 394,690,283 doses of the Covid-19 vaccines and distributed 478,362,045 vials, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.Those figures are up by 933,417 from the 393,756,866 vaccine doses that the CDC said had been given by Friday out of 477,069,555 doses delivered.The agency said 214,870,696 people had received at least one dose while 185,143,698 people had been fully vaccinated as of 6:00 am ET on Saturday.The CDC tally includes two-dose vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech, as well as Johnson & Johnson's one-shot vaccine.Meanwhile, about 4.74 million people have received an additional dose of either Pfizer or Moderna's vaccine since August 13, when the US authorised a third booster shot for people with compromised immune systems.(With inputs from agencies)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/astonishing-death-toll-another-reminder-of-how-important-it-is-to-get-vaccinated-biden/articleshow/86718519.cms||---

Gehlot said he would not only complete his full five-year-term but would return as the head of the next Congress government after the 2023 polls. The assertion appeared to be aimed as much against BJP as against factional rivals who had renewed their efforts to get the leadership to replace Gehlot with Sachin Pilot, his principal challenger. Baghel, who earlier felt troubled amid indications that the Gandhi siblings continue to be indulgent of health minister T S Singhdeo's reminder that it was time the incumbent vacated the helm for him as part of the promised rotational CM scheme, ruled out a Punjab rerun in Chhattisgarh after being appointed as the election in-charge for UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-congress-grapples-with-punjab-crisis-gehlot-and-baghel-confident-of-staying-put/articleshow/86718571.cms||---
---||India||Centre changes decision, says paddy procurement to commence in Punjab, Haryana from Oct 3||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Saturday ordered to start paddy procurement in Punjab and Haryana from Sunday (October 3), barely three days after it had announced to postpone the procurement till October 11 “in the interest of farmers” due to recent heavy rains. The decision came after protests by farmers in Punjab and Haryana against the Centre’s earlier decision. In its order, the food ministry said the government decided to start paddy procurement from Sunday in the two states. Earlier, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, his deputy Dushyant Chautala and Union minister Ashwini Choubey had a meeting in Delhi after massive protests erupted outside the CM’s home in Karnal district. “As per the decision taken, the Haryana government has assured that paddy procurement will start from tomorrow (Sunday). They have made everything ready. Procurement in Punjab is already in process. From tomorrow, both states will begin buying,” Choubey said. The Haryana CM said, “Due to delay in monsoon’s retreat, the central government had postponed start of procurement of paddy and millet from October 1 to 11 this year. There are demands for an early start. The procurement will start tomorrow (Sunday).” Yogendra Yadav of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of farm unions protesting against the farms laws at Delhi borders, claimed it to be a “victory” for the farmers. On Thursday, the ministry had issued a statement saying, “Keeping in view the interest of farmers and to avoid any inconvenience to them, the department of food and public distribution has decided that procurement of paddy under MSP would commence from October 11 in Punjab and Haryana.” It had claimed that due to recent heavy downpour in the two states, the maturity of paddy crop had been delayed and the high moisture content may lead to rejection of the grain at the buying centres causing losses to farmers. But the decision irked farmers and many of them protested on Saturday in several parts of the two states, laying siege to the houses of many ministers, MPs and MLAs. Procurement for kharif marketing season 2021-22 was to start in Punjab from October 1 and Haryana on September 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-changes-decision-says-paddy-procurement-to-commence-in-punjab-haryana-from-oct-3/articleshow/86718658.cms||---

---||World||Now Nevada institute staff need to get Covid vaccines or face termination||WASHINGTON: After Supreme Court denied an emergency appeal from a group of teachers to block New York City's Covid-19 vaccine mandate for public school teachers and other staff, Nevada has issued a similar policy, requiring employees at all public universities and colleges in to get the vaccinations by December 1 or face potential termination.  All new hires must prove their vaccination status under the new policy. Meanwhile, coronavirus case trends are improving in urban areas but have worsened in most rural parts of the state where vaccination rates are the lowest.  The Desert Research Institute has the highest vaccination rate at 87 per cent, followed by the University of Nevada Reno at 82. UNLV reported 75 per cent. Rural Elko-based Great Basin College had the worst rate at 66 per cent. Nearly 65 per cent of residents aged 12 and older have one vaccination and 56 per cent are fully vaccinated, according to state data. On Friday, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor denied the emergency appeal from a group of teachers who had filed for the injunction with her on Thursday to keep the mandate from going into effect. Under the mandate, the roughly 148,000 school employees had until 5 pm Friday to get at least their first vaccine shot. Those who didn't face suspension without pay when schools open on Monday. Meanwhile, in Salt Lake City, the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints thanked members who have followed its guidance to get vaccinated against the coronavirus.  Church President Russell M Nelson spoke Saturday at a conference taking place again without full attendance due to the pandemic. For the first time in two years, leaders were back at the faith's 20,000-seat conference center, with several hundred people watching in person and others on television. The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square returned to the conference.  The Utah-based faith has repeatedly encouraged its 16 million members worldwide to limit the spread by getting vaccines and wearing masks. Last week, church officials announced masks will be required inside temples to limit the spread of the virus. On the other hand, the leader of a Mississippi pediatricians' organization is urging school districts to keep mask mandates in place to slow the spread of the Covid-19.  Dr Anita Henderson of Hattiesburg is president of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. She says about 30 per cent of youngsters aged 12 to 17 in the state are vaccinated, and "now is not the time to let our guard down".  Mississippi has reported nine pediatric deaths from the Covid-19. Some school districts are repealing mask mandates. Among them are the Madison County and Rankin County districts in central Mississippi and the Ocean Springs district on the Gulf Coast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/now-nevada-institute-staff-need-to-get-covid-vaccines-or-face-termination/articleshow/86718162.cms||---
---||India||India’s vaccine coverage crosses 90cr landmark||NEW DELHI: India crossed a significant landmark in its Covid vaccination drive by administering 90.4 crore doses till Saturday evening. More than 72 lakh doses were administered till 9:30pm on Saturday, with Bihar taking the lead by pushing 26.4 lakh jabs in a single day. Maharashtra, which inoculated the second-highest number of people, trailed Bihar with a count of 7.5 lakh doses. India’s average daily vaccinations has increased substantially in September to just over 79 lakh doses/day (up from 59.2 lakh/day in August), as more than one crore doses were administered on four separate days including 2.5 crore on September 17. The daily average, however, dropped slightly last week (September 25-October 1) to 68.84 lakh doses/day from 76.14 lakh doses/day in the September 18-24 week. The first-dose coverage of the country’s adult population has also increased significantly to around 70% of the estimated 94 crore people aged 18 and above. So far, 26% of the adult population has received both doses. While more than 5.3 crore doses of unutilised anti-Covid jabs were available with the states and UTs till Saturday morning, officials are expecting supplies to improve further over the next few weeks as Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D vaccine is expected to be rolled out soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-vaccine-coverage-crosses-90cr-landmark/articleshow/86718744.cms||---
---||Business||Vaccination drive, dip in Covid cases help domestic air travel soar||MUMBAI: Domestic air travel demand was on a steady rise worldwide until August when concerns over the Covid-19 Delta variant reversed the trend in countries such as China, US, Japan, Australia and Brazil. By contrast, in India, buoyed by vaccination drives and a drop in Covid cases, domestic traffic demand has continued its steady month-on-month climb since June, according to recent data released by International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global airlines’ trade body. In India, the climb had recommenced in June after the huge drop witnessed in April-May during the second Covid wave, which had India’s domestic air travel demand take the deepest plunge worldwide. Domestic air travel demand (measured in revenue passenger kilometres: number of kilometers flown by all passengers) was the lowest in May. It fell 71% as compared to the pre-Covid month of May 2019, showed IATA data. Only Japan with a 68.5% drop in demand as compared to May 2019 came close. Other countries fared way better that month. The US registered only a 26% dip in domestic air travel demand in May 2021 versus May 2019 while it was a drop of 30% for Australia and 44% for Brazil. Countries such as Russia and China registered a growth in domestic travel demand, of 23% and 6%, respectively, as compared to May 2019. But India caught up in August. With fears over the Delta variant, globally, domestic travel demand dipped in most countries that month. The decrease in domestic travel demand was 32% in August 2021 versus August 2019, globally. The previous month, it was only down by 16% as compared to July 2019, said the IATA report. On the other hand, in India, domestic travel demand was down by 60 % in July 2021 versus 2019. The percentage decrease reduced next month with a 45% decline in August 2021 versus 2019. “India’s domestic traffic reversed the August trend...owing to positive trends in new cases and vaccination,” it said. In August, domestic passenger traffic at Mumbai airport touched 1.4 million, which is what the airport had handled in March. Delhi airport’s domestic passenger traffic had peaked in March with 2.9 milli-on passengers and the airport inched close to that number in August with 2.6 million passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vaccination-drive-dip-in-covid-cases-help-domestic-air-travel-soar/articleshow/86718761.cms||Manju V
---||World||Trump asks court to get him back on Twitter||WASHINGTON: Former president Donald Trump has filed a suit asking a court to reinstate his account on Twitter and restore the online voice he lost for allegedly instigating the Capitol Hill riot. Twitter and other social media banned the former president from their platforms after a mob of pro-Trump supporters assaulted the United States Congress building on January 6. They were riled up by a speech hours earlier, when Trump hammered away at his false claims that the election he lost to Joe Biden was stolen from him. Twitter said at the time that Trump tweets leading up to his removal violated its policy against glorifying violence and were likely to cause people to mimic what happened on January 6. In the filing Friday in a Florida federal court, Trump argued that the platform that served as his main megaphone for reaching his millions of conservative followers was "coerced" into suspending him by members of the US Congress. At the time he was banned Trump had more than 88 million Twitter followers. Twitter, the filing argues, "exercises a degree of power and control over political discourse in this country that is immeasurable, historically unprecedented, and profoundly dangerous to open democratic debate." The suit notes that the Taliban, in power in Afghanistan now and still considered a terrorist organization by the United States, is allowed to have a Twitter account. That account appeared on August 8 and "over the weeks that followed Twitter allowed the Taliban to tweet regularly about their military conquests and victories across Afghanistan." Banning Trump but not the Taliban amounts to "ludicrous incongruity" on the part of Twitter, the suit alleges. Contacted by AFP, Twitter declined to comment on Trump's move. Trump continues to hold a tight grip on the Republican Party and after keeping a low profile for some months after the election, he has resumed holding election-style rallies, often dropping hints that he will run again for the White House in 2024.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-asks-court-to-get-him-back-on-twitter/articleshow/86718885.cms||---

While the government did amend this policy after the Fifth Central Pay Commission’s recommendations in 1996, any deceased soldier’s wife entitled to liberalised family pension prior to that would be deprived of it in the event of remarrying someone other than her late spouse’s brother. “A widow is competent and entitled to remarry according to her choice and will. The conditions preventing the remarriage of the widow or restricting her choice to marry to the late husband’s brother alone for claiming LFP will only be conditions imposed in restraint of marriage and hence, violate the public policy to be followed in respect of marriage. Therefore, those two conditions... are void as they are against the public policy in respect of marriage,” the tribunal ruled. The tribunal’s Lucknow bench passed these orders while allowing an application filed by Girija Devi, whose husband Sepoy Shree Kishan, a native of village Surwari in Mathura district of UP, was killed in the 1971 war. The applicant had been granted special family pension from February 1, 1972, till her marriage on May 6, 1974. After remarriage, she was paid ordinary family pension. She filed a plea in October 2011, informing that the parents of the deceased soldier had died prior to 2006, but a liberalised family pension was not granted to her. She then approached the tribunal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-tribunal-junks-widow-remarriage-rule-for-pension/articleshow/86719169.cms||Ajay Sura

Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal and Tehan formally launched the resumption of negotiations on the India-Australia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) on Thursday. The two decided to conclude the negotiations on CECA by the end of 2022 and reach an interim agreement by December this year to liberalise and deepen bilateral trade in goods and services. Negotiations for the trade deal, which began almost a decade ago, have been stalled since 2015. The two sides have also decided to include e-commerce in the final FTA which is expected to be completed by the end of December 2022, said Tehan. “There will be a number of areas that the interim agreement will cover and we have also agreed that there will be market access offers by the end of October,” said Tehan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/australia-wants-fta-with-india-to-be-a-win-win-for-both-sides/articleshow/86719261.cms||---
---||Raipur||Chhattisgarh won’t become another Punjab, says CM||RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh Congress will never become another Punjab, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said on Saturday, even as more of his loyalists landed up in Delhi, apparently to lobby against any change of guard in the state. Sources in Congress say another eight to 10 Congress MLAs flew to Delhi on Saturday on two flights to join some dozen-odd party colleagues already camping there for the past three days. The Chhattisgarh MLAs’ Delhi dash hasn’t gone down well with the Congress high command when it is battling the Punjab crisis, say sources. Like the legislators before them, the MLAs who went to Delhi on Saturday, claimed they were on personal trips. Around a third of Congress legislators are now in the national capital – that’s some coincidence. “Why is the media after these legislators? Is there any political development? MLAs can travel anywhere. If they have gone, they will come back,” CM Baghel told reporters at the state party headquarters in Raipur where he attended a Gandhi Jayanti function. “Everyone is free to go wherever they want. When there is no political development, why is their visit being viewed through a political prism?” he asked. Reacting to BJP vice-president and former CM Raman Singh’s jibe that Chhattisgarh Congress is going the Punjab way, Baghel said: “Chhattisgarh can never become Punjab. The two states have only one thing in common — there’s a number in their names. Punjab is a land of five rivers and our state is formed of 36-Garh”. Baghel has been trying to downplay the legislators’ beeline for Delhi, saying it is not linked to political developments, but one of the MLAs, Brihaspat Singh, has publicly given a statement in Delhi against any change of guard in Chhattisgarh.  Besides, sources say, the MLAs have been trying to meet senior party functionaries for the last couple of days but they haven’t yet got a hearing. Raman Singh said: “It’s for Rahul Gandhi to take a decision to end the political uncertainty in the state. Congress MLAs are frequenting Delhi. They say it is tourism. Leadership has crumbled in Congress where senior leaders are raising their voice against the leadership.” On September 29, around 15 legislators, mostly first-time MLAs, landed in Delhi in the middle of the Punjab political crisis. Later, other groups of legislators left for the capital. It’s being viewed in political circles as a show of strength by Baghel loyalists against any possible leadership change in the state. Trouble has been simmering in Chhattisgarh Congress since the last week of August following speculation about a mid-term change of guard on a purported formula agreed upon after the 2018 election victory. CM Baghel and health minister T S Singhdeo had separate meetings with senior leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, in August. Singhdeo, who is in race for the top post, maintains he is waiting for the high command’s decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/cg-wont-become-another-punjab-says-baghel/articleshow/86719288.cms||---

Even rural industrial parks will run on cow-dung power, he said. Chhattisgarh is the only state that procures cow dung from farmers, turns it into vermicompost and sells it in the market. CM Baghel launched the ‘Gobar Se Bijli’ scheme in three districts – Raipur, Durg and Bemetara -- on Gandhi Jayanti. “When the world is worried about global warming and everyone is talking of green energy, our government has decided to make electricity from cow dung and contribute to the making of a greener Earth,” he said. Scientists said the cost of electricity generated from cow dung would range from Rs 2.50 to Rs 3 per unit. Around 20kg cow dung produces enough methane to generate 2KW electricity, they said. Every village in Chhattisgarh will have a gobar-to-bijli plant that will be set up at gauthans (cow shelters), the CM announced. “Cow dung procured from farmers under Godhan Nyay Yojana will be used to generate electricity. This will not only benefit the environment but also women self-help groups that do the procurement,” Baghel said while inaugurating the project at a Kisan Sammelan in Bemetara district. Women and youth will participate in the production of green energy, Baghel said, adding: “The state government aims to implement innovative schemes for the inclusive development of its 76.7% rural population in order to make Bapu’s dream of ‘gram swaraj’ a reality. This will not only increase employment, but also improve the standard of living of villagers.”  Chhattisgarh procures cow dung for Rs 2 per kg from cattle owners, and sells the vermicompost in the market at Rs 8 per kg. The state has so far purchased ‘gobar’ worth over Rs 102.5 crore. A system is already in place to collect raw material for the cow dung-to-power scheme. “Biogas plants, scrubbers and gensets have been set up in gauthans to generate electricity from cow dung. Power will be produced from the methane in these tanks. Gauthans will now become self-sufficient in terms of electricity, besides manufacturing organic manure, and doubling the benefits and income of gauthan samiti and women self-help groups,” said Baghel, adding that the Chhattisgarh government has been working on the project for several months. Gauthans have been developed in the form of rural industrial parks in 6,000 villages under the Suraji Gaon Yojana to produce manure and other income-oriented activities conducted by women. So far, more than 12 lakh quintals of vermicompost and super compost manure have been produced and sold. Under the Suraji Gaon Yojana, the state government has sanctioned construction of 10,112 gauthans for the purpose of conservation and promotion of livestock in villages out of which 6,112 gauthans (60%) are already operational. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/cm-launches-gobar-to-power-project-to-run-rural-ind-parks/articleshow/86719291.cms||---

The launch of the legal aid mission with Gandhi Jayanti made the President remember the ideals set by Mahatma Gandhi as a lawyer in South Africa. Kovind said that Gandhiji wanted the poor to get equal access to justice and lawyers to render free of cost service to poor litigants. "I feel the advice of Bapu should be followed by advocates, especially by the designated senior advocates in the Sc and the HCs. Pro bono services by established legal practitioners will go a long way in providing equal access to justice to poor litigants," he said, while lauding the NALSA's efforts in resolving 1.1 crore pending litigation in the last two years through Lok Adalats. The President also said there are only 11,000 women lawyers among a total of 47,000 panel lawyers with the legal aid services and 17,000 women paralegal volunteers among a total of 44,000. "I am told NALSA is engaging more women lawyers. As a country, our aim is to graduate from women development to women-led development. Increasing the number of women in NALSA, is important to reach out to a large number of women beneficiaries," he said. Chief Justice of India N V Ramana said the awareness programme, to be continued across India from Gandhi Jayanti to the birthday of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, could galvanise the system in providing poor and marginalised people easier access to justice. "Key to equal access to justice lies in creating legal awareness first. Legal awareness will become the galvanising force behind the reform process that we are propagating. Only when the vulnerable classes are aware about their rights, can they shape their own future." "In a democratic country, it is the faith and trust of the people that sustains institutions. We must earn that faith. The quality of democracy rests on the quality of justice. For a healthy democracy, a vibrant judiciary is essential," he said. Nalsa executive chairman Justice Uday Umesh Lalit said, though NALSA is in its 25th year of existence, there is a distinct lack of faith in the free legal aid services because of the quality of legal services. "Of all the pending cases, just about 1% of the cases are with legal aid services," he said, imploring the established senior advocates across the country to do just three cases free of cost for poor litigants and become harbingers of change in the quality of legal aid. Justice Lalit said in medical courses, internship is mandatory. A similar process can be initiated in the law colleges, which could adopt two or three villages in their vicinity where the students can go as paralegal volunteers to spread awareness about availability of quality free legal assistance. "The Bar Council of India has assured that it would help in enlisting the law colleges to do the needful in helping spread legal awareness," he said. Justice A M Khanwilkar, head of SC legal services committee, said the SC committee, 37 state legal services authority, 39 HC legal services committees, 673 district legal services authority and 2,466 taluk level legal services committees have provided legal assistance to 8.3 lakh poor litigants across the country since 2019. He said the permanent lok adalats have disposed of more than 39 lakh cases recently. Mediation has settled more than 1.85 lakh cases since 2019 despite pandemic. E-lok adalats during the same period have settled over 4 lakh cases, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/legal-aid-mission-to-cover-6-6l-villages-thrice-in-45-days/articleshow/86719562.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Govt to soon clear names of new CJs of 13 HCs: CJI||NEW DELHI: Chief Justice N V Ramana on Saturday said the government has assured that the names recommended by Supreme Court Collegium a fortnight ago for appointment as new chief justices of 13 High Courts would be cleared in one or two days and emphasized that speedy appointment of judges could help lessen the burden of pendency. Speaking at the launch of pan-India legal awareness campaign at Vigyan Bhawan, Justice Ramana said, "Since May onwards, we have recommended 106 persons for appointment as judges and eight for appointment as chief justices of various HCs. The government has cleared some. The law minister said the rest of the recommendations would be cleared within a short time, within one or two days." If the CJI was making a mild grievance about delay in appointment of judges, Union law minister Kiran Rijiju presented the government's grievance about delayed disposal of commercial disputes hurting the investors confidence and increasing the litigation cost. Outlining the NDA government's focus on ease of doing business for overall prosperity of the society, the law minister said the enactment of Commercial Courts Act, 2015 was a step towards creating a sound atmosphere for smooth resolution of commercial disputes. "The Act mandates courts to provide decisions in a time-bound manner. Adjourns should be reduced to bare minimum. Mediation should be a preferred mode of resolution of commercial disputes. This would lessen the burden on the court but also boost the confidence of investors in the Indian legal system and attract more investment," he said. He lamented that at present it takes 1,445 days to decide a commercial dispute at the court of first instance involving a litigation cost equivalent to 31% of the total value of the commercial dispute. For success of a law, it requires cooperation from both executive and judiciary, he added. On the front of Judges' appointment, the CJI has set a record. Within five months of taking oath as 48th CJI, Justice Ramana-led Collegium has recommended over 100 names for appointment as HC judges, eight new CJs for HCs and transfers of five CJs from one HC to another. Significantly, the CJI-led Collegium has set another record by recommending nine new judges for the Supreme Court, three of whom are women including Justice B V Nagarathna who would go on to become the first woman CJI in 2027. The Union government had cleared the nine names for appointment as SC judges within a week of the August 17 recommendation of the SC. However, the recommendations for appointment of new CJs of the HCs and transfer of CJs of five HCs have been pending with the government for the last 15 days. The CJI said, "My companion judges and I have attempted to provide litigants with speedy justice. I thank the government for expeditiously clearing the names which would go a long way in providing speedy justice to the people. These appointments will take care of pendency to some extent. I seek cooperation and support from the government to enable people easy access to justice and strengthen democracy." Seeking the government's cooperation in enhancing judicial and legal infrastructure in rural areas, Justice Ramana said, "Covid-19 has created many problems for many institutions including the judiciary. Thousands of cases have accumulated in different fora. Apart from large vacancies, non-working of courts and lack of virtual conference facilities in rural areas, the pandemic has exposed some deep rooted problems in the system." He said, "Quality of democracy rests on the quality of justice. For a healthy democracy a vibrant judiciary is essential... Socio-economic justice would be impossible to achieve without providing equal opportunity to access the justice system. Key to equal access to justice lies in creating legal awareness which will galvanise the force behind the reform process." Speaking at the occasion, Rijiju echoed the ideas of President Ram Nath Kovind and Justice U U Lalit to say that lawyers cannot be only money minded in their profession. Quoting Mahatma Gandhi, Rijiju said special attention from the executive and judiciary as well as legal fraternity is required to make equal access to justice for all a reality. "For many persons, any contact with the justice delivery system can be a challenging experience due to its complexities. More so for the poor and marginalised section, the justice system can be difficult to understand and navigate due to various obstacles such as lack of financial resources and lack of awareness on how to access the justice system and long distance to reach a legal service provider. NALSA is bridging this gap," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-to-soon-clear-names-of-new-cjs-of-13-hcs-cji/articleshow/86719580.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Kolkata||Live streaming and TV coverage replace pandal-hopping plans||KOLKATA: Avid pandal hoppers have been robbed of the chance to visit their favourite Pujas for the second time in a row after the court order barring entry of visitors inside pandal. According to the directive, visitors can view the idols from a distance of 10m, in case of a big pandal, or 5m, in case of a small one. Only a restricted number of organisers will be allowed to stay inside the pandals. However, most regular pandal hoppers said the restrictions were acceptable because they were put in place for the greater good and will keep transmission of Covid in check. “I was really looking forward to going out during Durga Puja and visiting a few famous pandals. But the restrictions announced on Friday have brought an abrupt end to my plan,” said Mainak Sengupta, a college student and resident of Tegharia. Expectations of pandal-hopping had been raised because a good percentage of people in the city have been vaccinated. “I had been expecting to go pandal hopping since I have been fully vaccinated, and immunisation has been generally good in the city. I hoped there would be some relaxation of rules during the festival. Although the government has lifted the night curfew during the festival, the new restrictions have made the curfew decision irrelevant. We won’t be able to take selfies and click pictures from such a distance,” said Arghya Dutta, a resident of New Town who would be out at least on two days, pandal hopping with friends, in the pre-pandemic times. This time, several organisers have designed their pandals in such a manner that people will be able to view the idols and decorations from afar, keeping the social distancing norms for the pandemic in mind. But many revellers are already planning to sit in front of the TV or go online to see live streaming of the rituals on the five days of puja. “Most pujas organisers now live steam the rituals on their social media pages. So, it is better to watch it on my smartphone for a better view. There is no point in going out among crowds and not even get a chance to click pictures inside the pandals,” said Samriddhi Sinha, a homemaker from Baranagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/live-streaming-and-tv-coverage-replace-pandal-hopping-plans/articleshow/86714826.cms||---

Agrawal was shot dead at the Harsiddhi block office gate on September 24. Jha said four shooters were paid Rs20 lakh to kill Agrawal. He said the money was financed by former pramukh of Harsiddhi block, Kindev Prasad (44), who along with shooter Manish Kumar alias Manish Patel (23) and liner Neeraj Kumar Singh (22), was arrested on Friday and sent to jail on Saturday. Earlier, a journalist, Rajesh Kumar Singh (44), was arrested. A nexus of businessmen, politicians and real estate agents was behind the murder, he said. Refusing to disclose their names, the SP said a politician, whose fuel pump was sealed, has been quizzed. “We are gathering evidence against him,” he said. The SP said Manish, Sachin, Pappu and one more shooter had reached the spot and shot Agrawal. Jha said Manish confessed to the police that the contract amount was paid to Sachin and Pappu. “Three are evading arrest. Rajesh had provided Rs1 lakh and a new bike to Sachin a month back. Rajesh is also a named accused for the murderous attack on Ramakant Singh in May this year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/shooters-were-paid-rs-20-lakh-to-kill-rti-activist-east-champaran-sp/articleshow/86712592.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The actor-politician, who also hails from the same community, also highlighted the Kapu reservation issue and how the community’s agitation got derailed after the train burning incident at Tuni station in East Godavari district in 2016. “Kapu, Balija, Telaga, Ontari and Munnuru communities never enjoyed the fruits of power and governance. Similarly, communities like Setti Balija and Koppula Velama also never enjoyed the power of governance. The Kapu community should collectively work together to achieve power. Together we can create a society with communal equality. No one can suppress a community for the sake of political gain,” he said at a public meeting. He also clarified that he is not against any community and went in alliance with the TDP in 2014 to give a message of unity. Meanwhile, agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu hit back at the Jana Sena chief’s comments. “He is staging a political drama in the name of ‘shramadanam’, which lasted for only 1.08 minutes, which is more like Pawan’s style of ‘start-camera-action’. Why is he waging a war against the state government? Is it for providing welfare schemes to the poor during the Covid-19 pandemic, or for introducing English medium in government schools, or for renovating dilapidated government hospitals?,” Kannababu asked. Kannababu also slammed Pawan for his “cheap tricks” by raising the issue of bad roads. “The state government has already prepared an action plan to repair all roads across the state, and has sanctioned Rs 2,200 crore for the works, which will start very soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/kapu-leaders-urged-to-unite-backward-castes/articleshow/86713322.cms||Venu Lanka

Following the appointment by Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA, Zurich, Switzerland) as the medical officer for the coveted sporting event, Dr Kiran will oversee the match between Iraq and Lebanon in Doha Qatar on October 7, and between Iran and South Korea in Teharan (Iran) on October 12. “As part of my duty there, I oversee medical issues and check medical aspects of staff, players and others who are accompanying the players from other countries and ensure proper implementation of the anti-doping programme. We have to work by adhering to Covid protocol as an infection control officer too,” he said, and explained the dope test procedures: “After collecting dope samples, the test will be conducted through a lucky draw. Only 2-3 players from each team will be tested. It costs Rs 20,000 for each test,” he said. Till July-end, FIFA already had conducted 700 dope tests, of which only one was found with positive analytical findings. “We usually find the presence of steroids or stimulants or recreational drugs like ganja, heroin and other substances in those who fail the test,” he added. The Dharwad resident has been a consultant in sports medicine for the past 21 years. He has done MBBS from Mysuru Medical College and PG diploma in sports medicine from SAI-NIS Patiala Medical College.

Jana Sena questioned them and now the government is repairing roads.” The actor-turned-politician on Saturday participated in ‘shramadanam’ voluntary road repair works at Hukumpeta Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) and at Puttaparthi in Anantapur district. Tension prevailed at Rajahmundry after police stopped Pawan from heading to the ‘shrama danam’ venue, citing Covid-19 norms and security reasons.Later, police permitted Pawan to proceed but with riders. They said only two cars would be allowed and denied permission for a public meeting. Pawan expressed dissatisfaction over the restrictions and asked the police to not be harsh with his fans. He filled potholes on the state highway and addressed the public at Rajahmundry. “The government has been ignoring road repairs for the last two years. People are facing severe problems and no one responded till we launched this programme. The government repaired potholes on Dowleswaram barrage in a single day when I announced would stage a protest there.

With chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy scheduled to launch the Clean Andhra Pradesh initiative at MG Road, commuters mainly across Kanaka Durga Varadhi, Prakasam Barrage, Krishna Lanka, Hanuman Junction and Benz Circle were left stranded on the jam packed roads. Vehicles were not allowed into MG Road from 9 pm on October 1 till the chief minister completed the flagging off ceremony of mini garbage trucks on Saturday afternoon. Cops placed diversions at Benz Circle where even city buses heading to Pandit Nehru Bus Station (PNBS) and vice-versa were diverted via Eluru Road while buses coming in from Machilipatnam were diverted via Tadigadapa 100 feet road, Enikepadu, Ramavarappadu Ring Road and Eluru Road. Traffic was affected after cops imposed restrictions for cars and other small vehicles coming from Guntur at Kanakadurga Varadhi to enter Vijayawada between 8 am and 12 pm in the afternoon. Bikers had to take the Tadepalli route and enter Vijayawada via Prakasam Barrage. This resulted in traffic coming to a standstill from Sai Baba temple to Prakasam Barrage for three kilometres. “The entire strategy was a mess. You must prioritise and send the vehicles leaving Vijayawada if you want to regulate traffic within the city. The arrangements were focusing on the opposite,” Konametla Siva Prasad, a truck driver from Vizag rued. Traffic eventually eased at around 1 pm after the CLAP initiative was flagged off from the MG Road stretch and the CM’s convoy left. Traffic cops said matters got complicated after many commuters who refused to follow the diverted route, decided to turn back and drive across the wrong side of the road, thus worsening traffic for hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/diversions-across-vijayawada-cause-hours-long-traffic-snarl/articleshow/86713270.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Ahmedabad||IAS acme: Gujarat steel frame shored up by engineers, doctors||AHMEDABAD: The notion that civil servants are generalists has been both re-engineered and anesthetized by the fact that Gujarat’s pool of top IAS officers is now dominated by engineers and doctors. Over the past seven years, IAS officers from those two disciplines have been outnumbering their peers from the humanities in the highest echelons of the Gujarat cadre. The tipping point was 2013, when six of the seven new IAS recruits in the Gujarat cadre were doctors and engineers. Between 2013 and 2020, of the 72 freshly recruited IAS officers, 61% belonged to the engineering stream while 14% were medical doctors. There were just 25% from other streams such as arts and commerce. Between 2005 and 2012, of the 106 fresh IAS recruits, only 27% were engineers while a meagre 5% were medical doctors and the remaining 68% came from the humanities. Experts say that profitable opportunities for ‘hardworking’ engineers had drastically reduced in the 2011-12 period. The number of students choosing the humanities in colleges also plunged. In that background, many engineers veered to the civil services. Interestingly, in 2012, of the 18 fresh IAS officers who selected Gujarat as their state cadre, only four belonged to the engineering stream, while none had a medical degree. An additional collector of the 2020 IAS batch said that a major reason was the change in the UPSC examination pattern after 2010. From that point, aspirants could pick one optional subject instead of two. “When there were two optional subjects, those from the humanities background had the upper hand,” the officer said. “When a single optional subject became the norm, engineers and those with technical backgrounds could compete with those from the humanities.” Dinesh Dasa, the chairman of the Gujarat Public Service Commission (GPSC), said: “In a competitive world, the employability of engineers is not as high as it used to be two decades ago.” Dasa added: “Instead of struggling to find jobs in their fields, fresh engineering graduates are now opting for work with a wider horizon.” Administrative jobs in the government is an attractive choice in that context. In the case of medical students who enter the civil services, Dasa said: “They opt less for administrative services as there is still a good requirement of doctors in society.” He added: “Only a few medical students opt for administrative services. They typically have studied medicine because of family and peer pressure. But once they become mature they find themselves suitable for something other than the medical profession.” Adharsh Rajeendran, a 2020-batch IAS officer, has a BTech in mechanical engineering. “I had a close friend who made it to the civil services and he told me about the possibilities that lay in the career,” he said. “I did not think twice before the dive.” A senior General Administration Department (GAD) official said that the period between 2006 and 2012 was the dot.com age and the IT boom sent many towards engineering. In all, 23.6 lakh seats were available in engineering courses across the country for 2021-22, according to the AICTE, the regulatory authority for technical institutions in the country. This is the lowest since 2012-13, when 26.9 lakh seats were available. The peak of the last 10 years came in 2014-15, when 31.8 lakh seats were offered by engineering colleges. Since then, however, the number of seats has been declining.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ias-acme-guj-steel-frame-shored-up-by-engineers-docs/articleshow/86714548.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, who was the chief guest at the event at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies, said the success of Bapu’s Champaran Satyagraha made Mohan a Mahatma. He said Gandhi often used to say had he been a woman, he would not have tolerated any torture. “He also said that the true meaning of Swaraj is the courage of a person to speak against any injustice,” he said. Noted Gandhian and Padma Shri awardee Prof Ramjee Singh spoke about empowerment of women by panchayati raj institutions in the context of Mahatma Gandhi's vision of gram swaraj. He said Gandhiji used to say that if women get consciousness, no one can do wrong to them. “A woman is full of divine power, that is why she is worshipped,” Singh said. He stressed that to establish peace in the country and outside, one has to learn from Gandhi’s philosophy of life. Sree Kant, director of Jagjivan Ram Institute of Parliamentary Studies and Political Research, said when women came to participate in the Satyagraha, Bapu used to make them aware of the difficulties ahead. Earlier, additional chief secretary and special secretary of education department, Sanjay Kumar and Satish Chandra Jha, respectively, flagged off the ‘prabhat pheri’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/students-artists-take-part-in-prabhat-pheri/articleshow/86712646.cms||Faryal Rumi

A record over 33.09 lakh doses were administered in the state on the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 17 and over 27.21 lakh people had received their shots on August 31. As per the data available till 9pm on the CoWIN portal, the maximum 1.79 lakh doses were administered in Patna district, followed by 1.03 lakh shots in East Champaran and 1.01 lakh doses in Muzaffarpur. The state health department had made arrangements at 14,887 sites, including five private facilities. At several places, boats were also used to reach the people for administering the vaccine doses. Meanwhile, four new Covid-19 cases were registered in the state on Saturday. Two of them were from outside Bihar, but tested positive during their visit to the state.

---||Kolkata||Bengalis abroad get online ‘priest’ training to worship the goddess||KOLKATA: Apprehensions of yet another wave of the pandemic and a spurt in the number of Pujas after a year when celebrations were put on hold have prompted Bengalis living overseas to take a crash course in how to perform the elaborate rituals for Durga Puja. A number of Bengalis in countries like the US, the UK and Thailand have trained themselves in the “shodos-upachar” or the traditional 16-step method to worship the goddess. A scarcity of priests at puja pandals in these countries was first felt last year when movement restrictions and other Covid-19 regulations regarding gatherings were imposed. “Five-six persons were allowed in during the celebration.  That actually meant that the Durga Puja was no longer “sarbajanin” where the masses could participate. It was confined to a few members of a family. That led to an increase in the number of pujas in the United Kingdom,” said Subhamay Bhattacharya, a resident of Canary Wharf in London. This prompted Bhattacharya to start looking for books and courses online to perform Durga Puja himself. “There are more than 60 Durga Pujas in the UK and around 40 of them are located in and around London. So, there is a scarcity of priests. That got aggravated last year. Bhattacharya volunteered to learn the ritual and will be performing the puja this time,” said Sourini Hazra, founder of the Bristol Puja Committee. “A lot of enquiries started coming in from countries like the UK and Thailand since the lockdown was imposed. In absence of priests, they decided to get trained for different pujas online,” said Nitai Chakraborty of Maniktala Tol O Nabagraha Mandir. Chakraborty broke the entire 16-step process into smaller parts and started teaching over platforms like Zoom. He used WhatsApp to send audio recordings of the mantra for practice. “It takes around three months to learn the “shodos-upachar” rituals. The most difficult part is sandhi-puja, in which an elaborate ritual has to be completed within 48 minutes,” he said. Arup Nandi, one of the organisers of the Durga Puja at Voorhees — a town in southern New Jersey, USA — said that nearly 20 families in the area decided to perform the Puja separately last year. “It was difficult to procure an idol during the pandemic, so we decorated a large photograph with the ghat in front of it,” he said. Budhaditya Bhattacharya, an IT professional who had so far performed pujas like Satyanarayan at his house, agreed to try out Durga Puja for the first time. He started learning from online and offline resources. “The temples have resident priests. But it is difficult for a new puja committee to find a priest during the pandemic. Many are apprehensive about getting infected,” Bhattacharya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengalis-abroad-get-online-priest-training-to-worship-the-goddess/articleshow/86714786.cms||Rohit Khanna

He also took a dig at CM Nitish Kumar for his ‘pata nahi (I am not aware)’ reply to a media query on NITI Aayog’s report on district hospitals across the country. The report on best practices in the district hospitals, released on Thursday, had put Bihar at the bottom in some categories. However, in several other categories, the state was ranked above the national average. “Bihar’s health department is simply rotting as per NITI Aayog. The government has turned blind to the plight of the doctors, medical staff and poor patients. I will try to get into the bottom of each malady afflicting Bihar’s abject medical system by listening to the wisdom of our doctors,” Tejashwi tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-slams-nitish-over-poor-health-infra/articleshow/86712768.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Dearth of fire stations holds up relief efforts||VISAKHAPATNAM: Inspired by the Odisha model of disaster management, the state government had proposed to increase the number of fire stations, manpower and advanced equipment along the coastal areas of the state. The move was aimed at achieving preparedness in tackling natural disasters on the lines of the Odisha government. But even years after the proposal, much remains to be done even as several cyclones have wreaked havoc in the coastal regions in the intervening period. Cyclone Hudhud hit Vizag city and its surrounding districts on October 12, 2014. The city remained in darkness for over a week. It was then that the personnel of the Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) won the hearts of Vizagites for their massive relief and restorations efforts. In the same year, the AP government announced setting up more fire stations along coastal areas. However, the AP fire department (Andhra Pradesh State Disaster Response and Fire Service) has only 184 fire stations across the state and it faces a serious dearth of staff (at least 30%). For instance, Vizag city, the only coastal city in the state with an over 25 lakh population, has had only three major fire stations for decades. There is an urgent need to modernise the fire safety system in the city. After learning lessons from the 1999 super cyclone that pounded parts of Odisha and inflicted damage to lives and property, the Odisha government decided to give top priority to the strengthening of fire stations to tackle various kinds of disasters. Odisha, with the unique distinction of having at least one fire station in each block, set up 335 fire stations and all of them were equipped with fire tenders as well as high-end, sophisticated equipment including boats, multi-cutters and tower lights. The home guards were declared as auxiliary force and the civil defence personnel’s duty was to contain the damage and save lives before rescue teams arrived at the disaster site, a senior officer said. Andhra Pradesh is yet to set up a sufficient number of fire stations to effectively tackle disasters. As per the norms, for every 50,000 population, there should be one fire station, but in six districts, stretching from Srikakulam to Krishna, there is just one fire station for every two-lakh population. At present, there are 90 fire stations and five fire outposts in six districts. District fire officer, Vizag, BVS Ram Prakash said they have sent proposals to set up new fire stations at various locations in the district. “Despite the shortage of manpower, our department has been attending to the various kinds of disasters to save lives. We are conducting restoration works, too,” he added. Though the state government had formed Andhra Pradesh State Disaster Response Force (APSDRF) with six teams for mitigation , AP mostly depends on the teams of NDRF and fire service personnel during disasters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/dearth-of-fire-stations-holds-up-relief-efforts/articleshow/86713169.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Ahmedabad||A first in 18 months: Zero Covid deaths in past 30 days in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: The last death attributed to Covid-19 in Gujarat was recorded on September 3, a month ago. The state is one of the few in India to achieve the feat. Neighbouring Rajasthan is one such example. It’s for the first time in the 18-month long pandemic that the state has not recorded any deaths. From September 3 to October 2, the state has recorded 491 cases with a recovery rate of over 95%. Out of 33 districts of Gujarat, 19 have zero active cases as of Saturday morning. The state would mark the feat when 27 cases were recorded in 24 hours – two-month high for Gujarat. To put the figure in perspective, just five months ago, the state had recorded 2,650 deaths in May at the rate of average 88 deaths per day. Calendar month-wise, September was the first to record only one death attributed to Covid-19. The last deaths in Ahmedabad and Surat cities were recorded on July 18 and August 27, respectively. Comparing Gujarat to other Indian states, Maharashtra recorded 1,571 deaths in September, Kerala 4,126, Tamil Nadu 637 and Karnataka 455, to name a few. Neighbouring Madhya Pradesh had also recorded lower deaths at 6 in September. Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital which had a 1,200-bed designated facility for Covid and treated highest number of patients during the second wave across Gujarat, said that they have not got any confirmed Covid-19 patient in the past one and a half months, let alone death. “Vaccination played a major role in reducing severity and mortality of the infection. While we still get suspected cases, their symptoms are much milder than the ones we used to get a few months ago,” he said. “All must get vaccinated to get protection against the virus.” The private hospitals in the city share a similar experience. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that the pandemic has taken the shape of an endemic now. “We do get one or two patients. But few require intensive care, and almost zero deaths have been recorded for the past two months,” he said. “But I would still urge all not to throw caution to the wind and follow Covid protocols especially during the approaching festive season.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/a-first-in-18-months-zero-covid-deaths-in-past-30-days-in-state/articleshow/86714457.cms||Parth Shastri

Those who have been arrested are identified as Yuvraj Pandey alias Ekansh Pandey, son of Ashok Pandey, Deepu Tiwari, son of Daya Shankar Tiwari, and Abhishek Kashyap, son of Om Prakash Kashyap. All the three arrested are residents of Singhadia in Gorakhpur. Following the incident which took place on Thursday night, a case was lodged against 14-15 accused under sections 302( murder), 147( punishment for rioting) , 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult) of IPC at Ramgarh Tal police station. The incident happened just three days after a Kanpur realtor was allegedly murdered during a police raid at a hotel which falls under the same police station. The incident took place when a few men entered into the model wine shop and ordered liquor. An altercation broke out when the miscreants refused to pay and started beating the victim, Manish, as other employees escaped fearing for their lives. The CCTV footage showed five to six goons knocking down water and beating Manish repeatedly with sticks, and even beating another employee, Raghu, who tried to stop the brawl. On the basis of the footage, the police identified the accused involved. In this case, the name of the brother of Pankaj Rai, former student union president of DAV college, had also surfaced as an accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cops-arrest-three-in-liquor-store-salemans-murder-case/articleshow/86717100.cms||---

The devastating second wave, whose epicentre was Amravati and Nagpur, has left a deep psychological impact on many due to which there is hesitancy by many parents to send kids to school. Natasha Gaikwad, a parent, said, “Many parents will have similar concerns because there’s no approved vaccine yet for children. If I do send my child then I would prefer using our personal vehicle because school buses and hired transport might not be a safe option.” She feels that the safest option would have been to keep city schools closed till the next session or at least till students have been vaccinated. Another parent Chandrashekhar Wanjari said that he would not want to send his child for physical classes right now. “I don’t think it is safe yet for children to be among so many others on the same campus,” said Wanjari. He says public transportation may not be the best option right now. “Even if kids go to school, I wonder how safe school buses and other modes of public transport are. I would definitely drop and pick my son in a personal vehicle. Ultimately, safety of children is more important than attending physical classes,” he said. Another parent Bharat Telmasre too said that physical classes are not an option. “I will not be sending my child to school because his safety matters to me beyond everything. There’s a lot of risk sending kids to attend physical school at this period of time. Schools should not be opened until and unless every child gets both the doses of vaccination and at this point of time each child’s safety and security is very important. Such decisions should be taken when everything is under control,” said Telmasre. Another parent Sujit Das said horrific memories of the second wave in Nagpur still linger. “It hasn’t been that long since that second wave. We would have preferred if the government kept schools closed for some more time considering children could be vulnerable,” said Das, who is a ex-armed forces member. Parent Sonia Sharma is concerned that children might not be able to follow guidelines on campus. “I wonder how they will maintain appropriate physical distancing at all times and it will be difficult for the school staff to monitor the same. Schools should remain shut until each and every person attending the school, including students, is fully vaccinated,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/school-reopening-no-vax-shot-for-kids-makes-parents-jittery/articleshow/86715104.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Badvel to go for third by-election in 70 years||VIJAYAWADA: Badvel assembly constituency is ready for its third by-election in its 70 years of existence. The constituency has seen 17 elections so far. The first by-election was held in 1963, necessitated by the death of Swatantra Party MLA Vaddemanu Chidanandam. The second by-election was held in 2001 following the death of sitting TDP MLA Bijivemula Veera Reddy. The third by-election is scheduled to be held on October 30, caused by the death of sitting YSR Congress MLA Gunthoti Venkata Subbaiah. The long history of Badvel constituency speaks of its loyalty to the Praja Socialist Party and Swatantra Party before it moves to the Congress in the fourth general elections held in 1967. Later, after the emergence of the TDP and with the defection of Congress’ loyalist Bijivemula Veera Reddy, the TDP wrested the seat in 1985. The Janata Party, which wrested power once in 1978, had also won this seat, displaying its anti-Congress roots in those initial years. However, later on, the constituency was swapped between the Congress and the TDP, till the YSRC emerged after the 2009 general elections. The constituency had been the fortress of both the Vaddemanu and the Bijivemula families until it was reserved for Scheduled Castes following delimitation in 2009. While the Vaddemanu family won the seat three times, the Bijivemula family won the seat five times. Veera Reddy from the Bijivemula family and Sivarama Krishna Rao from the Vaddemanu family are popular leaders in the constituency. The constituency was in the grip of B Veera Reddy for several years, whether he was in the Congress or later, the TDP. It was only after his death in 2000 that the constituency went under the command of the late Dr Y S Rajasekhar Reddy, under whose leadership the Congress won the seat in two consecutive elections of 2004 and 2009. After Rajasekhar Reddy’s death in 2009 and the subsequent launch of the YSR Congress party by his son, Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, the constituency stood like a rock behind the young leader, giving his party victories in 2014 and 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/badvel-to-go-for-third-by-election-in-70-yrs/articleshow/86713341.cms||Gopi Dara

Gautam is a cleric and a convert to Islam. He had allegedly converted a number of persons, including speech and hearing impaired and other vulnerable people. The means of conversion are in violation of the UP’s Anti Conversion Law enacted in 2020, says the UP police. Dheeraj Jagtap, a person originally from Yavatmal, was arrested in Kanpur by UP ATS on Friday. This follows the arrest of Prasad Kaware and two others from Ganeshpeth in the city by the UP cops. Jagtap was produced before the court on Saturday. Jagtap and Kaware are alleged to be part of Gautam’s network in Maharashtra where there is no similar law. It has been learnt that both had converted themselves to Islam but had kept their Hindu names. Jagtap had also been visiting Mominpura where he is said to be having links with some locals and carried out activities, said sources. According to the UP ATS press release, he had converted 10 years ago and was running a WhatsApp group ‘Revert, rehab dawah’ for allegedly luring people into the fold and harbouring religious hatred. Jagtap was also a key member of Islamic Youth Federation, an outfit which is mainly into conversion. Both Jagtap and Kaware were engaged in converting people by luring them with benefits and intimidation, said the release. He was also involved in preparing illegal documents of persons who had changed their religion, said the release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/up-ats-arrests-one-more-vid-man-in-conversion-case/articleshow/86715131.cms||Shishir Arya

According to the meteorological department, the city received 193mm rainfall between Friday (8.30am) to Saturday (8.30am), leading to a dip in temperature and causing extensive waterlogging in several parts of the district, making it difficult for the natives to commute. The rainfall continued at the time of filing of this report. The last time the city had received such a heavy rainfall was in 1894 at a record of 218.7mm, informed the department. "There is a well marked low pressure area over South West Bihar and adjoining UP ( east), which has caused this heavy rain of 193 mm in the last 24 hours. In the next 48 hours , moderate to low rainfall is expected in the region. During this day, the temperature might be around 30 degrees, while night temperature may fall up to 22 degrees," said climate scientist Kailash Pandey. Deoria and Kushinagar districts also witnessed heavy rainfall in the same duration, recording 75.5 mm and 66 mm rainfall,respectively. Maharajganj and Santkabir Nagar received moderate rainfall at 33.2 mm and 29.5 mm, respectively. Basti and Siddharthnagar received low rainfall at 6.7 mm and 14.7 mm, respectively. On Saturday, due to heavy rain since Friday night, the streets wore a deserted look, while shops remained shut as people preferred to remain indoors. Due to a public holiday, schools and offices were already closed.

---||Lucknow||Agencies gather information on religious places along Uttar Pradesh-Nepal border||LUCKNOW: As a part of an exhaustive exercise launched by the National Security Council (NSC), the Indian intelligence and security agencies are collecting every possible detail about religious places situated on the UP side of the Indo-Nepal border. Besides, the agencies are also tracking the spillover of mobile, radio and television signals from across the border, and NGOs and social organisations active in the region and their political affiliations, if any. The mammoth exercise is a part of NSC’s exhaustive study on these aspects and an assessment of its significance in terms of national security. Intelligence and police agencies in Maharajganj, Siddharthnagar, Bahraich, Shravasti, Balrampur, Lakhimpur Kheri and Pilibhit have been asked to collected details of all “significant religious places in border areas” with specific mention of the “strength and quality of mobile, TV signals and radio network spill over from across the border, if any”. They have also been asked to provide details of NGOs active in border areas. Reports received so far state that Nepal’s cellular, radio and television networks have clear or faint penetration into Indian borders. This is more because in almost all the border districts, Indian telecom operators have no signal or very faint network in the 5km strip along the border on the Indian side. As per the information gathered so far, Nepal’s cellular networks ‘N Cell’, ‘Yen Cell’ and ‘Namaste’ cover 1-1.5km range of the Indian side in Thoothibari and Sonauli areas of Maharajganj and some border areas in Bahraich. Nepali TV and radio have even deeper penetration in Maharajganj. However, since Indians are not very familiar with Nepali language, they don’t usually tune in. Similarly, the broadcast of FM Nepal, Krishnasar FM and Bageshwari FM is loud and clear in border areas of Bahraich district. In Shravasti, Balrampur, Kheri and Pilibhit districts, Nepal Telecom’s network is available for up to 5km on the Indian soil while the signals of FM channels like 91.4 MHz and Radio Gantantra 95.1 MHz work effectively.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Need automated signals at 17 junctions, say traffic cops||NAGPUR: With a considerable increase in vehicles on roads, the Nagpur traffic police have identified 17 junctions that need automated traffic signals. The survey also revealed that there are six intersections where defunct signals can be removed. The survey also found that Metro rail pillars are obstructing clear view of signals at 20 intersections, causing traffic jams and accidents. The traffic police have approached the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to address these issues without delay. In a letter to municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, the traffic police headed by DCP(traffic) Sarang Awad have also demanded repairs of 20 non-functional traffic signals across the city. Most of the junctions identified for installing traffic signals are in north, east and south Nagpur and in Kamptee, Hingna etc outside NMC limits. Sai Mandir Square (Indora), Pardi Naka Square (Kamptee), Wathoda Square (Sakkardara), MIDC T-Point (Amravati road), CRPF Gate (Hingna road), Hasanbagh Square (Sakkardara), Yadav Nagar Chowk (Kalamna ring road), Rani Durgawati Chowk (Indora), Kalamna T-Point (Kamptee), Wardhaman Nagar Power House Chowk (Lakadganj) and Prajapati Chowk (Lakadganj) are some of the places where there is an urgent requirement for traffic signals. For installing new automated traffic signals, the NMC will require approximately Rs1.53 crore. Given the prevailing precarious financial condition, the NMC may take long to fulfil traffic cops’ demand. Motorists told TOI that in absence of traffic signals at many intersections, most of them are forced to ignore norms to drive through hapahazard traffic. It often causes accidents, besides putting the lives of road users in danger. Encroachment and haphazard parking on roads add to the problems. Traffic experts too said that traffic has increased in the city over the years but authorities concerned are slow to respond. There are junctions where traffic signals are defunct and signals are missing at many spots. The traffic police have asked the civic body to remove signals at Ajni overbridge square (Sitabuldi), Munje Chowk (Sitabuldi), Dharampeth Coffee House Square (Sitabuldi), Mohammed Rafi Square (Sadar), Mangaldeep Chowk (Sadar) and Juna Nandanwan Chowk (Sadar). Non-functional traffic signals, which need to be made operational, are across the city, including Congress Nagar Chowk, Ajit Bakery Square, Gaddigodam Square, Mayo Hospital Chowk, Darodkar Chowk, Gorewada Chowk, Telephone Exchange Square, Chapru Nagar Chowk, Kadbi Chowk and University Library Square. The Demands * 17 new signals * 20 defunct signals to be repaired * 6 signals to be removed * Black-white stripes at speed-humps * Speed limit boards across city * No parking boards across major roads * Shifting of electric poles from roads||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/need-automated-signals-at-17-junctions-traffic-cops/articleshow/86715156.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The work of placing U-Girders had started on August 11, 2020, and the 624th —the last U-Girder of the section — was laid on Friday night. Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation Limited (UPMRC) director (works & infrastructure), and other senior officials were present at the construction site on the occasion. UPMRC managing director Kumar Keshav congratulated the entire Metro team and said, “The last twin U-Girder on Priority Corridor of Kanpur Metro project was placed on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday. With this entire nine km corridor from IIT to Motijheel is complete.” Excellent work has been done by UPMRC team and contractors, he added. “This work used to appear as a Herculean task to us, but we have completed it in over 22 months since commencing construction of first pile on November 15, 2019. This shows we have done great work with high precision. This is possibly the fastest construction of any Metro project,” he said. The track laying and signalling work on more than half of this corridor has also been completed, he said, while adding that UP Metro team is working round-the-clock to accomplish the target of starting trial run on the Priority Corridor in November 2021. The track laying and signalling system work had started from IIT Metro Station and has reached beyond Geeta Nagar Metro Station. The finishing work is being done at Metro stations and 70% of it is already done. “There are nine Metro stations on the Priority Corridor and finishing work is going on at all the stations. The finishing work at first five stations — IIT, Kalyanpur, SPM, Vishwavidyalaya and Gurudev — is in the final stages, while work on other stations is also being done at a rapid pace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/priority-corridor-track-base-complete-last-u-girder-placed-at-motijheel-stn/articleshow/86717168.cms||---

A MARD representative said they had attended to Covid and emergency duty on the first two days, but would be forced to stop if their demands are not met. The statewide strike did not have a wide impact on Saturday, which was a public holiday (Gandhi Jayanti). Senior teachers attended to out-patient departments on Saturday as resident doctors kept away from routine work. “We have been told by state medical education department officials that the minister will talk to us. We are still waiting,’’ said Central MARD president Dr Dyaneshwar Dhobale-Patil. MARD said the state did not give a written assurance that tuition fees for the period they worked for Covid patients would be waived. They were only given unofficial assurances that their fee would be waived as they were not taught specialisations they had enrolled for during the pandemic. The students pay an annual fee of Rs 1 lakh and want a refund of fee amount for 15-16 months. Other demands included not taxing stipends given to resident doctors at BMC-run KEM, Sion and Nair Hospitals. Late in the evening, Association of Intern Doctors and Indian Medical Association-supported MARD’s strike. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-resident-doctors-threaten-to-intensify-2-day-old-strike-if-demands-are-not-met/articleshow/86717236.cms||---

The city’s first lactation cuboid was developed and inaugurated at Glocal Mall in Sitabuldi to mark ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ on Saturday. The special purpose vehicle of Smart City Project Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) has planned the concept and launched it with the help of Goel Ganga Group, which constructed and is operating Glocal Mall. Tiwari told TOI, “Women are excelling in all sectors. At the same time, they are not getting all types of facilities. Pink Cabin is a good concept. I will ensure an amendment in the city’s development and control regulations (DCR) for making Pink Cabin mandatory in all malls and markets having 100 or more shops.” Tiwari felicitated Goel Ganga Group vice-president Anup Khandelwal for accepting NSSCDCL’s request and developing Pink Cabin. “We have developed Pink Cabin in 10x10 feet space on ground floor. We have installed two good sofas, two chairs and a table for changing diapers of children. We have also provided a ceiling fan and other types of facilities,” he said. Tiwari also announced that the next Pink Cabin would be developed at Gandhibagh garden. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation and NSSCDCL are likely to develop Pink Cabins across the city wherever required and possible, considering the experience of the one developed at Glocal Mall. Goel Ganga Group also facilitated a drive-in Covid-19 vaccination centre upon the civic body’s request. Meanwhile, NSSCDCL has planned various types of activities from October 1 to 3 to mark ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mayor-proposes-to-make-lactation-cuboid-must-in-all-malls-markets/articleshow/86715179.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The accused is the district secretary of the Samajwadi Party in Kanpur Dehat. Police recovered a country-made firearm and a car from his possession. After initial investigation, it came to fore that there was an altercation between the accused and the deceased.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: VRAS forms Jai Vidarbha Party to fight polls on statehood issue||Nagpur: The Vidarbha Rajya Andolan Samiti (VRAS) which is fighting for statehood, has taken the electoral plunge by floating the ‘Jai Vidarbha Party’ (JVP) for next year’s municipal corporation and council elections in Maharashtra. JVP is the latest addition to join politics on the “separate Vidarbha state” plank. Earlier, outfits like Vidarbha Janata Congress, Vidarbha Rajya Party, Vidarbha Mazha and Vidarbha Rajya Aghadi (Viraa) founded by former advocate general Shreehari Aney had tried their hand in elections, but all of them failed to make a mark. “The party has been launched to press for the demand of a separate state through the Lok Sabha, the assembly and local body polls. It’s the only solution for the issues like farmers’ suicide, unemployment, malnutrition, Naxalism, drought, and incomplete irrigation projects which are plaguing this backward region,” founding president Ram Nevale said in a press briefing. The formation of VRAS’ political wing was announced on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary. It would have 106 members along with 11 office-bearers to start with. The Election Commission of India (ECI) recently granted registration to the new party. “Instead of supporting candidates from other parties in every election, VRAS decided to float a political front so that votes of Vidarbha citizens would be secured for supporters of a separate state. We’re targeting 10 lakh members by December 2022. We would be fighting the elections on the basis of money collected through crowd-funding as we lack funds,” Nevle told TOI. Accompanied by newly appointed vice presidents – Ranjana Mamurde and Mukesh Masurkar – he added that they would limit themselves to 11 districts of Vidarbha region for the elections and would grant tickets to candidates supporting their statehood movement.

The reservoir's level has been rising consistently in the recent spell of rain. Earlier, despite rains in the city and surrounding areas, there was no significant rise in the level of the reservoir due to low rainfall in its catchment area. The most significant rise in the level of the reservoir was seen in September. Till the recent round of rains, Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) was concerned about the drinking availability if it did not rain. Correspondence had been started with the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) to ensure supply of water from the project to Ajwa reservoir. In-charge additional city engineer (water works) Amrut Makwana said that the water level in the reservoir was sufficient till next monsoon. He added that at the present levels even with more rainfall, there was no immediate need to release water too. “Only if there is extremely heavy rainfall, there will be a need to release water,” said Makwana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodaras-drinking-water-needs-met/articleshow/86715199.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Industrial court rules in favour of Chandrapur GMCH workers||Chandrapur: Around 500 contract workers of Chandrapur Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) agitating since 235 days seeking their pending salaries and minimum wages against their work had a major triumph after the industrial court ruled in their favour and stayed the appointment of a new contractor at the medical college. “The industrial court has directed the GMCH administration to deposit the pending salaries of all the contract workers within a month and reinstatement of all the regular workers,” said leader of the agitation Pappu alias Pradeep Deshmukh. Noted lawyers Adv Prashant Khajanchi and Adv Mohan Nibrad pleaded the case of the agitators who celebrated on the streets by dancing and distributing sweets on Friday evening. Nearly 500 contract workers had launched a sit-in agitation titled ‘Dera Andolan’ before the district collectorate since February 8 under the banner of the Jan Vikas Kamgar Sangh demanding their pending seven months’ salaries and minimum wages against their work. The matter remained unresolved even after several months of agitation. The GMCH administration instead of resolving the issue, appointed a new contractor for supply of workers. Contract workers Darshana Zade, Savita Dudhe, Madhuri Khobragade and Nisha Hanumante had moved the industrial court seeking a stay on the move. Regular hearings were held for three months. “Finally on Friday evening, the industrial court issued a status quo in the case and directives regarding depositing of pending salaries with the court and reinstatement of workers,” Deshmukh said. Narrating the woes of the agitators, Deshmukh informed that three of the agitators, Pradeep Khadse, his wife and Sangita Patil died during the eight-month long agitation following depression and mental tension. “Some of them lost their close relatives to Covid for lack of money for their treatment. With no salaries since the last 16 months, many lost their power connections and were even abused by their landlords. Agitators failed to pay the school fees of their wards and even grocers had stopped giving them supplies on credit. Despite these hurdles, they braved the odds and remained steadfast,” said Deshmukh. Pleas made to deputy CM Ajit Pawar, guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar, medical education minister Amit Deshmukh and many senior officers fell on deaf ears, even as Deshmukh met and explained the technicalities of their case. “The ruling of the industrial court is a victory of the constitution,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/industrial-court-rules-in-favour-of-chandrapur-gmch-workers/articleshow/86715206.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Kanpur||Grocery shop owner, wife and minor son killed in Kanpur||KANPUR: A grocery shop owner, his wife and their minor son were bludgeoned to death in Uchwaa area of Fazalganj here on Saturday morning. The assailants, after executing the killings, tied all the three bodies with a rope, covered them with a blanket and fled with the grocery owner’s two-wheeler. Police identified the deceased as Prem Kishore (45), his wife Gita (39) and their son Naitik (12). Prem Kishore, who used to run a grocery shop from his house, lived with his wife Gita and son Naitik. His two elder children, born to his first wife, live with his elder brother Raj Kishore, a resident of Gumti. Raj Kishore is a driver of a senior judicial officer. At around 6 am on Saturday, Raj Kishore received a call from his neighbor, who told him that the house was locked from outside and consignment of milk was lying outside the shop, and his brother Prem Kishore was not answering his phone calls. Raj Kishore rushed to the spot with relatives who broke open the locks. On entering the house, they discovered the bodies of his brother Prem Kishore, his wife Gita and their son Naitik lying in a pool of blood. All the three dead bodies were tied with a rope and covered with blankets. The face of the child was found to be tied with a polythene. On coming across a ghastly crime scene, Raj Kishore raised an alarm and alerted Prem Kishore’s neighbours and the police that the blood-soaked bodies of his brother, his wife and son were lying inside the house. Immediately, a police team of Fazalganj police station along with a forensic team and a dog squad arrived at the spot. After getting information about the triple murder, DCP (headquarters-South) Sanjeev Tyagi and DCP (crime) Salman Taj Patil also reached the spot. As soon as the news of triple murder spread in the area, a large crowd gathered at the spot. According to the investigators it seems the assailants have tried to give the incident a colour of robbery. It is a meticulously planned incident, and the reason of the murder is being ascertained, they said. “The injury marks on the victims’ bodies suggested that they were hit brutally with a heavy object which resulted in their death,” said DCP (headquarters) Sanjiv Tyagi. Meanwhile, tense moments prevailed when after the investigation was over, the police tried to dispatch the bodies to the mortuary for the post-mortem examination. Brother of deceased Raj Kishore and his relatives created a ruckus and accused the cops of removing the bodies without showing them. Senior police officials including DCP (headquarters) Sanjeev Tyagi and DCP (crime) Salman Taj Patil tried to pacify them, but they remained adamant to their demand. After efforts of half-an-hour, police removed the kin from the road. Later, the close family members of the deceased were sent to the post-mortem house by the police. Talking to the media, Raj Kishore alleged that the police acted in a very irresponsible manner. “Neither they allowed to visit us on the spot nor showed the condition of the dead bodies that how my brother and his family were killed”, Raj Kishore said. Hailing from Baijnath Kheda in Unnao district, Prem Kishore had married Gita, who was his second wife. More than a decade ago, his first wife Lalita had died in a road accident leaving behind two children. After her death Prem Kishore married Gita to look after his five-year-old son Puneet and three-year-old daughter Preeti from his first wife. After marrying Prem Kishore, Gita gave birth to his son Naitik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/grocery-shop-owner-wife-and-minor-son-bludgeoned-to-death-in-fazalganj-area/articleshow/86717279.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Students stirring out of bubble with a smile but parents wary||MUMBAI: When Aaryan Arole first heard that his school might reopen after all, the first thing he did was yank out his uniform, locked down for eighteen months. “I can’t wait to meet my friends and teachers, play football and eat from the cafeteria. Even the thought of boarding my school bus feels exciting!” says the class ten student of Dr. Pillai Global Academy. Except for one problem. The uniform of this 15-year-old who was 13 when schools shut down in March last year, no longer fits. That’s led to another conundrum. “I’ve grown a few inches taller and suddenly everything is small. I hope the school allows casuals for the rest of the year.” While kids like Aaryan are ready to stir out of their pandemic bunker with a brave smile and brand new backpacks, many parents aren’t. As families prepare for a return to in-person learning for classes 8 to 12 from Monday, run-of-the-mill worries have been overtaken by fresh concerns, leaving parents of students — from preschool to high school — more anxious than usual. Though some are ready to handle the transition to a more stable, interactive learning environment for their child trapped in a screen for more than a year, the possibility that their kid might get infected while sharing a school bus or getting too close to their classmates during assembly, games and lunch hour, are challenges that pandemic-wary parents are finding hard to shrug off. “I’m not hot about the return, especially because there’s been a rise in cases among children. And there’s still no definite vaccination plan for minors,” says Ashish Banerjee, father of a class nine boy from Peddar Road. Even as schools scramble to figure ways to help remote learners reacclimate to physical classrooms with SOPs on how children will be seated, shepherded or taught through a hybrid model of in-person and online classes, putting brakes on a child’s impulses can be a task. “Getting kids to follow an orderly route to and from class, canteen or washroom may become more difficult during lunch and toilet breaks,” worries Banerjee. Sutapa Bhagat, coordinator for EuroKids and mum to a class eight child, can’t help but fret about kids playing hooky to make up for days lost in lockdown. “With one batch in school and another at home, won’t maintaining two attendance registers be a challenge? What if some kids decide to naughtily skip school. Parents may think they’re in class and teachers might believe they’re at home!” she ponders, adding how staggered start times and rotational routines would throw working parents out of gear. Another stumbling block for parents is healthcare protocol for children who test positive for Covid. “There’s no talk about whether there will be a special helpline for cases or if schools should have a proper infirmary,” says Banerjee. The decision regarding reopening of schools for junior classes will come through after the festive season but anxiety has been several notches higher among parents of primary school children — especially those making the more difficult transition of going to a school for the first time. Jimit Shah, whose eldest started primary school in 2019 worries about how his son will cope in a classroom environment. “Although he’s in grade 2, he’s only been to online school. We as parents have always been around at home to help when he couldn’t keep pace.” Amrita Roy who would sit through every online class with her 10-year-old isn’t sure how much her daughter will pick up instructions from the teacher. “I hope teachers slow down for kids to adjust,” she says. Pratham Education Foundation, an NGO that works with schools across India has been running a readiness campaign for young children and parents across 10,000 villages and urban communities across India to help mothers of primary kids with bridging exercises in the run up to formal schooling. “Children from rural areas or low income urban families who have not been through any formal education or online access are now in class one or two,” says Rukmini Banerji, CEO of Pratham, stressing on the need for schools and parents to get together before schools formally open. “To alleviate fears and plan transition and safety measures more effectively.” To understand return-to anxieties among stakeholders of pre and primary schoolers, the Early Childhood Association (ECA) and Association of Primary Education and Research surveyed 500 parents that revealed many did not agree on what the safest method might be. If fathers seemed more open to coping with the risks, mothers were anxious about the impending ‘third wave’ and lack of pediatric covid care facilities. “It’s imperative that we help parents and teachers acknowledge their anxiety and help them talk about it. Children have mirror neurons and if the two most important stakeholders of their care are anxious, they too will feel stressed. That in turn will affect their ability to remember rules. It will also affect their immune system,” said ECA president Swati Popat Vats. Whether or not they trust the school to keep their children safe, many parents who couldn’t wait to send their children back to the classroom are now willing to wait and watch. “Just last week two children of my daughter’s age living in our building started showing Covid symptoms. We’re not out of the pandemic yet so why this knee jerk reaction halfway through the academic year?” asks Shyam Hari, a seafaring father of a class eight girl, refusing to give the school his consent. But even as such disputes play out, parents like Aaryan’s realize that virtual learning and ad-hoc arrangements are no replacement for the classroom experience. “Especially when they’re losing out on the last few precious days of school. I trust the institution to take enough care and my son to follow precautions for him to go back to what is usually the most memorable phase in one’s life,” insists his father Sagar Arole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-students-stirring-out-of-bubble-with-a-smile-but-parents-wary/articleshow/86717300.cms||Mohua Das

On October 15, to involve the stakeholders in rejuvenating the river that flows from the heart of the city, a group of citizens will undertake a novel ‘Vishwamitri Padyatra’ on October 15, walking alongside the river and connecting with urbanites living on its banks. “We have been making efforts to revive the river clearing it from pollution and ravines that have engulfed it. We have reached out to the government authorities and environment activists over the years. Now, we will involve citizens sensitizing them about the river and its importance,” said Dr Jitendra Gavali, director, Community Science Centre that is facilitating the foot march. “We intend to gather Barodians and make them walk by the river. Many aren’t aware about its history or its biodiversity. Once they understand it, they are likely to join us in the revival project. We will also connect with people staying by the riverbank and involve them in our campaign,” Gavali told TOI. The rally is being organized on the birth anniversary of former president Abdul Kalam, who had supported the ‘Vaho Vishwamitri Abhiyan’. Participants will walk a nearly 22km stretch within seven to eight hours. “We will try to cover the temples located along the river apart from other interesting spots. Spreading awareness about Vishwamitri that is home to hundreds of crocodiles will also ensure that people don’t dump garbage in it,” said Vishal Thakur, one of the organizers. Plans are also afoot to invite some prominent citizens during the campaign. “We will organise a bigger ‘padyatra’ next January, wherein we will cover the entire stretch of Vishwamitri from its starting point in Pavagadh,” Gavali added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/barodians-to-march-for-revival-of-vishwamitri/articleshow/86715115.cms||Tushar Tere

Bhujbal said a delegation comprising the event’s organisers met him. “We discussed the possibility of organising the event. If the Covid infection remains at the current state or the situation improves, we think the event can be held in the middle of November,” he said, Kautikrao Thale-Patil, the president of Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Mahamandal, and the office-bearers of Nashik-based Lokhitwadi Manda, which is hosting the 94th Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan in Nashik, were mulling over conducting the literary festival in November after it was deferred from its earlier schedule of March 2021 due to the Covid-related restrictions. Internationally acclaimed astrophysicist and writer Dr Jayant Narlikar was unanimously selected to be the president of the event. The organisers have started meeting again over the event and giving final touches to the preparations. “We are reviewing the Covid situation in the district and keeping a close watch on the spread of infection. If the situation remains as it is now, or even improves we will consider organising the event on November 19, 20 and 21. It will be subject to the permission from the state government,” Bhujbal said. The organisers were planning to conduct the event either in November or in January 2022. “We were close to starting the event in March when it was deferred indefinitely. All things are in place, we just need to start some last-minute preparations for which we have started our meetings again. We are hopeful that the event will be conducted in November,” said Jaiprakash Jategonkar of Lokhitwadi Mandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/marathi-literary-festival-in-nashik-likely-in-nov-bhujbal/articleshow/86896177.cms||---
---||Delhi||A thriller and a good joke have a lot in common: British author Clare Mackintosh||A good crime thriller is like telling a good joke. The punchline is always there, but we don’t see it,” British author Clare Mackintosh told a rapt audience at a Times Litfest session on ‘Whodunit: The craze for thrillers’. Mackintosh feels timing is crucial. “A joke, a good magic trick and a gripping thriller has only one thing in common – good timing. It is always there in front of us, but we miss it. And then when the revelation happens, we are like, ‘Ah I knew it’. But at the same time, the reader or the listener is blown away by it,” says the author of Hostage. While discussing the importance of plot in a thriller, Bilal Siddiqi, author of Bard of Blood, says that he plans the ending before he starts writing a book. “So, whatever I do in between, it should bring me to that end,” says the 27-year-old. Mackintosh, however, disagrees. “That might be the case with screenwriters but in the case of novelists, it’s two camps. Some plan their ending before and others don’t,” says the real-life cop-turned author. Panelist Kjell Ola Dahl agrees with Mackintosh and says that he too goes back and forth for a proper ending. “I search a lot of directions and try new things. I have planned earlier but then I don’t feel the tension of my characters and the closeness to the story if I do so,” the Norwegian author says. Dahl adds that he likes to compose a story like a mystery. “I am more interested in the characters and how they relate to society. When I write a book, I try to understand why a crime is committed. In most cases, society is involved,” he says. Siddiqi says that it is always a plus to have a mentor who can guide you. “It is extremely important to have a mentor who knows the craft well,” says the author of Bard of Blood, which was turned into a Netflix series. Mackintosh says that her earlier profession helped her a lot while writing crime fiction. “I was a cop for 12 years and have observed people from all walks of life. We all have the potential to crossover from the good to bad and vice versa. And that area is a rich territory for any writer, particularly crime writers,” says the author who loves writing high-octane thrillers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-thriller-and-a-good-joke-have-a-lot-in-common/articleshow/86715252.cms||---

They are of the view that the unemployed youth are unhappy with both the TRS and BJP governments which have failed to fill up vacancies in the government sector. Also, the demand for road shows to be addressed by Revanth has come up as the the new TPCC team did not hold any ‘Dalit-Girijana Dandora’ public meetings in Huzurabad. There has been no formal announcement on campaign schedule so far from the Congress. “The mood of the cadre is upbeat after Revanth took over as party president. He should take up an extensive campaign in Huzurnagar,” said a local leader. The party-think tank is likely to finalise the candidate from a panel of five names soon. The Congress leaders defended the delay in announcing the candidate citing the case of CM K Chandrasekhar Rao announcing the names of S Vani Devi and Nomula Bhagat at the last moment and yet winning the Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahbubnagar Graduate MLC seat and Nagarjunasagar bypoll. Revanth said the party has its own strategy for the Huzurabad bypoll. “We don’t have ill-gotten money to start spending five months before the election schedule is announced. The party will take all the required steps to contest the bypoll. Soon, we will come out with our action plan,” Revanth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-workers-demand-revanth-road-shows-in-huzurabad/articleshow/86715283.cms||Roushan Ali

Village head Girijakant Tiwari recounted how Jal Jeevan mission had revolutionised their lives with clean water flowing from taps and women relieved of the treacherous trek through the parched hinterland to fetch water. Tiwari also told the prime minister that every home in Umaree has a toilet and the village is open-defecation-free. Praising villagers of Bundelkhand for their dedication, the PM said, women have been empowered and getting their due with dignity through schemes like PM Awas, Ujjwala and Jal Jeevan Mission. In the seven-minute conversation, he took note of development projects in the district even as villagers huddled in front of a giant LED screen to hear the prime minister. Banda MP R K Singh Patel, local MLA Chandrapal Kushwaha, district panchayat president Sunil Kumar Patel, divisional commissioner Dinesh Kumar Singh, director of Jal Jeevan Mission Akhand Pratap Singh, district magistrate Anurag Patel were present. “Sisters and daughters of Bundelkhand would spend their invaluable time in construction activity, but had to wander about for water. The situation is fast changing. In last 6-7 years, it’s our endeavour to empower our sisters, daughters and mothers,” the PM said. Speaking to the gram pradhan, Modi asked, “Tiwari ji, what was the water situation in your village and how is it now.” Tiwari said, “Earlier, we had to fetch water from reservoirs or hand pumps. Now, water is reaching every household under Jal Jeevan Mission. We are also free from water-borne diseases. Women find comfort in cooking and enough time to teach children, while we find easy access to water for agriculture. We are thrilled and we believe that what you say, happens.” To Modi’s query on the toilet construction campaign in Bundelkhand, Tiwari said, “Women feel safe as they don’t have to defecate in the open. Now, every house has a clean toilet.” The prime minister also launched the Jal Jeevan Mission App to generate awareness among stakeholders and for ensuring transparency and accountability of the scheme. He also launched Rashtriya Jal Jeevan Kosh, where any individual, institution, corporation or philanthropist can contribute to help provide tap water connections in rural households, school, anganwadi centre, ashram shala, and other public institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/tap-water-flowing-in-parched-banda-village-head-recounts-jal-jeevan-revolution-in-interaction-with-pm/articleshow/86717319.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Rajkot||Blind banker makes food apps serve inclusion||Rajkot: The Covid-induced lockdown made most of us a little more dependent on our apps, but Aziz Minat faced a challenge that went beyond the pandemic. The 29-year-old blind banker, who stays alone in Ahmedabad, found it difficult to manoeuvre through the interface of food delivery apps, making life tougher. However, refusing to give up, he took up the cause and ensured that at least two of the main food delivery apps in the country change their apps to make it easily accessible for disabled people. Minat, a resident of Sarkhej, struggled to order food through food aggregator apps during the lockdown as these apps were not enabled to work with a screen reader – an interface between the operating system and the user that reads aloud what is on the screen and allows the user to direct the cursor accordingly. Minat told TOI, “I put this issue out on social media and a friend recommended that I file a petition on change.org last February then another one in June. It got a very good response as these companies contacted me through mail and over the phone regarding the changes that needed to be made.” While one of the firms implemented the change last year itself, the second company changed the app 10 days ago and, on their blog, credited Minat’s petition for helping them put themselves in the shoes of those with impairments. Minat says there are very few apps that are compatible with screen readers. “Today, there are many apps for travel, banking and myriad other services. They should be created according to the web content accessibility guidelines (WACG) prepared by the world wide web consortium,” he says, adding: “I want India to implement a law wherein techies are mandated to develop applications keeping the needs of the disabled people in mind.” On Change.org, Minat’s first petition garnered 14,464 supporters, while the second application received signatures from 27,934 people. The platform’s country director, Nida Hasan, said, “We are so incredibly proud of Minat for believing in his power to create a meaningful change. He has started an important conversation on accessibility and inclusivity for the disabled people in India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/blind-banker-makes-food-apps-serve-inclusion/articleshow/86715289.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Hyderabad||Tiger from Maharashtra spotted in Nirmal district||HYDERABAD: A tiger from Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS) in Maharashtra has now been traced in the buffer and eco-sensitive zone of Kubeer mandal of Nirmal district. Forest officials, who found the pugmarks of the big cat a few days ago, said that they were witnessing regular movement of the wild animals on the Maharashtra-Telangana border and there is one particular big cat, which has been regularly coming towards Nirmal district and going back to Maharashtra. While the tiger was initially suspected to be ‘Gabbar’ which entered Bheempur mandal in Adilabad district about a month ago, the officials clarified that there were very few chances of the tiger entering into this part of the state. “It is difficult for a tiger to move towards this part (Kubeer mandal) from Adilabad due to full-fledged roads and highways in between. We will know better once we get some photographic evidence from the camera traps. So far, we only have the data pertaining to its pugmarks and cattle kills,” a forest official told STOI. The last cattle kill was reported on Saturday morning in Bhainsa area after which a forest team inspected the site and submitted a verification report to the veterinarians. The veterinarians will study the sample of the kill and certify whether it was a tiger or a leopard kill, the foresters said. Meanwhile, the forest department has set up 25 camera traps and formed a special team to monitor the movements of the big cat to avoid any kind of man-animal conflict in the region. Villagers have been asked not to venture into the agricultural fields late in the evening or early mornings when the wild animals are usually active. When asked if there was a chance for the tiger to head towards Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR), in-charge district forest officer (DFO) Vikas Meena said: “Since the tiger corridor is on the other side towards Asifabad district, there is very little chance for the tigers that enter this part of Nirmal district to go towards KTR. This is outside buffer and eco-sensitive zone but since it is abutting Nanded area of Maharashtra, we see tigers entering into Nirmal or Adilabad districts.” However, taking into consideration the behaviour of tigers that had previously entered Nirmal district, including ‘Walker’, which came to be known for its marathon walk of over 3,000 km, the forest officials said that even this tiger will most probably go back to Maharashtra. “Ichoda in Adilabad is close to the tiger corridor in Asifabad district which leads to KTR. But in between, there are some encroached areas and roads. If the tiger follows that route, then through Adilabad it can go inside KTR. However, the chances are less because there are a lot many disturbances,” Meena said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tiger-from-maha-spotted-in-nirmal-dist/articleshow/86715236.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Self-medicating patients rose to 35% in lockdown, say doctors||MUMBAI: A community-based study in Dadar has shown that about a third of the people who needed medical assistance chose to self-medicate during the first lockdown last year. Such patients could have contributed to the early spread of the pandemic within their locality, said doctors from the BMC-run KEM Hospital’s preventive and social medicine department in a write-up in the latest edition of JAPI (Journal of the Association of Physicians of India). The survey, led by PSM department head Dr Gajanan Velhal, was carried out among 380 residents of Naigaon locality. “The National Health Mission data from March 2020 suggested that medical treatment, whether as in-patients, out-patients or emergencies, fell both for communicable and non-communicable non-Covid diseases,” said the JAPI article. One of the main reasons for keeping away from hospitals was the fear of Covid (77%), the lockdown (79%) and 73% felt their symptoms were too mild to need medical help. In the survey, done between December and January, students from KEM interviewed 380 residents, of whom 58% were females. Almost 35% of the participants said they had chosen to self-medicate for complaints ranging from hypertension to viral fever. “When we asked them if they would have followed the approach before the lockdown for similar symptoms, only 7% replied in the affirmative,” said Dr Velhal. The tendency to self-medicate could have been contributed to early spread of Covid-19 in the locality, said the JAPI study. Medical student Shirish Rao, who was part of the survey, said there was not awareness about teleconsultation though the group tried to talk about the Centr’s e-sanjeevani option. “Among the 9.1% who reached a medical facility due to an emergency, the outing wasn’t satisfactory due to the Covid restrictions and rules within hospitals,” added Rao. Heart attacks, diabetic foot-related complications and deep vein thrombosis were among the emergencies that people entered hospitals during the first lockdown last year. Among those who self-medicated, tablets for cough, fever and painkillers were “used once to occasionally”, while multivitamins, Ayush medications and home remedies such as kadha were taken “frequently to almost daily” to boost their immunity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-self-medicating-patients-rose-to-35-in-lockdown/articleshow/86717404.cms||---
---||Meerut||UP: Police team that said man held for cow slaughter 'died of fear' in dock||Muzaffarnagar: Nearly a month after Saharanpur police picked up a 40-year-old farmer from a Deoband village over allegations of cow slaughter and later claimed that he had accidentally shot himself in the leg while trying to flee and “died out of fear”, the deputy inspector general of police (DIG) has ordered a probe into the matter. The DIG (Saharanpur zone) has asked Muzaffarnagar police to lead the investigation following a request by the man’s cousin, Syed Isa Raza — who held a state minister rank in the former Samajwadi Party government — that the inquiry should not be handed to Saharanpur police to ensure a fair probe. The districts of Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar and Shamli are under the jurisdiction of DIG (Saharanpur zone). On September 5, police had raided Thitki village after a tip-off on alleged cow slaughter. After the raid, police had informed Raza that his cousin, Mohd Zeeshan, had tried to escape and accidentally shot himself in his leg. Station house officer of Deoband police station, Yogesh Sharma, maintained that Zeeshan was carrying a country-made pistol. “He shot himself in the leg and died after reaching the hospital,” he told TOI. Raza, however, said his brother had two licensed guns and had no need for a country-made pistol. “Two police personnel came to my home after the raid and told me that my cousin was involved in cow slaughtering and had shot himself in the leg while trying to escape. They said that he seemed to have died out of fear," said Raza, who held the post of advisor in sahkarita vibhag (cooperative department) in the Akhilesh Yadav government. Zeeshan’s wife, Afroz, alleged that he was beaten to death. In a police complaint, she said that three police personnel, including three sub-inspectors, had beaten Zeeshan to death after picking him from home. “On the day of the raid, he had told me he was being taken in for questioning. He never returned,” she told TOI, adding that her husband was a “respected person”. “We do farming on 40 bighas of land. He had no involvement in illegal activities or cow slaughter. I’m now left alone to take care of our three children,” said the 38-year-old. Superintendent of police (city) Muzaffarnagar, Arpit Vijayvargiya, said they have started investigating the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/police-team-that-said-man-held-for-cow-slaughter-died-of-fear-in-dock/articleshow/86713429.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||Kolkata||Director says Charu web series to highlight ‘slow poisoning’, not based on cop’s book||Kolkata: In a new twist to the controversy over the making of a web series regarding Naxalbari, the director has wanted to meet the members of revolutionary Charu Majumdar’s family to know their side of the story. Quashing reports claiming his series would be an adaptation of Runu Guha Niyogi’s ‘Sada Ami Kalo Ami’, director Sayantan Mukherjee said his series would highlight Majumdar’s alleged slow poisoning in prison by the state machinery. There have been talks about Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Jaya Ahsaan being cast in the lead though they are yet to sign on the dotted line. The final announcement on the cast is expected after the Pujas. But before that happened, controversy erupted when Majumdar’s son, Abhijit, objected to the making of a series on Naxalbari by adapting the controversial book. “That will be a distorted version of history,” said Majumdar, who teaches English at Siliguri College. Mukherjee told TOI such fears were unfounded. “The series is called ‘Calcutta Chronicle’. The first season is on Charu Majumdar. The second season is after his death till 1992. The third season will be from 1992 till Kishanji’s death in 2011. We will use real names. We are not making a series from Runu’s point of view. There was a systematic attempt by the Centre and the state to eliminate Charu. Runu was just a pawn,” the director claimed. During his research, Mukherjee claimed to have found that Majumdar was subjected to “slow poisoning” during his 12-day stay in Lalbazar. “Our research says his medicine and oxygen supply were slowly cut off. We tried to retrieve those files to find what had happened but none was available to us. I would definitely want to meet his family to know their side of the story. In my series, Charu will be the hero. Runu is a cop with grey shades,” the director said. He has gone through 100 books, including the authorized biography of Kanu Sanyal, ‘The First Naxal’. “My producer, Abhijit Chatterjee, had bought the rights of Runu’s memoir, ‘Sada Ami Kalo Ami’. Runu will be shown as a cop in the series,” Mukherjee said. Abhijit said, “It is not mandatory to get in touch with family members to make a commercial series. We don’t have any control over how Charu Majumdar will be depicted. The director can always come and meet us. Our humble plea to him is to refrain from using our names as an act of approval or credit to his commercial venture. Currently, it is next to impossible for us to give consent to this work unless he gives a public declaration on his intention. If he actually lives up to what he is claiming, it will mean challenging the authority of the state machinery. That will become a phenomenon.” Various works of fiction, including ‘Kaalbela’, ‘Tista Parer Brityanto’, ‘Kalo Sona’ have been part of Mukherjee’s research. “Charu made a huge contribution to the communist movement, no less than that of Che Guevara. But he was systematically removed from the scene,” the director said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/director-says-charu-web-series-to-highlight-slow-poisoning-not-based-on-cops-book/articleshow/86715312.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Winter guests arrive early, season’s first migratory birds fly into Rabindra Sarobar lake||KOLKATA: Birders and environmental activists were overjoyed by the early arrival of winged guests at Rabindra Sarobar, which has been one of the favourite nesting spots for migratory birds from far-off lands. Two couples of painted storks were spotted on one of the islands at the Lake. “I was very excited to spot the group. I immediately started looking for the perfect angle to take their photograph. A few families of painted storks have started revisiting the Lake since 2020 after a gap of five years,” said Abhishek Ghosh, a passionate birder. Painted storks usually arrive in the city in November. In between his job as a chemist at an MNC laboratory, Ghosh spends hours at Rabindra Sarobar in the morning and evening to watch birds. “Since I stay close to the Lake, I have the opportunity to go there all the time,” Ghosh added. Last year, as the city was shut down for a considerably long time for the pandemic and even when transport did reopen, the various restrictions had improved the environment. The cleaner air and fewer visitors to the Lake might have had attracted more varieties of migratory birds to the green zone; 118 species of birds were photographed last year, while 100 varieties were spotted in the years before that. Among the migratory birds that visited the city last year were pied harrier, brown headed seagull, Swinhoe’s minivet, grey backed shrike, Indian/blyth’s paradise, blue tailed bee eater, peregrine falcon, hooded pitta, little egret, great egret, common tern, large hawk cuckoo, black winged kite and white throated fantail. Many of the varieties were seen at the Lake for the first time. “We are expecting a much bigger population of migratory birds this winter, thanks to the proactive role of the KMDA—the Lake custodian—and Kolkata Police in complying with the National Green Tribunal order by preventing the celebration of Chhat Puja within the green zone. The Lake this year has been much cleaner. The ambient air has also improved because of the good rain we received this year,” said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an environmental activist and Lake enthusiast.

The woman was rushed to a hospital with bullet injuries. She is out of danger, said police. The woman was on her way to a temple in the morning when Gaurav Tyagi intercepted her, said police. In the ensuing argument, Tyagi drew a country-made pistol and opened fires at the woman who fell on the ground, screaming for help, said police. Seeing passers-by gathering at the spot to her rescue, Tyagi fled the scene, said police, adding that the woman was shifted to a private hospital, where she is stated to be out of danger. Meanwhile, anxious and afraid, Tyagi went to his house and shot himself dead, said police, who found his blood-stained body lying on a cot. Superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh said the body was sent to the district hospital for autopsy and a probe was going on. “We have learnt that Tyagi had turned widower a few years ago. He is survived by a son. He had been pursuing the woman of his village for a long. It was a one-sided affair. He had a tiff with the woman, following which in a fit of rage he attempted to kill her and then ended his life,” added the SP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/jilted-lover-ends-life-after-failed-bid-on-womans-life/articleshow/86713439.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Tilted’ vendor Act may hamper Delhi growth: High court||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has flagged certain provisions of the law governing street vendors, saying they “tilt the balance” in favour of vendors at the expense of planned development of cities. “It needs serious consideration whether, while protecting and promoting street vending – by enacting the Street Vendors Act, aspects regarding planned development of cities and towns have been compromised,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh observed while dealing with a batch of petitions on the issue. The high court said the Act needed to be examined in light of “possible infringement of fundamental rights of the citizens who live in any city, or town, particularly, under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.” The court was hearing petitions on squatting rights and setting up a town vending committee (TVC) in various places in the capital. It also highlighted how the TVCs have a majority of representation from amongst the street vendors, their associations and NGOs formed for protecting their rights. “The representation of the various authorities tasked with the task of local administration, including the municipal administration, police administration, public works department, etc, all put together is less than 50%. In a sense, the street vending committees, therefore, appear to be heavily loaded in favour of the street vendors,” the court noted, giving its prima facie view that “the scheme of the Street Vendors Act and the Rules framed thereunder greatly tilts the balance to encourage street vending.” The court also observed that the overcrowding of any place shall not be a basis for declaring any area as a no-vending zone, and sanitary concerns shall not be the basis for declaring any area as a no-vending zone, unless, such concerns can be solely attributed to street vendors and cannot be resolved through appropriate civic action by the local authority. It decided to examine the issue closely and clubbed earlier petitions challenging the Street Vendors Act to the current plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-tilted-vendor-act-may-hamper-city-growth/articleshow/86717427.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Goa||Goa: NIO study calls for caution in sand mining, flags erosion||PANAJI: Taking note of a report by scientists of the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), the Goa State Expert Appraisal Committee (GSEAC) – an advisory body to state on environment clearances – has given the go ahead to resume sand extractions at four locations in the River Chapora. However, the committee has laid down a host of restrictions, including installing CCTV systems to monitor the mining activity. Earlier, the high court had asked for such CCTV monitoring of sand extraction in the state to curb illegalities in the sector. Goa has also received a rap in 2019 from the National Green Tribunal for failing to install CCTV systems to tackle the illegal sand extraction in the state. The NIO scientists Mandar Nanoskar and Saurav Mondal carried out prefeasibility reports for sand extraction for the River Chapora and found that the upper stretches of river banks have experienced bank erosion at many locations. They noted that many more areas are vulnerable and prone to bank erosion. “Based on the baseline data and the prevailing site conditions, sand extraction at unregulated rates or in the sensitive area will have negative impacts on the environment. Accordingly, certain areas in the stretches of the river have been demarcated where sand extraction from the river bed requires restrictions,” states the NIO report. The depth of extraction should not exceed 3ms from the existing baseline profiles and sand extraction should be carried out using the manual method utilizing canoes only, without the use of mechanized boats or machinery, the scientists have recommended. Based on this, the GSEAC has given the green signal for extraction of sand from four locations in the Chapora, but has proposed regular monitoring of sand mining. “It was suggested that mines department or any other department could be designated for this work for timely monitoring of extraction,” GSEAC said. A host of restrictions have been suggested which include mapping the area for extraction and demarcating the rest as a no-mining zone, setting up boundary pillars at the demarcated area, no mining below the depth of 3ms. An environment management plan should be made part of the lease agreement for sand extraction, GSEAC has said. For transportation of sand, the use of trucks, tippers, tractors through the adjoining villages should be avoided and entry and exit points for transportation should be created with 24x7 CCTV monitoring, the committee has recommended. It has also said that the mining and loading activities should take place only during the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nio-study-calls-for-caution-in-sand-mining-flags-erosion/articleshow/86717419.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

A forest guard has been suspended and a notice served on a forest department official for dereliction of duty. The FIR was registered on the orders of Bijnor divisional forest officer (DFO) M Semmaran. A departmental probe is also on. He said a contractor, Taasir, was entrusted with the task of cutting to 476 old eucalyptus trees on a 5-km stretch on both sides of the Amhera-Chandpur road, which is to be widened. The felling was to be carried out under the supervision of the Forest Corporation staff. The latter allegedly connived with the contractor to cut more trees from other places. The illegal felling was exposed during a surprise check, when more than 10 trees were found missing. Only pits and stubbles were found instead of the trees, the DFO added. Semmaran said, “We have filed a case against five people, including sector in charge of Chandpur, Forest Corporation, -Madanpal, and another staff, Sitaram Bharti, contractor Taasir Ahmad and his two partners under the Indian Forest Act and some IPC sections. A departmental inquiry has also been set up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/5-booked-for-illegal-felling-of-forest-trees-in-bijnor/articleshow/86713455.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Aurangabad||Filling form 'F' not clerical, must be done by medical practitioner: HC||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court, while citing Supreme Court observations that: "filling of Form 'F' is not a clerical job, but it has to be filled up by the medical practitioner", has turned down the plea of Beed-based woman gynaecologist, Dr Sangita Dhakne, who had been booked a decade ago after eight incomplete F forms were seized from her sonography centre-cum-hospital. The forms, which are to be mandatorily filled by the gynaecologist, were found incomplete during a surprise visit of the authorities in June 2011. Subsequently, based on the complaint lodged by naib tehsildar Shrirang Munde, an offence was registered against Dhakne under relevant sections of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, or PCPNDT Act, and even the sonography machine from her hospital was seized. In 2011, the Parli-Vaijnath-based judicial magistrate first class issued a process against her in the case, following which, in 2012, the gynaecologist moved the HC seeking quashing of the process. The division bench of the HC, comprising Justice Surendra Tavade, ruled: "It appears from the impugned order that the trial court has considered the averments made in the complaint and the documents produced on record. Therefore, it can be said that the trial court had applied its mind before issuance of process. Said order is legal, valid and proper." In the petition, Dhakne, through her lawyer SG Chapalgaonkar, contested that the complaint has not been filed by an authorised person. On hearing the contention, the HC observed that the civil surgeon is the appropriate authority. Now, as per the amendment, civil surgeon can authorize any surgeon to carry out inspection and to file a complaint. "The prosecution can lead evidence to prove the charge leveled against the applicant. Therefore, the trial court has not considered the said aspect. Admittedly, the prosecution is required to lead evidence before the charge. If it is found that the naib tehsildar had no authority to initiate action, then the applicant can be discharged. Said aspect is dependent upon the evidence to be led on record. Therefore, I do not find any merit in the contentions that the complaint was not filed by the authorised person," concluded the High Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/filling-form-f-not-clerical-must-be-done-by-medical-practitioner-hc/articleshow/86712168.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||2,696 Covid cases in Maharashtra; doctor says count may not fall much now||MUMBAI: The daily Covid-19 count has been fluctuating between 2,400 and 3,200 for seven days, pointing to a lull between the peaks in the ongoing SARS2 pandemic. On Saturday, Maharashtra registered 2,696 cases, including 405 in Mumbai, and 49 deaths, including six in Mumbai. During the second wave’s peak in April, over 65,000 cases were registered in the state on some days. The lowest daily count during the earlier lull between the first two Covid-19 waves (peaks in September 2020 and April) was 1,842 on January 25, and there were another half a dozen days when the caseload was below 2,000. “With a population of 120 million, one cannot expect daily cases to go down much further,” said state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate. Experts have maintained that Covid-19 is unlikely to disappear completely in the near future and people may have to wear masks till the first half of 2022 if not the entire year. However, Covid could transition into an endemic disease such as malaria or dengue that is present throughout the year with seasonal and regional peaks. “At present, it may be premature to talk about Covid-19 turning endemic as many countries have or are in the process of witnessing the third wave,” said Dr Awate. However, he said the chances of a third wave in Maharashtra appear to be low at the moment. The reasons for this optimism range from the Delta variant to herd immunity. The third wave in most countries has been caused by the Delta variant, which was responsible for the second wave in India; the Delta variant was first identified in Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. “Many sero-surveys have shown that 60% to 70% of the population have been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus already. This is close to herd immunity,” said Dr Awate. Moreover, close to 50% of the state’s population has received at least the first dose of the anti-Covid vaccine and 20% are fully vaccinated. Officials are worried about the emergence of another Delta-like variant that could “escape” existing antibodies. “At the height of the second wave, the state had 7 lakh active cases. We are preparing for the third wave, expecting it to be 1.5 times worse than the second. We want to prepare the infrastructure, oxygen supply and medicines for 10.5 lakh active cases,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2696-cases-in-maharashtra-state-doc-says-count-may-not-fall-much-now/articleshow/86717479.cms||---

During their stay, the members and their supporters held a cleanliness drive and took out a march in village pockets. While former CM Harish Rawat is camping in Kotdwar, the state Congress in-charge Devender Yadav is in Ranikhet and leader of opposition in Dehradun. On Saturday morning, the Congress members swept the village and its adjoining areas, took out marches and addressed the locals on issues like price hike, jobs and migration. Addressing a gathering in Simbhalchaur, Harish Rawat said, "We tried to make a state where everyone could stand with dignity and had the required opportunity to earn, educate children and get proper facilities. Is there a single person who can say he has not been impacted by the price hike?" "In the last three months, LPG cylinder prices have gone up by Rs 200," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/congress-members-camp-in-villages-interact-with-locals/articleshow/86713453.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Kolkata||A day to go for embargo on hilsa, Bangla import falls short of target||Kolkata: With barely a day to go before the ban on hilsa fishing and exports begins in Bangladesh, less than a quarter of the fish that Bangladesh government had approved for export to Bengal ahead of Durga Puja this year, has crossed the border. Till Thursday, 859.5 tonnes of hilsa from Padma-Meghna rivers had reached Bengal against the permitted trade of 4,500 tonne. With Friday and Saturday being holidays, the last consignment will arrive on Sunday. From Monday, the fishing ban on hilsa kicks in. “We have had only 10 days of trading compared to almost a month last year when 1,450 tonnes were imported. Since the hilsa catch is low in Bangladesh, the consignments have not been large. We have spoken to the Bangladesh commerce minister Tipu Munshi and requested him to extend the trade permission after the fishing ban ends on October 25,” said West Bengal Fish Importers’ Association secretary Syed Anwar Maqsood. The highest hilsa consignment of 246.7 tonnes arrived on September 25. This is the only day when over 200 tonnes of the fish arrived. On the other three days, more than 100 tonnes crossed the border into Bengal. The smallest consignment was the one that reached on September 24 when just 20 tonnes of hilsa had arrived. “The catch has been very poor in Bangladesh as it has been in India this year. Landing of fish is expected to improve after the ban period,” said Maqsood. With the volume of fish lower than expected, the price of hilsa has not reduced as much as customers would have liked. While hilsa of over 1 kg was sold for Rs 1,000-1,200 in the wholesale market last year, it has remained in the Rs 1,200-1,300 per kg price bracket this year. At retail points, it has hovered around the 1,400-1,500 per kg mark, disappointing several buyers. “The consistency in the quality of fish was better last year. This year, in a carton containing 20kgs of hilsa, there are a couple of fish that are not so good and have to be sold at a lower rate. This pushes up the rate of the other fish as we have to make good for the loss,” a trader at Lake market said, adding that if the quality was consistent, price would have been lower by at least Rs 150 per kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-day-to-go-for-embargo-on-hilsa-bangla-import-falls-short-of-target/articleshow/86715395.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Hyderabad||Konda backs Eatala, to canvass for him||Hyderabad: Former TRS MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy has thrown in his lot with Eatala Rajender in the Huzurabad bypolls. Vishweshwar himself will campaign for Eatala in Huzurabad, but not on BJP or any other political platform. “I am against the tyrannical KCR rule. I am close to Congress, BJP and left parties’ leaders and my fight is against KCR-led TRS,” he told STOI. The former Congress leader on Saturday released an open letter to the people, appealing to them to vote for Eatala and teach a lesson to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for making empty promises. Though Vishweshwar initially thought of fielding a candidate, he withdrew his plan to ensure that anti-TRS vote was not divided. He sent 20 teams to Huzurabad, each comprising 20 members, to campaign for Eatala. In the letter, Konda said: “You (Eatala) were one of the pillars of Telangana statehood movement. Now, you (people) have got an opportunity to give a crucial turn to the politics in the state. Eatala’s victory will provide a ray of hope to the people for a better Telangana. The state is looking at you (people).” He further said: “We had high hopes of a better life in Telangana. I trusted KCR but he neglected Chevella Lok Sabha constituency and Rangareddy district. The district has been deprived of even Pranahita-Chevella project so far.” Appealing to people to vote for Eatala, the ex-MP said: “KCR had failed to deliver on his promise of ensuring withdrawal of GO 111. And now, he is making promises to win Huzurabad. Don’t trust him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/konda-backs-eatala-to-canvass-for-him/articleshow/86715388.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||FC Goa lift maiden Durand Cup after extra-time victory over Mohammedan||FC Goa became the first Indian Super League (ISL) club to win the Durand Cup after getting the better of Mohammedan Sporting Club 1-0 at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan (VYBK) in Kolkata on Sunday. In the run up to the final, Edu Bedia had stressed on the need to win trophies this season and it was the Goa captain himself who scored from an extra time freekick that eventually proved to be the difference between the two teams. The Durand Cup, Asia’s oldest football tournament, returns to Goa after seven years. Salgaocar FC were the last Goan team to have won the trophy with a narrow win over Pune FC at the Panchayat ground in Raia when the tournament was played here for the first and only time in 2014. Churchill Brothers (three times) and Dempo SC are the other Goan clubs to have triumphed in this tournament. Juan Ferrando’s side started the Durand Cup as favourites and had arrived with a strong squad which included four foreign players. They remained undefeated in six games which served as a pre-season preparation ahead of the ISL in November. Since inception in 2014, this is Goa’s third trophy, having previously won the ISL League Winners Shield and Super Cup. Backed by a vociferous crowd, Mohammedan, the 2013 edition champions, started brightly and were trying to catch their opponents off-guard. But Goa organised well with centre-back Ivan Gonzalez keeping his composure alongside Papuia, Leander D’Cunha and Sanson Pereira. Goa soon controlled possession as Mohammedan were left chasing shadows. Trinidad and Tobago forward Marcus Joseph, leading scorer with five goals, was hardly given any space and had to drop deep to receive the ball. The I-League side were impatient. They lost the ball easily and came up with some reckless challenges. Goa, on the other hand, were taking time to find strikers Devendra Murgaonkar and Muhammed Nemil. Their best chance came five minutes before the break when Devendra put Sanson through inside the box. The left-back cut back and laid the ball for Alexander Romario who ballooned it over. The trend continued in the second session as Goa were waiting for their opportunity while Mohammedan defended in numbers and tried to counter. The teams went into extra time just like they did in each of their semifinals. However, just before the break in extra time, Milan Singh needlessly brought down Alberto Noguera outside the box. Edu’s left-footed freekick evaded onrushing Redeem Tlang and Ivan but most importantly, deceived the rival goalkeeper. Nikola Stojanovic came close for Mohammedan late in the game, but Goa custodian Naveen Kumar came up with a diving save to seal a memorable victory for the visitors. For his goal, and assured performance, Edu won the Golden Ball for the best player of the tournament. Naveen Kumar got the Golden Glove while Marcus Joseph edged out Goa striker Devendra Murgaonkar for the Golden Boot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-lift-maiden-durand-cup-after-extra-time-victory-over-mohammedan/articleshow/86737948.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

The constituency has seen 17 elections so far. The first by-election was held in 1963, due to the death of Swatantra Party MLA Vaddemanu Chidanandam. The second by-election was held in 2001 following the death of sitting TDP MLA Bijivemula Veera Reddy. The third by-election is scheduled to be held on October 30, caused by the death of sitting YSR Congress MLA Gunthoti Venkata Subbaiah. The long history of Badvel constituency speaks of its loyalty to the Praja Socialist Party and Swatantra Party before it moves to the Congress in the fourth general elections held in 1967. Later, after the emergence of the TDP and with the defection of Congress’ loyalist Bijivemula Veera Reddy, the TDP wrested the seat in 1985. The Janata Party, which wrested power once in 1978, had also won this seat, displaying its anti-Congress roots in those initial years. However, later on, the constituency was swapped between the Congress and the TDP, till the YSRC emerged after the 2009 general elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/badvel-to-go-for-third-bypoll-in-70-years/articleshow/86715396.cms||Gopi Dara

Most colleges across DU have an asking score of above 90% for most of their courses with 10 courses asking for a perfect score from aspirants. However, over 87,000 applicants who are in the 80% to 90% bracket are still left with a handful of options under the first cutoff list. Courses like BSc (H) Home Science and BSc (Electronics) are some of the options for students in the science stream. At Bhagini Nivedita College, the cutoff for BSc (H) Home Science increased by one percentage point and has been set at 86% this year. The cutoff for BSc (Prog) Physical Science with Chemistry and BSc (Prog) Physical Science with Computer is set at 80% this year. Last year, the cutoff for both the courses was 78%. At Deshbandhu College on the other hand, with an asking score of 89%, BSc Applied Physical Science with Industrial Chemistry is the only course in the science stream where the cut off is below 90%. The cutoff for courses like BSc (H) Instrumentation at Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women is set at 87%, which is one percentage point less than last year. Similarly for aspirants in the humanities stream, some of the courses available for students in this bracket are BA (H) Social Work and BA (H) Philosophy. The cutoff for BA (H) Social Work at Aditi Mahavidyalaya is 84%— a rise by one percentage point from last year. With a cutoff of above 90% for BA (H) Philosophy in most colleges offering the course, at Shyama Prasad Mukherjee College for Women, it is 86%, at Lakshmibai College 87% and 88% at Mata Sundri College for Women. These are apart from language courses like Hindi, Sanskrit, Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali and others for which the cutoff is below 80% and as low as 45% in some cases. Stating that students in this bracket should not lose hope, Hem Chand Jain, principal of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, said, “It is quite possible that in the second and third lists, they will get a chance. The reason behind our college having considerably high cutoffs is also because of our improved rankings. In several other colleges, it is because of the board results. Students should not lose heart as the next cutoff list should be slightly reasonable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-slot-not-many-options-for-kids-with-less-than-90/articleshow/86717454.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

She also said the CM got Pragathi Bhavan for himself and began constructing a new building for the secretariat, but 2BHK houses for the poor remained a far cry. “During the Telangana movement, the TRS was demanding ‘nidhulu’ (funds), ‘neellu’ (water) and ‘niyamakalu’ (recruitment). While people are still struggling for drinking water, funds have gone into the kitty of his family. There was no recruitment and posts are now confined to KCR family and his henchmen,” the Union minister said while addressing a meeting during the conclusion of BJP state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar’s Praja Sangrama yatra first phase at Husnabad on Saturday. She said the TRS was scared of Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM and not celebrating Telangana Liberation Day on September 17. “Though the car (symbol of TRS) belongs to TRS, the steering is in the hands of AIMIM,” the minister alleged. On the huge response to the meeting, she said people have come in large numbers to bless the BJP and also to end the ‘corrupt’ and ‘dictatorial’ rule of TRS. Irani listed out the schemes taken up by the Centre. She said the BJP government had taken initiatives to reopen Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI) at Ramagundam and purchased 12 lakh metric tonnes of cotton in the state. The Modi government had spent Rs 25,000 crore on Dalits, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-govt-duped-jobless-youth-smriti-irani/articleshow/86715431.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Aurangabad||API, constable in ACB net for taking Rs 30,000 bribe||Aurangabad: Two policemen of the Taluka police station of the neighbouring Jalna district, landed in a trap laid by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) while accepting powdered currency notes of Rs 30,000. The arrested accused have been identified as assistant police inspector (API) Suresh Kasule (36) and constable Charansingh Singhal (32). They were nabbed by the Jalna ACB team. The constable had allegedly accepted the bribe on the API’s behalf. An offence under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act was registered against the accused. On September 12, four people were arrested, and their vehicle and other articles worth Rs 16.5 lakh — allegedly for illegally organising a bull fight and placing bets on the animals — were seized. API Kasule allegedly started harassing the people who were neither present on the spot, nor had anything to do with the illegal bull fight that was organized at Peerkalyan village-based state-owned grazing land. The API called the complainant and sought a bribe from him. “The officer allegedly assured the person help in the case, if the bribe amount was paid. Unwilling to comply, the man lodged a complaint with the ACB,” said Rahul Khade, the ACB superintendent. The demand for the bribe was confirmed during the verification carried out in the presence of government panchas. The accused asked the complainant to hand over the bribe to his subordinate on Saturday, when the anti corruption bureau team laid the trap and held accused duo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/api-constable-in-acb-net-for-taking-rs-30000-bribe/articleshow/86712236.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Hyderabad||Cops foil Congress’s Jung Siren, arrest several party leaders||HYDERABAD: Police on Saturday foiled the launch of ‘Vidyarthi-Nirudyogula Jung Siren’ by arresting a large number of Congress leaders and not allowing many of them, including TPCC president A Revanth Reddy, to come out of their residences and go to LB Nagar, the venue of the inaugural of the Jung Siren. Police said that permission was not granted for the event. Congress alleged that police resorted to lathi-charge on the party leaders and workers at many places leaving several injured. The party had announced a padayatra from Rajiv Gandhi Chowk at Dilsukhnagar to Telangana martyr Srikant Chary’s statue at LB Nagar, where hundreds of Congress members and youth were to take an oath to fight for the cause of students and unemployed. Several Congress leaders sustained injuries when the police tried to arrest them. However, many party members who were able to reach Telangana martyr Srikant Chary’s statue at LB Nagar paid homage and announced the launch of Jung Siren amidst slogans against chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao-led TRS government and the police. “By suppressing the inauguration of Jung Siren, KCR has declared a war against all students and jobless youth,” Revanth alleged. He announced that the next Jung Siren public meeting would be held in Mahbubnagar. Tension prevailed at TPCC president A Revanth Reddy’s residence after a large number of policemen deployed at the spot did not allow Revanth to go to Srikant Chary’s statue at LB Nagar to participate in the padayatra. Telangana Congress vice-president Aamer Javeed who was injured in the melee said, “Unfortunately, police descended on the peaceful protesters. The fear of TRS government is apparent. They have unleashed police atrocities on youth. However, this will further galvanise the Congress cadre.” He added that he had filed a case against SI Mahender at LB Nagar police station. LB Nagar police said that cases were registered for violence and 197 persons were taken into custody. “11 cops were injured in the incident. Without provocation, the agitators allegedly pelted stones at the policemen and in reaction we had to use mild force to disperse the agitators,” LB Nagar inspector Ashok Reddy told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-foil-congs-jung-siren-arrest-several-party-leaders/articleshow/86715438.cms||Roushan Ali

He said it would be the highest allocation received in the over eight months since the commencement of the vaccination programme and the state would aim for 15 lakh vaccinations a day. BMC officials also said that they had fresh stocks to carry out high-turnout drives for another week. “We have got 2.5 lakh doses of Covishield and 80,000 doses of Covaxin. This should help us vaccinate over one lakh people each on the first three to four days of the week,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. For the last three months, the state has been demanding three crore doses to speed up vaccination. So far the state has covered 8.27 crore beneficiaries. Of these, 5.81 crore have received the first dose and 2.46 crore, both doses. Nearly 30% of the population is fully vaccinated in the state. In the city, Saturday saw only 1.04 lakh people take the vaccine, against 1.39 lakh to 1.5 lakh on the weekdays from September 27 to October 1. While the turnout for vaccines is usually the highest on Saturday in Mumbai, October 2 was an exception. In September, the highest ever monthly vaccine doses (29.5 lakh) were given out in Mumbai. “Of this, 20 lakh was at public vaccination centres. We hope to do better in October,” said Kakani. Tope said that statewide the government had increased vaccination last month and it was hoping to scale it up further. “The state had completed two crore second doses mid-last-month and had even touched 15 lakh vaccinations in one day early September. With more doses allocated, we are aiming to have this as a target,” said the minister. He said that in a video-conference with the Centre he had thanked it for allocating more doses to the state this month. Ahead of the festivities, intensifying vaccination is key. The state had even passed an assembly resolution to demand three crore doses. Additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas said the Centre had allocated 1.8 crore Covishield doses and 39.74 lakh Covaxin doses for October for the target population of 9.14 crore beneficiaries in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2-2cr-doses-from-centre-in-oct-will-aim-for-15l-jabs-a-day-in-mumbai-tope/articleshow/86717542.cms||Nisha Nambiar

A resident of village Modipura under Pihanat block, Virendra Singh said, “Majority of the people suffering high fever are dependent on quacks operating in the area as the government centres are not admitting the patients. Laturi Singh was taken to an unathrised doctor by his family members. He was given an injection and administered intravenous fluid. Hours later, his condition deteriorated. He died on the way to Agra”. Resident of village Midkoli under Bah block, Mukesh Chaudhary said, “Three people suffering high fever have died in the last one week. Every house in the village has a family member suffering high fever and dengue symptoms. The community health centre is not admitting patients. The district hospital and SN Medical College is over 60 kilometers away from the village. Patients are suffering at home.” Chief medical officer of Agra district, Arun Kumar Srivastava said, “Health department teams are conducting door-to-door survey in the rural areas to identify patients suffering fever and help them in getting the required treatment. Medical camps are also being organised in the affected areas. Cleanliness work and anti-larvae spraying is being done in the villages to prevent the spread of vectore-borne diseases. Strict action will be taken against the quacks. All the cases of deaths are being investigated”. Meanwhile, at least three more deaths of patients suffering high fever were reported in the last 24 hours in Firozabad district. Besides 2 died in Etah, 2 in Kasganj and 2 in Mainpuri.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Survey to identify inactive ration cards||NEW DELHI: Delhi government is going to starta survey to identify inactive ration cards in the capital. Delhi has around 17 lakh ration cards under National Food Security Act and around 72 lakh people are linked to these ration cards many of whom are inactive card holders. The government wants to identify people who have not lifted ration for the last three consecutive months. If the survey teams find that the ration card holders have not lifted subsidised ration for the last three consecutive months due to valid reasons, the food department will give them notice and they will be asked to regularly lift ration.  If it is found during the survey that the beneficiary no longer stays at the given address, the ration card of such beneficiaries will be suspended by following the laid down process. Many beneficiaries who belonged to other states returned to their native states during lockdown and did not come back to Delhi. The survey is likely to start from November. “If the person who has not lifted ration for the last three consecutive months has valid reasons for not lifting the ration then their ration card will not be suspended,” said an official. The central government has fixed a quota for ration card holders in Delhi at 72 lakh (beneficiaries). Delhi has around 17 lakh ration card holders who are attached to 2,000 ration shops, which have been divided into 70 circles for administrative purposes. No new ration card can be made by breaching the fixed quota. So new ration cards will be made to replace the dormant existing ration cards. Over 2.5 lakh applicants for ration cards are waiting in Delhi for ration cards. Delhi government has appealed to the Centre many times to increase the quota to 80 lakh. Recently, Delhi High Court allowed Delhi government to go ahead with its doorstep delivery of ration scheme as long as there is no shortage of ration in fair price shops. “Despite being a much sought after scheme, the Centre through the LG rejected the ration delivery scheme one week before its commencement. This court order came after an overwhelming majority opted for supply of rations at their doorstep,” the government said in a statement. The AAP government believes that its home delivery of ration scheme will help curb the theft of ration and harassment of the poor by the ration mafia syndicates. It is likely to launch the scheme soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/survey-to-identify-inactive-ration-cards/articleshow/86717553.cms||---
---||Agra||UP cop booked for kidnapping, beating Aligarh bizman||AGRA/MEERUT: Days after six cops were booked in UP’s Gorakhpur for allegedly killing a Kanpur-based businessman, a sub-inspector posted in Bulandshahr was booked along with three others for allegedly kidnapping and brutally thrashing a businessman in Aligarh. Bulandshahr senior superintendent of police (SSP) Santosh Singh told TOI that SI Ajay Kumar was investigating a case of cheque bounce pending in Bulandshahr against the businessman, Abhishek Tewari. “The cop flouted a number of norms. He went out of his jurisdiction. The case did not fall in the category of heinous crimes and did not merit arrest as punishment was less than seven years. Kumar left the district without informing seniors and indulged in alleged illegal acts and hence has been suspended and an inquiry set up,” said the SSP. According to the victim’s complaint to police, about 10 people arrived in a car at his factory on the night of September 30 and started beating him up. “One pointed a revolver at me and another started kicking me. Some called up police but when local cops reached the spot, a man who was in a police uniform identified himself as Ajay Kumar, Bulandshahr Kotwali in charge. Then they shoved me into the car and drove off. I asked them why they were thrashing me and where they were taking me, but they didn’t say anything. They beat me up, drove around for a while and then suddenly turned back and dropped me at Harduaganj police station (Aligarh),” said the complaint. Harduaganj station house officer Rajesh Kumar said an FIR was registered on Friday against Kumar and three others, including an unidentified person, under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 364 (kidnapping) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. Talking to TOI, Tewari said he was picked up by police in connection with a cheque bounce case registered against him on September 16. “I was assaulted and suffered injuries. I feared for my life and was scared what would happen to my family, my two minor daughters. I’m grateful I made it out alive but no one should go through this,” he said. Inspector general (Meerut range), meanwhile, said an inquiry has been instituted and the accused sub-inspector suspended. “Our investigation is focusing on the malafide intention of the officer reflected in his flouting of service rules. Allegations of assault are not part of our investigation but if the victim approaches me with an application, we will certainly include it in the inquiry,” said IG Praveen Tripathi, adding that they would also assist in investigating the FIR registered in the Aligarh thana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-cop-booked-for-kidnapping-beating-aligarh-bizman/articleshow/86713609.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Delhi||Delhi: Ban in place, but crackers are still not ‘out of stock’||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has imposed a complete ban on bursting and sale of firecrackers till January 1, 2022, but a few shops in Sadar Bazar and near Jama Masjid are still selling firecrackers. When TOI visited the areas on Friday, some cracker shops were selling only toy guns and decorative items. However, the banned firecrackers were available at a few shops that had hidden their stock. At a shop in Sadar Bazar, toy guns and idols of deities were on display. On being asked about the availability of firecrackers, the shopkeeper showed different varieties of crackers, which he brought from the store room. The shopkeeper said the packing of the boxes of crackers would be done properly to hide their identity. Similarly, a shop near Jama Masjid had pasted posters that crackers are not available. When TOI asked the shopkeeper if crackers could be purchased, he asked about the variety and quantity needed. He also asked if there was a celebratory function. The shopkeeper said he could provide firecrackers in a day after an order was placed with him. However, staff at some firecracker shops said they were only selling toy guns due to the ban imposed by the Delhi government. A government official said, “The district magistrates and deputy commissioners of police have been empowered to implement the ban in Delhi. If anyone is found guilty, action will be taken accordingly.” An official of Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said that after the ban was enforced in the national capital, the police did not issue licence to shopkeepers. On September 15, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the ban on sale and usage of all types of firecrackers after reviewing the pollution levels around Diwali for the past three years. DPCC issued a notification on September 28 on complete ban on bursting and sale of all kinds of firecrackers till January 1, 2022. Last year, National Green Tribunal had directed a complete ban on firecrackers in the region during the Covid-19 pandemic. Delhi government had imposed the ban on firecrackers on November 6 last year, which was just before Diwali, but Delhi Police had already issued temporary licences for sale of firecrackers to traders by then. As traders had suffered losses in 2020, the ban was implemented early this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ban-in-place-but-crackers-are-still-not-out-of-stock/articleshow/86717604.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Pictures of the meeting in which the CM’s son, Rhythmjit Singh, can also be seen, are being widely circulated on social media. Apart from senior police officers, the crucial meeting was also attended by minister Pargat Singh, among others. According to retired bureaucrats and legal experts, the presence of any member of the family of a CM or a minister at an official meeting is in contravention of the Rules of Business of the state government. According to them, it may also violate provisions of the Official Secrets Act as several sensitive issues, which the CM or minister is bound to keep secret, are discussed at such meetings. A private person, even if s/he is a relative of the CM or a minister, cannot attend official meetings of the state government, the experts said. "This is an unusual practice and not expected from a person holding such a high position. The bureaucrats posted to the CMO should have informed him about this. The presence of an unauthorised or a private person at such meetings is against the interest of the state. It is also against the oath taken by the CM,” the experts added. BJP Punjab unit president Ashwani Sharma termed the incident as unprecedented and unethical, saying the CM is well aware of the rules as he is a three-time MLA. Credibility, and dignity while respecting the rules of the Constitution should always be maintained, he said. “It is unfortunate that senior bureaucrats, well aware of rules and norms, allowed this error to happen,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/row-in-punjab-as-cm-channis-son-seen-at-official-meeting/articleshow/86719615.cms||---

Land acquisition officer Vasanti Mali said the work of joint measurement of the land for the track was nearing completion. Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare has reviewed the progress of land acquisition. “After Diwali, the valuation of the land parcel will be declared and the farmers willing to part with their land parcel will be given the remuneration in their banks directly,” the officer said. The office of assistant director town planning is carrying out the process of land valuation. In all, 286 hectares will be required for laying of alignment of the Nashik Pune railway track in Nashik district. The track will pass through Nashik and Sinnar talukas and the joint measurement of the land required for the track has been carried out by the land records department and the farmers in 20 villages. The work of joint measurement in two more villages Belatgavhan and Vihitgaon — both in Nashik taluka — is yet to be carried out. On the reasons that these two villages were left out, the officer said the demarcation is carried out using the direct link by the satellite and the overcast situation obstructed the satellite signal. “We will have to wait till we get clearer skies to go ahead with the measurement,” Mali said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/land-purchase-for-railway-track-to-begin-after-diwali/articleshow/86712304.cms||Abhilash Botekar

This will make the zoo the only facility in India to house these primates in captivity. The zoo will be displaying Orangutan nearly after five decades, say authorities. It was in the early 1970s that the Zoo had a pair of Orangutans. They were popularly addressed as ‘Subba - Subbi.’ After their passing, None of the Indian zoos had the primate. Mysuru zoo has been making its best efforts for the last few years to get the Orangutan. Finally, the facility has received one pair each from the Singapore zoo and from a Malaysian zoo. The apes reached Mysuru after journeying for 12 hours including air and road travel in August. Since then, they have been kept under observation. Zoo executive director Ajit Kulkarni says the two pairs of orangutans and a pair of gorillas will definitely be star attractions. “They will be the prized possession of our zoo as we’re the only zoo to display the powerful and intelligent primates in entire India,” he said. Visitors of Mysuru zoo will definitely enjoy seeing the primates that will be put on display in four weeks. New enclosures are being readied to house them. Orangutan are sensitive but bright apes. They are an endangered species that are from the Borneo islands. Mysuru zoo, which is the only facility to successfully breed giraffe, spared a pair of giraffe calves in exchange for the orangutans. The lifespan of orangutans in captivity is around 40 years. Afa, 7, a male, and Minnie, 5, are from Malaysia while Merlin, 17, a male, and Atina, 13, are from Singapore. Six caretakers have been trained to look after the primates which are herbivores and feed on foliage and fruits. Gorillas travelled for 30 hours! A pair of Gorillas – Thabo, 14, and Demba, 8, both males, reached Mysuru after journeying for 30 hours from a zoo in Germany via Qatar and landed in Bengaluru. From there they were brought to Mysuru by road. Ajit Kulkarni, an IFS officer, said apes are healthy and active. “After we lost Polo, a gorilla that entertained visitors with its mannerism in 2014, the zoo was trying hard to get gorillas. After years of effort, we have received a pair. The International Zoo Association has promised to spare female gorillas,” he said. With these two new exotic species, Mysuru zoo has a long list of exotic species which other Indian zoos do not have. It is also the only zoo that has White Rhino, African Cheetah and now the primates. Infosys Foundation donates Rs 20 lakh Mysuru zoo authorities expressed gratitude to Infosys Foundation chief Sudha Murthy after the Foundation recently donated Rs 20 lakh for the upkeep of animals. Earlier in 2020, the Foundation had given the zoo Rs 20 lakh on two occasions. 1,450 Individual animals displayed Mysuru zoo is spread over 80 acres in the heart of Mysuru. It has houses 145 species of birds and animals including exotic species like the white rhino, giraffe, African elephant, gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutan, and gibbon. It is keeping as many as 1,450 different types of birds and animals on display.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/orangutans-back-in-mysuruzoo-after-four-and-half-decades/articleshow/86715579.cms||Lawrence Milton

Allegations of assault are not part of our investigation but if the victim approaches me with an application, we will certainly include it in the inquiry,” said IG Praveen Tripathi, adding that they would also assist in investigating the FIR registered in the Aligarh thana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-cop-booked-for-kidnapping-beating-aligarh-bizman/articleshow/86713710.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

As per the statistics recorded by city-based APJ Abdul Kalam Centre for Astronomy and Research, over 51 mm rainfall was recorded in a span of 25 minutes in the city alone, causing heavy loss to several assets in low-lying areas of the city. The most-affected areas of the city included many situated on the banks of Kham river that passes through the city. In Begumpura, Naregaon, Misarwadi, Jadhavwadi and Harsul, the water rose up to five feet damaging furniture, electronic gadgets and other articles at homes. Several residents were forced to vacate their houses and move to safer nearby locations in the middle of the night. Several household articles were washed away in nullahs passing through different areas in the city in the morning. The small-scale units, apart from those in Naregaon, suffered the most in the rainfall that temporarily disconnected Naregaon from the rest of the city. The absence of civic body staffers on the ground, resulted in serious outrage by residents in affected areas. The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s fire brigade remained occupied with rescue calls. The teams swung into action and pumped out water from over a dozen locations. Sriniwas Aundhkar, director of APJ Abdul Kalam Centre for Astronomy and Research, told TOI, “In those 25 minutes, the city witnessed rainfall at the rate of 118 mm, per hour, making it the third cloud burst in the city in the past one month.” He said that Cyclone Shaheen has moved towards Oman, causing a deep depression and eventually pulling the clouds from Bay of Bengal towards the region. “This, clubbed with the increase in humidity and return in monsoon, resulted in heavy showers in the early hours of Saturday in the region.” The rain caused further losses to crop in the region, submerged some bridges, roads and tens of hundreds of acres of farmlands in the region. The situation further deteriorated in some parts of the region as over 81,000 cusec water had to be released on Saturday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/aurangabad-circle-receives-over-88-mm-rain-in-2-hours/articleshow/86712336.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Delhi||Delhi: 5 wildlife traffickers caught in Paharganj with floating gold||NEW DELHI: Five wildlife traffickers have been arrested and sent to 14-day judicial custody after they were caught by a joint team of Delhi forest department and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) for smuggling 2kg of Ambergris — a solid waxy substance produced in the digestive system of sperm whales. Also known as floating gold, the substance is released by whales from their mouth as regurgitation, and can be used to make perfumes. A joint operation was conducted by members of the central forest division in Delhi along with WCCB, with officials stating that inputs were received that the group was hiding at a hotel in Paharganj. “A join team conducted a raid and the five men were taken into custody from a Paharganj hotel. The substance is quite rare and is mostly used for its musky fragrance, which can be used for perfumes. It has natural properties, which means that the fragrance also lasts long,” said Aditya Madanpotra, deputy conservator of forest (central). A forest official said prima facie it appeared that the men had been handed over the substance by someone to broker a deal. “They had not procured it themselves, but had been asked to deliver it or sell it ahead. Further investigation is ongoing,” said the official, stating that the sperm whale was protected as entry 5-A in part II, schedule II of Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. “Their vehicle keys were also seized in order to look for more ‘uncured trophies’ they may be in possession of,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/5-wildlife-traffickers-caught-in-paharganj-with-floating-gold/articleshow/86717692.cms||---

---||Goa||Imagine Panaji moves to ‘smarten’ city’s public transport with e-buses||Panaji: Ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, the government has finally moved to put in place a smart public transport system for the state capital. Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Limited (IPSCDL) has outlined a grand plan to create an intelligent transport management system (ITMS) under the Smart City Mission using 41 electric buses and buggies, smart bus shelters and a command and control centre to provide live monitoring and tracking of the buses. Strangely, IPSCDL, which is the project proponent, has outsourced the contract execution to Goa Tourism Development Corporation Ltd (GTDC), which floated three different tenders for the multi-crore project. “To promote smart public transport in Goa, IPSCDL desires to introduce an ITMS that shall integrate the smart platforms at Panaji KTCL bus terminal, smart bus shelters and e-buses plied on various routes in Panaji and surrounding areas through an IT solution and provide an end-to-end solution to commuters,” said an IPSCDL official. The aim of the project is to strengthen the unreliable public transportation system in the city, particularly to reduce the use of private transport, and to move towards planned development. IPSCDL officials and city planners agree that the shift towards public transportation can happen only if state-of-the-art buses are deployed to make public transport reliable, affordable and quick. Once implemented, ITMS will give passengers and authorities real-time information about the location of the bus, passenger load, and other operational aspects. Of the 41 e-vehicles that GTDC aims to procure, 20 will be buggies, or mini e-buses, and all will operate for approximately 12-15 hours per day. IPSCDL also aims to have 36 bus shelters in the city, some of which will have ticketing counters and bus information displays. A command and control centre will ensure real-time monitoring, tracking and operation of the bus service, safety of commuters, and optimise overall operational costs. “While the proposed ITMS solution is initially planned for Panaji and surrounding areas, it can be scaled up to cover the entire state,” said an official. The firm that supplies the e-vehicles will also have to create adequate charging infrastructure in Panaji to support the e-buses.

He appeared for Prime Ministers, right from Morarji Desai, to Charan Singh, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi as a counsel, became a judge of Bombay high court, and on retirement went on to dedicate 25 years to public service. Chief Justice Dipankar Datta, Justices GS Kulkarni, Sadhana Jadhav and several others went to pay their last respects at his funeral at Goregaon crematorium. His son, Justice R D Dhanuka is a Judge at Bombay HC. The late judge was the director of Yoga Institute, Kaivalyadham, and non-executive chairperson of Bombay Stock Exchange after retirement. He was appointed HC Judge in July 1990 and made permanent in five months, before the customary two-year wait. Prior to the judgeship, he was chairman of Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa for five consecutive terms. Six of his juniors, who trained under him, went on to become Bombay HC judges. In one of his landmark rulings, he removed hurdles faced by people under an 1828 law and empowered the HC to provide heirship certificates. Another crucial judgment held that an advocate cannot also be a power of attorney holder of his client. In a case, in Goa, when it was still a Union Territory, and three women were nominated by the President to back the then Congress, he defended the nomination, which Opposition had challenged before the HC in 1985. People with legal troubles would come from afar, having heard of his legal aid. His command over civil and tax law was immense recalled his other junior and retired HC Judge J P Devdhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-justice-d-r-dhanuka-retd-passes-away/articleshow/86718660.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Pune||Monsoon exit process may start in state in mid-October||Pune: Monsoon’s exit from the state may start from the extreme north Maharashtra in mid-second week of October or thereafter, against the backdrop of its likely delayed departure from parts of northwest India around October 6. “The earliest chance of monsoon commencing exit from extreme north Maharashtra might only be after or around middle of October second week, as against the normal period of October 5,” Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD, Pune, told TOI. He said that rainfall was expected to continue in parts of Maharashtra, including Pune and Mumbai, around the time when monsoon normally exits. “We are expecting fairly widespread to widespread rain in Konkan till October 6 and fairly widespread rain in Madhya Maharashtra till that time. Also, Marathwada is likely to see fairly widespread rain till October 5, followed by scattered rain. Vidarbha will witness scattered rain till October 6. Hence, we do not see any chances of immediate withdrawal of monsoon from here,” he said. Kashyapi said weather models indicated that monsoon might withdraw from parts of west Rajasthan, Saurashtra and Kutch around the October 6-8 period, as parts of these regions were likely to have consecutive dry conditions during the October 3-6 period. One of the criteria for monsoon withdrawal is cessation of rainfall activity over an area continuously for five days. The normal date for monsoon to begin withdrawal from extreme northern parts of Maharashtra is around October 5. Normal dates for monsoon withdrawal from Mumbai and Pune are around October 8 and 9, respectively. “Light to moderate rain is expected during the next few days in Mumbai, while Pune district has a forecast of thunderstorm with lightning, gusty winds and heavy rain at isolated places in ghats areas till October 6. Hence, commencement of monsoon withdrawal from these parts may also be delayed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/monsoon-exit-process-may-start-in-state-in-mid-october/articleshow/86715776.cms||Neha Madaan

The administration has projected around 1.21 lakh active cases in the district at the peak of the third wave. The administration has submitted proposals to the government for budgetary provision of Rs178 crore, including Rs115 crore for Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). This included a provision of around Rs5 crore — Rs4.39 crore for NMC — for stockpiling of crucial Covid-19 medicines. Nagpur district administration under collector R Vimala and health officials have drawn up a blueprint of Covid preparedness. It will be reviewed weekly as per the state government guidelines issued for creation of infrastructure and supplies 1.5 times more than that were needed during the peak of second wave. The plan mostly revolves around expanding the bed availability at more government facilities, increasing oxygen supply, medicine stockpiling, adequate trained manpower under experts and other logistics support for smooth functioning. Vimala said that most of the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants would be ready by October 31. “We now have capacity of 500 metric tonne oxygen supply. By October 15, PSA oxygen plants at Kamptee and Government Medical College and Hospital would also be likely to be ready,” she said and added, “Government has released some of the funds proposed by us and more are expected in the coming days.” As per the projection, there will be 80,115 active cases in the city during the projected third wave peak and another 41,271 in the rural. The projected 35% of the active cases (42,485) are expected to be hospitalized. The administration is contemplating creating access to government facilities for around 50% hospitalized patients — around 7,222 in rural and 14,020 in NMC limits. The administration aims to create at least 850 ventilator beds (4% of total hospitalizations) and same number of non-ventilator beds. Creation of 6,798 oxygenated beds and 12,746 non-oxygenated beds also among the plans. As per the plan, 423 ventilator beds (20 existing) and another 493 oxygenated ones (120 existing) are proposed at AIIMS where 1,262 different types of beds would be set up. In addition, there is proposal to convert six buildings of three government hostels to Dedicated Covid Health Care Centres (DCHC) with oxygenated beds. Non-oxygenated beds would be set up at another four hostels. Plans are ready to increase the capacity of existing 825 beds at 12 Covid care centres (CCC) to 3,620 beds at 35 CCCs. It’s learnt, four additional DCHCs have been proposed in NMC limits, apart from the 200-bed paediatric hospital already planned at Nagpur University premises. NMC would also have walk-in oxygen centres for mild and medium cases. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of Vidarbha Hospitals Association, said that second wave showed there was not enough preparedness as against the projection. “Now, the authorities must make arrangements for oxygen, medicines and consumables and related logistics. Reduce red-tapism and audit issues so that all hospitals can focus on their work instread of completing documentation formalities,” he said. District health officer Dr Deepak Shelokar said that regular reviews and coordination meetings are underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/district-administration-projects-1-21l-active-cases-at-third-wave-peak-prepares-plans/articleshow/86715660.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Pune||Fuel prices rise for third straight day in Pune; dealers blame global crude oil rates||PUNE: Fuel prices increased for the third straight day in the city on Saturday — a litre of petrol cost Rs107.71, while diesel cost Rs96.19. Dealers blamed a global increase in the price of crude oil for the surge. The fuel price rise comes after a fairly long lull. Diesel crossed Rs95 per litre on September 26 and breached the Rs96/litre mark on Saturday. Prices of both petrol and diesel had been increasing since September 28, with some quarters blaming high transportation costs. The price of a litre of premium petrol was Rs4 higher, at Rs 111.39. According to Ali Daruwalla, spokesperson of the All India Petrol Dealers Association, the price rise in recent days was driven mainly by a spike in global crude oil prices, which touched $80 per barrel. In Mumbai, the cost of diesel is inching towards the Rs 100 per litre mark in Mumbai, with a litre costing Rs 98.16 in the state capital and its suburbs; a litre of petrol cost Rs 108.19.  Local taxes and transportation costs made a litre of diesel even more expensive in Parbhani on Saturday, at Rs 98.35. Petrol cost Rs 109.94 per litre. In recent months, Parbhani had the ignominious distinction of leading the pack in fuel prices. In Pune, petrol breached the Rs100- mark for the first time ever in February this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fuel-prices-rise-for-3rd-straight-day-dealers-blame-global-crude-oil-rates/articleshow/86713878.cms||---

The aim of gathering the data is to do the mapping of property offences in Nashik range to take preventive measures. Patil told TOI, “The process of gathering the data is underway. We are focusing on property offences like chain snatching, robberies, house break-in thefts and dacoities. Once the data is collected, we could make a proper analysis of it for preventive measures.” He said the mapping would comprise the areas of crime, the time when they were committed, the modus operandi of criminals, etc. Once the mapping is done, the police will come to know the hotspots of offences like robberies, house break-in thefts, dacoities, chain snatching, etc following which the police can take measures to prevent such offences. From the modus operandi of the offences, it would also be clear if the same gang or same people are involved in the crimes in other districts. If the same criminals are committing the offences in various parts of the district, they can be arrested and booked under stringent laws like the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) etc. Shekhar Patil said in the Nashik region, the expanse and population of Ahmednagar and Jalgaon was more and hence even the rate of crime was comparatively more there compared to the other districts. He said the work of gathering the data will be complete in a week, after which the analysis will be done for further measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/gather-data-on-property-offences-in-5-years-nashik-range-dig-tells-sps/articleshow/86712446.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The trials for the U-25 district team were conducted on October 1 after earlier trials, which TOI reported, were held on a surface of tiles despite clear guidelines of holding trial matches on turf wickets only. In the retrial camp held on Friday, parents alleged in the letter that there were not many proper arrangements at the venue in Kotdwar and only 10 cricket clubs were registered with the district association which led to many aspirants losing out. Also, the retrial was supposed to be held on September 30, but due to "improper arrangement", it was postponed to the next day. CAU secretary Mahim Verma, who is in Pauri to overlook the arrangement in the district, has taken note of the complaints.

At a protest on Saturday at the Mahatma Gandhi circle in Old Goa, citizens criticised the unplanned development at the world heritage site. Local activist Glen Cabral said that despite repeated demands for a master plan for Old Goa, projects were being allowed, threatening the ancient city’s heritage. He said that plans that were afoot under the Sagar Mala project for riverfront development and helicopter tourism would be risky for the monuments. Another social activist, Rama Kankonkar, said that it is high time the government understands and implements Gandhi’s ideals, and that the people would continue opposing unplanned development. Architect Tahir Noronha said that the government had notified the process to start planning for the 200m area on either side of a stretch of the national highway at Kadamba plateau. He called for holistic planning for the entire area of Old Goa instead of piecemeal planning. Cabral pointed out that bringing the highway area under the OPD would affect a heritage fort wall, the Bainguinim spring and other unexplored sites. Pointing out that Old Goa was the land of Gomateshwara and the resting place of the sacred relics of St Francis Xavier, Aruna Wagh, a social activist, said that elected representatives who garland Gandhi’s statue have their hands tainted as they have disrespected him by their actions. The citizens, who had called on deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar on Friday, told reporters that he promised he would review the PDA plan for Old Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/scrap-odp-for-old-goa-demand-locals-heritage-lovers/articleshow/86717787.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Farmers gherao residences of top politicians, DC offices in Punjab and Haryana||Bathinda/Patiala/Ambala: Hours before the Centre reviewed its order on paddy procurement in Punjab and Haryana, scores of farmers from both the states gheraoed several DC offices and residences of MLAs and ministers on Saturday morning in a bid to pressurise the two state governments to start the process at the earliest. The Centre on Thursday had deferred procurement of kharif paddy in Punjab and Haryana, which usually begins on October 1, to October 11 as the crop maturity is delayed and moisture content in fresh arrival is beyond permissible limits owing to recent heavy rains. In Haryana, violent clashes were reported in Panchkula and Karnal. Enraged farmers surrounded Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s at Prem Nagar in Karnal and even pitched a tent outside. Hundreds of farmers and labourers from various parts of Karnal district had gathered at the new grain market in Karnal. After holding a meeting there, led by BKU (Charuni) district president Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, they started their march in paddy-laden tractor-trailers and other vehicles towards the Haryana CM’s residence. The police, however, tried to stop them by barricading and using mild water cannons on the crowd, but farmers broke the barricades even as a heavy police force including paramilitary was also deployed at the CM residence to deal with any law and order situation. Elsewhere in Haryana, residences of several BJP and JJP leaders were gheraod. There was a serious law and order situation in Sirsa, as farmers broke barricades outside MP Sunita Duggal’s residence and staged a dharna. However, the situation was brought under control after senior police officials reached the spot. Later, the farmers organised a langar outside the MP’s residence. In neighbouring Hisar, the farmers submitted a memorandum to MLA Kamal Gupta, while in Fatehabad, MLA Dura Ram’s house was gheraod. In Ambala, the farmers started a march from the new grain market and proceeded with paddy-laden tractor-trolleys towards the residence of BJP’s Ambala MLA Aseem Goel. According to sources, several police barricades were broken near the MLAs residence, but later the farmers sat on a peaceful protest outside the house. In Kurukshetra’s Shahabad-Markanda town, farmers assembled near the residences of Haryana sports and youth affairs minister Sandeep Singh and JJP’s Shahabad MLA Ram Karan Kala and staged protests. In Yamunanagar’s Jagadhri city, they staged a protest near the house of Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal. Heavy police forces were deputed by the concerned district administrations at all protest sites to protect the residences of the ruling party leaders in Haryana. In Punjab’s Patiala and Bathinda, farmers handed over memorandums to the respective deputy commissioners, and demanded paddy procurement from Monday. The protesting farmers also warned that if the deadline is missed, they will sit on an indefinite strike in front of DC offices across the state. In Patiala, a group of farmers also staged protests near the houses of MLAs Brahm Mohindra and Rajinder Singh. Interestingly, both Punjab and Haryana chief ministers claimed credit for the Centre’s decision to start procurement from Sunday. Khattar, who along with deputy CM Dushyant Chautala and agriculture minister Jai Parkash Dalal, met Union minister of state for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Ashwini Kumar Choubey in New Delhi on Saturday said the Centre had agreed to his delegation’s request of starting procurement from October 3 as most of the grain had already reached the mandis. “I am happy that he accepted our request,” he said. Similarly, the statement from the office of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who had raised the issue of kharif procurement during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, said the Centre had ‘acceded’ to the CM’s request. “Expressing gratitude to PM Modi for his immediate personal intervention in this regard,” Channi said this decision would be instrumental in ensuring smooth and hassle-free procurement of paddy to the satisfaction of the farmers. BKU Charuni national president Gurnam Singh Charuni termed the protest as a victory of farmers, saying, “Once again, a big victory for the farmers, assurance given to start paddy procurement from tomorrow (October 3) after gherao of MLAs and MPs in Haryana and Punjab. Thanks to farmer associates and if the government does not start procurement by tomorrow, then roads will be blocked on Monday.” Pointers for graphic: Procurement ready * Punjab set up 1,806 purchase centres for kharif marketing season 2021-22 * Nearly 800 rice mills and other public places to act as temporary paddy purchase centres * 4 state procurement agencies — Pungrain, Markfed, Punsup and PSWC — along with FCI, assigned to procure paddy on MSP * Strict Covid-19 rules to be enforced at all temporary purchase centres * Field officers to analyse data on paddy arrival, maintain close vigil on mandis and rice mills * Special E-Physical verification of rice mills before the procurement season to ensure that there is no unaccounted paddy in mills||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/revisedfarmers-gherao-dc-offices-residences-top-leaders-across-haryana-punjab/articleshow/86717778.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Cops crack double murder case of 55-year-old, her house help||DEHRADUN: Police on Saturday claimed to have cracked the double murder of a 55-year-old woman and her house help. The woman, Unnati Sharma, lived with her husband Subhash Sharma and domestic help Raj Kumar Thapa near Prem Nagar. After investigation, police concluded that it was the handiwork of Aditya, 20, a local villager, who wanted to work at Unnati’s house. Earlier, too, he had worked there and was paid Rs 500 per day. Hoping to get work, Aditya approached Unnati but she said they already had a house help. Unable to find work elsewhere, Aditya decided to eliminate Raj Kumar. On September 29 around 4 am, Aditya entered the house through the forest area and hit Raj Kumar with an iron rod. Unnati, who was present at the time of the incident, tried to escape and alerted her husband, but Aditya followed her to the kitchen and killed her too. In the absence of any CCTV cameras around the house, police teams struggled to collect any evidence. But they did scan CCTV cameras in nearby areas, which helped them trace the accused. Police said the accused wanted to join the Indian Army but couldn’t as the medical board had declared him unfit. A day after the incident, he called an ambulance and got himself admitted to Doon Hospital. “The accused has confessed to the crime. We have recovered the murder weapon,” said Dehradun senior superintendent of police Janmejay Prabhakar Khanduri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cops-crack-double-murder-case-of-55-yr-old-her-house-help/articleshow/86713894.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The construction work for the two buildings has already begun and is likely to be completed by April-end, said senior police officers. Nashik Rural SP Sachin Patil said there are many police station buildings that are not in good shape, but have adequate space around them. Against this backdrop, the work of constructing the new buildings for the Sinnar police station, MIDC police station and Saikheda police stations has been taken up. Recently, the taluka police station was also renovated. Once, good infrastructure is made available for the police personnel, it will also increase their efficiency, he added. Currently, the MIDC police station in the Sinnar MIDC area is operating from a rented venue. The location of the police station, which is in Musalgaon, causes inconvenience to many people. Efforts are being made to ensure that the MIDC police station starts functioning from its own location in the Sinnar city.A new building for the Sinnar police station will also come up at the same location. Meanwhile, to ensure that police presence continues in the MIDC area of Sinnar even when the police station is relocated, the police would be setting up police chowkies in the Musalgaon and Malegaon industrial areas, said Sachin Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2-police-stations-getting-new-buildings/articleshow/86712493.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Chandigarh||Hours before procurement nod, Pargat says BJP, Capt behind delay||Jalandhar: Punjab sports and education minister Pargat Singh on Saturday alleged that the decision to delay procurement of paddy was the result of a conspiracy between BJP and former chief minister Amarinder Singh, who is expected to launch a new party with the BJP’s backing. He said the Shiromani Akali Dal was also a part of the same conspiracy. “The decision to delay procurement was taken a day after Amarinder called on Amit Shah. It is a clear bid to harass farmers of Punjab and, by implication, create trouble for Punjab government,” he said after a group of farm union members started a protest demanding beginning of procurement when he was at Circuit House and they also closed its gates. “There is also the possibility of a drama in which Amarinder takes up the issue and central government then starting procurement, so he can claim credit while launching his party,” Pargat said, hours before Centre decided to start procurement from Sunday. “The cat is out of the bag now. Amarinder has proven he was actually working as a BJP CM while sitting in Congress. We have already been saying that he was colluding with the Union government and his recent actions have proved it,” Pargat said. “Earlier also, BJP, Badals and Amarinder were colluding; the same pack is now working to harass farmers of Punjab for vested political interests,” he said. It is learnt farm activits initially came to submit a memorandum to Pargat. However, after he met them and told them that Punjab government had already taken up the issue with Union government, the group sat there and also closed the gates of the Circuit House, blocking Pargat’s way. They opened the gates around 3pm, while those siting outside his house continued their sit-in till evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hours-before-procurement-nod-pargat-says-bjp-capt-behind-delay/articleshow/86717851.cms||IP Singh
---||Goa||Wind from Sumatra impacts Indian monsoon: Expert||Panaji: The southwest monsoon may be thought of as a local system of the Indian subcontinent. In reality, distant weather elements can also impact its dynamics. In a paper, a former NIO scientist has shown how events occurring even near the Sumatra coast affect monsoon rain. Meteorologist M R Ramesh Kumar has discussed in his research the evolution dynamics of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) – a phase triggered by an alongshore wind parallel to the faraway Sumatra coast in Indonesia. The IOD pertains to the fluctuation of warm sea surface temperature (SST) between two areas or poles, hence the term dipole. SST is usually cooler in the western pole (Arabian Sea which comprises the western equatorial Indian Ocean) or warmer in the eastern pole (Sumatra or in the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean). This difference in temperatures cannot be observed in other oceans. But during some years, the Arabian Sea region is warmer and the Sumatra region is cooler. This reversal is termed as IOD, which on the positive side, brings more rainfall in parts of India. The IOD has been recognised for about 20 years, making it much less studied than many other climate patterns. For the Australian region, positive IOD created drought conditions over eastern Australia in 2006, 2007 and 2008 and triggered bush fires in 2019 and 2020. For his study, the meteorologist observed the rare sequence – otherwise, IOD occurs after three to four years - of consecutive extreme IOD events of 1994 and 1996 while 1995 was a neutral year with normal temperatures. In 1997, it was the positive IOD which blunted the impact of this century’s strongest El Nino(triggered by cooler sea surface temperature in the eastern Pacific Ocean, near Peru coast) and ensured a less deficient monsoon that year. El Nino causes an upheaval that sucks moisture from the Indian Ocean. When cooler temperatures persist near the Peru coast, it gives rise to La Nina that yields more rainfall in India. A negative IOD this year hampered monsoon activity, especially during August. The low-level jet – another unique wind formation that blows from Somalia in Africa — is the other system that positively boosts rainfall in India. “So, in this case, the wind near Sumatra coast is responsible for upwelling in the EEIO that causes IOD,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wind-from-sumatra-impacts-indian-monsoon-expert/articleshow/86717850.cms||Paul Fernandes

On April 10, TOI had reported the exchange proposal wherein in lieu of tigers and bears, the NZP will give 8 sambars, 10 albino blackbucks, 10 blackbucks, 20 barking deer and even brow-antlered (sangai) deer, painted stork and jackals. Pramod Panchbhai, divisional manager, Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM), said, “The technical committee of the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) on September 16, 2021, had cleared the exchange proposal.” On Friday, NZP veterinary officer Dr Abhijeet Bhaval was in the city to receive the animals. The two tigresses, around three years, were engaged in human-animal conflict and were captured from Bramhapuri in Chandrapur district. The animals were shifted in two vehicles along with veterinarians Dr Mayur Pawshe and Dr Syed Bilal. The Gorewada Rescue Centre had 13 tigers in captivity. Now it will have 11 tigers, including two males and 9 females. “We still have excess tigers and can share two young tigresses with other zoos. The vehicle that is carrying the tigers and sloth bears will reach Delhi on Monday morning. On Tuesday it will return with blackbucks and sambars. In the second phase, Gorewada would bring more animals from NZP,” said Panchbhai. Panchbhai said the NZP had written on March 13, 2021, to zoos in Nainital, Van Vihar at Bhopal and Gorewada demanding tigers and sloth bears. NZP is a participating zoo for the conservation breeding of five species – tigers, lions, one-horned rhinos, sangai deer and red jungle fowl. It has successfully bred a number of endangered animals and birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/two-gorewada-tigresses-a-pair-of-sloth-bears-sent-to-delhi-zoo/articleshow/86715367.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The state government has allowed physical classes to begin for students of Classes VIII to XII in the urban areas. According to school representatives, while teachers conduct the classes physically, arrangements have also been made to ensure that students, who are not physically present, can attend them online. “Ours is a Wi-Fi campus and we are conducting physical as well as online classes for our students so that they can opt for the mode of their choice with equal attention paid to everybody,” said Pushpy Dutt, principal of Delhi Public School (DPS), Nashik. The schools also ensure a safe environment for students with vaccinated staff, Covid-appropriate behavior and norms being implemented in detail. “We will start school from October 11. We are ready with the standard operating procedure (SOP) laid down by the state government, but we don’t want parents and students – apprehensive about the situation – to be mentally burdened,” said Nilufer Chavan, principal director of Cambridge Curriculum of Wisdom High International School. The staff at most schools is completely vaccinated and the parents’ consent would be mandatory for every child entering the school premises. Educational institutions have also assured students attending lessons from home about providing all necessary help. “If the child is unwell or unwilling to attend school, parents should not force them. Let them take their time. All help will be provided online,” Ratan Luth, chairman of Fravashi Academy and Fravashi International Academy, said. As far as examinations are concerned, some schools, like DPS, have conducted proctored examinations and are providing safe examinations at school. There are other schools as well that have called the students on campus on alternate days. “We have called the students on alternate days, ensuring maximum attendance to 20 – one on each bench. The lessons taught to one set of students would be repeated by the faculty for the next set of students on the next day,” said Sanjay Katale, principal of St Xavier’s School, Nashik Road. At such schools, four to five 30-minute lectures will be conducted from 9 am till 1 pm. The children will be able to have food but under teachers’ observation. Children will be allowed to go to washroom in a staggered manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/simultaneous-online-offline-classes-in-some-nashik-schools/articleshow/86712500.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Medical College pilot testing AI tech to screen lung conditions||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Medical College is pilot testing an artificial intelligence platform to assess various lung conditions, including Covid-19. According to the officials of AMC, Salcit Technologies has developed the patented ‘Swaasa’ AI platform, which brings in the functionality of spirometry without the constraints of time, space, specialised equipment or trained professionals. The platform analyses cough signals along with a subset of symptoms and provides an assessment. Speaking to ToI, Andhra Medical College principal Dr PV Sudhakar said the technology works based on audiometric analysis of cough sounds and other symptoms. “Based on the analysis, it will provide a health assessment by using the proprietary algorithms. This is also being tested for Covid-19 disease. The existing methods of diagnosis like X-Ray, CT scan and other pulmonary tests (routine sputum culture and spirometry) require laboratory setup. These are expensive and time consuming. Moreover, they are not available in all rural and tribal areas. Modern technology should be made use of to diagnose these conditions based on the pattern of ‘cough’, which is the common symptom for all respiratory diseases,” said Dr Sudhakar. Professor and head of the department of community medicine, Dr Devi Madhavi, said earlier a private hospital conducted the pilot study on the technology. “Now, the artificial intelligence platform is being tested in the primary health care setting at RHTC Simhachalam. The technology will be tested on nearly 2,000 patients. The study is completely non-invasive and involves only recording of cough from the patients. The device facilitates screening and identifies whether the problem is attributable to airways or lung parenchyma/pleura. This will be highly useful in identifying the appropriate next intervention, including referrals. This is also highly cost effective” said Dr Devi Madhavi. The duration of the study is six months. Dr Devi Madhavi and Dr L. Siva Kumar, assistant professor, are the Investigators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/amc-pilot-testing-ai-tech-to-screen-lung-conditions/articleshow/86713933.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Khaunte pointed out that the panch members of Socorro panchayat have expressed their apprehensions that the meeting called to discuss no-confidence motion against the sarpanch may be sabotaged with the help of the chief minister. “Few members from the Socorro panchayat body had shifted over to BJP. For the last three years, the panchayat had lost out on development. What Vazarkar and his group did over the last three years, using umbrella of chief minister and the BJP government, is well known. Forgery of sale deeds and land scams were regular affairs,” Khaunte alleged. He recalled an earlier instance when BJP government “interfered and intervened” in Siridao-Pale panchayat, following which the panchayat members had to approach the high court seeking directions to the government. Khaunte pointed out that when Salvador-do-Mundo panchayat, backed by BJP, had members moving no-confidence motion, the entire process was over in 8 to 10 days and even new sarpanch was inducted. “But when Socorro panchayat has given no-confidence against BJP-backed person, the gap between the motion and the meeting to discuss it is 13 days,” the Porvorim MLA said. Khaunte said that apprehending the possibility of “mischief” being played on October 5, when the motion will be taken up for discussion, he has asked the chief minister not to interfere in the matter. “There is government’s interference everywhere, including that of chief minister. Democracy is in peril,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-meddle-in-socorro-sarpanch-no-trust-move/articleshow/86717906.cms||---

He reviewed the progress of various water diversion schemes being implemented in Nashik region that aim to bring water flowing into the Arabian sea across the ridge towards Godavari valley through a series of dams, channels and tunnels. The Devasane Manjarpada gravity water diversion scheme in Dindori taluka has been completed, which has enabled diversion of 606 million cubic feet (mcft) water to Godavari valley. Out of this, about 500 mcft of water has already been diverted till date. He has also directed that developmental activities be developed at Nandur Madhmeshar, which is a Ramsar site, to attract tourists. It should be done on built operate and transfer (BOT) basis, he suggested. When about demand to shift offices to Aurangabad, he said the offices were required when the activities of water management and developmental works were being carried out and hence the question does not arise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/finish-dpr-on-river-linking-projects-by-year-end-patil/articleshow/86712540.cms||Abhilash Botekar

As part of Gandhi Jayanti celebrations, activist Ane Gracias and locals organised a programme at the historic site of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Chapel at Chimbel in the Provedoria compound. Children and others held a peaceful procession with placards. The procession culminated in hugging trees marked for felling. Recently, the locals had held another protest outside the gate. On Saturday, history lecturer and researcher Prajal Sakhardande traced the history of the site as it was once a hub of religious, social and other activities. Sakhardande said that Goan priests, Tertiary Carmelites had set up the first indigenous order at the spot and the site should be conserved and preserved. Gracias said that only three patches of the hill in Chimbel are untouched. Former Santa Cruz legislator Victor Gonsalves and Rudolf Fernandes also spok. Recently, a delegation of Chimbel villagers urged chief minister Pramod Sawant to protect the trees at Provedoria’s old age home as priests of the Order of Discalced Carmelites also staked claim to the property at the site||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/children-hug-trees-marked-for-felling-at-chimbel-historic-site/articleshow/86717859.cms||---

---||Amritsar||We will go on till 2024 if we have to: Rakesh Tikait||BATHINDA: When on the evening of February 6, Uttar Pradesh-based farmer leader Rakesh Tikait had said farmers are ready to continue their protest till October 2, everybody had made fun of him feeling his claims to be hypothetical, away from reality, but now as the protests had breached that highly unlikely target and ready for much more beyond that, the determination of farmers of going to any length for repeal of farm laws, has again come to fore. After the call for chakka jam (road disruption) on February 6, Tikait had said we give time to the government till October 2 to repeal laws and we are ready to hold protest till then. Tikait might have made the claim spontaneously, eight months ago, without much thought, but as it has come true, now even the government seems to be taking the claims of protesting farmers seriously, feel the leaders of the Santyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the banner under whose patronage the farmer agitation is being spearheaded. “Yes, I remember of making the claims nearly eight months ago that the protests will go on till October 2. Going by the egoistic attitude of the central government, I had assessed that this government is not ready to listen to farmers and struggle will go for longer. Even though the situation is the same, we are getting some feelers from the government trying to mellow down its approach. We are, however, ready to go longer, even till 2024, if the government will not listen to the anndatas of the country,” Tikait said while speaking to TOI over phone. “Now, the farmers have decided to concentrate more energies on Uttar Pradesh and hope this may make the central government to listen to us,” said Tikait adding that they are ready for the talks if the government wanted to resume the dialogue process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/we-will-go-on-till-2024-if-we-have-to-tikait/articleshow/86717897.cms||Neel Kamal

Rajendra Trimbake of the civic body’s health department said that, as on September 30, 12 patients tested positive for dengue. Trimbake said dengue cases were declining and their aim was to ensure the numbers do not rise again. Towards this aim, the civic body is taking various steps. Trimbake said that they have served notices to various government departments to ensure that there was no water accumulation in the basements of the buildings and if the water was accumulated it should be immediately cleared mosquitoes responsible for dengue and chikungunya are bred in this clean water. This year, the civic body has also collected 1,243 non-usable tyres from various parts of the city as water accumulation in these tyres could also lead to the spread of mosquitoes. Sanitary workers deployed by the NMC have regularly done fogging in various parts of the city. Further, officials of the health department are also on the look out to check if people are following all the rules and ensuring that there is no water accumulation in their respective areas. This year, the NMC collected a fine amounting to Rs 76,900 from 177 cases registered against people for not keeping their premises clean and not working on clearing water accumulation in their areas.

Imports of silver stood at a six-and-a-half-year high in September 2021. Some 126 metric tonnes (MT) of silver was imported in September, according to data from the Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex . The last time silver imports were this high was in December 2014, when they stood at 166.96 MT, suggest AACC data. Jewellers attribute the surge to fall in prices and upbeat festive season sentiment. “Demand has remained good over the past two months. This is not just for bars, coins and articles made of silver but even jewellery. New age buyers are increasingly preferring silver jewellery that is light on the pocket and trendy and demand has remained good,” said Jigar Soni, president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA). Silver prices have fallen by 9.2% in a month from Rs 65,000 per kg on August 31 to Rs 59,500 per kg on September 30. According to analysts, the fall in prices was a factor propelling demand for silver not just for jewellery and artefacts but also industrial consumption. “In the run up to the festive season, jewellers and bullion traders expect good sales of silver coins and artefacts in addition to jewellery. Therefore, they have stocked up well in advance, taking advantage of the prices,” said Haresh Acharya, director, IBJA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/silver-imports-at-6-year-high-in-sept/articleshow/86714072.cms||Niyati Parikh

Sawant was interacting with swayampurna mitras appointed in each village, after launching the online swayampurna portal. More than 10,000 individuals have benefited so far from the swayampurna mitras’ assistance, the chief minister said. “On the coming Saturday or Sunday, swayampurna gram sabhas will be held in all panchayats on a single day. Similarly, we will also hold a special gram sabha in villages where there are pending cases related to tribal rights and forest rights. We will have one gram sabha to clear the pending cases in one meet,” said Sawant.

Attempts to find the two other missing persons – a Navy mountaineer and the Sherpa guide – will resume early on Sunday, personnel involved in the search told TOI. The avalanche had hit around 5:30 am on Friday and the rescue operations, launched jointly by NIM, State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), Indian Air Force (IAF) and Indian Army, started soon afterwards. The search had to be called off late afternoon due to bad weather and resumed around 7 am on Saturday. Earlier, members of the Indian Army’s Garhwal Scouts and a team from HAWS had managed to reach Camp-1, the base camp for the climb. The IAF had also air-dropped some of its personnel near the site. After four bodies were spotted near Trishul peak during an aerial survey, the search teams reached the avalanche-hit area despite bad weather. “All-out efforts are being made to locate the fifth naval climber and one Sherpa. Remaining mountaineers of the Navy and support staff have safely reached Homkund base and Camp – 1,” said Colonel Amit Bisht, principal of NIM, who is leading a rescue team. As part of the naval expedition, an advanced team, with jawans and support staff, had moved towards Trishul on September 19 and a second team followed on September 23. On Friday morning, a lead team of 10 Navy personnel and some guides started the final ascent while another team stayed at the summit camp, waiting its turn. Around 5:30 am, when the lead team was around 400-500m from the peak, it was caught in an avalanche. Mount Trishul gets its name from the trident-like appearance of its three peaks. The team was climbing Trishul-I, which is 7,120m high. The expedition was being conducted as part of Swarnim Vijay Varsh celebrations, which mark 50 years of the Bangladesh Liberation War. Being one of the most difficult climbs in the world, Trishul-I has seen many accidents. In October 2019, 37-year-old Hungarian mountaineer Peter Wittek went missing from the summit camp, which, at a distance of 1,000m, is closest to the peak. He was part of a six-member Singaporean-Vietnamese-Hungarian-Mauritian expedition team. In September 2017, three mountaineers, part of an IAF expedition, fell sick while climbing the peak and had to be airlifted. One of them died on the way to the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/remains-of-4-navy-mountaineers-retrieved-from-avalanche-hit-trishul-another-mountaineer-sherpa-still-missing/articleshow/86714005.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala

Speaking at a function in Ahmednagar on Saturday, Gadkari said the secretary of his department had even issued an order that they would not take up any new road project in Maharashtra unless the state government lowers the cost of land acquisition. He said land acquisition costs Rs 18 crore per acre in Maharashtra. Gadkari said that lowering the cost of land acquisition did not mean that the farmers would be at a financial loss. “I will ensure that they (farmers) get a more attractive price and are not at loss for parting with their land. But my ministry is not in a position to buy land at a high cost as apart from making roads, other infrastructure such as roadside amenities, bus stands etc have to be set up by us,” he said. He and NCP chief Sharad Pawar were in Ahmednagar on Saturday to dedicate and lay the foundation stone of 526 km of national highway projects in the district. The total project cost of all these projects is Rs 4,074 crore. The ministry will be implementing the Surat-Chennai greenfield expressway project at a cost of Rs 50,000 crore, which will pass through Nashik, Ahmednagar and Solarpur. “This project will be connected up to Kochi and Hyderabad. Once this project is ready, it would ease the traffic from North India in districts like Kolhapur. It covers 180km in Ahmednagar district and the ministry will spend Rs 8,000 crore in this district,” he added. Gadkari stressed the need for sugar factories in Ahmednagar to give greater focus on ethanol production. In his speech, Pawar appreciated the work done by Gadkari in making quality roads across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/land-acquisition-cost-high-in-maha-gadkari/articleshow/86712565.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Nagpur||‘Competitive performance suffered due to lockdown’||As many things are set to reopen in Maharashtra by the end of this month, coaching institutes express shock that they have not yet figured in the government’s discussions about reopening. Rajnikant Bondre, president of Maharashtra-based Association of Coaching Institutes (ACI), says this prolonged closure has resulted in poor performance by the state’s students in competitive exams like JEE and NEET (results awaited). In an interview with TOI, Bondre talks about the repercussions of the government’s inaction. Excerpts... Q. The government is now pushing ahead with reopening plans. From schools to religious places and soon movie theatres will be reopened. Are you surprised that so far coaching institutes do not figure in the list? A. It’s absolutely shocking that we are not even being considered in this plan. As I understand it, students studying in Std X-XII can attend schools/junior colleges, they can visit restaurants, shops, resorts, travel across the country and soon visit religious places and movie halls but they cannot attend coaching institutes. The problem is that the coaching industry has not been categorized properly, so nobody knows who is responsible for our sector. Q. Many have the misconception that you are under the education department’s purview. A. Not at all. We are a completely different entity and we have evolved parallelly to the existing education system. But schools and colleges can only be run by registered trusts, and that’s not the case with us. We pay 18% GST, professional tax, are charged commercial rates for utilities and are not entitled to any sops. It’s high time the government took cognizance and defined the category under which we come. Q. You are claiming that Maharashtra students’ performance has been adversely affected due to prolonged closure. A. That is a fact. The two major competitive exams, JEE and NEET, need intense preparation for at least two years. But the final months before the exam is when students need that physical interaction with teachers. Mostly we call it ‘doubt clearing sessions’ and this is similar to polishing off a product to take it to its zenith. That academic finesse is reached in these physical one-to-one interaction with teachers, and that could not happen here. We were allowed to reopen in bits and pieces but there were restrictions on the number of students and such permissions did not last long. Q. Even schools were functioning online, so how can coaching institutes justify the demand for physical classroom teaching? A. Online classes are a failure when compared to physical mode. It does not even come close. To put my point forward, let’s take the example of the USA. It’s a country which is 25 years ahead of us technology wise and this online teaching has been going on there for a long time. So why do physical schools and colleges still exit there? Let’s move to this pandemic period. If online system was so good then US schools and colleges would have resolved to permanently remain in online mode since they got a long time to experience how it works. So it’s not about the net connectivity quality or lack of devices, the bottom line is that children learn best in physical mode. That online versus offline debate is dead. Q. If you reopen, isn’t there a chance of students getting exposed to the virus as they start mingling with each other? A. There are three different parts to my answer. First is that a fair number of these students have attained the age of 18 (since they are in Std XII) and have taken at least one dose of the vaccine. The second part is that controlling the environment in a coaching institute is very easy because we have limited and disciplined students. These are meritorious students who are well aware of the exam’s importance and hence will always follow safety guidelines. Third is that we spend extensively on sanitization and generally go over and beyond what the government has ordered. So keeping all these things in mind, I would say coaching classes are one of the safest places for students to visit. Q. How will you draw the government’s attention now? A. We are working closely with other associations based in Pune and other parts of Maharashtra to have a more coordinated strategy. We will be approaching the government to grant us a hearing and listen to our problems. Also we hope that the media highlights these things so that awareness is created on how one of the safest places, the coaching institutes, are still waiting for reopening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/competitive-performance-suffered-due-to-lockdown/articleshow/86715991.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

A source privy to the discussions said Gadkari, also chairman of the Centre’s infrastructure committee, was requested to hold a meeting on this issue in Delhi. “Stakeholders, including the defence ministry, Airports Authority of India, and Pawar and Bapat are expected to be present. The minister was requested to take up this issue on priority,” said the source. The source said the meeting could be held next week and that Gadkari was keen on resolving the issue at the earliest. During a visit to Pune last month, Gadkari had said the infrastructure committee will soon approve the handover of 13 acres of defence land for the airport’s expansion.  Bapat emphasized that the issue of shifting the airport’s cargo area to a 2.5-acre plot belonging to the Indian Air Force needs to be immediately addressed. “We hope a solution will soon come to the fore,” Bapat told TOI. In 2016, defence authorities provided the airport with 15.84 acres of land. The land is being used for the construction of the new terminal, which is likely to be ready by August next year. The issue of the pre-paid autorickshaw stand at the airport, which was removed from the premises in August this year, is also expected to be resolved by next week, Bapat said, adding that talks are being held with AAI authorities.

This will be done at the Alandi Road office. Work for setting up infrastructure to allow movement of small commercial vehicles is going on,” Pune’s deputy RTO Sanjay Sasane said. For the brake test of vehicles, the traditional method followed involves making the vehicles run at different speeds on a 250-metre track, with inspectors telling the driver to apply the brakes at specific points. The inspectors then check whether the brakes are working. “This machine is more scientific and will involve static vehicles rolling on rollers. The check will be better with little human interference,” the official said. Of the Rs50lakh sanctioned for the project, Rs26lakh has been kept for developing infrastructure, while the rest is for the purchase of the machine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/roller-brake-testing-machine-to-be-installed-at-alandi-road-rto-office/articleshow/86715975.cms||Joy Sengupta

Those selected will benefit from United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) ‘roof for all’, a poverty alleviation programme. Punjab government had asked the district units of the rural development and panchayat department to convene special sessions of gram sabha from October 2 to take up the campaign. The state government plans to provide five marla plots to roofless from the common village lands in villages. The district rural development officials started the identification process on Gandhi Jayanti on Saturday which will continue for a week. A few days ago, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had promised to provide plots to those who have no source of living. Labourer organisations Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union, Mazdoor Mukti Morcha and some others had been raising the demand and had taken up the matter with the state government. On Thursday, rural development and rural department director Manpreet Singh Chhatwal wrote to district officials to reach out to village panchayats to call sessions and identify beneficiaries without fail. The sources told that the state government want to complete process before next assembly elections. Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union general secretary Lachman Sewewala said, “We are taking up the matter with panchayats and officials to get the identification of beneficiaries in a timely manner so that every deserving persons get the plot and no one is left out. We will approach the state government to extend the date to complete the process if it is not completed in a week as nearly 13,000 village panchayats have to identify the beneficiaries and pass the resolutions.” Barnala ADC (development) Naval Kishor, who was appointed as nodal officer for 11 districts for various demands of labourers, said, “The process of convening sessions of gram sabhas will start from Saturday and we are hopeful to complete it in timely manner to provide plots to the roofless.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/plots-to-roofless-under-un-programme-panchayats-to-identify-beneficiaries-in-a-week/articleshow/86718001.cms||Neel Kamal

As part of his interaction with gram panchayats across the country, Modi spoke to the gram pradhan and chairman of Bhatta-Kyar Kuli village water and sanitation committee, Kaushalya Rawat. He expressed happiness over the pace of work, saying he was glad to learn that all households in the gram panchayat were getting tap water, as part of the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) initiative. When he asked the gram pradhan about the availability of water in the village before the launch of the JJM, he was told that earlier, women and children had to go through a harrowing time fetching water, which was not the case now. On whether the improved water supply had proved profitable for those running homestays, the gram pradhan said that the tourist footfall had gone up, heralding a change for good in the village. PM advised her to keep a record of visitors’ antecedents and also seek their feedback on the stay. “This record will be useful in the future,” he said. Informing about the status of vaccination in the village, Kaushalya Rawat said that the entire adult population had been fully vaccinated. Reacting to this, the PM said that government schemes were successful only due to people’s participation, whether it was Covid vaccination or the JJM. He highlighted the importance of drinking water, saying it was due to improved water supply that homestays had been developed in the village, tourism footfall had increased with out-migration arrested. “A basic amenity like water not only changes lives but also has the power to change the economy of the country,” the PM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/basic-amenity-like-water-changes-lives-has-power-to-change-economy-pm-tells-villagers-near-mussoorie/articleshow/86714053.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Pune||Criticism over linking Aadhaar with voter ID||Pune: Over 23 organisations and 500 individuals have flayed the move to link Aadhaar with voter ID and have written to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to withdraw the proposal. A month ago, the ECI had said that the move would help weed out duplicate or even non-existent voters. The government had approached the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) with the proposal to permit the ECI to use Aadhaar for registration of new voters. While sources at the ECI have confirmed that the proposal was still under consideration, those critical of the move said that it would create mass disenfranchisement, increase voter fraud and want the proposal to be withdrawn. One of the signatories, Srinivas K, told TOI that using Aadhaar for “cleaning up” databases of other government registries, like MGNREGA and PDS, have led to arbitrary deletion of names of citizens from the system without any notice. In the letter, a copy of which is with the TOI, they have stated that the move could fundamentally alter the structure of democracy, undermine electoral democracy and impact voters’ trust in the electoral system. The letter further noted that the Election Commission’s proposal would violate the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Puttaswamy case, which limited the use of Aadhaar authentication solely to welfare programmes. The letter further elaborated that in 2018, election officials from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh linked Aadhaar data with voter ID cards after which people found that at least 55 lakh voters had been arbitrarily disenfranchised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/criticism-over-linking-aadhaar-with-voter-id/articleshow/86715965.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Seven districts in the state recorded excess rainfall while six registered normal rainfall. State recorded a total of 613.3 mm rainfall between June 1 and September 30, 2021, which is around 19 per cent more than the normal 514 mm. In 2020, Andhra Pradesh recorded a total 738.2 mm rainfall between June 1 and September 30, which was around 44 per cent more than the normal. Director of IMD-Amaravati, S Stella said the conditions are very likely to be favourable for commencement of withdrawal of southwest monsoon from some parts of northwest India from around October 6. Similarly, the southwest monsoon will commence withdrawal from Andhra Pradesh from mid-October. Seven districts- Kadapa and Chittoor of Rayalaseema region and Guntur, Krishna, East Godavari, Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts of coastal Andhra Pradesh recorded excess rainfall during the southwest monsoon this year. Six districts - Anantapur, Kurnool, Nellore, Prakasam, West Godavari and Srikakulam districts recorded normal rainfall, she added. Among the total 13 districts in the state, Chittoor recorded 49 per cent excess rainfall followed by Visakhapatnam (37%), Vizianagaram (36%), Guntur (33%) and Kadapa (32%). As of now, only three districts have registered deficient rainfall with Kurnool logging 11 per cent deficiency followed by Prakasam (8%) and Nellore (5%). The farmers say lack of rain in some weeks in some parts of state and the excess rain in some weeks during the SW monsoon season should be looked into to understand the quality of monsoon season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-receives-19-more-rains-as-monsoon-readies-for-retreat/articleshow/86714035.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Dehradun||Dehradun residents recreate non-cooperation movement against tree felling||DEHRADUN: Taking a cue from Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, Dehradun residents, including children and van gujjars (tribals who rear cattle and survive on forest produce), gathered at Asharori on Saturday on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti to protest the proposed felling of 11,000 trees for construction of the Delhi-Dehradun expressway. The trees, including century-old British-era Sal trees, are to be axed for the development of a four-lane elevated road from Ganeshpur (Uttar Pradesh) to Asharori (Uttarakhand), a 19.5 kilometre stretch. The matter is sub-judice in court now, but conservationists alleged that UP authorities have already started tree felling in an eco-sensitive zone of Rajaji Tiger Reserve that falls under their jurisdiction. The ‘Mohund Chalo’ march was kicked off from Asharori forest check post at 10am on Saturday. Protestors walked chasing slogans and holding placards with messages like ‘Go Green or Go Home’, ‘Dehra-doomed’ and ‘Congratulations you have saved 11 minutes by killing 11,000 trees’. Anku Sharma and Dr Aanchal Sharma, founder members of The Earth and Climate Initiative NGO, said Gandhi Jayanti was the perfect occasion to protest against the “despotic strategies of the government”. “GoI is marking Wildlife Week starting today to next one week, yet it is felling trees and destroying the habitat of wildlife,” said Ira Chauhan, member, Citizens for Green Doon. A van gujjar, Mohammad Jumman, told TOI that the area was once single-laned and only a bullock cart could pass through. “Do we really need wider roads? We need forests and wildlife,” he said. Meanwhile, a statement released by 18 NGOs in the state said, “Much of the fun of visiting Doon Valley lies in cherishing the sylvan quiet hilly forested terrain with its birds, bees, elephants and leopards. Destroy their habitat, flatten the terrain and then sit pondering why tourism in our state has taken a hit. The beauty of Uttarakhand is not man made, it is nature’s gift to humanity, to be cherished and protected.” Reenu Paul of ‘Rajpur Community Initiative’, the high court petitioner in the case, told TOI, “Shivalik Hills lie on the entire stretch from Ganeshpur to Dehradun. Trees should not be touched by the authorities here,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/to-protest-tree-felling-for-del-doon-e-way-locals-recreate-non-cooperation-movement/articleshow/86714081.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Pune||Pune: Popular tigress ‘Priyadarshini’ dies of old age at Katraj zoo||PUNE: Tigress ‘Priyadarshini’ died at 21 of old age at the Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park in Katraj on Friday evening. Park director Rajkumar Jadhav said the usual lifespan of a tiger is 15-16 years. “Priyadarshini died at 21, indicating that the animal got adequate food care at the park. It was a calm animal and never attacked any staffers in these years,” said Jadhav. Priyadarshini was brought to the Katraj Park from Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai in 2006. The tigress was popular among visitors but had been off display for the past five years because of old age, said a zoo official. Dutta Chandne, a caretaker in the tiger section of Katraj zoo, said unlike other animals, Zoo staff and caretakers fondly referred to Priyadarshini as ‘Priya’. “She would always greet me with her typical roar whenever I would go to her cage,” said Dutta Chandne, a caretaker of the tiger section. “Whenever I would call her ‘Priya’, she would immediately come to the door of the cage. We had developed a bond over the years,” recalled Chandne, who along with a team of veterinary doctors had gone to Mumbai to bring the tigress to the zoo. “In the early days, she was a bit aggressive, but never created an issue for us. She was famous among visitors. Her death is a personal loss and I shall forever cherish fond memories of her,” added Chandne. According to procedure, the veterinary doctors of the park conducted a post-mortem and cremated the carcass on the park premises. The zoo now houses four tigers and three tigresses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/popular-tigress-priyadarshini-dies-of-old-age-at-katraj-zoo/articleshow/86716001.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: This Daan Utsav donate to help vendors restart livelihood||MUMBAI: In the two lockdowns since March 2020, street vendors, roadside petty shop owners like mechanics, cobblers, tailors were among the hardest hit. Having lost the source of their livelihood, these street vendors desperately need help to get back on their feet. Now two NGOs, Cash Relief and Turn Your Concern Into Action (TYCIA) Foundation, have collaborated to help restart the livelihood of 200 families which were affected during the pandemic-induced lockdowns. Part of #DaanUtsav (October 2-8), Cash Relief and TYCIA Foundation have begun a crowdfunding campaign (https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/helpstreet-vendors-restart-theirlivelihoods) to collect money. “We have a target to collect Rs 15 lakh through crowdfunding and the similar amount will be matched by well-wishers. We will send help through direct transfers to the accounts of the beneficiaries,” said Cash Relief ’s Rahul Nainwal. “We will ensure that they utilise the money to buy equipment, raw materials, carts and shop.” The lockdowns were so devastating that many street vendors had to even sell their cart and shop just to survive. Now with the donors’ contributions 200 families will restart their livelihood. Both Cash Relief and TYCIA have experience in collecting funds and taking help to the needy during the lockdowns. Cash Relief had collected and distributed around Rs five crore and helped the migrant workers reach home during the first lockdown. Tabish Bilal of TYCIA said that, since many families have lost their breadwinners, the focus is on helping the affected families to find source of livelihood. “Through our networks at the ground we will identify the families and try to help create entrepreneurs. Our volunteers at the ground can easily verify the needy families and we will try our best that the money transferred to the accounts of the beneficiaries is properly used,” said Bilal. Giving details about a case study, Bilal said that when Chitrakoot (Bundelkhand) resident died of Covid complications within three days of contracting this virus, it left his wife Anjali devastated. With two children to feed, Anjali was in dire straits and needed some work to survive as there was no one in the family to support her and their two children after the sudden death of her husband. With the help of Rs 30,000 from TYCIA Foundation, Anjali started a grocery shop and is now doing well. Bilal added that, apart from monetary help to the people who lost their livelihood during the pandemic, efforts are also being made to make them financially literate. So, volunteers hold orientation programmes and teach people how to use PayTM, do online cash transfers. Beginning with Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary, #Daan Utsav or the festival of giving motivates people to go out and help the needy. Those who lost their livelihood during the lockdowns deserve help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-this-daan-utsav-donate-to-help-vendors-restart-livelihood/articleshow/86718038.cms||---

---||Mumbai||GST collection in Maharashtra goes up 9% in September||MUMBAI: Maharashtra’s goods and services tax (GST) collections recovered in September after a dip in August. With revenues of Rs 16,584 crore in September, the collections were 9% higher than in the previous month but remained lower than in April and July. GST is a consumption-based tax and an indicator of economic activity. Maharashtra’s GST collections are the highest in the country and it is the main revenue earner for the state. “GST collections have improved since the lockdown-style restrictions in April and May this year. But collections are still around 8-10% below expectations since the economy is yet to recover fully,” said a government official. Collections are set to rise in the coming three months with the onset of the festive season. GST revenues reflect transactions made in the previous month, which may explain the higher collections recorded in April and July this year. “April collections are typically higher because they reflect the compliances by companies at the end of the financial year in March. In July, collections were also high because the lockdown-style restrictions were lifted in June. This resulted in the release of pent-up demand and also higher compliance by companies which had been delayed during the April-May lockdown-style restrictions,” said a government official. The data shows that the GST collection from April to September is 52% higher than the same period last year. During April-September 2020, collections were Rs 65,699 crore while this year it is Rs 99,958 crore, a difference of Rs 34,259 crore. Last year, the national lockdown was very stringent with most sectors barring agriculture closed. During the state lockdown in April and May, agriculture, manufacturing, construction and essential services were allowed to stay open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-gst-collection-in-the-state-goes-up-9-in-september/articleshow/86718687.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

The Centre had on Thursday deferred procurement of kharif paddy in Punjab and Haryana — which usually begins October 1 — to October 11 as crop maturity is delayed and moisture content in fresh arrivals is beyond permissible limit due to recent heavy rains. In Punjab’s Patiala and Bathinda, farmers handed over memorandums to the respective DCs and demanded start of paddy procurement by Monday. The protesting farmers also warned that if the deadline is missed, they will sit on an indefinite strike in front of DC offices across the state. In Patiala, a group of farmers also staged protests near the houses of MLAs Brahm Mohindra and Rajinder Singh. Similar protests were also held in neighbouring Haryana, where residences of several BJP and JJP politicians were gheraoed. There was a serious law and order situation in Sirsa as farmers broke barricades outside MP Sunita Duggal’s residence and staged a dharna. However, the situation was brought under control after senior police officials reached the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-gherao-residences-of-netas-across-haryana-punjab/articleshow/86719866.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Two hospitals record 10 intestinal gangrene cases in one week||HYDERABAD: In the last one week alone, two major hospitals in the city — the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) and Osmania General Hospital (OGH) — have reported at least 10 cases of rare intestinal gangrene, an after-effect of Covid-19. When STOI last reported this in June 2021, there were only four cases of intestinal gangrene in the city. “We have observed a recent surge in mesenteric ischemia cases, especially in the younger population with no comorbidities. During the past week, we have encountered six such cases, all requiring removal of a significant segment of the intestine, four of them requiring ventilator support, of which two ultimately succumbed to the disease,” said Dr N Bheerappa, professor and head of department of surgical gastroenterology, NIMS. Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a life-threatening condition, which occurs due to blockage of either arteries or veins supplying blood to the intestines, which may eventually lead to gangrene of the intestines. Dr Bheerappa added: “Of all the patients, three of them were relatively fit males with no previous comorbidities. Although none of the patients reported to have any history of Covid-19 illness or exposure, only two of them had received only a single dose of vaccine. Still Covid-19 antibodies were significantly positive in all six of them, pointing towards a role of Covid-19- related increase in thrombotic tendencies (tendency to form clots).” In fact, doctors say that while this condition is usually a known complication and in severely ill patients with multiple comorbidities, it is now being seen among healthy people too. “And the incidence is increasing drastically now,” said Dr C Madhusudan, head of department of surgical gastroenterology, OGH that has seen four such cases of acute gangrene in the past week where almost the entire intestine had to be removed. Doctors here said that they have been reporting 10 to 12 such cases every month in the last few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-hosps-record-10-intestinal-gangrene-cases-in-one-week/articleshow/86715594.cms||Amrita Didyala

Madurai city police commissioner Prem Anand Sinha said that closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras played a key role in tracing the robbers in a speedy manner, and urged the public to set up more of these cameras in their residences and business premises.Police said that out of the 19 cases of chain snatching reported in Madurai city in September, 15 have been solved, with many cases even taking less than a day to crack. As many as 11 robbers, including two women, who were involved in chain snatching in Thirunagar, Avaniyapuram, Anna Nagar and Mathichiyam have been arrested. Police were also able to recover the stolen gold jewellery from them.“These cases have been cracked within the month itself. This is mainly because we were able to make use of CCTV cameras to get important clues early that can help us identify the accused. The cameras help us save time and trace the culprits quicker,” said Sinha. Though CCTV cameras have been installed at most of the important junctions in the city, some outer extension areas are still lacking coverage. “While busy areas in the city like Vilakkuthoon, Thilagar Thidal, Tallakulam etc., are mostly covered by CCTV cameras, areas like Avaniyapuram, Koodal Pudur, Thiruppalai and Thirupparankundram need better coverage. Individual residents or resident welfare associations can set up CCTV cameras in their neighbourhood to better ensure safety,” said the commissioner.Meanwhile, armed patrols across Madurai city are also playing an active role in helping trace robbers and prevent chain snatching incidents. Automatic number plate cameras are also installed at 20 locations which is helpful to identify the vehicle of any suspect. Sinha praised the efforts of police officials in tracing and arresting the robbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cops-seek-more-cctv-cams-as-robbers-get-caught-faster/articleshow/86716080.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Thrombolytic therapy is the administration of drugs called lytics or clot busters to dissolve blood clots that have blocked major arteries or veins. “Only one patient out of 112 had major bleeding complications. The mortality rate from bleeding complications was a little over 1%. Since patients recovered muscle power, anti-gravity function, were not bedridden and were less dependent or fully independent in activities of daily living, overall mortality from ischaemic stroke was significantly reduced (4% only) and morbidity related to stroke among recovered patients was minimal,” said the doctors of of Apollo Reach Hospital, Karaikudi, while addressing the media. They said thrombolytic therapy is being underutilized in rural and semi-urban areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stroke-docs-vouch-for-early-thrombolytic-therapy/articleshow/86716065.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Prakash Raj to cross swords with Vishnu in MAA polls||HYDERABAD: The actors have changed attires and their dialogues have undergone a change as the stage is set for the elections to the Movie Artistes Association (MAA) on October 10. Who scripts a victory on that day is another matter but the run-up to the poll has actors on their television screens spewing venom, making vitriolic statements and trying to give the rivals a run for their money. This usually happens in box-office matters in the estimated Rs 1,500 crore film industry. Now, the fight is in the open and not on the big screen. Springing a surprise, actor Naresh, who was once again vying for the president’s post, made some quick political calculations in what is an obvious attempt to upset the applecart of Prakash Raj panel. Giving up on his plans, Naresh has teamed up with actor Vishnu, who is contesting for the president’s post. While five panels were supposed to be in the fray initially, it has now turned out that there will be only two — Prakash Raj’s and Vishnu’s. Senior actor CVL Narasimha Rao is in the fray for the president’s post and does not have a panel. In another development, actor Bandla Ganesh withdrew his nomination as general secretary and expressed support to the Prakash Raj panel openly. “I havee withdrawn on the advice of my godfather and well-wishers,” he said. Bandla Ganesh is close to actor-politician Pawan Kalyan. Actress Jeevitha Rajasekhar is contesting as general secretary in Prakash Raj’s panel. While being critical of the YSRCP government in Andhra Pradesh for its plans to introduce online ticketing for theatres, Pawan Kalyan had asked senior actor Mohan Babu to also speak up for the industry. “You are my friend Chiranjeevi’s younger brother and I can take the liberty to address you as someone younger to me without having to be respectful. I will respond to you later but at the moment, we are busy with elections to MAA. So, I seek your vote in favour of my son Vishnu,” Mohan Babu said. While the stars are fighting it out, producers are sandwiched between the AP government and Pawan Kalyan. As the Jana Sena chief had criticised the AP government, a team of producers, including Dil Raju, went and met AP’s information and public relations minister Perni Nani. After the visit, they also met Pawan Kalyan. “The producers have come to me to say they have nothing to do with Pawan Kalyan’s statements,” the minister said even as expressions of producer Dil Raju showed that he was feeling uncomfortable with the minister’s utterances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/prakash-raj-to-cross-swords-with-vishnu-in-maa-polls/articleshow/86715725.cms||---

The hospital renovated at a cost of Rs 45 lakh has five separate cabins for doctors, and a laboratory. The building has been renovated and the road to the hospital has been asphalted. Deshpande Foundation has donated an USG machine costing Rs 14.5 lakh. Specialist doctors including senior paediatrician Dr Rajan Deshpande who are also members of Rotary Clubs have offered their services free to the hospital. HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said two doctors, three nurses and four Group ‘D’ staff have been recruited for the hospital. “We are launching this programme on a trial basis, and depending on the response, we will decide on extending it to other hospitals, should more private doctors volunteer,” Itnal said. The enlisting of services of private doctors comes as a measure to pre-empt any possible crisis by predicted third wave of Covid-19. HDMC had felt the shortage of doctors when the twin cities reeled under the onslaught of the pandemic’s second wave. Private doctors have agreed to visit HDMC’s maternity hospital daily, and attend to patients. “Paediatricians, orthopaedic surgeons, ophthalmologists, gynaecologists, general surgeons, among other experts, have expressed their interest to serve at the hospital. They will spend at least two or three hours at this hospital,” Dr Rajan Deshpande said. HDMC health officer Sridhar Dandappanavar said the honorary doctors would work at the hospital in the afternoon. “Consultation will be free, and the registration charge for patients will be nominal. We have installed an ultrasonography machineand will fix the price for the scan soon,” he said. The members of Facebook group Dharwad Bonds have beautified the hospital premises by painting Warli Art on its compound wall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bellaud-inaugurates-renovated-hdmc-hospital/articleshow/86715603.cms||---
---||Pune||Union minister: Maha govt not paying crop insurance premium||Pune: Union minister of state for finance Bhagwat Karad on Saturday took potshots at the state government, claiming that it had not been paying crop insurance premium, and called out state deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar for opposing inclusion of petrol and diesel under the GST fold. In his speech, Karad largely spoke about the central schemes regarding ease of doing business and financial inclusion over the past seven years, claiming that the Narendra Modi government had largely got rid of corruption. The event, organised by the BJP’s business cell, held at a star hotel here, was billed by party state president Chandrakant Patil as an “informal” discussion and feedback session among the minister, businessmen and tax professionals. Although there were dozens of concerns among the audience, some complained that almost none of them were directly addressed.“We wanted the Union minister to address a lot of issues regarding the difficulties we encountered while filing Goods and Services Tax (GST), especially as micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs). However, all that he said was that these would be discussed at the Union council of ministers’ meetings over the next week or so,” said an attendee at the event. The BJP city business cell also handed Karad a ten-page list of concerns and suggestions regarding GST, such as frequent changes in slabs and norms, issues while availing input tax credits, as well as a list of prayers, such as allowing payment of Goods and Services Tax in instalments, condoning GSTIN registration and errors in E-way bills, among others. In a cover letter, praising Goods and Services Tax as a “revolutionary reform”, they opined that the system was implemented in “little haste”, and urged the implementation of their suggestions to “improve the image of the BJP government” as one that is “business friendly”. “The Goods and Services Tax is a new law, and difficulties are being noticed while implementing it. We will discuss the issues and find ways to solve it,” Karad said while interacting with businessmen and industrialists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/union-minister-maha-govt-not-paying-crop-insurance-premium/articleshow/86716134.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

As a state, it is the continuing effort of UTDB to make shooting in Uttarakhand a smooth process,” the minister added. The first policy took shape in 2015 and since it has been reviewed and developed with time. "The government is giving concessions to the production houses that come for film shoots and wanted to know what more can be done for them to promote Uttarakhand as an ideal location for shooting not just for Bollywood but also for Hollywood,” said Maharaj.  Secretary Tourism Dilip Jawalkar, said, “Uttarakhand has immense potential for film shooting. We are always open for producers and directors to come and visit especially the unexplored destination of Uttarakhand.

---||Goa||Against backdrop of exits, Cong calls for unity in party||Margao: Even as Congress celebrated Gandhi Jayanti and Lal Bahadur Shastri Jayanti on Saturday, the issue of veteran Congressman Luizinho Faleiro’s exit from the party loomed large in the speeches of Congress leaders. At a function held at the party’s South Goa district office, Congress leaders exhorted partymen to stay united in a bid to prevail upon them not to get influenced by Faleiro’s departure. “It doesn’t matter if a leader leaves the party, you, the worker, has to stand by the party. Leaders are made by you – workers and voters,” South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha said while addressing party workers after paying tributes to the leaders. “Don’t forget that whatever development that has been done in the country and in Goa has been done by Congress. Everybody commits mistakes, but let us all stay united and take an oath to re-instill in us the ideas and values of Congress.” Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat in his address sought to draw a parallel between the situation faced by Gandhi when many of his associates deserted him during the freedom struggle, and the one faced by Congress now when several leaders have quit the party. “Let anybody join the party, and let anybody quit it, it shouldn’t matter for the party. Congress should march ahead on the path set out by Mahatma Gandhi,” he said. He also further urged party workers not to air their grievances in the public, but to try to resolve the issues at the organisational level. “There may be differences amongst us. But the party is like a family; the issues shouldn’t be brought out in public,” Kamat said. State Congress president Girish Chodankar said that the BJP government neither believed in Gandhiji’s ideals of truth and non-violence nor in honouring the farmer and the soldier as underscored by Shastri with his ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ slogan, even as he urged party workers to march ahead on the path of Truth.

Sharing details, a day after three officials of AP Mercantile Cooperative Society (APMCCS) were arrested for the fraud, police said that the culprits siphoned off the money immediately after the seven-day period, though in Akademi’s records the FDs were created for a tenure of one year Investigation also revealed that the offenders handed fake bonds to the Akademi and kept the originals in their possession. “Several fixed deposits were created with public sector banks (PSBs) either through cheque or online by Akademi between December, 2020 and August, 2021. However, the key accused, who were involved in the creation of fixed deposits, made sure the tenure of each bond was only for seven days,” said a CCS official refusing to disclose any details about the key accused. Cops maintained that the accused were still absconding. “After the completion of seven days, fixed deposits were transferred by the accused into different fake accounts opened in the name Telugu Akademi at AP Mercantile Cooperative Society, using the original bonds. Later, from these accounts, money was withdrawn. Who is in possession of this ill-gotten money ? How was it spent? We can only get to know that after several missing suspects are nabbed and questioned,” a source from Hyderabad police told STOI. For facilitating the accused to transfer Akademi’s FDs into fake accounts with AP Mercantile Cooperative Society, the three accused — AP Mercantile Cooperative Society chairman and managing director BVNN Satyanarayana, AP Mercantile Cooperative Society operations manager V Padmavathi, AP Mercantile Cooperative Society relationship manager Syed Mohiuddin, who were arrested by CCS on Friday— allegedly received commissions. “There is inconsistency in the statements of these three accused on the issue of commission they made from this illegal act. A minimum of 5% of 60 crore withdrawn money was earned by the trio,” police said. Police suspect that this fraud was committed in connivance with some members of the Telugu Akademi, PSBs, APMCCS and some others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fake-fds-used-to-siphon-off-rs-60cr-from-telugu-akademi/articleshow/86714267.cms||Srinath Vudali

After the commission's secretary S Sasidhar Reddy informed about the attempts by unknown intruders to gain access to the laptop of the commission during the hearing of witnesses through video conference mode, the high court's information technology team started the investigation as the laptops used by the commission were provided by them. The preliminary understanding from the information technology team assisting the commission was that whoever made an attempt to acess the laptop knew the specific ID of the computer. The information technology team would be looking into the list of people who have access to the laptop's ID and also details of the intruders who tried to gain access to the laptop through Any Desk remote acess platform with IDs: IT Cell_SDNR and CID. Meanwhile, the laptop has already been replaced by the high court and kept in safe custody. To ensure safety of the data, the commission's information technology team has been taking daily backup of the proceedings. After finding out about the details of the intruders, the commission would be updated by the IT team. So far, no police complaint has been lodged regarding the incident. The issue came to light when the IT team of the commission alerted the secretary about the attempts made by unknown persons to gain access to the laptop hosting the commission's hearing when the witness deposition was in progress on Friday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hcs-it-team-probing-bid-to-hack-sc-panels-laptop/articleshow/86714262.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Under the programme, the IOC will provide sportspersons to train the inmates in various sports. The Yerawada prison has chosen three sports — carrom, chess, and volleyball — for the inmates. As of now, 60 inmates have shown willingness to learn a sport. The IOC will also provide women coaches, if any of the woman inmates wanted to learn a sport. “The prison tourism was halted in February because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

MMRDA is undertaking trial runs on both Metro corridors as they have received four rakes in all till now. Metropolitan commissioner S V R Srinivas said, “We issued notices to J Kumar Infraprojects Ltd, NCC Ltd, Godrej and Capacite Infraprojects Ltd for delay in completing work on Metro stations.” MMRDA sources said the cumulative penalty amounting to more than Rs 2 crore will be recovered if they fail to complete work within the deadline. Sources said nearly 85% work on stations is complete. MMRDA is hoping that contractors will finish the work by October 15. The first phase (20km) is between Dahanukarwadi and Aarey (18 stations). Both Metro lines are expected to reduce vehicular congestion by 25%. A Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) team will soon begin inspection of trial runs on both corridors, after which the commissioner of railway safety will issue a safety certificate; then only commercial runs can begin with 10 train sets, of which two arrived. While Metro 2Ais 17.5km long, Metro 7 (Dahisar-Western Express Highway metro station) is 18.6km long. A senior MMRDA official said, “Work on staircases and escalators is being carried out at some stations, so it will take some months before commercial operations can begin.” MMRDA had set a deadline of December 2020 to commence services but coronavirus led to a lockdown and labourers left for their nnative places as work came to a standstill. Indigenously-designed Metro cars will operate on 25kV AC traction power, will have CCTV surveillance, and passenger can carry their bicycles in the coaches. The cars are of stainless steel body and can carry 2,280 passengers in six train sets. Both Metro lines were sanctioned by the Devendra Fadnavis-led government on October 6, 2015 . The bhoomi pujan was performed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 11, 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4-contractors-face-rs-2cr-fine-totally-for-delays-in-metro-stations-work/articleshow/86718157.cms||Manthank Mehta

They said they would have been willing to observe Covid norms, including masks and sanitisation, and would accommodate 50% of the capacity of the venue. However, the proximity involved in garba likely posed a health challenge. And physical darshan was not permitted during Ganeshotsav either. Organiser Ganesh Naidu said, “I am surprised at the government rule which allows garba in all parts of the state except Mumbai. I cannot hold my event at Kora Kendra, Borivli. But 500 metres away from Dahisar Check Naka is Mira Road, whose municipality has permitted garba. As has Thane Municipal Corporation. Does the virus follow geographical barriers?” So far only the Ghatkopar Gujarati Samaj has planned a virtual dandiya event, like last year. Jignesh Khilani, secretary of the organisation, said, “Mumbai is receiving unfair treatment through the ban. Why not simply regulate garba, now that the Covid caseload is decreasing?” Virtual dandiya is a new concept that was devised amid the Covid-19 pandemic last year. The aarti, followed by music and dance, are streamed from a live performance several kilometres away. People participate in such events from the comfort of their homes. An online link is sent to users via Bluetooth, Zoom, YouTube or Facebook on the day of the event, and they dress up and dance at their respective locations. Meanwhile, Mumbadevi Temple is preparing to reopen on the first day of Navratri, October 7. Manager Hemant Jadhav said, “Approximately 200 devotees will get darshan every hour. At the request of the police, we are launching an app for devotees to book darshan tokens online. No darshan is allowed without prior booking. Also visitors should be fully vaccinated with the completion of 14 days after the second shot, or should have taken the RTPCR/ antigen test. Covid norms are compulsory.” The app may be launched on the temple’s website on October 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-garba-ban-only-in-mumbai-organisers-fume/articleshow/86718718.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

The company informed the National Stock Exchange and the BSE of the latest development on Saturday, a day after it convened a board meeting and decided to decline the requisition for an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) with a proposed agenda that sought removal of Puneet Goenka as company CEO and addition of six new independent directors to revamp the board.

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Women’s car gang on prowl, victims say cops failed to alert citizens||LUDHIANA: The women's car gang has targeted several people in the city over the past few years and has robbed them off their gold jewellery. On Thursday and Friday also, the gang targeted two women in two different areas, Moti Nagar and Haibowal, and escaped with their gold bangles. However, the city police have hardly taken any preventive measures, despite knowing the modus operandi of the gang. The gang targets elderly women around religious places. They would either offer them a lift, or would ask for some address and some times even lure them to the car citing some excuse. And in the next few minutes, the accused would grab the gold jewellery of the target and would escape. Usually, according to sources, the gang comes in a white car. A man would be driving the car and two to three women would be sitting in it. Rajat Malhotra, an advocate in Punjab and Haryana high court, and a resident of Humbran road, said, “In 2019, my mother Veeran Malhotra was targeted by the women car gang. My mother was returning from Ram Sharnam when the car gang made her sit in the car, took off her gold karas and threw her out of the moving car. My mother had gone through a knee replacement after that incident. Moreover, in this case the police had identified one accused woman who was already arrested in a similar case. She was brought to the office of some police official where she had admitted her crime; however, later she was let off.” A resident of Gill Road, Usha, 65 said, “The gang had tried to rob me of my gold jewellery in 2015 on Ferozepur Road. But I did not go near them and escaped. The gang has been active for a long time but the police have done nothing to stop them. There should be awareness, especially among the elderly women, about the gang. The announcements should also be made around religious places. Besides, CCTVs and awareness boards must be deployed outside all these religious places.” ‘Will be nabbed soon’ Deputy commissioner of police, investigation, S P S Dhindsa said, “Patiala police had busted this gang about two years ago. Ludhiana police had brought those arrested on production warrant and had made their arrests. The police are showing the pictures of all those arrested and accused to the victims to identify them.” According to Dhindsa, “There are a group of families of a village in Fatehgarh Sahib district who are involved in these crimes. They have been arrested several times. But they come out on bail and again execute the crime again. We will solve these cases soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/womens-car-gang-on-prowl-victims-say-cops-failed-to-alert-citizens/articleshow/86718161.cms||Payal Dhawan

The three first timers, Swapnil Jambhulkar, Praveen Lavhale and Akash Naik, were nabbed by Sadar police while they were in the process of cutting open an ATM after doing a recce of the place for three days. Police said Lavhale, who had the knowledge and skill in handling electronic gadgets, was the main driving force behind the gang who had no past crime records of such offences. Jambhulkar, who had an accident and rioting case against him in the past, earlier worked at a roadside snacks centre. He too required money. Naik, also from an economically weak family, wanted some fast cash. The trio had ganged up with a plan to rob an ATM after cutting it open. Police said Lavhale had been staying at Jambhulkar’s place for the last few days as the gang had decided to cut open the ATM at Bhimsen Chowk. As the gang was engaged in cutting the ATM, an informer alerted Sadar police station which in turn relayed the message to the control room, said senior inspector of Sadar police station Vinod Choudhury. The alert message was overheard by zonal DCP Vinita S who was on the night round. She immediately rushed Sadar police to the spot. The night officer, sub-inspector Santosh Khandekar of Sadar police station and detection branch team had first sent a cop in civil dress to keep a watch at the ATM. After he gave the signal, the rest of the cops zeroed in on the gang before nabbing them red-handed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/to-build-house-man-attempts-to-rob-atm-arrested/articleshow/86711216.cms||Soumitra Bose

For three days, cellphone users have been getting text messages with a link, asking them to click it to participate in the event to win a car from an automobile company. Investigators said that weblinks within such emails can also unleash malware or lead you to scammer-run copycat websites. The company has tweeted that the corporate group or its companies are not responsible for the promotional activity. The scamsters have used the group’s name and sadi that it is celebrating 150 years of its existence and asked to click to participate to win a car. After coming across such fraudulent offers, the Mumbai cyber police has issued a warning to the public not to fall victim to such phishing attack links used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. DCP (Cyber) Rashmi Karandikar said such links could be used to steal credentials and banking card numbers. “The fraud offers have gone viral on social media... Do not click on such fraud links,” said Karandikar.

Fingers crossed, say festival organisers. The Arkay Centre on TTK Road has already begun hosting Carnatic music concerts this week, limiting the number of rasikas as per the government’s Covid-19 safety protocol. Still, the concerts have gone live. October 1 had a performance by Ramakrishnan Murthy in celebration of the 149th birth anniversary of composer Papanasam Sivan. More concerts will follow through the first week of October. Violinist Vittal Rangan, who was one of the accompanists at the Arkay concert, says nothing can match the dynamics of live concerts. "As artists, we feed off the energy of the audience. It is refreshing to have rasikas come up to us after a concert and engage with us about music," says Rangan, who will be performing live this December at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. Arkay Ramakrishnan, the founder of Marusdhdhwani, which is hosting the concerts, says they have a live concert line up over the next two months. "For our anniversary, on November 11, we have planned a 12-day concert series. In December, for the Margazhi season, we are organising two concerts a day from December 1 to December 31 as well as a few lec-dems," he says. "Over the last 18 months, we have lost several wonderful artists such as TN Krishnan, B Krishnamoorthy, and Thanjavur V Sankara Iyer, but on account of the pandemic, we could not organise memorial concerts for them. Our lecture-demonstrations will pay tribute to their lives." At Narada Gana Sabha, K Harishankar says there will be virtual as well as live concerts this year, and hints that government sops willing, the December Season canteen too may see a comeback after a year’s hiatus. Rajagopal Sekar, secretary of Kartik Fine Arts, says that though most of their season will be virtual this year, there is a plan to take some concerts live in January 2022. "All the artists want to be on stage. Nothing beats performing live, but we have to keep safety in mind," he says. On September 30, for its 46th anniversary, Kartik Fine Arts hosted a live event in Mylapore, where artists were honoured with awards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/after-a-year-gone-virtual-sabhas-open-their-doors/articleshow/86716196.cms||Kamini Mathai

---||Visakhapatnam||In a 1st, AP power companies to give Rs 126 crore back to consumers||VISAKHAPATNAM: You may have heard of governments waiving power bills to keep voters happy in an election year. But have you ever heard of power distribution companies giving crores of rupees back to consumers? In a rare gesture, power utilities in Andhra Pradesh have decided to pass on Rs 126 crore they saved through cost-effective power purchases back to users. The companies have submitted proposals to the AP Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) seeking approval to return the money in the first quarter of 2021-22 to domestic consumers. There have been instances earlier of true-up charges where power distribution companies have sought an increase in tariff. But this is perhaps the first time in the country that they have decided to pass on the savings to the consumers through true-down charges. About 1.45 crore domestic consumers will benefit from the gesture. The state has about two crore power consumers including about 55 lakh high-tension consumers. The HT consumers, however, will not get the benefit. The Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (APSPDCL) saved Rs 0.15 per unit by purchasing power in the open market at lower rates and saved Rs 89.23 crore in purchase of 6,013 million units of electricity. Similarly, the Andhra Pradesh Central Power Distribution Company Limite (APCPDCL) saved Rs 33.25 crore and the Eastern Power Distribution Company (EPDCL) Of Andhra Pradesh Limited Rs 3.67 crore. State energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli made the announcement while participating in the 152nd birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi in Vijayawada on Saturday. “Any policy, programme or best practices being implemented in the power sector are aimed at protecting the interests of consumers. The programmes of the state government in the power sector are being implemented by power utilities in a true spirit. Our prime focus is always the consumers,” he said. Quoting Mahatma Gandhi, Srikant added; “A customer is the most important visitor on our premises. He is not dependent on us. We are dependent on him Later in a statement, State Energy Conservation Mission chief executive officer A Chandrasekhar Reddy said that the endeavour of the state government to save public money and the best practices that were introduced by power utilities during the last two years are yielding good results now. “This will ultimately benefit every electricity consumer in the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/in-a-1st-ap-power-cos-to-give-rs-126-cr-back-to-consumers/articleshow/86718163.cms||---
---||Chennai||The future of fashion is fluid & free||CHENNAI: American fashion icon Anne Klein said, "Clothes aren’t going to change the world, the women who wear them will." And, in a post-pandemic world curious about inclusivity and ethical living, a tribe of young fashion labels are changing the world through gender-fluid or genderless fashion. It isn’t simply about tailoring a garment for one and all but creating culturally compelling statements that everyone in the eclectic gender spectrum can proudly fit into and make their own. When Chennai designer Purushu Arie was a design student at NIFT Delhi, he was trained to design clothes that primarily catered to women or those identifying as female, which he, as a cis-gendered man, couldn’t resonate with. Years later, as most of the garments were gifted to his female friends, he started making clothes that he could wear, and eventually those that anyone could wear. "With time, I realised I no longer had gender in mind while designing clothes. This was also when I was studying fashion history, and realised that historically, clothing was never gendered," he says. Purushu Arie whose ‘ungendered’ label by the same name has caught on among men, women and non-binary youngsters, is inspired by Tamil costume history, which Arie says, is rife with progressive, functional gender neutrality. "In Sangam texts, they talk about the ‘pudavai’ as a garment worn by everyone. The structures at Mamallapuram show both male and female figurines wearing veshtis and dhotis. And under Pandyan empire’s popular pearl trade that reached as far as Indonesia in the east and Egypt in the west, kings, who would be perceived as powerful ruling class symbols of masculinity, wore pearl jewellery," says Purushu who creates lungis with waistbands and pockets, and saris — designs he calls "utilitarian reinterpretations of ancient Tamil silhouettes." When Mumbai-based designer Aastha Jhunjhunwala started her online store Sthal, it was her own rebellion against the rigidity and gender normativity in the fashion industry. "I believe gender is completely a social construct. My launch collection was ‘make to order’ and the other two were upcycled, oversized shirts that could fit all body types. While we have standardised size charts, we also customise, which is important," says Aastha. "For example, if I’m going to make a kimono, less men would usually go for it, as it may seem feminine to them. But the fact is it’s a straight cut and all genders wear it. If there are people asking for modifications to make it more boxy, we keep those possibilities open." But most importantly, a gender-fluid garment is created with sensitivity as much as aesthetic, and this is a big step towards opening the world up to gender and sexual minorities, says director and LGBTQI activist Malini Jeevarathnam, who is gender non-conforming. "It’s relieving when I no longer have to go to the men’s section at stores and awkwardly wait in line to try out a shirt or a pair of pants," she says. "It’s welcoming to know there’s a dedicated team designing clothes for you." But it would be shallow to assume that gender-fluid fashion — which is most of the time also size fluid — has opened up avenues to only those who identify beyond the binaries. For many it is as much about versatility as choice. Architect-turned artist Priyanka Ulaganathan, who is a client of Purushu’s and identifies as a woman, says it is comfort and novelty that makes it tick for her. "Purushu designed a crop top for me that I could confidently pull off, as a chubby woman, and also team up with palazzo pants and a shawl. It gave me a lot of room to experiment and also stand out distinctively," she says. Fashion commentator and editor-in-chief of The Voice of Fashion, Shefalee Vasudev, says, "When a brand calls itself gender-fluid, they are approaching it with the politics of delinking gender with clothes and colours. It goes over and, rejects by choice, many of the existing wardrobe classics earlier separated for the two genders, which gives us deconstructed pants, asymmetrically-created kurtas, and a re-arranged grammar of colours," she says. "The regular consumer who’s not into the politics of gender fluidity, is still excited by how many ways you can wear a boxy pants, or a military jacket. People are attracted to these exciting styling avenues."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/the-future-of-fashion-is-fluid-free/articleshow/86716241.cms||Saranya Chakrapani

The judge gave this interim direction while hearing a petition filed by Kanaparthi Pavani of Hyderabad who questioned the legal validity of the teaching faculty recruitment notification-2020 given by the university that ignored key statutory provisions like OBC reservations. Upon hearing the contention by university counsel that the selection was complete and appointment letters too were given to the selected candidates following the recent decision of a division bench that vacated the stay imposed on the recruitment by the National BC Commission (NCBC), the judge said that the whole selection would be subject to the judgment of this court in this petition. “Give a list of selected candidates to the petitioner and inform all the selected candidates about the ongoing case against their selection,” he said. It may be recalled EFLU had challenged the legal validity of a stay imposed by the NCBC on the ground that the latter did not possess any powers to stay the recruitment. A division bench agreed with EFLU in this regard and vacated the stay. The bench, however, said that it had not expressed any opinion on the university’s action of ignoring OBC reservations in the recruitment. The NCBC too said that it would bring to the notice of the President of India the injustice being done to OBCs at EFLU. “We will also challenge the order of the HC bench before the Supreme Court,” Achary Thalloju, member of NCBC, said. The case will come up for a hearing on October 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-court-makes-eflurecruitment-conditional/articleshow/86714295.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

While one hospital each will come up in Sasan, Jamwada and Dhari, place for the fourth hospital is likely to be identified soon. Parimal Nathwani, Director-Corporate Affairs at Reliance Industries Ltd, said they will construct the four hospitals which will also be equipped with ICUs. “We will get the best doctors and latest equipment to treat lions. The hospital will be run by the forest department but we will monitor the hospitals,” he said. He added, “Upgrading existing hospitals with new infrastructure is the need of the hour as it would help the department to provide best treatment to injured or sick lions. Three sites including the extension of Sasan hospital have already been identified for this.” Sources in the forest department said that these hospitalss will be over and above the one which will come up in Sasan under Project Lion. Nathwani further said that under corporate social responsibility (CSR), they have also got approval to construct parapet walls around open well. “The department has already shared a list of wells with us. We will work out an estimate and begin work within a fortnight,” he said. In context of increasing presence of lions outside the protected area in greater Gir, he said that plantations should not be allowed in protected areas of Gir. “Open space must be maintained to facilitate lion movement. Also, the prey base must be increased so that lions do not venture out in search of food,” he said. Trackers and the maldhari community in Gir are two major contributors to the proliferation of Gir lions, he said, adding that trackers share a special bonding with the lions and for them, it is not merely a job.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/4-hospitals-for-lions-in-offing/articleshow/86714312.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||IIIT-Hyderabad, NIMS join hands to digitise glass slides||HYDERABAD: Paving way for digital pathology, the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H) has installed a digital scanner at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) that would digitise glass slides having tissue samples. This would enable pathologists to not only view and magnify the samples for finer details on a computer but would also create an Indian pathology dataset to develop artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for accelerated and accurate diagnosis. Traditionally, a tissue sample is processed to make sections out of it. These sections are then stained with pigments onto a glass slide to provide a contrast and reveal cellular components under microscopic observation, making it a manual and tedious process. “With digitisation, the entire slide is scanned and converted into a digital one which can be viewed on a computer and magnified (if required) to look at the finer details. One need not physically transport the glass slides to a pathologist for diagnosis. A mere link to the required image will be enough,” said Dr Shantveer Uppin, head of department, pathology at NIMS. IIIT-H’s initial collaborative efforts with NIMS are focused on digitising the existing glass slides to create an Indian dataset of various malignancies. NIMS has a huge quantity of pathological slides that have been stored for over 15 years. Since NIMS receives a large caseload of lung cancer patients, the project will kick off with digitising and annotating of lung cancer biopsies. Apart from cancer, the aim is to digitise lupus nephritis samples – an auto-immune condition affecting the kidneys. “There are various classes of lupus which are analysed manually. We want to build an AI tool where based on the scanned images, it will identify these features and help us in guiding diagnosis better,” said Dr Uppin. Acknowledging that installing expensive scanning machines in every hospital may not be feasible, the iHub-Data team, a technology innovation hub at IIIT-H, is in preliminary discussions to have a centralised scanning facility housed at IIIT-H, serving as a one-stop shop for sample collection and digitisation. “Our aim is to create this repository such that not only can everyone contribute to it but it is also publicly accessible. It is a long haul, but we are definitely excited about it,” said professor Bapi Raju, healthcare lead at iHub-Data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-nims-join-hands-to-digitise-glass-slides/articleshow/86714334.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Bizmen fume over frequent power cuts||LUDHIANA: City businessmen, especially those belonging to fasteners industry are miffed over frequent power cuts taking place in the industrial areas, specially near Sua Road. The power cuts in the Gill Road area from past three days after a truck crashed into a power supply tower too has caused resentment amongst businessmen. Industrialists are also alleging that due to the power cuts and scheduled maintenance by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), they are suffering huge production losses and are shelling more money for fuel for generators. Businessmen are also of the view that the scheduled power cuts for maintenance should be carried out only on holidays when almost all the factories are closed. According to Rajkumar Singla, president of Fasteners Suppliers Association (FSA) Ludhiana, “Factories located on Sua Road are facing big problem these days, power outages have become quite common in this area. Sometimes sudden power cuts occur while there are days when there are scheduled maintenance activities carried on by PSPCL for entire day. Yesterday and the day before for instance, there were shutdowns from 9am till 6pm in several areas coming under 66KV Sahnewal Kanganwal line and 11KV feeder. Though the department informs us about these shut downs in advance this is still causing huge loss to us. How can the factories will carry out production when there will be no power supply for 10 hours. Department should think of some alternatives like to carry on such maintenance without affecting the factories.” According to Munish Sacheva, general secretary of FSA Ludhiana, “Even a single hour of power cut costs us dearly because on one side we have to bear huge production loss if we do not arrange alternate source of power to run our factories as despite power outage we will have to pay wages to our labour for their time. On the other hand, when we use power generators to handle the situation we have to shell out huge amount of money for the fuel which is used to run the generator. The only way out of this situation is the regular power supply from the PSPCL in the industrial areas and the scheduled maintenance should only be carried out during national holidays when all the factories are usually closed.” According to another industrialist Pankaj Aggarwal, “The problem of power cuts is quite prevalent in the city and PSPCL needs to work on improving its distribution system. In recent case for three days the power supply remained disrupted in Gill Road area after a truck rammed into a tower carrying power lines. We understand that PSPCL is not at fault in this case, but at least they should have acted fast to ensure the normalisation of power supply.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bizmen-fume-over-frequent-power-cuts/articleshow/86718175.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: CBSE schools gear up to start offline classes||HYDERABAD: A month after the Telangana government allowed reopening of schools for physical classes, many schools affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) are now setting ground to call back students to the classrooms. Despite the government’s nod, majority of the CBSE schools had decided not to reopen physically and continue only online classes. Now, after a month, schools have decided to reopen in a phased manner for all the students. From collecting consent forms to conducting internal surveys, some schools are prepping to reopen for physical classes between October 4 and October 20. “Most parents have agreed to send their children to school for in-campus classes. Hence, we may not be able to conduct online classes if there is not enough strength,” said a circular issued by a private CBSE school in Kukatpally that is set to resume classes from October 18. Although the high court has asked school managements to not force parents to send their wards back to school for physical classes, online classes in many schools depend on the number of students preferring them and teachers’ adaptability to handle both online/offline classes. “In case the conditions are not conducive to continue online classes simultaneously with offline classes, we will be withdrawing the online classes. Students can attend the physical school, only with the consent of the parents. Students of classes LKG to class 12 will attend school on alternate days from October 20,” stated a circular issued by a private CBSE school in Jubilee Hills. Schools have decided to reopen in a phased manner .

The gang, which used to travel in a truck, is suspected to have broken into many ATMs in several states including Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. A diligent investigation, clutching on a stray ATM transaction done by a gang member, led police to the gang comprising Sajid, Arshad and Lukman and a juvenile from Nug and Mehwat areas of Haryana. Police seized the truck, Rs 45,000 in cash, mini-gas cylinder, and a welding equipment from them. While the three men were sent to jail, the juvenile was sent to a correctional facility. Police said Sajid has similar cases pending against him in Maharashtra. Arshad was involved in a few thefts in Haryana. It all started with a spate of break-ins and burglary attempts at ATM kiosks in Tiruvallur and Arakkonam. A joint operation was conducted by Tiruvallur and Ranipet district police to track the gang behind the thefts. On September 15, the gang attempted to steal cash from an ATM at Arambakkam. Based on specific tip off, police team rushed to the spot but the gang fled the scene after abandoning their vehicle near Elavur check-post. On September 17, Rs 4 lakh stolen from an ATM at Arakkonam. Suspecting the same gang, that had abandoned the car and escaped at Elavur, police traced the car owner in Andhra Pradesh. They realised that it was a stolen car. However, while scanning the last successful transaction made at the same ATM, police found that money had been withdrawn from the same bank account by one of the suspects. They then collected the account-holder’s details from the bank and found that a gang member, Sajid, had a mobile number. Using it, police tracked Sajid’s location and found that it matched with location of the burglary bid. Police also found out that Sajid was aboard a truck near Gummidipoondi and its registration number was also retrieved. The CCTV camera footage confirmed he truck had travelled through all the three crime spots. On Friday, police found Sajid was moving towards Gummidipoondi. Police intercepted the truck and arrested all the four. Police said the gang targeted only unmanned ATM kiosks in isolated locations. One suspect would walk into the ATM and apply spray foam on the CCTV camera eye before others looted it with a gas cutter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/police-bust-atm-looting-gang-seize-truck-cash-and-gas-cutters/articleshow/86716262.cms||---
---||Chennai||This dental clinic is more accessible than others||Chennai: When Preethi Srinivasan became a quadriplegic after an accident, one of the challenges she faced every day was something as simple as brushing her teeth. Maintaining oral hygiene is a challenge for people with disabilities as they are usually dependent on others for self-care and lack access to professional dental care. That’s why an accessible dental care unit was on the top of the charts for Preethi when she envisioned INSPIRE (Integrated Spinal Rehabilitation) in Tiruvannamalai, a centre that will use holistic medicine to heal people affected by paraplegia and quadriplegia. The centre, an initiative of Soulfree, a not-for-profit that works with survivors with spinal cord injuries, which Preethi co-founded with her mother, was inaugurated earlier this year. And the accessible dentistry unit will be launched by the end of October.“Most dental clinics are not accessible to wheelchair-users, even the regular dental chair is not disabled-friendly or comfortable and people don’t realise that we have different needs,” says Preethi. “So I wanted to create a facility where disabled people can get treatment with dignity. We charge a nominal fee to keep the centre running.”The accessible dentistry unit is being designed by Dr Bijivin Raj, who works at the Sri Mookambika Institute of Dental Sciences and is also a trustee of Soulfree. “We have nine specialties in dentistry and special care dentistry usually comes under paediatrics, and focuses on treatment procedures for the disabled,” says Dr Raj, adding that physical occupational therapy units usually design custom-made toothbrushes etc. for the disabled as they are not freely available in the market. “Some may not be able to hold a toothbrush properly so they are dependent on someone to even brush their teeth, but it is difficult. So many suffer from tooth decay or gum problems. So, if people have some movement in their limbs, we can redesign and make custom toothbrushes that can bend in certain ways to ensure proper oral hygiene.”The facility will have the option of portable dental units,so people can be treated in a person’s homes or a hospital bed. “Everything there — the drilling and cleaning units, spittoons — will be wall mounted. Instead of regular dental chair, wheelchairs that can be reclined can be positioned so that people can get treatment in their wheelchairs itself,” says Dr Raj. Dr S K Rajavalli, who runs Rajavalli Dental Care in Thiruvanmiyur, says there is little awareness about accessible dentistry. “My clinic has a ramp near one entrance for people in wheelchairs. And a few dental colleges in Chennai have portable dental units, but a lot more needs to be done,” says Dr Rajavalli, who started Project Punnagai in 2015 to provide quality dental treatment to spastic children. “Often, parents bring in children with disabilities only when they complain of pain, but some kids are unable to communicate that so parents need to get a check-up done every three to six months. And clinics and hospitals need to gear up to address their needs and requirements.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/this-dental-clinic-is-more-accessible-than-others/articleshow/86716285.cms||Priya Menon

---||Chennai||Railway ticket vending machines fall into disuse||Chennai: Suburban travel may have resumed close to pre-Covid-19 level, but railways are yet to make all automatic ticket vending machines operational at railway stations. Though funds have been allocated at railway budgets to repair and replace the machines, most machines at suburban and MRTS stations are not working. The few that were working were being used by railways to issue tickets by posting a volunteer often drawn from retired railway staff in the pre-pandemic days. This practise too seems to have been discontinued due to the travel restrictions imposed due to Covid.T Sadagopan, a consumer activist and commuter, said the machines are almost forgotten. “People do not use them on our route because many prefer to buy tickets from counters. This is also a reason why they fall into disuse.” He also said that “maintenance is key. The machines get jammed as people don’t know how to use them.” The zone got Rs 5crore allocation in the budget for repair or replacement of the ticket vending machines this year. Similar allocation was also done last year, but no change was seen on the ground. A railway official said steps were being taken to replace many of the machines as around 90% of the pre-Covid commuter traffic has resumed. “We have repaired a few machines in major stations like Central and Egmore where the number of tickets purchased is high. Around 50 machines have come and are being installed soon.”Retired staff will also be roped in to sell tickets from these machines, said an official. The smart card based ticket vending machines were not popular among people even at stations that catered to commuters who are tech savvy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/railway-ticket-vending-machines-fall-into-disuse/articleshow/86716306.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The election promises to be a tri-cornered contest between the ruling BJP, opposition Congress, and new entrant AAP. With delimitation having been recently implemented in Gandhinagar and with several neighbouring villages being included within the limits of the municipal corporation, the BJP looks to make big gains in the civic body. For its part, the Congress aims to consolidate its position among the voters of the state capital. The GMC election assumes importance as it will be the first big electoral test of the new CM, Bhupendra Patel. The GMC also falls under the Lok Sabha constituency represented by Union home minister Amit Shah. A large number of government employees reside in the state capital. Both the Congress and the BJP have promised jobs for the residents of Gandhinagar, while the AAP claims it has emerged as the alternative to both the BJP and the Congress. Congress leader Nishit Vyas said his party’s manifesto focuses on employment and reflects the ambitions of the people of Gandhinagar. “Though Gandhinagar is the state capital, the BJP has done very little for the city’s people,” Vyas said. “I am sure the people will vote overwhelmingly for the Congress.” BJP spokesperson Yamal Vyas said that state and central governments have worked together to make Gandhinagar a vibrant capital city over the past few years. “With world-class education institutions, GIFT City, and other projects, Gandhinagar has evolved into a modern city,” he said. “The BJP will sweep the election.” Counting of votes will be taken up on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/first-test-for-new-cm-as-gmc-goes-to-the-polls-today/articleshow/86714382.cms||---

Flagging off an all-India car rally of the National Security Guard from the Red Fort as part of the ongoing ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’, Shah said unlike freedom fighters, the youth of today may not have the privilege of making the supreme sacrifice. “But they can live for the country by participating in its development,” he added. The event on Saturday was attended by Tokyo Olympics medallist Bajrang Punia besides junior home ministers Nityanand Rai, Ajay Kumar Mishra and Nishith Pramanik and the central para-military brass. Stressing on self-reliance and ‘Make in India’ mantra given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Shah said the youth of the country should associate themselves with this goal so that India becomes the global manufacturing hub and Indian products with the label ‘Made in India’ are sold all over the world. Shah underlined the importance of the day of the event, the birth anniversary of Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, and late Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. “Both these great men have left their indelible impression on the country's history, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/participate-in-indias-development-shah-exhorts-the-youth/articleshow/86719903.cms||---

It proved that the NDA and Gujarat governments have relations with him. From reports of agencies, we suspect that Modi and Shah knew Singh’s address and the Cente helped him from Delhi to flee the country,” alleged Patole. Countering criticism of opposition parties that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was ignoring the plight of thousands of aggrieved farmers who suffered due to the wet drought in Vidarbha and Marathwada and that the respective guardian ministers were not responding to their calls for help, the Sakoli MLA reiterated that BJP leaders should first approach Modi and Shah instead of targeting others. “Ever since the BJP came back to power at the Centre in 2019, it has been meting out stepmotherly treatment to Maharashtra. The state is facing calamities, but no help has arrived from the Centre. Instead of sitting here and shedding crocodile tears for farmers, BJP leaders should move to Delhi and stage a dharna before the Modi-Shah duo to bring funds for the state. People will definitely reward them,” said Patole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-modi-and-shah-know-of-param-birs-hideout-alleges-patole/articleshow/86718242.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Lucknow||Har Ghar Nal scheme: An oasis for parched homes in UP||LUCKNOW: In January 2019, when the state government began the implementation of the Har Ghar Nal scheme under the Jal Jivan Mission, coverage of piped supply in UP was just 1.96%. Now, ahead of the 2022 UP elections, Yogi government hopes to be able to start direct supply of water to 18.88 lakh households in the Bundelkhand and Vindhya regions and by the end of next year, piped water will be provided to an additional 34,397 villages across the state. The project is being rolled out in two phases. Anurag Srivastava, principal secretary, Namami Gange, said that Bundelkhand, Vindhya and arsenic and fluoride affected areas will be the first to be benefitted by this scheme. Explaining the need for piped water supply, Srivastava said: “UP has a good supply of groundwater and even now, there continues to be a high dependency on borewells and handpumps. There are 3 million functional handpumps in the state. However, in areas like Bundelkhand, Sonbhadra and Mirzapur, which are rocky, it was neither possible to dig borewells nor was there sufficient water. The area is known for droughts and water shortages. It was, therefore, decided to target these areas first,” he said. The Jal Jeevan Mission in Bundelkhand and Vindhya regions will cover all such areas where there is acute shortage of water. An average of 44% of the physical work in various schemes has been completed. All related piped water schemes will draw water from dams and rivers, and groundwater, treat the water for which a network of water treatment plants is in the process of being set up, and then supply to various areas. The schemes, said an official, are being executed in nine districts of Bundelkhand and Vindhya regions and will cover about 18,88 lakh households with a population of 1.04 crore. From about 40 litres per capacity daily, the government is aiming to increase supply to 55 lpcd. By December, even though the entire planned network of infrastructure is unlikely to be completed, parts of the project will be commissioned. In the remaining 66 districts of the state, the government will cover areas where water is contaminated with arsenic and fluoride and such places where there is no access to clean drinking water. This will include 34,257 villages and projects are likely to be commissioned by the middle of 2022. From about 40 litres per capacity per day, the government is aiming to increase supply to 55 lpcd. Srivastava said that in Bundelkhand, 467 projects are being implemented, 43 of which are surface water schemes and the remaining based on groundwater. At least half the projects are expected to be completed by December. Pankaj Singh, project management consultant, Jal Jeevan Mission, said that the Budhpura drinking water scheme in Jhansi district will start by November. “We are making intake wells, water treatment plants, clear water reservoirs and overhead tanks zone wise. About 14 tanks have already been constructed. Water for this project will be drawn from the Matatila Dam in Lalitpur,” he said. In addition to this, over 80% construction work in Mahoba’s Lahchura Kashipura village group pipe drinking water scheme has been completed and preparation is on for trial run of the scheme in October. This scheme is being executed at a cost of Rs 233 crore and will benefit 44,000 households.

Arvind Kejriwal has worked to incorporate these initiatives in the curriculum of colleges and schools and therefore, we thought we should bring this model too,” said AAP Goa’s general secretary (youth) Hanzel Fernandes. “Gandhiji said that you must be the change you want to see in the world. Keeping this in mind, without a single MLA, we are working to provide adequate guidance from professionals to our youth,” AAP national executive member and Goa vice president Capt Venzy Viegas said, adding that once the party forms the government, these workshops and guidance will be worked into the education curriculum and inculcated into school and college functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-holds-skill-devpt-workshops-for-youth/articleshow/86718243.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

From proposing a transition from a three-year bachelor’s programme to a three- or four-year programme with the focus in the final year on research, to offering university status to a large group of institutions with proven academic record, the committee has made several recommendations in the short-term implementation plan, which will not require financial resources. In the long-term plan, it has endorsed offering universal free digital rights to all learners in the state. The report of the task force has been submitted to the government and will be tabled in the cabinet soon. The 19-member task force was constituted in October last year under the chairmanship of scientist Raghunath Mashelkar. It has identified 18 provisions in NEP that can be immediately implemented through simple directives. Offering a plan for a four-year degree programme, starting post-doctoral programmes in universities, enabling digital adjunct faculty for foreign universities on board and enabling provisions for rationalisation of fees and reforming fee regulatory policies are included. The need to define a dual-degree mode of operation and collaboration, and creation of an academic bank of credits was included in the medium-term plan, which needs some funds. Mashelkar told TOI NEP has given an opportunity to rethink, reimagine and reinvent the education system. “One of the important recommendations we have made is to completely transform digital education. We are recommending free digital devices and infrastructure to all learners, along with free access to digital learning, assessment, and employment resources. The idea is to provide an end-to-end digital solution to students,” said Mashelkar. The report estimates an annual investment for state-wide digital transformation to be around Rs 3,000 crore for about 30 lakh student beneficiaries, starting from 10 lakh in 2022-23. This comes to around Rs 10,000 annually per child, which is just a 12-18% increase from current costs, it states.  Former Mumbai University vice-chancellor Rajan Welukar, who was chairman of the subcommittee for curriculum, said they have suggested a flexible, futuristic empowering curriculum. Niranjan Hiranandani, member, task force, and provost, HSNC University, said, “The report emphasises on training students in some vocation by taking a multi-disciplinary approach... Even if they drop out in between, they will be equipped with a diploma or a degree.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/new-national-edu-policy-in-three-phases-maharashtra-state-task-force/articleshow/86718281.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Hyderabad||‘Will raise the merger issue in Parliament again’||HYDERABAD: Assuring residents of Secunderabad Cantonment Board of voicing their demand for a merger, A Revanth Reddy, the local MP and member of the parliamentary standing committee on defence said, he will raise the issue in Parliament once again. In the past too he had fought for this merger of cantonment areas into the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). Secunderabad Cantonment is one of the Assembly segments of Malkajgiri Lok Sabha seat represented by Revanth. In an interview with STOI, Revanth admitted to the sufferings of cantonment residents due to lack of drinking water supply, inadequate underground drainage system, poor and narrow roads, closure of some roads by Local Military Authorities (LMA), lack of recreation or big parks and multiplexes and malls, to name a few drawbacks. But he hastened to add that the main problem for the backwardness of cantonment areas is lack of funds. He said that the SCB is made to starve, both by the central and state government. The state government too is largely responsible for neglecting the SCB areas. For example, the TRS government had announced 20,000 litres of free water supply to the poor in GHMC limits but did not extend the sop to people of SCB despite the area abutting the GHMC limits, he said. “It is the responsibility of the state to first send a consent letter to the defence minister, Union home minister and Prime Minister stating that the Telangana government is willing to merge SCB with GHMC. I have already submitted representations on merger and closure of roads to the defence ministry and parliamentary standing committee on defence,” Revanth said. Revanth agreed that the merger of SCB areas into GHMC will certainly help in improving civic and other facilities in cantonment areas. But he also reiterated how the centre cannot merge the two unilaterally and will need a formal approval from the state, which should be backed by a resolution of the Cantonment Board. On complaints from resident welfare associations that Revanth has not been visiting the cantonment constituency as often, he said: “It is a misconception. The most number of my visits have been to the cantonment constituency. Though the central government stopped MPLAD funds due to Covid-19, I along with my friends and corporates spent crores of rupees and transformed a PHC into a 100-bed full-fledged Covid-19 hospital in SCB limits,” Revanth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-raise-the-merger-issue-in-parliament-again/articleshow/86714430.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Surat||Delay in admissions leaves Surat students in lurch||SURAT: Post the successive waves of the Covid-19, organizations — both private and government — are trying their best to get things back on track as soon as possible. But that does not seem to be the case with Veer Narmad South Gujarat (VNSGU). The administration of the VNSGU has shockingly adopted an indifferent attitude towards completing the admission process for the current academic session. The delay in getting their admissions confirmed will surely cost the students dear. The global pandemic has already impacted academic activities in the past 18 months. As the Covid cases began receding, the students were hoping for resumption of offline classes. But the biggest university of south Gujarat is yet to wind up admissions due to which the academic session is getting delayed. VNSGU started its admission process around one and half months back. But even after six weeks the process is far from over. Though the academic session hasn’t begun yet, the varsity has already announced that the first semester examinations of all the courses will have to be completed by December end. Now, the students are questioning that if the classes don’t begin on schedule how they will get time to prepare for the examinations. “I am receiving many complaints from students who are yet to get admissions. Even after two months the process is yet to complete. This will further impact the careers of students who are already facing several issues due to the pandemic,” said Bhavesh Rabari, former VNSGU syndicate member. The student wing of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has decided to protest against the VNSGU administration’s lethargic attitude. “We are going to stage a dharna at the university over the delayed admission process. The university has already announced dates for completion of the first semester while the academic session is yet to start,” said Kishan Ghori, secretary of Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Samiti, student wing of AAP. “I got admission in a different college and not in the one I had applied for. Despite multiple representations nobody is ready to address the issue,” said a student trying for admission in a post-graduation course in science. VNSGU’s decision to opt for a decentralized admission process this year has left many surprised. In the past, the centralized admission process proved efficient for the varsity. Students used to get admission on time and that too without visiting multiple colleges. VNSGU vice chancellor, K N Chavda, used to efficiently handle the centralised admissions when he was principal of an affiliated college. “We are trying to complete the admission at the earliest. The academic activity will start soon,” said Chavda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/delay-in-admissions-leaves-students-in-lurch/articleshow/86714416.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Lucknow||Greywater management: Way ahead to sustain water supply under Jal Jeevan Mission||By- Asad UmarIn the recent past, the country has seen numerous poignant images of water scarcity emerging from rural areas and witnessed desperate measures being taken in cities/towns running dry. However, with the launch of Jal Jeevan Mission, which aims to provide tap connection to every rural household by 2024, there is confidence to get assured and sustained access to safe water. This confidence is based on the fact that there is a strong political and administrative will to address the challenge, and adequate funding has been ensured. As per the latest data of the Ministry of Jal Shakti, significant progress has already been achieved since the launch of Jal Jeevan Mission in 2019 and 42% rural households are getting potable water through taps. Moreover, water conservation and greywater (all sources of domestic wastewater, excluding toilet wastewater) management remain top priority and the foundation of Jal Jeevan Mission is built on the success of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Rural India largely depends on groundwater to meet its drinking water and agricultural needs as 85% of rural water supply and over 64% of irrigation depends on groundwater. However, the estimates by the Central Groundwater Board show that the water table in most parts of the country has been declining every year, and if the trend continues, meeting the country’s agricultural and drinking water requirements will become a big challenge. The NITI Aayog report on ‘Composite Water Management Index (2018)’ underlines that over 600 million Indians face high to extreme water stress. Even Uttar Pradesh, which is a part of Indo-Gangetic plain and known for good rainfall and largescale groundwater potential, is also facing a dip in water table. There are 138 blocks which fall under semi-critical, critical, and overexploited categories which is quite alarming. Here, Jal Jeevan Mission presents a unique opportunity to prioritize source sustainability measures. UP, which also generates 9727 MLD wastewater (highest in the country) and accounts for almost 25% of the total wastewater generated, can significantly contribute towards minimizing water stress through reuse for non-potable purposes and groundwater recharge. Though greywater could be a source of contamination and health concerns but given India’s growing need for water, its efficient management could be an opportunity to minimize stress on freshwater resources. With the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission, a village with a population of 1,000, on an average generates 38000 litre greywater per day which could be a potential source of groundwater recharge. Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) recommends the use of only treated wastewater as a source of artificial groundwater recharge once it meets the standards. There are centralised and decentralised options which offer cost-effective treatment systems. While soak pits or kitchen gardens are suggested in households, larger community pits, waste stabilization ponds, Duckweed pond and constructed wetland could be viable options at community level. The SBM phase-II guideline also advocates for greywater management in villages alongside piped water supply facilities being provided/proposed under JJM. Going forward along with community engagement, panchayats (local governments) need to be empowered to plan with communities. A paradigm shift, as suggested under JJM, is the way forward to ensure clean, sustained piped water to all rural Indian citizens. Now is the time to do this. Thanks to Jal Jeevan Mission, the age of poor water supply systems can be a thing of distant past.

Confirming the development, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI on Saturday, “I have thanked the Centre for allocating more doses to the state this month. We certainly increased our vaccination in the last month and hoping to scale it up further. We even touched 15 lakh vaccinations in one day in early September. With more doses allocated, we are aiming to set this as daily target.” Additional chief secretary, health, Dr Pradeep Vyas said the state had received 1.8 crore Covishield doses and 39.74 lakh Covaxin doses as part of the allocation for October for the target population of 9.14 crore beneficiaries. The Maharashtra government has been demanding three crore doses from the Centre for the past three months to speed up vaccination. The state government had passed a resolution in the assembly to demand three crore doses from the Centre. “Against it, we have received at least two crore doses. It will help us scale up vaccination in October,” Tope said. The health minister said the state had completed administering over two-crore second doses of Covid vaccine in mid-September. So far, the state has vaccinated 8.27 crore beneficiaries. Of them, a total of 5.81 crore people has received the first dose of vaccine. As many as 2.46 crore (30% of Maharashtra’s population) have been completely vaccinated in the state. Tope said intensifying vaccination was the only way to arrest the spread of coronavirus infection. Officials stressed that the state had been assured that it would get increased vaccine supply from the Centre for the coming two months to scale up vaccination in view of the festivals. Citing Navratri and Diwali festivals ahead, Tope said, “We have to follow the Covid-19 protocols strictly and increase vaccination.” He said guidelines had been issued for Navratri also to ensure that there was a cap on the number of people attending functions with strict adherence to Covid protocols. The minister said only Ahmednagar district was currently showing a high weekly positivity rate (WPR) and the local authorities were assessing it. The recent cabinet note had shown Ahmednagar district’s WPR at 4.27% — the highest in the state. Maharashtra’s average WPR was pegged at 2.11%. The state Covid task force had earlier cautioned people that they should remember coronavirus had not gone and there should be strict adherence to Covid protocols amid the unlocking process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-to-get-2-2cr-vaccine-doses-from-centre-in-oct/articleshow/86716396.cms||Nisha Nambiar

On September 28, the burglars had broken into Malik Ornaments, broke the safe and stole 1.172 kg gold ornaments worth nearly Rs 52 lakh. Police recovered gold worth Rs 35 lakh from the accused Kamlesh Solanki, Vijay Baraiya, Ravi Solanki and Anil Parmar. The investigation was handed over to the city crime branch. “The three accused including mastermind Kamlesh Solanki are engaged in collecting dust from the gold market. After the burglary, they all went to Mumbai celebrate,” said V K Gadhvi, police inspector , crime branch. Parmar, a resident of Ahmedabad, helped others in the crime by managing new mobiles for them after the burglary. It was difficult for police to identify perpetrators as they took the CCTV cameras along with them. They had dumped the cameras in water near Ramnathpara after stealing gold. Cops then examined the footage of 50 CCTVs installed in the near-by areas, but the visuals were hazy due to night vision and heavy rain. Police then started examining the old records to identify the burglars who had adopted the same modus operandi earlier. Based on human intelligence, they raided their houses and shops and got to know that the trio had recently gone to Mumbai. A team of cops kept a watch and detained them before they entered the city. During questioning, the four confessed to the crime and handed over the melted gold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/four-arrested-for-rs-52-lakh-gold-burglary-in-rajkot-city/articleshow/86714465.cms||---
---||Surat||Gujarat: Weavers duped of Rs 150 crore annually, alleges FOGWA||SURAT: As if the recession caused by the pandemic wasn’t enough, the weaving unit owners have been hit hard by big-money frauds. For the first time the association of weavers Federation of Gujarat Weavers Welfare Association (FOGWA) has launched a campaign against organized cheating rackets. FOGWA alleged that these gangs are duping the weavers of around Rs 150 crore annually for the past few years. “In the past six months fraudsters have duped weavers of around Rs 100 crore in the city. We have exact details of frauds involving Rs 10 crore. FOGWA is gathering additional details and soon we will declare names of more firms and individuals who are duping the weavers,” said Ashok Jirawala, president, FOGWA. On Friday, FOGWA submitted a list of 57 textile firms and five brokers that are allegedly involved in cheating the weaving units to the police. FOGWA has demanded that the Economic Offence Cell of police take action against these fraudsters. FOGWA recently held a meeting on this issue which was attended by leaders of various industrial societies. In the meeting it was decided to expose these firms by declaring their names. “We were forced to declare the names as no legal actions were initiated against the culprits even after approaching the police,” Jirawala alleged. “Those involved in cheating initially win the trust of the weaver by making timely payments for the first few purchases. Once the weaver agrees to accept payment terms of over a month they purchase products worth crores of rupees from multiple suppliers and disappear,” said Jirawala. “It is a multi-crore racket and we have identified 20 brokers. These are not simple cases of cheating but pre-planned rackets,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/weavers-duped-of-rs-150cr-annually-alleges-fogwa/articleshow/86714528.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The research team from GITAM University has found that the hybrid nanomaterial that generates hyperthermia or high temperature can be successfully used to kill cancerous cells in the body, while keeping the healthy cells intact. The nanomaterial developed by GITAM-BARC team can also be used for security applications like detection of counterfeit currency and environmental applications like detection of harmful chemicals in water bodies. Research scholar Ramaswamy Sandeep Perala told TOI that the hybrid nanomaterial they have developed works better than the existing cancer therapies like chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In the existing therapies health cells are also affected along with the cancerous cells. But in the hybrid nanomaterial application, only the cancerous cells are affected while the normal cells remain in good health. The result of the research was published in peer-reviewed scientific publication, ACS Omega, published by the American Chemical Society. Venkata Nagendra Kumar Pinta served as the guide to Ramaswamy Sandeep. As part of the research Ramaswamy Sandeep used nanomaterial Yttrium vanadate plus holmium and Ytterbium ions and its hybrid containing super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, Yttrium vanadate, holmium and Ytterbium. When this hybrid nanomaterial was injected into the cancerous cells, it increases the temperature in the region by about five to eight degrees C. The normal body temperature is 37 degrees C (98.6 F). In the injected the region the temperature increases (hyperthermia) to 42 degrees C to 45 degrees C. At this temperature the cancerous cells are killed, while normal cells remain unaffected. “We have developed a single entity nanomaterial for multi-utility applications from cancer treatment to detection of fake money to identification of heavy metals in environment. It has promising potentiality in luminescence properties, anticounterfeiting and hyperthermia applications,” Sandeep said, adding that chemotherapy and radiotherapy have advantages, but they come with some unwanted disadvantages to human life. The researchers have tied up with BARC to use hyperthermia instrument and succeeded in coming up with good results in treating cancers by using hybrid nanomaterial by attaining hyperthermia temperature of 42-45 °C in a notable time, where the effect on normal cell lines is negligible. The hybrid nanomaterial works better than the existing cancer therapies like chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In this application, only the cancerous cells are affected while the normal cells remain in good health, said Research scholar Ramaswamy Sandeep Perala||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gitam-barc-team-develops-novel-hybrid-nanomaterial-to-treat-cancers/articleshow/86714504.cms||Syed Akbar

He posed as an orthopaedic surgeon from the UK, serving with the UN in Yemen. The woman filed a complaint with the cybercrime police on Friday against four people who had identified themselves as Arav Yash Acharya, Yash Acharya, Dhwani Shrivastav, and Yana Gupta. The complainant said that she had created a profile on a matrimonial website in April. She said she was contacted by Arav who shared a picture of his identity card. Satisfied with his status, she decided to marry him. She said that Yash, a man that Arav had projected as his father, gave his blessings. Arav assured her that he would return to the UK and bring his father to India for the wedding. At this stage, the supposed surgeon started making his surgical strikes at the woman’s bank account. He first told her to send money to his agent to book a flight ticket to the UK. He cited poor connectivity in Yemen. The complainant could initially send only $3,000 (about Rs 2.22 lakh) to the agent. Arav asked her to send the remaining Rs 3.20 lakh to Dhwani, who he said was his relative in India. He said Dhwani will send the amount to his agent. The complainant did so, still trusting Arav. Later, Arav called the complainant and said that since he was discontinuing his job midway, he has to pay Rs 2.56 lakh penalty. His persuasively tragic tale made the complainant send that money to Dhwani. Then on June 12, Arav told the complainant that he had been detained at the Turkey airport in a fake money laundering case. He said he had to pay Rs 7.5 lakh for his release.

The senior advocate of the Supreme Court was in Ahmedabad to speak on the subject ‘India in the age of Modi’ at the Girish Patel Memorial Lecture. Sibal was repeatedly questioned on his recent call for election in the party and for internal reforms, but he flatly declined to elaborate on the issue. Instead the member of the so-called G-23 group said, “I don’t know whether the party is ready for reforms, but I can only voice my own sentiments.” However, Sibal said that his party is speaking out and its leader Rahul Gandhi too is speaking out against the government, which is good. He, however, refused to answer questions on various party decisions including the change of guard in Punjab and said that he was not involved in the process, and question should be asked to those who handle the house of Congress. When asked whether the Congress has lost the ‘middle ground’ in the present game of politics, Sibal said that the present BJP government has changed the rules of the game. “The democracy is like cricket which is played by the rules of the game. Now, the government has all the umpires with it. ED (Enforcement Directorate) is the umpire, CBI is the umpire, they try to influence courts. They have captured the system. We (Congress) have not lost the middle ground. With the power in their hand, with demonetisation BJP becoming the richest party in the world, there is no match if the umpire is in its pocket.” He further said, “What will the opposition do if you don’t play by the rules of the game. If anybody raises his voice, the government uses sedition weapon against him.” Sibal also said that Prime Minister Modi does not stand for the principles of Mahatma Gandhi, that he stands mute spectator when there are cases of lynching and violence being reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/modi-govt-has-changed-rules-of-game-sibal/articleshow/86714508.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Organizers seek cop help to fix crowd flow route||Kolkata: A day after Calcutta High Court barred entry of visitors into Durga Puja pandals owing to the pandemic, several Puja organizers went back to the drawing board to revise the route for flow of the crowd, demarcate the point where barricading will be done and identify members who will be present inside the pandal. Many smaller pujas and those located inside inaccessible lanes said they will collaborate with local police to manage the crowd to prevent any bottleneck in front of the pandal. Many said they were expecting some sort of guidelines. “We have barricaded in such a manner that people cannot go within 10m of the pandal. We did it today as we are in the process of providing finishing touches. It will also give an idea on how to plan flow of visitors,” said Sanjay Majumdar, secretary of Thakurpukur SB Park Sarbajanin. “We were already anticipating that there might be some restrictions on entry of people inside the pandal this year too, so we had planned accordingly. But since our puja is in a park inside a lane, we will need cop help for traffic management and movement of visitors because last year, we observed people have a tendency to stop in front of the pandal,” said Somen Dutta, general secretary of Kashi Bose Lane Duga Puja Committee. Many Puja committees have already touched base with local police to demarcate a proper route for the movement of the visitors. “We learnt the lesson last year and were prepared this time. We have meeting with local police who will help us make a proper channel with the help of guardrails for entry and exit of visitors,” said Sandipan Banerjee, convenor of Behala Nutan Dal. Members of most Durga Puja committees said they had planned the pandal in such a manner that people can view the deity from a distance. “So we will not have to alter the structure of the pandal but crowd management needs to be looked into because last year people would stop in front of the pandal to have a proper view and that would slow down the movement,” said Biplab Pal, general secretary of Posta Durga Puja Samity. Many Puja organizers also said they will review if they will hold the opening ceremony or not. “Court order clearly restricts the number of people inside the pandal. If the opening ceremony is held, a lot of people will assemble but we do not want to take any chance. So we are going to review the decision,” said Ashok Kumar Ojha, joint secretary of Mohammad Ali Park Durga Puja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/organizers-seek-cop-help-to-fix-crowd-flow-route/articleshow/86714540.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Pune||Optimism and caution as theatres prepare to welcome patrons back||Pune: As theatres in the state gear up for reopening next month and wait for standard operating procedures (SOPs) from the state government, practitioners in the field are waiting with both a sense of optimism and caution, given the false dawn late last year and early this year. Theatre owners and producers waited for over a month to resume plays and performances in large theatres last year after the state government allowed those spaces to reopen in November 2020. With the second wave, theatres and other performance spaces were ordered shut again in March 2021. Despite thousands being out of work, many in the industry said that they will wait out the initial period and wish for government support for audiences to gain confidence before heading back to the theatres. “People need confidence that it is safe to go back to the theatres. The government can help by organising free shows, such as drama or film festival. Otherwise, not too many producers would be willing to restart the shows, because they would be concerned about the viability. However, we will await the SOPs from the state government,” said Meghraj Raje Bhosale, president, Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Natya Parishad, Pune. Others have already drawn up plans to go back to the stage, especially those whose initial comeback plans were thwarted by the second wave of the pandemic. “Most industries have largely worked out and adjusted to Covid-19. The same will also happen to theatre, too. For the limited months we could work last year, and in the beginning of this year, we did fairly well. Now, we plan to wrap up our online performances by the end of October and go back to the stage in November. I think most of us will grab the opportunity to go back to live performances,” said Raveesh Jaiswal, a theatre producer and actor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/optimism-and-caution-as-theatres-prepare-to-welcome-patrons-back/articleshow/86716508.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The VWSCs are a key component of implementing the JJM, which aims to provide tap water connections to all rural households by 2024 He underlined how the JJM was in sync with Mahatma Gandhi’s dream of ‘Gram Swaraj’ (village self-governance). The PM launched a dedication fund to tap private donors to give a boost to the Mission through public participation, and released a mobile App for improving awareness among stakeholders and for greater transparency and accountability of schemes under the JJM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jal-jeevan-mission-driven-by-villages-women-pm/articleshow/86719906.cms||---

At the event police’s enforcement of the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime (GUJCTOC) Act was appreciated by principal district judge V K Vyas. “Criminals involved in organised crime fear getting involved in criminal activities due to strict enforcement of GujCTOC by Surat police.

I found that many serious crimes are taking place but the detection is also done effectively by police,” said Vyas. Describing his observation about the presence of associates of GujCTOC accused in court campus Vyas said, “I noticed that people known to these accused come to court campus during the hearing of the cases. We should ensure that any incident like Rohini court does not take place.” Describing it as a unique event, city police commissioner Ajay Tomar said, “For the first time police, prosecutors, judges, collector and other senior government officials are present on the same dais.

---||Jaipur||My govt will complete its full term & get repeated: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Fluttering the dovecotes, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday suggested he would not only complete the full five-year term but would also head the next Congress government after the 2023 state elections. Gehlot claimed there was no anti-incumbency against his government so far, even though 18 of the past 31 months went fighting corona and elections. Making a public appearance after a gap of several months since the second Covid wave and undergoing angioplasty in September, 70-year-old Gehlot said he was fully fit now and would be active for the next 15-20 years even if that made some people unhappy. The CM’s remarks were aimed at his rivals both in BJP and Congress. In BJP, leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria has been claiming that the Gehlot government would be unable to complete its term, while in Congress his former deputy Sachin Pilot has been vying for the CM post. Speaking at the launch of a special government drive related to solving people’s land ownership problems on the Gandhi Jayanti, Gehlot said, “I will make (Shanti) Dhariwal ji minister of the same department (urban housing and development). I’m declaring his portfolio today itself. He will be the UDH minister for the fourth time.” Gehlot reminded people that Dhariwal has been the UDH minister in all his three terms as the CM. Gehlot’s statement made at the programme that was watched live across the state implied that he would be the chief minister for the fourth time and would be distributing portfolios once again. The event was held at the chief minister’s residence in the presence of ministers, MLAs and bureaucrats. Questioning the media for linking ongoing political developments in Punjab with Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, the chief minister alleged it was being done to please Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. He claimed the media houses get nightmares about Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax searches and hence target Congress governments. “Entire Gujarat cabinet was changed overnight but the media did not question it,” said Gehlot. Gehlot attributed his government’s losses in the past—reduced to 56 seats in 2003 and to 21 seats in 2013—to state employees’ strike and Modi wave, respectively. “But this time the public mood is in our favour,” he claimed. Taking potshots at the bureaucracy, Gehlot said, “They are the first to stop work and speculate if the government will survive or fall.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/my-govt-will-complete-its-fullterm-get-repeated-raj-cm/articleshow/86718284.cms||Bhanupratap Singh
---||Pune||Shirdi airport gears up for devotees as shrine to open||Pune: Flights to the Shirdi airport are set to resume with the state government allowing religious places to reopen from October 7. A Shirdi airport official said on Saturday an airline will start two daily flights — one to Delhi and another to Chennai — from October 10. “Another carrier will operate two flights to Hyderabad and Delhi from October 15, but these will not be daily. Another daily flight from Delhi is expected to start from November 1,” said the official of the airport, which is run by the Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) Limited. According to another official, flight movements are expected to increase with the temple reopening. “If everything goes well, we expect to reach pre-pandemic operational levels in five to six months. The infrastructure is ready and the runway has been extended along with night landing facility. However, both these need the approval of the DGCA,” said the official, adding that the airport needs flights. All flights to/from Shirdi were stopped since April 2021 amid the second wave of the pandemic. Airport sources said losses of Rs50 lakh per day have been incurred since the outbreak of the pandemic and the total amount is estimated at 8.5 crore. Before the pandemic hit, the airport witnessed 28 scheduled flights and a daily passenger traffic of 5,000. In line with experts saying that airport authorities must think about ways to earn revenue even when the Saibaba temple is shut, the MADC recently announced the development of a city around the airport. The proposed city, named ASHA, will be on the lines of Naina (Navi Mumbai Airport Influenced Notified Area), state government officials had said, adding that around 1,600 hectares of land around the airport will be acquired.  “We are thinking of other ways to ensure the airport earns revenue even in grim times,” an MADC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shirdi-airport-gears-up-for-devotees-as-shrine-to-open/articleshow/86716533.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Goa||Canacona projects were possible with support from landlords: Isidore||Poinguinim: After laying the foundation for five different projects in Canacona worth Rs 51.8 lakh, mostly along the Manohar Parrikar Canacona bypass road, deputy speaker and Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes said the projects were possible only because the landlords showed interest and gave sufficient land for the projects. The developmental works involved construction of gutter and access along the toe of the bypass road alignment, construction of a side drain at Mashem where rain water entered houses earlier, construction of toe-wall to protect the existing boundary at Mashem, construction of a service road and a drain at Ganebhag near Talpona and construction of a gutter to prevent water from entering residential houses at Patnem in the municipal jurisdiction. Stating that it was the “generosity of the landlords in allowing the government to carry out development works”, Fernandes expressed happiness and gratitude, saying that state government can do a lot of projects if landlords do not object to such initiatives. While locals thanked Fernandes for taking up their demands which they said were initially ignored by highway authorities, the MLA acknowledged the support from landlords. Fernandes said the highway officials did not understand the woes faced by locals due to hardships of constructing bridges along highways. Locals said that the construction on the expressway had caused considerable access problems due to debris and stagnant water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/canacona-projects-were-possible-with-support-from-landlords-isidore/articleshow/86718319.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Grandeur takes a back seat, focus shifts to tradition after Covid curbs||KOLKATA: The organizers of the city's big-budget Pujas have decided to shun grandeur and return to tradition and focus on rituals to hold a puja with piety and devotion following the ban on entry of visitors into pandals. Instead of competing with each other in respect of pandal decoration, theme lighting or simply showing the power of ‘money’, organizers of several big-budget Pujas have cut their budget and concentrated on traditions associated with Bengal’s biggest festival. State’s panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee, who is the president of Ekdalia Evergreen Puja committee, is preparing to check a special Benarasi saree at a north Kolkata-based store for a 25-ft Durga idol to be worshipped during the four-day festival at the Ballygunge pandal. “An order was placed with a city-based businessman to prepare a special Benarasi saree for our tall Durga idol from Benaras. The saree has landed in Kolkata and we are eagerly waiting to have a look,” Mukherjee said. While worshipping mother Goddess according to tradition, the Ekdalia Evergreen puja committee will offer mouth-watering Bhog to Durga and her family. The bhog on Asthmi will be a complete food package: khichuri, bansanti pulao, five types of vegetable fries, three special vegetable dishes, pineapple chutney and desert. Organizers of College Square Sarbojanin Durgatsav Committee have drastically cut its budget on pandal and instead concentrated more on tradition relating to puja. “We have already booked priests from a famous Sanskrit academy in Hatibagan. These priests, well conversant with the Durga Puja rituals and representatives of one of the oldest Sanskrit schools, will take our puja to a great height, we all believe,” said Bikash Majumdar, the chief organizer of the puja committee. The group of priests will also perform Kumari puja, Majumdar added. This apart, the committee will also exhibit lighting around the square. “We won’t dishearten the visitors as we know they can’t enter our pandal. We will entertain them through our elaborate lighting around the square,” Majumdar said. The organizers of Santosh Mitra Square (Lebutala Park) are also concentrating on performing a grand Kumari Puja. Besides the presence of a group of priests, here a police officer well-versed with the puja rituals will perform the puja, said Pradip Ghosh, the president of the puja committee. Ghosh said their 15-ft tall Durga idol will be adorned with precious but traditional gold ornaments. “We are attaching more importance to stick to tradition associated with the pujas. Accordingly, we have stopped spending unnecessarily on pandal decoration or lighting. Instead, we will concentrate more on traditional pujas,” Ghosh said. Tridhara puja committee, known for its generous spending on pandal and lighting, has decided to do away with pomp. The committee will now concentrate on the traditional rituals during the four-day festival. “Keeping in mind a predicted third wave, this year our slogan is ‘We believe in tradition not in grandeur’. Accordingly, we have planned our entire programme — from Sasthi to Dashami,” said president of the puja committee Debasis Kumar. The committee has roped in a group of dhakis from several districts who would perform during the pujas to make it a grand event. Besides, the committee has a group of priests who will be performing pujas each day keeping in mind the tradition associated with the puja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/grandeur-takes-a-back-seat-focus-shifts-to-tradition-after-covid-curbs/articleshow/86714564.cms||Saikat Ray

The issue was discussed during a high-level meeting chaired by the advisor to the administrator a few days back. MC officials informed officials of the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) about the situation. A discussion was held on the effects of the waste water on the ground and the MC proposed strict action. After taking the opinion of senior officers, the adviser decided to give one month time to residents. “Since these are residential properties with large human habitation, their water supply cannot be disconnected in such a short time. The UT wants to give them optimum time to shift their lines from storm drainage to sewage. Therefore, it was decided to give them some more time so that residents can cooperate with the authorities and do the needful,” sources said. The move comes ahead of the MC elections scheduled for December. Thirteen villages were transferred to the Chandigarh MC a few years back and a survey is being conducted in these. “We will cover all the villages one by one and inspect them properly to check disposal of their waste water,” sources said. Box: Works allotted Since the civic body authority has received dedicated funds for development of 13 villages transferred to the MC from UT administration, the MC engineering department has allotted majority of the works. Initially, works of sewage, storm and water supply line was allotted with an amount of around Rs 50 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/residents-get-another-month-to-drain-waste-water-into-sewage-line/articleshow/86714627.cms||Deepak Yadav

The construction of the house was completed within 47 days, and handed over to the family on Saturday, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti. The house is located in Irde-Bettampady, a small village in Puttur taluk. In July, when Government High School, Irde-Uppalige headmaster K Narayan visited the house of Mokshitha as part of the ‘Vidyarthi Mane Man Beti’ initiative, he saw the student staying in a thatched hut, covered with tarpaulin to protect from rain. The house of Mokshitha, a class X student, and the daughter of Kamala and late Kepu, had no electricity. Her father died eight years ago, and mother rolled beedis and worked as a daily wage labourer to make ends meet. “Narayan shared with me the details about the student’s plight. We started looking for a solution to the issue, so that the student gets a permanent roof over her head. We contacted many like-minded donors and they readily agreed to help,” said C Lokesh, BEO, Puttur. He said that sponsors for the house included philanthropists and associations. The foundation for the house was laid on August 15, and it was completed in 47 days. The house is spread over 570 sq ft, and has a bedroom, drawing room, kitchen and veranda. Rotary Yuva Puttur has come forward to build a washroom for the family. “This initiative is an inspiration to many to do good for others in a small way,” said Ravindra Nelyadi, a retired teacher who was part of the project. Headmaster Narayan said that Mokshitha aims to clear the SSLC examination with distinction. Puttur MLA Sanjeeva Matandoor inaugurated the house and handed it over to the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/funds-pooled-to-gift-house-to-underprivileged-student/articleshow/86717444.cms||---

The farmers’ protest at the border for almost a year now has singed him. He used to take home Rs 500-1,000 daily before the protesters converged on the border in November last year. Right now, he earns Rs 100 a day if he is lucky, Rs 200 at most, because work has ground to a halt due to the agriculturists’ sit-in. Daily-wage earners and shop owners are facing the brunt of the inactivity caused by the farmers squatting in the locality and hampering road movement. Welder Nadeem, for instance, said "Kaam to hai hi nahi (there is absolutely no work). I was getting Rs 18,000 a month earlier. Now I don’t get customers for even a week at a stretch.” On Friday, the Supreme Court expressed concern at the continuing blockade of roads in and around Delhi by the farmers agitating against three central legislations, and shopkeepers and workers agreed on Saturday that the blockade had to end if the residents of the border localities were to survive. Manish Khatri has three outlets for branded clothes at Singhu border. He claimed a loss of Rs 1 crore due to the blockade. "I had to shut down one of my showrooms," he said. His brother, Rahul, added they had to lay off 5-7 employees because they were unable to pay their salaries. “We have also cut pays by 30-40% because our sales have been hit," Rahul said. Deepak, an employee, did agree and said there were days when no customers came. "The agitation shouldn’t continue,” he asserted. On Saturday afternoon, a few vehicles slowly negotiated the muddy, potholed highway. Traffic is almost non-existent. Raju, a local, had two empty buckets in his hands. “Earlier, I used to get water bottles at my doorstep, but the cans don’t come now and I have to go to the village for water,” he said. “Look at the condition of the road.” Arvind Chaudhary owns a factory making ventilation parts. “I can’t even calculate the losses after the blockade,” he said. “Small trucks that charged Rs 500 for delivery services today ask for Rs 3,000 for the same work,” he said. A mall nearby is deserted. The protesters use the parking lot of the mall for washing clothes and utensils. Satendar Singh, who claimed to be the owner of a petrol pump, declared he had suffered a loss of over Rs 1.5 crore in the past few months. “Business is down Rs 35,000 from normal every day,” he said. According to him, due to the traffic snarls arising from the protest, people cannot drive to the petrol pump and come carrying jars. “They ask us for petrol in plastic drums and containers. If we refuse, arguments break out, resulting sometimes in scuffles," he revealed. Meanwhile, many commuters also spoke about the tough time they were facing due to the farmers’ refusal to vacate the highway. "Every day, just because of this blockade, I have to travel an hour to reach my shop,” said one of them. “The distance of my shop is otherwise just 20 minutes from my home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farm-stir-escalates-woes-at-singhu/articleshow/86716630.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Pune||Driven by high-value deals, second quarter property registrations in Maharashtra top 2019||PUNE: The registration of properties across Maharashtra in the second quarter of the ongoing financial year has outpaced the number of registrations in the corresponding quarter in the pre-pandemic 2019-20 fiscal. As per data available with the state registration department, Rs7,507 crore was collected in revenue during the July-September quarter, slightly higher than the Rs7,112 crore earned during the same period in 2019. Registrations are the largest source of revenue for the state exchequer. The state’s inspector-general of registration and stamps, Shravan Hardikar, told TOI that high-value registrations during the second quarter primarily helped boost revenue. “We registered many government projects, mortgages and even land transactions of a higher value,” Hardikar said, adding, “Smaller transactions such as gift deeds and leave and license agreements have seen a decrease.” Officials said they were expecting increased registrations and revenue this month too, with the impending rollout of the e-registration facility — software that would allow developers register properties right from their offices. Senior government officials, however, pointed out that there were no sops this year, such as reduction in stamp duty that was announced last year, to boost revenue and registrations. Despite this, with the festive season around the corner, developers said they were expecting an increase in registrations. State Credai president Sunil Furde said there was a positive sentiment among developers and buyers, which has buoyed the market. “Aided by lessons from last year, realtors are managing to cope better in the aftermath of the second wave, with relatively less stringent restrictions. The aggressive vaccination strategy in the state too has helped,” Furde said. He said they had sought sops — on the lines of the stamp duty reduction this year too and were awaiting a positive response from the government. A recent survey by real estate consultant Anarock stated that, catalysed by the second wave, home buyers were increasingly looking to purchase properties in the range of Rs 90 lakh to Rs 2.5 crore, rather than in the affordable segment. While 35% favoured properties priced between Rs45 lakh and Rs90 lakh, 27% preferred affordable housing. In the previous quarter, nearly 36% had been in favour of budget homes, the report stated. Rollout of software for e-registration next week The state registration department will roll out software next week that would allow developers to register properties right from their offices. The software is being tested right now with the help of 350 developers, most of them from Pune and Mumbai. Hardikar on Saturday said operators and developers will be trained in using the software, which is aimed at streamlining the entire process. “From the coming week, the process can commence. This will enable more developers to come forward and also reduce footfalls at the registration offices,” Hardikar further added. Pune Credai president Anil Pharande said the software will ease the entire process of registration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/driven-by-high-value-deals-q2-property-regns-in-state-top-2019/articleshow/86716583.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The NABL-approved lab test report mentions low pungency, sweet taste, ‘no tear’ factor, low pyruvic acid, high protein, fat and fibre content, besides high antioxidant compounds (quercetin),” said Professor Jitendra Kadam, who proved the geographical difference of the white onion. Prof Kadam, who is from the spices and medicinal plants department of the Dr Balasaheb Sawant Konkan Krishi Vidyapeeth (DBSKKV) in Dapoli, along with two of his students, took interest in getting the GI tag in 2018. “It boosts immunity, helps with insomnia, blood cleaning, blood pressure and heat-related ailments,” said Karuna Navalkar, whose efforts were specially mentioned during the GI tag process. Local farmers have preserved the seed for over two centuries. The onion is also mentioned in a government gazette published in 1883.  “The GI application was processed by the DBSKKV-Dapoli through a farmers’ association ‘Alibag Pandhra Kanda Shetkari Utpadak Gat’ and the state agriculture department. A six-member committee of Geographical Indication Registry approved it on September 29. It will be published in the Geographical Indications Journal,” added Kadam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/alibaug-white-onion-gets-gi-tag-for-health-benefits/articleshow/86718322.cms||Umesh K Parida

The civic body has estimated Rs 11. 90 crore to construct the structure. A day before chief minister Ashok Gehlot laid the foundation stone, the JDA appointed the firm S S Udhyog. Gehlot, while laying the stone of the project, said, “After seeking the advise of the Gandhian advisory committee, constituted for this project, our government has decided to reduce budget to half. The museum will be a milestone in connecting new generation with ideology of Gandhi.” The total area of the museum in 16,000 square metre, out of which only 30% area will be utilized for construction, while plantation will be carried out in the remaining area after spending approximately Rs 55 crore. “The museum will be constructed in three phases. The structural design, content, artifacts and literature on Gandhi will be decided by the 11-member committee constituted for the issue.” On the Central Park land in Kanak Bhawan, the state government also inaugurated the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Governance and Social Sciences on Saturday. The JDA had taken possession of Lakshmi Vilas Hotel, Kanak Bhawan and a horse stable at Central Park, spread across nearly 35,000sqm, following a Supreme Court order on May 5. According to officials, Lakshmi Vilas Palace and the adjoining marriage garden together occupy an area of about 18,000sqm. The previous BJP government had decided to auction Lakshmi Vilas Palace, which had been turned into a hotel, to the hospitality industry after it was acquired by the JDA, sources said. This was based on a recommendation by a three-member committee constituted to define the usage of prime land at the Central Park. However, the project did not see the light of the day after the government changed. The new Congress government decided on a multi-crore project dedicated to Gandhi in the heart of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-lays-foundation-stone-for-gandhi-museum-co-to-finish-work-in-9-mths/articleshow/86718303.cms||---

---||Delhi||Health shield: 40-plus Delhi Police officers to undergo check-up||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police officers above the age of 40 years will undergo a mandatory annual preventive health check-up, as ordered by police commissioner Rakesh Asthana. The decision came after the police chief spoke to several senior officers about the health of the personnel in the force. Given the Covid pandemic and the working life of the policemen, the decision has been met with appreciation down the ranks. As per the standard operating procedures issued by Asthana on Friday, police personnel from the rank of multi-tasking staffers to DANIPS-cadre officers above the age of 40 years will undergo an annual health check for early detection of diseases so timely curative measures can be initiated. “Delhi Police personnel while performing their duties for long hours under tiring circumstances suffer from occupational health issues and lifestyle-related diseases. Suboptimal health status has an adverse impact on policing,” said the SOP.  “Keeping in view the prevailing health scenario, there is immense need for maintaining requisite fitness and alertness amongst police officers by implementing an annual health check-up scheme for operational staff of Delhi above the age of 40 years.” Around 119 police officers have died due to Covid, with at least 7,000 testing positive and surviving. The objective behind the scheme is to ensure ailments in police personnel are detected early, not only for medical treatment, but also to help in their overall health development. “Even during the pandemic, health check-ups were organised regularly,” said a police officer. "The mandatory health check-ups will not only boost the morale of the force but also allow treatment for ailments well in time.” Under the SOP, each head of office (HOO) and unit will ensure smooth implementation of the scheme.  “The HOOs will identify CGHS-empanelled hospitals in their respective jurisdictions. An ACP in each unit, as nodal officer, shall ensure the list of such police personnel above the age of 40 who would be sent for medical examination on the prescribed dates to the identified hospitals,” the instructions read.  “The nodal officer will maintain a separate register exclusively for this scheme and maintain up to date information for perusal of senior officers.” Apart from this, an annual calendar for the health check-up is to be finalised by each district and unit between April 1 and December 31 of the calendar year. If any officer cannot go for a medical check-up on a specified day for any reason, be it health or other preoccupations, they are to be allotted another date to get it done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/health-shield-40-cops-in-the-capital-to-undergo-check-up/articleshow/86718767.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Residents upset with loss of garden for air quality monitoring station||Hubballi: Residents of Lingaraj Nagar in Hubballi have taken up cudgels against the proposed plan to instal an air quality monitoring station on a 20ftx20ft plot, which the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) had pledged for the creation of a small garden. Given the plot’s dimensions, residents are certain that, should the station be built on the site, the garden that they have nurtured will become the casualty. Lingaraj Nagar resident R Rajendran Iyer, a marketing professional, pointed out that they had constructed a compound around the plot where the flowers and trees of the garden now bloomed. “If the HDMC decided to use a fourth of the site for the station, nothing but the two large neem trees, which occupy nearly a third of the site, will be left of the garden. This was not the HDMC’s first choice to house the station. Residents of another locality opposed having the station in a garden there, not to mention political pressure,” Iyer told TOI. Dr Tejaswini Patil, also a resident of Lingaraj Nagar, sought to remind the HDMC that the norms clearly stipulated that not more than 5% of the plot could be allotted for other purposes. “It was us, the residents who planted and nurtured the trees in the garden. But some of them have been axed. This is both unfair and unjust,” she said. Fellow Lingaraj Nagar resident Santosh Shali said that neither HDMC nor the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) had divulged any information about the station. “We do not what sort of device is being installed. Nor do we know if it will be safe. They came in with earthmoving machines and started digging up the garden,” he rued. Retired principal Prof CD Patil pointed to the abundant open spaces under HDMC’s purview that could be used for the housing of the air quality monitoring station. “Instead, they are seeking to destroy a garden. Officials must reconsider their decision. We have been repeatedly requesting them to shift the station elsewhere, but our pleas have gone unacknowledged,” Prof Patil said. HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said that officials had tried to convince the residents. “But they are not listening to us. They are suggesting another location, but this place is surrounded by trees, which makes it unsuitable to house the air quality monitoring station, since it will result in the readings being inaccurate. The station is being installed under the Centre’s ‘Clean Air’ initiative. We will, however, hold a public consultation meeting,” Itnal said. KSPCB senior environment officer Shobha Pol, however, said that the objective behind installing the station was to get a clear idea of the quality of air. “The station will provide data on the contents of the air, which will also prove beneficial to the residents. We can assure the residents that it will not be a source of nuisance. The HDMC is lending us this space at the behest of the Dharwad deputy commissioner,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/residents-upset-with-loss-of-garden-for-air-quality-monitoring-station/articleshow/86715640.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Exhibitions featuring garments, jewellery, home décor and gift items are attracting a lot of attention from citizens. “We had organised an online exhibition last year, but the response was not good. On-ground events generate more sales than online ones ahead of the festive season. We will allow entry to fully-vaccinated visitors only,” said entrepreneur Sharmila Chauhan, who will participate in an exhibition to be held next weekend. Event organisers are making the most of the national holidays as they kick-start their events. “We organised an exhibition on October 2, which is a national holiday, so that working professionals and their families can enjoy shopping for Diwali, Durga Puja etc. We organised the exhibition in an open space where social distancing could be ensured,” said Somnath Adheswar, an event organiser. Rahul Jajaria, a gifting solutions entrepreneur, who has a stall at an exhibition in Wakad over the October 9-10 weekend, said, “Many new products have come keeping the pandemic in mind. People are gifting masks, sanitizer sets, and so on.” Manisha Sethia, resident of Kharadi and an avid shopper, said, “My mother-in-law and I used to look forward to these exhibitions every year. We did not do much online shopping last year because there were curbs on celebrations. We did not visit relatives or friends, attended or organised any party, and just remained indoors. This year, I hope exhibitions will have new stocks and many varieties of products.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/exhibitions-draw-festive-shoppers-ahead-of-durga-puja-diwali/articleshow/86716623.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu youth pedals his way to Khardung La on borrowed bike||COIMBATORE: Visiting Khardung La in Ladakh, one of the highest motorable roads, is every biker’s dream. But it takes hard work, courage and perseverance to conquer the frozen mountain pass on a bicycle, says N Ajmal of Mettur in Podanur here, who pedalled 3,500km to reach the place. Ajmal, 25, son of a forklift operator, had to discontinue an engineering diploma course as he was not be able to pay the fees. He took up carpentry to support his family and started YouTube channel ‘backpack tamizha’ nine months ago. “I wanted to show the world that money and sophisticated vehicles are not required to live one’s dream,” Ajmal, who started the arduous journey on July 25 on a bicycle borrowed from a friend, told TOI. “I left my house with just Rs 6,000. It would have cost me Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 to buy a new bicycle.” “Many passersby stopped by and inquired about my journey. They felt happy that I am doing something that they could not do despite having the wherewithal to do it. They offered money, but I humbly refused,” he said. “Many people offered me food and accommodation. I rested in houses of strangers, in my tent and even star hotels, thanks to good people. But I will always cherish the times I spent with a nomadic people in Maharashtra. They prepared roti specially for me and served with love and warmth.” Ajmal reached Khardung La, at an elevation of 17,582ft above sea level, on Wednesday noon after 66 days. “As the final leg of the 40km stretch connecting Leh and Khardung La is steep, I decided to push the cycle instead of pedalling.” “While many people discouraged me, grit and determination helped me to reach the place on a cycle.

While the building housed 12 apartments, only two on the ground floor and one on the first floor were occupied. Luckily, the occupants were outside when the balcony and staircase landing of the building collapsed.The TNHB Colony houses 960 apartments in total and most of them are in a dilapidated condition. They were built in 1984. Half of the houses are still occupied, despite the city corporation issuing the residents notices to vacate, as the units are unfit for living.A TNHB official said in the damaged A wing of the building, houses were rented out to tenants. He said most of the house owners had moved out over the years after the units were damaged and became unliveable.Pointing out that there were five resident associations in the colony, the official said lack of consensus among them was delaying the process to demolish the houses and rebuild them.R Muthu Kumar, coordinator, joint action committee of the resident association, said talks were on with TNHB to demolish the buildings. He said TNHB had proposed to construct five-storeyed buildings after razing down the existing three-storeyed buildings, as it would be easy for TNHB to recover the cost of construction by selling the extra units.Former Singanallur MLA N Karthik said housing and urban development minister S Muthusamy, who had visited the colony two months ago, had assured to build new houses for the people with private partnership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/part-of-singanallur-housing-unit-collapses-in-heavy-rain/articleshow/86716631.cms||---

So far, no one from MSU or any other university of Gujarat has written and published a physics textbook of international standard and that too in a complex subject like quantum mechanics. “Writing a textbook of international standard is the most difficult task for physics teachers or researchers. That is the reason why no teacher from Gujarat has published an international recognised textbook in this subject,” said Sharma, 64, who embarked on the task after retiring from MSU. “Most textbooks currently in use are of foreign authors. Students find it difficult to follow these textbooks of foreign authors because of language difficulties and lack of elaborate explanation of mathematical formulas/ derivatives that foreign authors use,” said Sharma, whose textbook has been published by renowned publishers of books and journals – the CRC press (Taylor & Francis publication group, USA). Sharma has taught multiple courses on quantum mechanics during 33 years of teaching and 40 years of research career at MSU and Jiwaji University, Gwalior, as a regular teacher and subject expert at other universities. “My interaction with students while teaching quantum mechanics and guiding them for post-graduate, master of philosophy dissertations and for PhD degrees made me realize that vast majority of students in Indian universities lag behind in understanding quantum mechanics compared to students in US, Europe and other developed countries,” said Sharma, adding that over the past 2-3 decades, quantum mechanics has also continually evolved as a subject.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/quantum-leap-for-ex-msu-dean-work-goes-global/articleshow/86714718.cms||Prashant Rupera

---||Coimbatore||DMK strongman Veerapandi Arumugam’s son dies at 57||Salem: Senior DMK functionary Veerapandi A Raja, son of the party veteran and Salem strongman the late Veerapandi Arumugam, died of cardiac arrest at his house in Poolavari here on the occasion of his birthday on Saturday. He was 57.Raja’s death came as a shock to his supporters, who were planning to celebrate his birthday in a grand manner. While expressing grief over Raja’s death, chief minister M K Stalin said it wasn't the death of a single man. “A pillar has fallen. He will continue to live in every DMK cadre’s mind. My deepest condolences to Raja’s family members and the party cadres.” Stalin said Raja had served the party like a warrior along with his father Veerapandi Arumugam. “He could woo anyone with his soft nature. The party could entrust him with any task, as we were sure they would be done. I had met him on Wednesday. I am speechless. Thalaivar Kalaignar couldn’t stand the loss of Raja’s father and had wept inconsolably at the hospital entrance. Now, we have lost Raja at a young age. I don’t know how to console his family,” he said as he failed to hide his emotions. Raja, who joined the DMK in 1982, had held several key positions in the party, including that of the youth wing district organizer and district secretary. He was an MLA too. He had contested the 2006 assembly poll from Veerapandi and won. Lately, he was serving as a member of the party’s election working committee. According to a family member, Raja was getting ready to go out and garland his father’s statue in the city, as part of his birthday celebrations. “He went to the washroom after shaving. When he didn’t come out even after half an hour, we felt something was amiss and knocked on the door. As there was no response, we broke open the door and found him unconscious on the floor.” Raja was immediately rushed to the Dharan Hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead. Talking to TOI, Dr V Selvaraja, managing director of the hospital, said Raja was brought to the hospital around 7.10am. “Doctors tried to revive his heart’s functioning. However, their attempts went in vain. He died of sudden cardiac arrest.”The body was subsequently taken to his house, where thousands of DMK cadres gathered to pay their tributes to him. Ministers K N Nehru, Ponmudi, A V Velu, M R K Panneerselvam, Vellakoil Swaminathan, P T R Palanivel Thiyagarajan, Anbil Mahesh Poiyamozhi and Mathivendhan, and DMK leaders S R Sivalingam and T M Selvaganapathy also visited Raja’s house and paid their tributes.Raja’s body will be buried on Sunday on a land behind his house, where other family members, including his father, elder brother and mother, rest in peace.More than 600 police personnel from Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts have been deployed at Poolavari to control the crowd. Shops in Veerapandi and Poolavari villages remained closed on Saturday. In a press statement, Tamil Manila Congress president G K Vasan said Raja’s demise was not only a loss to his family, but it was a loss to the DMK as well.Pattali Makkal Katchi founder Dr S Ramadoss said he was deeply saddened at the demise of Raja. “While we were separated over politics, Raja was one of our family members.” Raja is survived by wife Shanthi and daughters Malaivizhi and Keerthika.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dmk-strongman-veerapandi-arumugams-son-dies-at-57/articleshow/86716644.cms||---
---||Pune||Covid-19: Pune’s R0 value drops below 1, indication of receding 2nd wave||PUNE: The district’s basic reproduction number (R) or R-naught (R0) for Covid-19 has plunged below 1, indicating that the second wave of the pandemic is receding. R-naught in all three components of district— Pune municipal limits, Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits and Pune rural — slipped below 1 in week ending September 29, health department data showed on Saturday. While the R-naught value in the PMC limits came down to 0.96, it slipped to 0.94 in the PCMC areas and 0.98 in the rural parts. During most periods in August this year, this value was 1 or above for for two or three of these units. R0 indicates the average number of people who can catch the infection from one sick person. R0 should thus be below 1 for the pandemic to recede. An R0 of more than 1 is worrisome as it means that each infected individual will spread the infection to more than one person. Hence, a value of less than 1 is necessary to stop virus spread. According to British Medical Journal, R0 is used to predict the beginning, surge and phasing out curve of the epidemic. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “R0 in epidemiology understands the pathogenesis of the virus and the epidemic. The next direction of the outbreak can be predicted using this value. If R0 is 1, it means that the number of patients is stable. When it is greater than 1, it indicates increase in patient population. When it is less than 1, it indicates less number of patients being infected.” Dr Deshmukh said if progressive R0 (since peak) is decreasing, it indicates that the wave has significantly waned. “Right now, the R0 in Ahmednagar is higher than Pune, indicated by the increase in Covid cases there. Multiple factors have helped bring down Pune’s R0, including adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour, disease control, higher host immunity, increase in vaccination, among others,” he said. Senior epidemiologist Dr Amitav Banerjee told TOI that the value is applied at the population level as a whole and not at an individual level. “When R0 is less than 1, it indicates that an infected person may not be infecting further as the surrounding people have immunity due to natural infection or vaccination. This number being less than 1 indicates a scenario where, though there may be sporadic cases in a community, they may not be in clusters or cause a local surge,” he added. Banerjee said to arrive at the R0, the index case in an outbreak is identified and through contact tracing, a calculation is made on how many the index case has infected. “Second wave has been connected to wide infection spread due to the Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2. A bulk of population got infected, prompting natural immunity, which contributed to a reduction in R0, among other reasons. Natural immunity is more robust because an individual is exposed to the whole virus instead of a part of it (as is in case of getting a vaccine),” he said. He said natural immunity would also give protection from future variants because no matter how much the virus mutates, it does not mutate more than 1% of its original composition. “So, 99% of a variant will actually be the same as the original version of the virus,” Banerjee further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/punes-r0-value-drops-below-1-indication-of-receding-2nd-wave/articleshow/86716640.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Judge asks why bizmen held in jail in ex-CP case||Mumbai: The Thane sessions court has questioned the police action in the extortion case registered against businessmen Sanjay Punamia and Sunil Jain, who are co-accused along with IPS officer Param Bir Singh.Thane sessions judge R R Kakani in his separate orders granting bail to Punamia and Jain said that the detention in jail is unwarranted and to oblige someone, they are being harassed. The judge also questioned the police decision to book them for cheating, saying cheating and extortion won’t go hand in hand. The court further noted that criminal sections of kidnapping or abduction for ransom are not applicable. Two offences, one at Marine Drive police and another at Kopri police, were registered in July against Punamia, Jain, Singh, DCP Parag Manere and DCP Akbar Pathan by arch business rival Shyam Sunder Agarwal and his nephew Sharad Agarwal respectively. Both cases were correlated and the accused were charged under various IPC sections of extortion, abduction, cheating and conspiracy. The duo was arrested on the complaint of Punamiya’s former partner Shyamunder Agarwal. Both jointly carried out construction business in 2005-2006 and after some period, their relations turned sour. In one of the complaints, Agarwal alleged that in 2016, he was arrested in a false case and five days later, Jain asked Agarwal’s nephew Sharad Agarwal to settle the matter with Punamiya and Param Bir Singh. Sharad and his brother Shubham were called to Singh’s bungalow, where Rs 20 crore was allegedly demanded in the presence of deputy police commissioner Parag Manere. The court dwelt on the numerous complaints and court cases initiated by both parties. It cited cases where, in one, settlement was arrived at before the HC, while the second was settled in civil court. “It is highly improbable to hold that the person settles a dispute without free consent. It is to be noted that Shyam Sunder Agarwal is also a reputed builder. It is unacceptable that this person will keep himself mum before the high court and will accept the terms as it is without resistance.” The court also said in such cases, there would be endless litigation. The court also noted that there is a delay of four years in registering the FIR by the complainant. The court said the prime accused, Singh and Manere, have not been arrested, though two months have passed. On the applicability of kidnapping or abduction for ransom, the court said, “So far (as) the applicability of offence under Section 364A of IPC is concerned, I am rather doubtful whether it would attract the present case or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-judge-asks-why-bizmen-held-in-jail-in-ex-cp-case/articleshow/86718335.cms||Ahmed Ali

Accusing the Congress government of cheating unemployed youths of the state, he wrote, "The government has suspended several officials in connection with paper leak at a time Dotasra has been claiming that the exam was conducted successfully." He wrote, "Even after the 12-hour blanket ban on the internet, the REET papers got leaked which shows the failure of the government." "The internet ban caused immense inconvenience to the students as many of them failed to locate the exam centres and missed the exams. What is being done for those who missed their exams?" asked Poonia. Mentioning that the alleged mastermind, Battilal Meena, had close connections with the education minister as their picture had gone viral, Poonia accused the Congress government of playing with the future of the youth. Highlighting the issue of paper boycott at Kamla Devi College in Alwar, Poonia questioned the paper reaching the exam centre late. The main accused is on the run. Meena was a frequent visitor of the Congress headquarters in Jaipur and had campaigned for a Congress candidate in the panchayat polls. Poonia said there were enough reasons to establish Meena’s realtions with Congress leaders. He said organised exam scamsters were active under the Congress government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-seeks-cbi-inquiry-resignation-of-dotasra/articleshow/86718337.cms||---

Addressing a press conference, Kundu on Saturday said, “The court made it clear that the rehabilitation or reintegration of the minors will continue as per the need of the children. The court has given a time of two weeks to juvenile justice boards to examine the cases if the children are homeless, come from broken homes or are in a difficult situation.” Explaining the importance of termination of such cases, Kundu said, “Children accused of offences face stigma and discrimination. Schools often don’t want them to continue and expel them for frivolous reasons. Other children bully them, calling them “criminal”, and such children lose friends and hence the most basic need of love and friendship is taken away. It has an adverse impact on their mental health and if kept in custody, it denies them basic liberty.” The petty offences are trespassing, possession/receipt of stolen property, theft, pornography, passing lewd comments, etc. Section 14 of Juvenile Justice Act says all inquiries into children involving petty offences must be completed within four months and the overall time limit for petty offences inquiry can be maximum of six months. In February, DCPCR found that 1,320 cases being pursued against children were beyond the maximum six-month time period allowed for inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rehab-crucial-for-juveniles-dcpcr/articleshow/86718782.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It was basically a verbal nod given to the letter from the home department as per the rules. The governor’s house’s direct intervention comes in matters related to Indian civil servants across the cadres,” said a governor house source. TOI called up the secretary of department of personnel Hemant Gera but he was unavailable for comments. Saini was arrested on September 9 while the woman was arrested on September 10. The forensic probe confirmed that the video was made in a resort in Pushkar on July 10. Other than Saini and the constable, two other SHOs of police stations in Ajmer and Nagaur were suspended for not acting on the complaint filed by the husband of the constable. Saini, then a serving DSP, came to limelight after a video with a woman constable indulging in an explicit act in a swimming pool at a five-star resort went viral after September 6. The issue hogged limelight since the constable’s six-year-old son was also seen in the pool witnessing the acts. The officer and the constable were slapped with charges under the Pocso Act following sharp outrage from the child rights group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rps-officer-woman-cop-terminated-from-service/articleshow/86718345.cms||---

The two leaders from rival parties shared the dais at a function at Ahmednagar in Maharashtra. “I am attending this function as I was told that Gadkari was going to inaugurate many projects in Ahmednagar which would solve long-pending issues of the city, and he wants me to be present,” Pawar said. Very often, nothing happens once the stone-laying ceremony takes place for a project, the NCP leader said, adding, “But when it comes to Gadkari’s projects, within a few days of the function one sees work starting. Gadkari is a great example of how a people’s representative can work for the country’s development,” Pawar added. “I remember, before Gadkari took over this responsibility (of ministry of road transport and highways), around 5,000km of work had been done. After he took over, the figure has crossed 12,000km,” the NCP chief said. The former Union agriculture minister advised farmers in the region that the use of sugarcane will not be limited to sugar production, and they should think of it as raw material for ethanol too. Gadkari said while executing road projects in Buldhana (Maharashtra), National Highways Authority of India also desilted local rivers and streams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/gadkari-has-shown-how-power-can-be-used-in-mumbai-pawar/articleshow/86718376.cms||---

However, health department officials have stated that preliminary reports find no evidence to support the suspicion. Vincy Susamma, a II PU student of Kadaba Government PU College, had died due to a severe headache, and locals suspected that she died of rabies, since the village had witnessed the death of a few dogs due to the disease. Pets in Vincy’s house had also died of rabies, but she had not shown any symptoms. Vincy, the daughter of Varghese from Kedila, was taken to a hospital in Puttur, as she was suffering from a severe headache on Thursday. She was later referred to the Wenlock District Hospital in Mangaluru, and died in the late hours of Thursday. Since Alankaru village had witnessed rabies in street dogs a few months ago, local residents assumed that the victim contracted rabies. DHO Dr Kishore Kumar M told TOI that the patient’s history does not suggest rabies. “Parents of the girl have not confirmed about dog bite, though one of their pet dogs and its pup died six months ago. The family members, including the girl, were petting the dogs, and hence rabies was suspected. However, they have not confirmed that the girl was bitten, and she also did not show any symptoms of rabies,” Dr Kumar said. Normally, salivation and hydrophobia are the major symptoms in rabies patients. She did not have salivation, but was facing difficulties in drinking water, he said. “It may be a case of cerebral haemorrhage. A team of doctors have visited the house, and they will submit a report after studying the case sheet,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/girl-dies-of-suspected-cerebral-haemorrhage-in-kadaba/articleshow/86717497.cms||---

A group of school children dressed as birds and animals, walked alongside the lake carrying placards on animal rights. Quoting Mahatma Gandhi’s message of “Be the Change,” Dalai said, “We are growing up in a world with increasing habitat loss, deforestation and overexploitation, threatening Earth’s rich biodiversity.” He urged youngsters to become animal rights advocates and to work for the cause of biodiversity conservation. Animals, he said, have the right to live without fear of mistreatment, exploitation or extermination. “Wildlife conservation is ingrained in our ethos and has always been an integral part of our tradition and culture. Our Constitution also enshrines this philosophy by including conservation of forest and wildlife as one of the fundamental duties of every Indian,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/wildlife-week-inaugurated-with-call-to-protect-animals/articleshow/86714788.cms||---

Ketan Varadiya, in his complaint with Sola police, stated that his father is also a practising advocate. The complainant stated that due to Covid-19, the family was in a financial crisis and they inquired at various places for loans. He stated that he came into contact with one Ramakant Sahoo, a resident of Odhav, who came to his house and told him that he was employed by one ‘Krishna Solution’ and was working on the Prime Minister Swarojgar Yojana, and was a member of the human rights commission. He said he was helping people get loans. The complainant said he needed to borrow Rs 15 lakh. Sahoo told him to pay Rs 75,000 as the ‘proposer amount’. Varadiya paid Rs 50,000 in cash and Rs 5,000 through a digital wallet and gave Sahoo the documents he asked for. On July 26, Sahoo called saying it was the last day to apply under the scheme and if anyone else from the family wanted a loan he would help them too. He then asked Sahoo to apply for a loan for his father as well. Varadiya paid him more money for this application as well. Sahoo told the complainant that the loans would be cleared by August 8 and gave them an Axis Bank cheque in case the loan did not get cleared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-duped-of-rs-1-3l-with-lure-of-prime-minister-swarojgar-loan/articleshow/86714795.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Ahead of exams, teachers’ promotion puts students in trouble||Poviet Kaur Chandigarh: Teachers who were waiting for promotions in the education department got their promotions but this has caused problems for both students and teachers. Exams for classes III to VIII will start from October 4, while semester examinations for classes IX to XII will begin in November. However, teachers from whom students have been learning in online and offline classes have gone to other schools after being promoted, leaving new teachers to teach students. On September 29, the education department promoted more than 100 teachers after almost five years. To improve class VI to Class XII results, 80 JBTs have been promoted to TGG and 18 NTT teachers have been promoted to JBT. However, the situation is such that the move may prove to be counter productive. Offline exams will start from Monday, October 4, for which students will come to school after 18 months. Students of classes III to VIII will have to adapt to a new teacher since the one they had for the last nine months has been sent to another school after promotion. New teachers will also find it difficult to prepare students of classes IX to XII for the November 2021 exam. For the last time in 2004, the Chandigarh education department conducted regular recruitment of lecturer teachers for classes XI and XII. The last recruitment of JBT and TGT teachers was conducted in 2015. At the time, 1,100 teachers were recruited. At present, only 700 teachers are providing their services. The process of recruitment to 131 NTT posts was started in November 2019 but it could not be completed in two years. At present, posts of more than 1,300 teachers are vacant and the Chandigarh education department has shown no sign of filling these.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ahead-of-exams-teachers-promotion-puts-students-in-trouble/articleshow/86714815.cms||---

Tandulkar, who works as a senior accountant in the accountant general's office, said he wanted to do something different since childhood. He started dabbling into creative work and in the process, made several artefacts. Some of them are unique, viz miniature artefacts inside a glass bottle like a cot, matchbox, bullock cart, tonga, sofa set and table chair out of wood. The 45-year-old said when he heard Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to make India a self-reliant nation, the first thought that came in his mind was, “Why not make a charkha with a difference?” Charkha was the weapon through which Mahatma Gandhi — hailed as the ‘Father of the Nation’ — taught Indians to be self reliant during the fight for independence against Britishers. Tandulkar said, “I started working on it and was successful in making a miniature charkha as small as 3.20mm long, 2.68mm wide and 3.06 mm high. I used small wooden sticks, a steel wire, cotton thread etc to make this charkha. The speciality of this spinning wheel is that despite being of such a small size, it is fully functional and can spin cotton like a big spinning wheel.” It is the one of the smallest spinning wheels in the world. Apart from being recognised in Asia Book of Records and India Book of Records 2021, the charkha has been nominated for Limca Book of Records. Tandulkar added that he had earlier made a miniature Bhagavad Gita — size one inch by half an inch — which was recorded in the India Book of Records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpurian-creates-record-for-smallest-ever-charkha/articleshow/86714803.cms||Ranjit Deshmukh
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Dengue, fever cases on rise; exercise caution, say doctors||LUCKNOW: In view of the rising cases of dengue, viral fever and typhoid in the city, doctors want people to exercise extreme caution against mosquitoes by maintaining clean and hygienic conditions in and around their houses and avoid self-medication in case they fall ill. Also, using masks and hand hygiene not only protects against Covid-19, but also seasonal viral infection because it is airborne. People can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away. It spreads when people cough, sneeze and talk. Touching the infected surface is another source of infection, they added. Hand hygiene also prevents typhoid. Doctors at SPM Civil Hospital, Balrampur, Lokbandhu and King George’s Medical University said that viral fever cases have increased by 50% this month in comparison to non-monsoon months. The outpatient door (OPD) services of these four institutes used to get an average of about 150 cases daily before July. However, with the advent of monsoon, daily cases gradually increased and in September the four hospitals altogether are receiving 225-250 cases daily. The cases of fever due to dengue were almost negligible till July, but started rising in August and now 15-20 cases are being reported daily. Similarly, cases of waterborne diseases like typhoid, which used to be around 10-12 daily earlier, now have increased by 10-15%. Prof Kausar Usman from KGMU’s medicine department said that some symptoms of seasonal viral fever, dengue and typhoid are common hence it is very important to consult doctors for right diagnoses instead of self-medication. “Besides fever and pain in the retro-orbital (sections behind eyes), TLC and platelet count can decrease in all these cases. That’s why specific diagnostic tests and medical expertise is required,” he added. Dr Rupendra Kumar of Lokbandhu hospital said fever patients should maintain a chart of temperature and keep monitoring pulse rate. “These charts can help doctors in diagnosis to start primary treatment before diagnostic test,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dengue-fever-cases-on-rise-exercise-caution-say-docs/articleshow/86718377.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

All necessary arrangements to help the affected people will be made,” Nitish told the media. Water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, Nalanda MP Kaushalendra Kumar, WRD secretary Sanjeev Hans, Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal besides Anupam Kumar, secretary to the CM, accompanied Nitish.

---||Lucknow||IIT to make science learning interesting for 79k KGBV girls||Lucknow: Girls enrolled in Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV), a residential chain of schools for socially and economically weaker sections, will now learn science through games, stories, and ‘curiosity boxes’. The UP government, in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar, has launched a ‘curiosity programme for teaching science in an experimental way’ aimed at making 79,000 girls enrolled in 746 KGBVs proficient in science as a subject. Under the programme, a team from IIT-Gn will groom 50 teachers as master trainers through 100 modules prepared on teaching science in an experiential manner—using interesting toys, activities, stories and assignments. Each module is a 5-15 minute video covering different topics from science books of classes 6 to 8. The videos describe ways of doing an activity and the science behind it. An integral part of the programme is the curiosity box, to be provided to each school. These boxes contain material enabling teachers to conduct the activity with students essential for an immersive experience. It will also help students perform activities on their own. Additional project director of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Sarita Tiwari said, “There is a notion that science is not a girls’ subject. We have decided to take this as a challenge. Through this programme, we intend to make students and more importantly teachers fall in love with the subject.” She added that the idea is to make classes more engaging, provide experiential learning, foster creativity, spark innovation and focus on concepts. Students will maintain a notebook where they pen down their experiences for each activity: their observations, scientific understanding and questions. They will also be given interesting assignments in each module to think about the concept. Teachers from all 746 KGBVs will be trained online thrice a week. In addition, there will be a residential workshop of master trainers at IIT-Gn after six months of the programme. Physical workshops will take place early next year. “Once the students and teachers become interested in the subject, scientific temper, critical thinking and conceptual understanding will follow,” said a KGBV principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/iit-to-make-science-learning-interesting-for-79k-kgbv-girls/articleshow/86718420.cms||Isha Jain

---||Rajkot||Imbibing Bapu’s principles true homage to him: CM||Rajkot: Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel on Saturday called upon people to imbibe Mahatma Gandhi’s principles of non-violence and cleanliness as he paid tribues to the Father of the Nation on his 152nd birth anniversary. Speaking at an all-faith prayer meet at Kirti Mandir in Bapu’s birthplace Porbandar, Patel said assimilating his ideals will be the true homage to Gandhiji. Patel called upon the people to make cleanliness an instinct and keep the state at the forefront in the second phase of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.  He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Clean India movement as well as Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) by realising Gandhiji's mantra of cleanliness. “Gujarat has been at the forefront of sanitation and water supply works through sustainable development,” he said, and exuded confidence that the Gujarat of Mahatma Gandhi would achieve new heights. Patel inaugurated several projects in Porbandar. These included a children's home for boys built at the cost of Rs four crore by the social security department and a new building of Porbandar-Chaya joint municipality constructed at the cost of Rs six crore. Patel also visited the Sandipani ashram of spiritual preacher Rameshbhai Oza. In the first phase of AMRUT Mission, Gujarat is placed at the third position in the country, having completed 305 important works at a cost of Rs 2,800 crore, Patel said. “As many as 95 projects related to safe drinking water supply have been completed in 31 cities. As a result, connections have been provided to 1.70 lakh houses,” he said.  Remembering Gandhiji’s idea of Surajya, Patel said “Gandhiji’s mantra of cleanliness was taken up by the PM as a social campaign which has become a massive public campaign. If Gandhiji gave us Swarajya, which paved the way for the upliftment of the poor villages, PM has started the journey of Surajya (good governance).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/imbibing-bapus-principles-true-homage-to-him-cm/articleshow/86714906.cms||---

He also warned against seven social sins; Politics without principles, wealth without work, pleasure without conscience, knowledge without character, commerce without morality, science without humanity and worship without sacrifice. Recalling Mahatma Gandhi’s initiative of promoting khadi and the cottage industry, he said this helped weave economic and sentimental ties between people in villages and towns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/beware-of-politics-without-principles-guv-on-gandhi-jayanti/articleshow/86714891.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Food & beverage industry in West Bengal plea for late closure of restaurants during Durga Pujas||KOLKATA: The food and beverage industry will appeal to the government to allow restaurants to close late during Durga Puja. At present, restaurants have to shut shop at 10.30pm. Though the state government has relaxed the strict night time restrictions between 11pm and 5am for 10 days (Panchami to Lakshmi Puja), it is applicable only for the movement of people and goods. “We are drafting a letter to the government requesting that the relaxation be extended to the industry that has been hit hard by Covid. This is the time of the year when we all look forward to doing good business and recovering some of the lost revenue. If the government gives its nod, we will then approach the Excise department for late closure licence,” Hotel & Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) president Sudesh Poddar said. Restaurateur Nitin Kothari says if the opportunity arises, he will pick up the late closure licence for as many days as possible. ‘Earlier, we used to take late closures for two or three days during the Puja. But now, if I get it for seven days, I will take it. With no pandal hopping, going to the restaurant is the only option for people and we are confident of getting walk-ins as late as 12.30am. I hope restaurants are able to operate till 2am like other years,” he said. Last year, too, restaurants were allowed to do business till late during Durga Puja. Pranav Singh, the honorary secretaery of HRAEI, pointed out the Covid situation now is a lot better than it was a year ago. “The biggest differnce is the vaccination that has happened. In any case, restaurants are operating with Covid regulations in mind and will continue to do so,” he said, adding that thermal checks and sanitization had become standard measures at all restaurants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fb-plea-for-late-closure-of-restaurants-during-pujas/articleshow/86714975.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Nagpur||NIT proposes approvals to 500 plots, not ready to give up Rs125cr paid to NMC||Nagpur: In a major relief for over 500 plot owners, the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) administration has proposed to sanction building plans, issue regularization letter (RL) and give other approvals to those who have paid charges to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). But continuing with its tussle with NMC, NIT is not ready to give up Rs125 crore recovered by the civic body from these plot owners.The NIT board of trustees will take final decision in this regard in a meeting on October 4.TOI on September 14 had reported that the NIT is not ready to sanction building plans, issue RL and give other approvals to the over 500 plot owners.The state government on August 27, 2019, had removed powers of NIT and made the NMC sole planning authority of the city. The NMC had sanctioned buildings plans, issued RLs and given other approvals in the areas transferred from the NIT. On April 9 this year, the government reinstated NIT’s powers. In over 500 cases, the NMC had taken charges while the process to sanction building plan, issue RL and other approvals was pending. The NMC had to transfer all the cases to NIT. Though people had paid charges to NMC, NIT is again demanding charges from the plot owners.Now, the NIT administration has proposed to verify charges paid to the NMC by asking for copy of receipts etc. The NIT will then sanction building plan, issue RL and give other approvals like amalgamation of plots, division of plots, mutations etc in case norms have been followed.At the same time, the NIT administration has said it will incur financial loss of Rs125 crore. “NIT wrote to the NMC on August 10 asking it to transfer charges recovered from the plot owners. But the NMC did nothing and did not respond positively,” said NIT in the proposal which also stated that the civic agency will adjust the amount in case it owes dues towards the NMC. The NIT’s plan not to give up the revenue of Rs125 crore will continue the dispute going on between the two agencies.NMC standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar, who is also a NIT trustee, told TOI that welcomed the NIT administration’s decision to sanction building plan, issue RL and give other approvals after verifying the charges with the NMC. “The NMC has recovered charges after verifying all details. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the NIT to do the needful. The NIT should give up demand for Rs 125 crore as there is no question of liability on the civic body,” he said.Sources told TOI that guardian minister Nitin Raut and president of City Congress Committee Vikas Thakre, also trustee in NIT, want NIT to recover Rs 125 crore from the NMC. The two leaders were instrumental in restoring powers of NIT.-----------------------------------------------IAN* Government made NMC sole planning authority for city in 2019* NIT transferred all pending applications to NMC* NMC regularized a layout, 1,244 plots and sanctioned 2,140 building plans* Government reinstated powers of NIT in April this year* NMC completed process.

---||Lucknow||UP CM Yogi Adityanath announces Rs 177 crore scholarships, vows to reimburse dues||LUCKNOW: Promising 51 lakh students eligible for government scholarships of getting their money by November 30, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday announced scholarships of Rs 177.35 crore to 1.5 lakh students. He also directed the education department to request private schools, where two girls of the same family were enrolled, to waive fees of one of the siblings. “If any school does not agree, the concerned department should send a proposal to the government to reimburse fees of one of the sisters. This will promote education of girls,” the CM announced at the event, held to mark birth anniversaries of Mahatma Gandhi and former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. The CM added the government was aware of the delay in disbursing scholarship money to 51 lakh students due to the pandemic. “We are working on a war footing to release funds by November 30,” he said. In his tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the CM called him a warrior of India’s Independence movement, who took the idea of non-violence and compassion to the world. “At a time when countrymen were steeped in disappointment amid foreign rule, he relied on swadeshi and self-reliance to fight the British. The world wondered how a common man in a dhoti would fight the British,” he said. Yogi Adityanath said the Mahatma’s message was more relevant today, referring to the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. “If we had made swachhta, a part of our lives since independence, we could have saved many lives. In UP, 1,500-2,000 people died of encephalitis every year and nobody paid attention to the plight of Dalits and backwards. They only functioned as vote-banks. Now, we have managed to curb encephalitis deaths by 99%,” the CM said. Gandhi’s vision of swadeshi also became the cornerstone of PM Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ programme, he said, which was crucial during the pandemic when more than 40lakh migrant workers returned to the state and the government managed to give them employment. The CM also paid tributes to Lal Bahadur Shastri, saying as prime minister, he gave India a new direction. “Though he was a follower of Gandhi, he also showed the world, India was capable of standing its ground before enemies. The 1965 war is an example. When other countries imposed sanctions on India, he said the country would not beg before anyone,” he said. Governor Anandiben Patel also paid homage to the two leaders. “Gandhiji said that a country’s progress is based on education and the world has recognised this fact. Good education results in character building, self-reliance and all-round development of a person,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-announces-rs-177cr-scholarships-vows-to-reimburse-dues/articleshow/86718429.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 30 turtles died at Byculla zoo in 1 year, activists seek probe||MUMBAI: A total of 30 freshwater turtles at Veer Jijabai Bhosale Udyan died from April 2019 to March 2020. This has been revealed in an annual inventory carried out by Central Zoo Authority. Other animals that died during this period include seven barking deer, six sambhar deer and one swamp deer. Dr Sanjay Tripathi, director of the zoo at Veer Mata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan, Byculla, said except for the swamp deer, all the other animals died because of natural causes. Advocate and activist Godfrey Pimenta said the entire focus of the zoo seems to be only on the Humboldt penguin. “Thirty deaths of one species is an unusually high number. There must be an enquiry,” he said. Dr Tripathi said in the case of the freshwater turtles, they were almost 40-50 years old and died of liver, kidney or respiratory failure. “The turtles were earlier in the old pond. Recently, we had created a new turtle pond and shifted them there. There are still around 12-13 old turtles and there has been some breeding too so we have around 8-10 newborns,” he said. In case of the sambar deer, now there is only one pair left while there are 20 barking deer and 25-30 spotted deer. In case of the swamp deer, the male and female deer were kept together in the same enclosure, said Dr Tripathi. “The male is rather young and one night there was a severe fight between the two. The female swamp deer died of injuries,” he said. However, naturalist Shardul Bajikar said so many turtles dying is not normal. “So many dying of liver, kidney or respiratory failures indicates there is an outbreak of a disease. A liver failure could be because of pollution, viral infection or some toxicity. A proper enquiry must be conducted. In case of the swamp deer which is a ‘critically endangered’ animal, a vague answer of an ‘aggressive male’ is not satisfactory. Such endangered animals need to be monitored very closely,” he said. Dr Tripathi said the zoo conducts a post-mortem on the death of an animal and the cause of death is recorded. The zoo director said many of the deer are in the 15-18 age group and are quite old. “We have written to the Lucknow zoo asking for two male and three female swamp deer. Very few zoos in the country have this species,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-30-turtles-died-at-byculla-zoo-in-1-year-activists-seek-probe/articleshow/86718476.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Delhi||Stubble fire spots back on NASA satellite, follow five-year pattern||NEW DELHI: Scattered farm fire events in both Punjab and Haryana have now started showing up on NASA’s VIIRS satellite imagery, with over 200 farm fire counts already recorded in Punjab’s Majha region since September 1, an analysis carried out by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) showed. According to data, 66 fires were recorded in Punjab on Wednesday, while 23 fire counts were recorded in Haryana on the same day. Each year, crop fires from stubble burning begin to show up on satellite imagery towards the end of September. Their numbers increase substantially by the second week of October. Experts said it was too early to compare data and a better indication of how both Punjab and Haryana were faring would be valid by mid-October, when monsoon withdraws as well. Prior to this week, parts of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi had still been receiving showers, which again, could impact crop fire patterns. “Over 200 farm fires have been reported in the Majha region (Amritsar and Tarn Taran) of Punjab so far. Satellite-derived fire event data over the last few years indicates a recurring pattern of early stubble burning in the region that commences in the last week of September,” said LS Kurinji, programme associate at CEEW. She added that while it was early to derive a trend on the number of farm fire events recorded so far, the Punjab government needed to ensure timely access to crop residue management solutions. “The fires we are witnessing these days seem to be following the trend observed in corresponding periods over the last five years. Targeted awareness campaigns and surveillance in high-burn villages are needed to stop stubble burning,” she said. In a study carried out by IIT Delhi last year, 554 villages were identified in both Punjab and Haryana where consistent stubble burning was taking place over the last three years. In terms of contribution to Delhi’s air in October and November, the study identified Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Firozpur, Ludhiana, Faridkot, Bathinda, Mansa, Patiala and Sangrur in Punjab and Hisar, Sirsa and Kaithal in Haryana as the biggest contributors. Proximity to Delhi, wind direction and intensity of fires were the major factors. Last week, Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR had said that Punjab and NCR states had prepared detailed action plans to tackle stubble burning, with the bio-decomposer solution developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute also to be used in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab this winter season. The bio-decomposer solution is to be sprayed over 6 lakh acres in Haryana, 1 lakh acres in Haryana and 7,413 acres in Punjab. CAQM said that detailed plans had been formulated based on a framework made by it for each state and directions issued for strict implementation of the plans in each state. The plans include in situ and ex situ crop residue management, prohibition of stubble burning, effective monitoring and enforcement and ways to reduce the generation of paddy straw as well. Each state has also been asked to adopt a standard protocol developed by ISRO to monitor farm fire counts this season.

A day earlier, the CM had directed his office and the chief secretary's office to call on the landline of all the DMs and SPs to check whether they were present in office during Jan Sunwai hours as per his earlier instructions. Assessing the handling of public complaints, the CM said that people are forced to come to Lucknow for relief. “The fact that complaints are being received on IGRS and CM Helpline shows that matters are not being tackled locally. If action is taken, then it is not to satisfaction,” he said. “Every little matter pertaining to law and order should be taken cognisance of. Senior officials should carry out surprise inspections of police stations and tehsil offices,” he said. The CM held a video-conference to review the Integrated Grievance Redressal System, 1076 CM Helpline, law and order, paddy purchase centres, communicable diseases, cow shelters and public welfare schemes of the state. "Paddy purchase has started from October 1. DMs and divisional commissioners should carry out inspections of purchase centres, and wherever necessary, purchase centres should be increased,” the CM said. A nodal officer should be appointed for each centre and crop residue should be sent to cow shelters instead of being burnt, said Yogi. A nodal officer should also be appointed for each cow shelter, he directed officials. He later reviewed the arrangements at Indira Gandhi Pratishthan, the venue where PM Narendra Modi will attend the urban conclave, during his visit to Lucknow in the coming week. The CM also inspected the UP pavilion, stalls and other models being installed at the venue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-seeks-reply-from-31-dms-24-sps-for-missing-jan-sunwai/articleshow/86718461.cms||Neha Lalchandani

In her police complaint, Reeta Devi, a resident of Rattpur Colony, Pinjore, who hails from Bihar, alleged that when she was going to the dentist, she met a 16-year-old boy who said he wanted to go Ambala and did not have money to pay the bus fare. She said a man came over asked the boy to check his pants. When he checked, he found a silver packet in his pocket filled with cash. The man said that the packet contained Rs 2.50 lakh and took it from the teenager. He then gave some cash to the boy and helped him catch a bus. Later, he told the woman that he could give Rs 2.50 lakh to her and convert her gold jewellery into cash. She said she gave her jewellery to the accused, who wrapped it in a cloth and wrapped some stones in another cloth. Thereafter, he gave the bundles to the woman and asked her to not open them till he returned. The woman kept waiting and when it got dark, she went home. She opened the cloth to find stones in it and her jewellery missing. She told her husband and they approached the police. A case has been registered under the relevant sections and further investigations are on.

---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Married man kills lover over her unending demands, held||VADODARA: A 54-year-old married man was arrested on Friday for allegedly killing a woman from Sankheda with whom he was having an extra-marital affair. The local crime branch (LCB) of Chhota Udepur police nabbed the accused Ramesh Panchal, a resident of Jambughoda in Panchmahal, based on the footage of CCTV cameras and the call detail records of the deceased woman Leela Bariya. During interrogation, Panchal told police that he was tired of Bariya’s unending demands for shopping and money so he killed her on September 28 on Sankheda-Handod Road in Chhota Udepur. Police said that Panchal slit Bariya’s throat repeatedly with a barber’s razor which was later found near her body by the investigators. “The accused and the victim were married and had their respective families. But whenever the accused would reach his workplace in Bodeli, the victim would call him asking him to take her out to the market for shopping,” said in-charge inspector H H Raulji of LCB. Panchal used to work at an engineering firm as a welder for Rs350 daily wage. Panchal told police that with his meagre income it was becoming difficult to fulfil Bariya’s demands and run his own home. However, Panchal had spent over Rs 12,000 for Bariya. Panchal was in a fix as he could not even break up with Bariya because she used to threaten to reach his home and tell his family about their illicit relationship. He then decided to bump her off and took her to Pavagadh on September 8. Panchal was planning to kill her there, but since there was a huge crowd, he could not succeed. On September 28, the duo met as usual on Sankheda-Handod Road near an old stepwell. Since there was no one around, Panchal grabbed the moment and slit Bariya’s throat and fled from there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/married-man-kills-lover-over-her-unending-demands-held/articleshow/86714989.cms||---

As per the data, the district reported 502 dengue cases in September. The cases had begun spiking from June (98), July (382) and August (1,030) in the district. Between June and August, five deaths too were reported in the district. Five more deaths were reported in September. This took the district’s toll to 10 for this year. Nagpur division, comprising six districts, too recorded a dip in September as compared to the previous month. The division’s dengue tally has surged to 3,030 as compared to over 500 cases in 2020 and 1,300 in 2019. The death toll too rose to 17 as compared to just two a year before and 11 in 2019. The division had seen 539 cases in June followed by 665 in July, 1,534 in August and 819 in September. As on September 1, the division had recorded over 2,200 cases and nine deaths since January this year. In August, over 1,534 cases were recorded in the division. Of these, 1,030 were from Nagpur district alone. The health department has collected over 16,000 serum samples from the six districts this year. But only 3,030 have tested positive in the ELISA confirmatory test. Last month, TOI had reported how public and private hospitals were running full with dengue patient but still the official data showed fewer cases. Doctors had said that the patients testing positive in NS1 and IgM tests were having all symptoms of dengue, but not all were counted as confirmed positive patients. TOI had also highlighted that the samples were tested after at least a week’s delay from the date of collection. Of late, hospitals have seen a drop in admissions of dengue patients. Dr Shyam Nimgade, assistant director of health services (malaria), said the health department has been working to make Nagpur division an endemic zone. “Continuous follow up of health workers was done at a massive level in the division with the cooperation of district collectors. Container and breeding spots was rigorously pursued. The workers successfully destroyed the spots which helped in bringing down mosquito density,” he said, adding that the cases are likely to further drop in October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dengue-cases-down-by-50-in-ngp-dist-div/articleshow/86714967.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Nagpur||‘Taking care in schools, religious places will prevent Covid spike’||Nagpur: Schools from Class 8 are scheduled to reopen from Monday, while temples from Thursday. Cinema halls and auditoriums will reopen from October 22. With most of public movements permitted, people are going to mingle and there could be a small but sure rise in new cases. Expert doctors tell TOI what kind of care we should take in order to be protected from the infection and when exactly should we fear about the third wave or the new surge in Covid cases. “We will be more or less safe even if schools and temples reopen. There is no need to worry a lot,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde.“The virus is not active now and it’s not multiplying the way it was in the early second wave. I don’t think school reopening and the temple run will add more numbers to the daily new cases,” he said. According to him, random testing at temples and religious places as well as periodic testing advised at schools may bring forward some asymptomatic cases which may appear like a spike but that’s not a thing to worry. “We must be confident. Physical distancing is not possible in the present scenario. We should wear masks. Getting fully vaccinated is also important,” added Dr Shinde. Academy of Paediatricians (AOP) Nagpur president Dr Vijay Dhote said school reopening will not infect kids. “Children are already mixing with each other and playing together. In fact, schools will follow Covid-appropriate behavior strictly. I don’t think cases in the pediatric popution will rise,” he said. Dr Dhote presented data from rural schools to back his claim. “Schools are open in rural areas for more than a month now. There is no surge in cases. Kids should follow hand hygiene strictly to avoid infecting elders at home,” he added. Physician Dr Mohan Patil said that the only thing we should keep a check on is hospitalization. “Even if someone is Covid positive, there is nothing to worry if you have vaccine protection. As long as people do not need hospitalization or oxygen or ventilators, we should not worry about the infection. We should focus on vaccinating more people,” he said, adding, residents in some clusters are unwilling to get jabbed. A senior member of the Covid task force in Nagpur district said they have suggested to the municipal corporation not to close down schools or restrict temples etc even if the new case count reaches up to 100.

---||Pune||Pune: Schools to first gauge pupils’ state of mind after reopening||PUNE: As schools gear up to reopen from Monday, a majority of them would be prioritising communication with students to understand their state of mind before starting regular classes. Administrations of most schools said many students might be dealing with Covid-related fatalities in their families, financial crunch, among other issues. They said over 50% parents have given consent to send their wards to school. For the students not attending offline classes, the schools will either record the lectures and then send a video or live broadcast the lectures, as per their technical capacity. As many schools received municipal guidelines late on Saturday, they decided to allow one student per bench, appeal to parents to drop and pick up their wards and keep 2-3 hours of school without breaks. Rajendra Singh, president of Independent English Schools’ Association, said member schools had already started an online learning loss assessment survey and depending upon the results, they would start a bridge course for students initially. “The focus would be on mathematics, science and English. We also have an offline test to gauge the emotional quotient of the students. While we have asked schools to start with 2 hours of lectures and gradually increase them, the examinations would be held post-Diwali,” Singh said. He said a blended learning method would be adopted initially. “Only 30-33% of parents have not consented to send their wards for offline classes. For these students, we will be broadcasting the lectures live. We know that these parents will also send their children to school after a week or two following a feedback from students attending offline lectures. This way they would be reassured about the arrangements at school,” Singh added. Medha Sinnakar, principal of Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said, “We have a meeting with all teachers, transport samiti, non-teaching staff, among others, on Monday, where we will decide on the finer points of reopening. We are set to reopen from October 5 or 6 and will appeal to parents to drop their kids off and pick them up after school. There won’t be any breaks and the focus will be on English, mathematics and science, with one other subject taken every alternative day from the next week. We have a medical room ready. Our first week will be ‘anand saptah’ (fun week), where we will also conduct various fun activities for students, such as make them watch a movie, sing, storytelling, among others. We want to first prepare them mentally before launching into full-time academics.” Seema Purohit, the principal of Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce, said they would be reopening physically from October 11. “Around 90% of our students are willing to attend physical classes. We had been planning an offline exam for Std XII students and we would like to start with that when we reopen. This will also give us a fair idea of how much the child has understood. For Std XI, we will conduct a week of orientation before we start actual lectures,” Purohit said. Transportation was a cause of concern for many parents as most of them would be working and may find it difficult to drop their wards to school and pick them up 2 hours later. “We had initially decided to send our son to school as he is in Std IX, but then the school said there won’t be any school buses. We both work. So, we decided to continue with online classes,”a parent said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/schools-to-first-gauge-pupils-state-of-mind-after-reopening/articleshow/86714982.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Delhi||CM Arvind Kejriwal to announce winter action plan soon: Minister Gopal Rai||NEW DELHI: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Saturday said Delhi’s winter action plan to combat pollution in the coming months was now ready and it would soon be formally announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Speaking at the launch of the 67th Wildlife Week at Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, Rai said the Delhi government was making efforts to not only protect the existing green cover but also to add more each year. “Visitors at the sanctuary will soon be provided electric cars and guides. Online ticketing services will commence soon. A cycle track has also been inaugurated inside,” he further said. The minister said the Delhi government had so far planted 22 lakh saplings this year and the yearly target of 33 lakh saplings was to be completed by March 2022. “Recently, we had a meeting with different departments, private construction agencies, RWAs and we took suggestions from all these people on what measures can be taken to improve the environment of Delhi. Suggestions have come to us from all departments and on October 4, the winter action plan of Delhi will be announced by the chief minister,” said Rai on Saturday. Asking people to help the government fight air pollution, the minister said many people were not aware that there was a butterfly park and a large waterbody known as Neeli Jheel inside Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary. “The government has given priority to the jheel’s beauty and people can come here to experience how it feels if we plant trees around us and how clean the air is. Those who visit here will be given the convenience of an electric car so that they can experience these pure surroundings we are aiming to build,” said Rai. The winter action plan will have 10 key focus areas, which have been identified to control pollution in the region. These include pollution from stubble burning, vehicular pollution, dust pollution, open-waste burning, pollution hotspots in Delhi and better coordination through the existing war room on pollution and the Green Delhi app.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-to-announce-winter-action-plan-soon-says-rai/articleshow/86718823.cms||---

Inaugurating a church hall at Ribandar, Sawant said “religious forces” have entered the state in a bid to create communal divide and disturb the harmony of Goa. “Even during the Portuguese rule and after they left, there has been no differentiation between Goans on the lines of caste, creed or colour. But today, I want to specifically make this point, religious forces have entered Goa. I want to remind Goans to be on guard,” Sawant said without elaborating. He said every other state in the country has seen friction between various communities because of caste and religious differences. “I want to say this again: Religious forces are making an entry into Goa. We must make sure that the relations between the communities don’t get destroyed,” he said. “But among Goans—whether we are Christians, Muslims or Hindus—there has been no discrimination. We have lived in unity. Whether it was Chovot, Christmas or Eid, we have gone and met each other and kept good relations. I am especially reminding the people of Goa today, on October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti),” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/religious-forces-have-entered-goa-to-create-communal-divide-cm/articleshow/86716938.cms||---
---||Goa||Mental health researchers concerned as year-long study finds prolonged stress levels||Panaji: The Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing uncertainty continues to negatively affect not just physical health but is also taking a toll on many people’s mental health. A nationwide study conducted by mental health research institute, Sangath, found that even though 95% of the people surveyed are Covid-free, an alarming number of them are suffering from mental illness and have reported moderate use of alcohol and tobacco. Sangath’s mental health researchers found that 66% of the 732 respondents from Goa, Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh had moderate levels of stress while 20% reported high levels. This is worrying researchers who point out that more than a year after the Covid pandemic made its presence felt in India, and despite a nationwide rollout of vaccines, the novel coronavirus continues to be a cause for moderate to high levels of stress and anxiety. A year long survey that began in July 2020 found that more than half of the respondents, or 68% to be exact, felt that they had moderate to extremely good information regarding Covid-19 and yet had cause to worry. The pandemic has infected 1.8 lakh people in the state since March 2020 and the virus has claimed 3,297 lives. Goa’s active cases stand at 950 and appear to be inching back towards the four-digit mark. While the state has seen two waves wreak havoc, the pandemic appears to have hit a trough for the moment. However, Sangath’s survey finds that the toll on mental health has remained worryingly high. In July 2020, 83% of the survey respondents had reported feeling moderate to high levels of stress, and almost 30% reported symptoms associated with depression. A year later, 86% of the respondents said that have moderate to high levels of stress and 12.6% reported symptoms of anxiety. As the pandemic wears on and restrictions necessary for public health continue, researchers are trying to trace the link to poor mental health outcomes. The survey already finds that 14% of the respondents have depressive symptoms. There is, however, a silver lining as the survey found that unlike in early 2020, more than two-thirds of the survey respondents felt in control of their finances, employment and future plans. The social distancing protocols appear to have distanced people from their loved ones, with just 18% feeling confident about their relationship with their partner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mental-health-researchers-concerned-as-year-long-study-finds-prolonged-stress-levels/articleshow/86717139.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Pune||Exercise can cut fall rate in elderly: SPPU study||Pune: A two-year study by the health sciences department of the Savitribai Phule Pune University has shown that the incidence of falls among senior citizens can be reduced with a few daily exercises and small changes to the furnishings in the house. Head of the health sciences department Aarti Nagarkar began a study on the umbrella topic of ageing eight years ago. In 2018, PhD student Snehal Kulkarni started focusing on walking and balance among older adults under Nagarkar’s guidance. “When we tried looking at reference points for older Indian adults on the correct walking speed, cadence we found that there is no reference point available. Hence, we decided to work on finding out how we can improve balance in older adults,” said Kulkarni. Nagarkar said they took a sample size of 800 older adults from 14 wards in the city.. “We found that women are more prone to falls,” said Nagarkar. Kulkarni said they would fasten a sensor around the older adults that measured about 54 gait parameters in them. “We would tell them to sit on a chair, get up, walk for 3m, turn and come down to sit on the chair. We were able to measure and publish the Indian reference points for stride velocity (how fast one walks), stride length and cadence (number of steps),” said Kulkarni. In their 16-week study, they made the 800 people exercise daily for 30-40 minutes and found that their fall incidences reduced by 40-50% on an average. Kulkarni, who is also a physiotherapist, said senior citizens should speak to their physicians before taking up any form of exercise. “Older adults must not do strenuous exercises where physiological parameters such as heart rate or blood pressure vary. Walking, sit-ups, stretches, balance and coordination and strengthening exercises can be done after speaking to a physician,” said Kulkarni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/exercise-can-cut-fall-rate-in-elderly-sppu-study/articleshow/86715016.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Goa||Goa: Petrol prices breach Rs 100-mark in Panaji, diesel close behind||PANAJI: The price of petrol, which was tottering around Rs 99 litre for more than three months, breached the century mark on Saturday after fuel prices were increased yet again, this time by 25 paise, to take prices to a lifetime high in Goa. The price of diesel follows close behind, barely Rs 4 from the century mark as the Centre and the state continued to rake in revenue. Oil marketing companies increased petrol and diesel prices by 25 paise and 30 paise respectively as international crude oil prices firmed up. Petrol in the state capital touched Rs 100.05-a-litre, the first time the fuel crossed the century-mark in the city, although in the hinterland, petrol prices had already teased the century mark in July. “The government needs money. It has to boost its coffers,” said a fuel pump dealer in the city. Fuel retailers point out that a major reason for fuel prices reaching the triple digit mark are the state and Central taxes levied on fuel. According to petroleum retailers, the price of petrol, excluding excise duty and value added tax, stands at Rs 39.3. Excise duty was revised sharply upward in 2020 when crude prices crashed due to a fall in demand because of the pandemic. Similarly, in February, the BJP-led Goa government hiked the VAT on petrol to 27% and on diesel to 23%. At that time, the price of petrol in North Goa was around Rs 83.1 per litre while diesel was around Rs 80.1 per litre. While citizens and motorists feel angry about the huge taxes that they need to pay on fuel, the government argues that such revenue is essential for growth, particularly during the pandemic when revenue sources have dried out. Goa earned Rs 682 crore from VAT on fuel in 2020-21. Since Pramod Sawant was sworn in as chief minister in March 2019, VAT has been increased on four occasions, the first being on June 14, when VAT on petrol was hiked from 15% to 20% and VAT on diesel was increased from 15% to 18%. The contribution of excise duty levied on fuel contributed Rs 3.71 lakh crore to the central exchequer in 2020-21, the highest in the last seven years. Speaking earlier to TOI, president of the Goa petrol dealers association (GPDA), Paresh Joshi, said that since 80% of India’s fuel requirements are outsourced, Indian fuel prices are at the mercy of the international crude oil trends and the strength of the Rupee. The basket of crude oil India imports has touched $78 per barrel in the past few days, prompting state-owned oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to resume daily price revisions. However, to put things in perspective, in April 2014, the Indian basket crude oil stood at $105.5 per barrel while petrol stood at Rs 72.3 per litre and diesel stood at Rs 55.5 per litre. This has led many, including the opposition, to point to the multi-fold increase in excise duty by the Centre when fuel prices plummeted in 2020. Excise duty collection during April-November 2020 was at Rs 1,96,342 crore, up from Rs 1,32,899 crore during the same period in 2019, according to data from the controller general of accounts (CGA). The opposition had protested against the rise in fuel prices, and had even held protests across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/petrol-prices-breach-century-mark-in-panaji-diesel-close-behind/articleshow/86716968.cms||Newton Sequeira

In modern times, it seems their online versions are not even sparing the cops. On Friday, a policeman, Kabir Mondal, posted in a south Kolkata police station, fell prey to an online fraud gang hours after his salary got debited from his account. The cop has an account in a nationalized bank’s Kidderpore branch. Mondal received a call around 12.30pm on his mobile phone and the person at the other end challenged the cop to stop him from withdrawing Rs 50,000 from the bank account. The constable thought it was a joke, only to be stunned when he received multiple messages from his bank informing him of withdrawals totalling Rs 50,000 from an ATM in Dhakuria. Mondal has lodged an FIR at Lake Police station. Lalbazar’s anti-bank fraud section is helping the local police in the probe. The bank authorities, who have also received a complaint from Mondal, are investigating the case separately. According to police, constable Mondal was on duty in the police station when the call came from an unknown number. “I am withdrawing money from your account. If you have the power, stop it, ” the caller resportedly told him, launghing aloud. The fraud took place minutes later. Police said the incident could be the handiwork of a skimming or a shoulder surfing gang. A few days ago, Mondal had withdrawn money from a private sector bank’s ATM and the card may have been cloned there. Mondal has denied sharing any personal information with anyone over phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-falls-prey-to-online-bank-fraud/articleshow/86715066.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Authorities eye minimal land acquisition for the project to avoid legal issues in the identified stretch.The tender valued at Rs 2.56 crore will identify a suitable agency to explore opportunities available on the 6.4-km elevated corridor from Anna statue in Melachinthamani till Railway junction via West Boulevard, Palakkarai and Melapudur. Highways officials said that the elevated corridor will have two lanes and viabilities will be explored to have multiple ramps (arms) at five locations. Considering the traffic needs, ramps are planned at Chathiram bus stand, Gandhi market, Marakkadai, Head Post Office and Railway junction. Two pedestrian subways may come up at the Chathiram bus stand and Main Guard Gate. “The agency to be identified will survey the land, vehicular traffic and shall conduct a soil test. They will submit a design plan, which will be modified if required,” a senior official with the state highways said.As there are an RoB and subway in the stretch, officials said that at such places, the elevated corridor will either be merged or designed to bypass the existing structures. Single pillars will be erected on the existing roads. “Since the available land is very less, there is no chance for a four-lane elevated corridor. We will make the project viable by ensuring limited land acquisition,” the official said. The agency will submit three alternative alignments to execute the elevated corridor for decongesting the city. Once the design is finalised by the alignment committee, funds required for the project will be sanctioned. The construction may take one year to commence, officials said. Further, two more tenders are expected to be released for the elevated corridors on Karur Road and Bharathidasan Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tender-floated-for-trichys-maiden-elevated-corridor/articleshow/86716966.cms||Deepak Karthik

The second round of discussion between the central committee of the Maharashtra association of resident doctors (MARD) and the state government failed to bring any positive outcome due to which doctors have decided to continue their strike. As it was Gandhi Jayanti on Saturday, doctors celebrated it with ‘Gandhigiri’. They paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi and organized blood donation camps at Yavatmal, GMCH Nagpur, Nanded and Ambejogai. More than 200 bags of blood was collected. “We have received support from the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Nurses’ Association, and also from our intern friends. Although, they are not participating in the strike, they are supporting our just demands of academic fee waiver and better hostels,” said Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale, president of Central MARD. Resident doctors are still hopeful of another round of discussion but not ready to settle for anything less than a written assurance from the medical education minister. Meanwhile, work continued to affect GMCs in the state on the second day too. As a result, patients who visit the GMCs should be careful now onwards. General visits could be postponed and emergencies should be given priority as health manpower will be limited at the hospitals.

A government spokesperson said even as UP currently ranks sixth among states in terms of exports, the government is in talks with ambassadors of 10 countries in order to boost exports. As per the data provided by the Centre, UP exported carpets and footwear worth Rs 744.15 crore and Rs 742.47 crore, respectively, against Rs 247.63 crore and Rs 147.04 crore last year. Similarly, leather wallets, bags and other products worth Rs 493.80 crore were exported this year as against Rs 79.21 crore last year while toys worth Rs 120.83 crore were exported this year as against Rs 26.19 crore in the corresponding period last year.

---||Pune||Early & meticulous planning helps residents tide over Covid-19 crisis||PUNE: Strategic foresight and meticulous planning helped the Clover Acropolis in Vimannagar and the Blessings Co-op Housing Society in Wagholi to prepare for the Covid-19 pandemic way before it reached Indian shores early last year. By the time first Covid case was detected in a husband-wife duo in the city on March 9, 2020, the residents of these societies had their own “Covid warriors” in the form of society staffers. They ensured that these support staffers were provided with accommodation within the society premises to keep them out of harm’s way. Harish Walunj, the chairman of the Blessings Co-op Housing Society, said, “We had made several provisions during the first wave of the pandemic, when there was too much fear and anxiety about the contagion. It was the time when people needed mental support from the people around them. For the first few days, there were no patients from the society. But as the contagion reached the society, an empty flat was used as an isolation facility. The patients were provided food and medicines by the society members.” The ideas were collectively implemented by the society committee members, including Mallikarjun Shrigan (secretary), treasurer Jayesh Mutyalkar and member Sneha Wagh, among others. The members also dedicated a separate elevator for Covid patients requiring to go out for tests or other medical reasons. “We would sanitise the common areas frequently. Security staffers were provided accommodation on the society premises. They were provided with home-made food during their stay here,” Wagh said. The society continued with the same practice during the second wave too. The eligible members of the society are fully vaccinated now. Committee members of the Clover Acropolis in Vimannagar said society manager Captain Yadav, housekeeping supervisor Kashinath Manjare, society supervisor Samadhan Kapse and garden supervisor Ram were their true Covid warriors. Hemant Samtani, treasurer of the society, said, “The staffers went over and above their call of duty to help in delivery of medicines, packages and parcels at the doorstep. They ensured garbage collection from flats with Covid patients and segregated it as per the PMC norms. The staffers also helped in sanitizing the premises and the apartments with Covid patients. At times, they would come after their duty hours to help us deal with the issues related to Covid patients.” A group of women from the society ensured that no patient went to bed empty stomach during the lockdown. They provided home-cooked meals (three times a day) to Covid-infected patients, said Samtani. The initiative was started by three to four women, which eventually grew to a team of over 30. They collectively provided over 700 meals to society residents during the Covid period. “We had the pleasure of our society supervisor, housekeeping supervisor and security supervisor to hoist the flag on the Independence Day this year as a gesture of respect for them,” Samoan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/early-meticulous-planning-helps-residents-tide-over-covid-19-crisis/articleshow/86715047.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

In a notice published on Saturday, the transport department issued the request for qualification and proposal (RFQP) for operation of 190 low-floor airconditioned private stage carriage electric buses under the cluster scheme. Under the cluster scheme of Delhi Integrated Multi Modal System (DIMTS), the government has so far inducted 3,033 buses. A day before, the transport department published RFQP for induction of 450 lowcfloor AC buses under the Cluster scheme. The Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) runs around 3,600 low floor buses. Together, the DTC and cluster buses comprise the public transport fleet. Another important segment of public transport is Delhi Metro trains. The new buses equipped with latest features like GPS, panic buttons, and CCTV cameras are expected to roll out on the city roads by mid-2022, if the bids are successfully carried out, officials of the department said. The new low-floor buses will replace old ones in two clusters that will complete road life of 7.5 lakh kilometres by next year. This will ensure that people do not have to face shortage of buses, said a department officer. The buses completing their road life are standard ones that will be replaced by low floor AC buses. According to estimates, Delhi requires at least 11,000 buses to fulfil public transport needs of the people. The Delhi government has been making efforts to bring more buses. The DTC too had floated tender for 300 electric buses recently.

It proved that the NDA and Gujarat governments have relations with him. From reports of agencies, we suspect that Modi and Shah knew Singh’s address and the Central government helped him from Delhi to flee the country,” alleged Patole. Countering criticism of Opposition parties that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was ignoring the plight of thousands of aggrieved farmers who suffered due to the wet drought in Vidarbha and Marathwada and that the respective guardian ministers were not responding to their calls for help, the Sakoli MLA reiterated that BJP leaders should first approach Modi and Shah instead of targeting others. “Ever since the BJP government came back to power at the Centre in 2019, it is continuously meting out step motherly treatment to Maharashtra. The state is facing calamities, but no help has arrived from the Centre. Instead of sitting here and shedding crocodile tears for farmers, BJP leaders should move to Delhi and stage a dharna before the Modi-Shah duo to bring funds for the state. People will definitely reward them,” said Patole. Responding to Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s comments on Congress that if such a big political party remained without a head then it will lead to confusion, Patole said since the former was a journalist, he has the freedom to express his thoughts. “In Congress, we respect everyone’s freedom of expression and liberty unlike BJP, which institutes an inquiry by the enforcement directorate (ED) and other agencies if you dare to speak or write against its leaders. Ours is a grand old party with a rich tradition, legacy and history and we don’t need sermons from anyone to run it.” On NCP MP Amol Kolhe’s statement that he wished to see their supremo Sharad Pawar on the PM’s seat and Ajit on chief minister’s post, Patole said in democracy everyone had the right to express their feelings. Accompanied by Congress city president Vikas Thakre and MLC Abhijit Wanjari, he refused to comment on the news of BJP and MNS collaborating for the forthcoming civic body polls. Fadnavis, Darekar embark on journey to drought hit areas in Vid & Marathwada Leader of Opposition in the assembly Devendra Fadnavis and his counterpart in council Pravin Darekar have embarked on their journey to drought hit areas in Vidarbha and Marathwada from Washim. Speaking to the media, Fadnavis said they were receiving messages from aggrieved farmers with no help coming their way. “Our visit is to awaken the administration and convey their plight to the government. We will ensure that compensation reaches them quickly. So far, only false assurances are coming from the government’s side, nothing really is happening on the ground. We would be visiting various drought hit areas of both regions in the next three to four days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/modi-shah-know-parambirs-whereabouts-alleges-patole/articleshow/86715025.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Gupta said instead of focusing on liquor, the government should focus on good healthcare facilities for the people of Delhi. “Youths are the builders of the nation, but AAP government is drowning them in liquor,” Gupta said. In reaction to BJP charges, Delhi government said, “Not even a single additional liquor shop is being opened in Delhi. The number of liquor shops will continue to be the same as it was under the old excise policy. “The BJP leaders are very well aware of this fact and they are deliberately misguiding the public due to their vested interests,” said the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/excise-policy-an-insult-to-gandhi/articleshow/86718827.cms||---

Expressing concern over the development, she requested the social media giant to immediately stop its trending and block senders of such posts. The subject received thousands of tweets both and against on Twitter. While the pro-Hindu groups endorsed Godse’s brutal killing of the Father of the nation, others slammed them for promoting such trends of glorifying a terrorist. “Godse is the first terrorist of India who killed the Mahatma. It was very surprising to see such trends about a killer receiving support from our own country. How can anyone tolerate such trends about our greatest leader? I appeal to Twitter management to remove all those objectionable posts with immediate effect,” Thakur said. She added that when Prime Minister Narendra Modi often talks highly about Gandhi whenever he was abroad, it was sad to see that such kinds of trends supporting a terrorist were trending on the social media. “Such acts is akin to promoting the terrorism and must be condemned in strongest possible words,” she said. Endorsing her, MPCC president Nana Patole targeted the BJP-led NDA government stating that those following such assassin’s ideology were ruling at the Centre unfortunately. “However, the people are well aware of their tactics and they would soon come together to finish Godse’s ideology,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/godse-was-india-1st-terrorist-who-killed-gandhi-maha-min/articleshow/86715068.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

He was rescued by the fire brigade personnel within 30 minutes. A video released by the fire brigade showed the man — Vijay Belbahadur — break into tears immediately on being rescued. Firemen in the video can be seen removing the rope placed around his arms and offering him a water bottle. Fire officer Pandurang Tambe said the drain’s cover had been stolen and that police had blocked the opening using a barricade. Kumar Kamble, a passerby, saw Belbahadur fall into the drain, and raised an alarm. Personnel from the Sinhagad sub-fire station rushed to the spot and reassured a terrified Belbahadur, partly drenched in sewage water, and used a rope to pull him out by 9.15am. Belbahadur, a citizen of Nepal, resides in Shaninagar in Katraj and works as a cook at a restaurant. “Witnesses told our rescue team that Belbahadur lost balance and fell into the drain after he removed the barricade out of curiosity,” said fire officer Tambe. Kamble said he was near the Katraj traffic signal when he saw Belbahadur fall into the drain. “He may have picked up the barricade thinking that it was lying by the roadside,” said Kamble. “In broken Hindi, he was able to give his name and address but could not explain how he fell into the drain. He boarded an autorickshaw saying he getting late for work and left the spot,” added Tambe. Belbahadur’s sister Radha said he has poor vision. “We have now decided to send him back to Nepal,” said Radha. Belbahadur was not available for comment as he does not use a mobile phone. Senior inspector Jaganath Kalaskar said the police have sent a letter to the Pune Municipal Corporation to cover the open drain at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/39-yr-old-falls-into-open-drain-fire-brigade-rescues-him-in-30-minutes/articleshow/86715065.cms||---

As many as 939 prisoners were shifted to neighbouring districts due to heavy waterlogging inside Ballia jail. Heavy pumps were being arranged to clear water logging from Azamgarh city localities. Divisional commissioner Azamgarh Vijay Vishwas Pant, who convened a meeting of officials on Saturday evening to finalise strategies to clear waterlogged areas of Ballia and Azamgarh, told TOI, “Posh city areas of the two districts are badly hit. Most of the localities in Azamgarh are waterlogged while massive waterlogging inside Ballia jail has led to shifting of prisoners to the jails of Azamgarh and Ambedkar Nagar districts.” Ballia district jail superintendent Lal Ratnakar Singh said due to heavy waterlogging as many as 939 prisoners including 61 women have been shifted to neighbouring districts. As many as 600 prisoners have been sent to Azamgarh jail while 339 were transferred to Ambedkar Nagar jail.” A big band of officials remained busy in arranging buses for the shifting of the prisoners amid tight security arrangements. As the already set up 100 pumps were insuffcient, over 150 HP additional heavy duty pumps were installed to clear waterlogging in city areas of Azamgarh, Pant said. District Magistrate Rajesh Kumar ensured that at least six marriage halls and lawns be turned into shelter homes those hit by waterlogging. In Varanasi, where 47 mm rainfall had taken place on Friday, some brief spells of showers took place on Saturday. But, overcast conditions kept the weather conditions pleasant. As per the IMD forecast the overcast conditions will continue for two-three more days. During incessant rainfall in Chandauli a mud house collapsed in Hingutargadh of Dhanapur and other in Sarvanandpur of Balua area in which Kamli Devi (38) and Ramdihal Yadav (48) were killed after getting buried under the debris.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ballia-jail-barracks-waterlogged-939-prisoners-shited/articleshow/86717057.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Lucknow||Ensure social media presence to avoid controversies: UP CM Yogi Adityanath to cops||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said all police personnel should be proud to be a part of the world’s largest force and asked them to take proper action in time to avoid unnecessary controversies. Speaking at the police investiture ceremony from 2019 to 2021, the CM said, “In case of an incident involving a cop, if an senior officer visits the scene of crime, holds dialogue and resolves it on the basis of merit, it would not snowball into a major issue.” “However, such actions are not taken by cops. Media is not getting information from cops on time. This is the reason why incidents get highlighted,” the CM said. During the event, Yogi also paid homage to Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on their birth anniversary. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath hands over gallantry medal to ADG law and order Prashant Kumar on Saturday“Social media picks up issues and people highlight them on the basis of their ideology and affiliation. If police is present (on social media) and gives its side of the story on time, cops will not turn from ‘nayak’ (hero) to ‘khalnayak’ (villain). We can restore people’s faith in the police force,” he said. “I have often witnessed that media trial takes place when cops do not visit the spot on time and give a version to media. The officers remain mute spectators and wait for someone else to speak. Such acts cast a shadow on our good work,” the CM said, adding that cops should keep a track on every activity on social media. “When an issue snowballs, each officer is heard giving explanation. We are not here to give explanations but to work for the people and make them feel secure,” he said. “The benefits of all the policies do not reach the people at the lowest level. In 2018, I met 20 technical students and 16 of them said they wanted to have their own start-up but wanted money for it. I told them that the government has specific policies and plans for it. We have ODOP Scheme but those students were not aware about it. In such a scenario, how will the government’s plans be successfully implemented,” he wondered. He said the state witnessed crimes against women but his government started anti-Romeo squads which were successful. “We started Mission Shakti in 2020. More awareness needs to be spread,” he said. “We had 20,000 women cops in the state but their services were not utilised. We roped them in for ‘Mission Shakti’ and utilised their services. We started exclusive women helpdesks in police stations and tehsils. Now people can spot women cops in every village who are not just helping women feel secure but are also creating awareness of government’s policies,” he said. He said every officer could do something innovative in and send their ideas to the government for approval. “We will also reward such officers with Police Utkrisht Sewa Medal,” he said. On this occasion, the CM also inaugurated ‘Manav Sampada portal’ which will have all the details related to cops like retirement and leaves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ensure-social-media-presence-to-avoid-controversies-cm-to-cops/articleshow/86718526.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Fuel price surge shocks consumers in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Fuel prices have once again begun increasing in the Ahmedabad market over the past three days. Prices of both petrol as well as diesel surged further up on Saturday for the third consecutive day. According to data provided by petroleum dealers, petrol price stood at Rs 98.97 per litre on Saturday with an increase of 24 paise against the previous day in Ahmedabad. On the other hand, diesel cost Rs 97.50 per litre, up 33 paise against Friday’s price. This is the third consecutive day when petrol prices have increased, backed by crude price rise. Fuel prices have shown an upward trend since April 15 and the surge continued every two-three days till July 17, from when prices stagnated. After August 22, fuel prices declined till September 4, when prices settled at Rs 98.04 for petrol and Rs 95.49 for diesel. However, a fortnight later, from September 28 onwards, fuel prices began to surge again. Overall, from April 15 till October 2, petrol price increased by 13.02% whereas diesel price surged 12.12%. Even though prices are on the rise, it has had little impact on the demand for fuel. “Fuel is an essential commodity and sure it is impacting people’s budgets but a surge in price will certainly not impact the sale of fuel or its demand. In fact, with the festive season beginning from next week onwards, the demand will further grow as people’s movement to the markets, to other cities will increase,” said a city-based petroleum dealer. Estimates by Federation of Gujarat Petroleum Dealers’ Association (FGPDA), suggest that the average monthly sale of fuel in Gujarat is an estimated 23 crore litre petrol and 55 crore litre diesel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fuel-price-surge-shocks-consumers/articleshow/86713888.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Sale of school-related items like uniforms, bags down 70%||AHMEDABAD: All dressed up and nowhere to go! This seems to sum up the situation of not only a large number of school students who continue to attend online classes 16 months after the pandemic forced schools to shut down, but also reflects the sorry state of affairs of businesses involved in the selling of school dresses and school bags. Schools in Gujarat reopened four months ago but they are seeing very thin attendance. As a result, retailers of school dresses and school bags who rely heavily on regular functioning of schools are unable to revive their business amid mounting losses. While the onslaught of the pandemic has brought down the school dress business by 70%, estimated to have a yearly turnover of Rs 500 crore, the school bag business that is estimated to be Rs 1,000 crore a year is also facing a similar kind of business losses. Manthan Lala, owner of a retail chain that mainly sells school uniforms and other items for schoolchildren, says his business is down by 70% as there is no fresh buying of school dresses by parents for two successive academic years. “Not many schools today insist upon their students to wear school uniforms while attending online classes,” said Lala. Very few students come to buy new school uniforms as they continue to use their older attire, he said. For Kamlesh Jain, who sells school dresses and other garments from his huge outlet in Vastral, the daily counter for school dress which was Rs 50,000 has come down to Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 per day. He says that only some schools have made it compulsory for students to attend online classes wearing school uniforms. The school dresses come with an expiry date and every year we need to upgrade as per the new trends and requirements of the schools, according to Jain. Similar is the case for school bags. “There are hardly any buyers for new school bags. The estimated market size in Gujarat is about Rs 1,000 crore and today the business is hardly around Rs 300 crore. We have made representation to the state government to provide some tax incentive and financial support to the industry that is struggling to stay afloat,” says Ankit Shah, joint secretary, Gujarat Bags Manufacturers and Wholesale Association. There are over 3,000 traders and retail store owners in the state who are reeling under financial losses, he says. Many workers have shifted to other industries due to the prevailing situation. Khushal Vaswani, a wholesaler and manufacturer of school bags, said he incurred heavy losses in the last two academic years. From an annual turnover of Rs 4 crore in pre-pandemic times his business is now reduced to a few lakh rupees a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sale-of-school-related-items-like-uniforms-bags-down-70/articleshow/86714148.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The police on Thursday booked the two firm officials after two city businessmen accused them of extorting Rs1.37lakh on the pretext of issuing them licences under the Copyright Act, 1957, for staging musical performances at marriage ceremonies in a star hotel here. The alleged extortion took place in August this year.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Despite ban on big venues, garba business upbeat this Navratri||It is that time of the year when streets in Gujarat come alive at night as men and women dressed in colourful attire flock to garba venues and swing to the beats. While Navratri is about devotion, the festival also brings a buzz in business activity and gives livelihood to lakhs every year. With the Gujarat government putting a ban on big garba venues due to Covid concerns, many in the industry, especially the singers, are disappointed over the income loss. However, the apparel and hospitality industry is happy that sheri garbas and Navratri is being allowed in residential societies. Festive season cushion for apparel sectorpparel and garments are on the top of the shopping list during festivities, and this Navratri season, the demand has seen traction unlike last year when there was no business as garba was not allowed, said traders and industry players. Since the state government has permitted organizing garba in residential areas and private events this year, even with a limited crowd of 400 persons, chaniya cholis and traditional outfits are selling at a decent pace. Kirit Patel, president, Panchkuwa Mahajan, said, "The demand is really good and traditional outfits and even fabrics are selling well. We’re receiving orders from other cities as well and this has given an overall boost to the textile business. Besides chaniya choli, people are also buying skirts, kurtas, and other traditional outfits, based on the ongoing trend." A host of exhibitions featuring fresh and old collections of traditional wear, chaniya cholis and other outfits from an array of apparel and textile brands are being held in the city and are receiving good response, claimed industry players. Ujjwal Shah, a textile designer, added "Last year’s business was nil because garba was not allowed. On the contrary, things are much better this time around as at least private events are taking place. The sale of entire outfits as well as mix-and-match garments is good." Navratri often marks the start of the festive season, which is followed by Diwali and the wedding season. As a result, not just chaniya cholis but the demand for other festive outfits as well as apparels usually grows. So much so that garment manufacturing units are utilizing their entire capacities to meet the growing demand. Vijay Purohit, president, Gujarat Garments Manufacturers’ Association (GGMA), said, "The demand remained good over the past month and the momentum of both sales and production has not lost steam. Since the threat of the third wave of Covid-19 has faded too, we expect the festive season demand to help us recover losses of the past year. Orders have suddenly begun to pour in and that too in good volumes. And we look forward to a better festival season this time. Garba artistes out of tune with restrictions on commercial events The ban on big Navratri venues has disappointed garba singers and artistes in the state. Many are ruing the loss of income for the artists who suffered last year too. "If the government had allowed big venues to organize garba with limited crowds, so many artistes and those associated with the festival could have earned their livelihood. For many of us, Navratri is the time to earn adequately and sustain our families," said Atul Purohit, a prominent garba singer. "We have urged the government to give permission to organize garba on party plots under strict guidelines," Purohit told TOI. Dilip Shah, trustee of Vadodara Navratri Festival (VNF) too is concerned about the artistes and other entrepreneurs losing out big time on earnings. "Garba singers, musicians and their troupes have this one festival to earn their livelihood. They will suffer huge losses as big garba venues haven’t been permitted by the government. Garba brings a lot of buzz in the economic activity, but with only small garba venues allowed this time, the industry will suffer," he said. Another garba singer, Paritosh Goswami, said the entire industry, including apparel shop owners, fashion designers, caterers, event managers and food stalls will suffer. "Even last year, garba artistes couldn’t earn a single paisa and this time too there is little scope. But we understand the government’s stand," he added. Hospitality hopeful of recoveryThe clearance to organize Navratri has given businesses in the hospitality sector some breathing space. Explaining the trend around Navratri, Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA), Gujarat, said, "This Navratri, several corporates are hosting garba for closed groups of their employees or clients. With this, smaller plots, banquets have been booked. Indirectly, this will also give good business to caterers, decorators and even artistes. These businesses incurred massive losses since the Covid pandemic struck." Nitin Nanavaty, president of Vadodara Food Entrepreneurs (VFE), said, "The government has allowed sheri garbas and this will attract a crowd. We will get business, unlike last year when Navratri was completely cancelled." Imitation jewellery industry in Rajkot fails to sparkleThe imitation jewellery industry in Rajkot is staring at revenue losses this year as well. Market experts say that the industry gets 30% of its annual sale during Navratri. According to traders, the ethnic jewellery usually remains in demand during the garba festival, not just in Rajkot but also in bigger cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai and Delhi. The dull earrings (jhumka) and jewellery sets attract a great demand during Navratri. "This year, sheri garbas are allowed but big commercial garbas haven’t been given the go-ahead and this has badly impacted the imitation jewellery business. This Navratri sales are down to 10%," said Jignesh Shah, president, Imitation Jewellery Association in Rajkot. "In big cities like Mumbai and Delhi, commercial garbas are very popular. But with a ban on large gatherings, big venues won’t be having Navratri and that has also affected the demand of imitation jewellery," he added. The yearly turnover of this sector is around Rs 3,000 crore with over 1,000 jewellers supplying imitation jewellery across the country. Over three lakh people, including workers, are engaged in this industry.

The revamp project was taken under a 75-hour challenge initiated by the Ranchi Smart City Mission, Ranchi Municipal Corporation and the World Resource Institute (WRI). The park which was closed since 2011 is being revamped under Smart City Mission’s place making and nurturing neighbourhood challenge for which Ranchi has been enlisted among 25 cities across the country. The reclaiming process of the park is being done in a unique manner as WRI is using waste materials for recreational infrastructure. Once completed, the park will boast of a dedicated children’s play area, walking lanes, spice and herb garden and lighting which will allow people to visit the park even during evenings. Talking to TOI, CEO, Ranchi Smart City Corporation Limited (RSCCL) Amit Kumar said: “We selected Zakir Husain Park for the 75-hour redevelopment project due to its location. The 37,000-square feet park is situated at one of the major junctions of the city opposite Raj Bhavan and it can be used by children and others for recreational activities.” The revamp project is supported by Ranchi Municipal Corporation and WRI is behind the initiative as the technical partner. Project associate of WRI, Arunima Saha said, “We had a challenge to revamp the park in 75 hours and the work began on September 30 at 10 am. It will be completed by Sunday 1 pm. It was indeed a challenging task because when we had visited it first, we couldn’t even go around the whole area as it was covered with shrubs and in a dilapilated situation. So, we got it cleaned first and then started the work.” On being asked what waste materials they are using for renovating the park, Saha said: “They have procured old pipes, tyres of various sizes and wooden logs from RMC’s scrape yard which were used for making swings, pyramids, plaques and sitting areas. The reclaiming project was divided into three parts — removal of unwanted shrubs and cleaning the area, installing waste materials based on their utility at different places creating required infrastructure and then plantation of spice and herbs in an earmarked area. Apart from that we also used paints and decorative lighting for the walkways and open spaces so that people from all walks of life could access it.” The park also had a canteen which was closed for more than 10 years and that too has been given the required makeover. The officials said that it will be provided to self-help group women for setting up their shop in the space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/closed-since-2011-zakir-hussain-park-to-don-a-new-look-today/articleshow/86714827.cms||Gaurav Pandey

While the administration talks about Swachcha Bharat mission and rolls out measures to sensitise people, they have utterly failed to keep this place clean,” said an elderly who was at the lake to offer his tributes to Gandhi. In Gumla district too, Gandhi Jayanti was celebrated where in Tana Bhagats (followers of Gandhian principals) remembered Mahatma Gandhi. Over one hundred of them from blocks assembled in Badri village under Ghaghra block to observe Gandhi Jayanti. They also recalled their first preceptor Jatra Bhagat who was pioneer of Tana Bhagat movement. Later his followers and descendants of Tana Bhagat joined the non cooperation movement of Gandhiji. They also performed bhoomi pujan at a hill in Badri village for construction of samadhi for both Mahatma Gandhi and Jatra Bhagat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/polluted-lake-around-gandhi-statue-upsets-hbag-residents/articleshow/86714962.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Last year, Sohrai Khovar art, a traditional art form, received the tag in a first for the state. Now, the Deoghar district administration has set its eye on its famous pedas to boost the business prospects of the traditional peda makers there. Talking to TOI on Saturday, Niraj Kumar, the Deoghar district coordinator of the Mukhyamantri Laghu Evam Kutir Udyam Vikas Board, said they have already begun the process to register all peda makers/manufacturers in the district and would continue till October 6 before making a formal application to claim the GI tag. He said, “In September, we held a meeting with all the peda makers under the chairmanship of deputy commissioner Manjunath Bhajantri to sensitise them on the importance of the GI tag for any product and why it will be helpful for them. The traders were asked to register with the district industries department by September 30. However, we have now extended the window as the response hasn’t been good.” Kumar said another round of awareness workshop is slated on October 4. “So far, about 20 peda makers have registered with us but we are trying to rope in as many as possible. In Deoghar, there are around 200 peda makers,” he said, highlighting that the traditional businessmen are not fully aware of the advantages. The official informed that only the pedas of Mathura have received the GI tag in the country so far. On GI tagging, Kumar said it defines the origin of a particular food/product and is recognised under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999. Geographical Indications Registry in Chennai is the lone competent authority to give the GI tag, he said. “GI tag will lend authenticity and uniqueness to a product. Once we get the GI tag for the Deoghar pedas, the traders there can easily have an option to sell their products globally sitting in Deoghar. It will boost their businesses,” he said, adding that they are now in the process of forming a cooperative society of all the peda makers to initiate the application process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/deoghar-admin-eyes-gi-tag-for-babadham-pedas/articleshow/86714687.cms||ASRP Mukesh

In response, Goa Foundation filed five applications stating that the high court, in earlier orders, had directed that such matters be filed before the NGT and not before the high court. The petitioners said that they had not been given a hearing in the matter prior to finalisation of the report. “…even in the present petitions, the action impugned by the petitioners is nothing but a fallout of orders and directions made by NGT in the proceedings before it,”stated the division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar. “The record indicates that NGT was monitoring the issue of demarcating private forests in the state. It is in pursuance of the orders made by NGT that the committee came to be appointed to give a report. Ultimately,it was NGT that accepted the committee’s report. Therefore, if any party has any grievance of orders made by NGT appointing such committee and accepting the report made by such committee, then it is appropriate that such party avails of statutory remedies available under the NGT Act,” the order stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-dismisses-5-pvt-forest-writ-petitions/articleshow/86717167.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Now, Class IX, XI failures can appear for 2022 boards in Goa||PANAJI: Students who have failed Classes IX and XI during the academic year 2020-21 will now get the opportunity to appear for the Class X and XII public exams 2022 as private candidates. The Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has approved the proposal as a one-time concession for students during the pandemic year. The concession will provide those who have failed the benefit of clearing the higher class and saving their year, pushing them into further studies. The board earlier also revised the scheme for private candidates to appear for the Class X and XII public exams in 2022. As per the revised scheme, private candidates too will get the benefit of year-round and internal assessment. This benefit of continuous and internal assessment will help in better evaluating students appearing for board exams as private candidates. The entire outcome is not dependent only on how they perform during the final Class X or XII exams. Last week, the board sought suggestions from the general public on the proposal, following which the inputs received were reviewed by a committee of the board and the proposal was eventually cleared. “After extensive deliberations, it was decided to allow ‘needs improvement’ students of Class IX and XI of the academic year 2020-21 to appear as private candidates irrespective of age in the ensuing public examination 2021-22 for Class X and XII respectively, as a one-time measure in view of the Covid-19 pandemic situation. Further, Class XI ‘needs improvement’ students can appear as private candidates only in non-practical subjects,” the board’s circular states. There is a minimum age criterion for students to appear as private candidates for the public exam. This criterion too has been waived off to allow younger students to seek the benefit of the one-time concession. To appear as private candidates, students will also be allowed to either choose their present school or any other school, which will act as their centre and carry out their year-round evaluation. “The schools opted by the students to register as private candidates shall provide them with study material and necessary guidance on voluntary basis, and conduct internal assessment and send marks to the board for further needful action,” the circular states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-class-ix-xi-failures-can-appear-for-22-boards/articleshow/86717250.cms||---

Ahead of the ‘Sarkar tumchea dari’ initiative to be held in Cuncolim, Gomes said that the government, which was claiming to bring governance to doorsteps at the fag end of its tenure, should consider the demands of staff of municipal councils engaged in door-to-door waste collection as “they have been pioneers of doorstep delivery of waste collection services every single day, for years without end”. Pointing out that collection of door-to-door waste has become a permanent feature in most municipal councils through personnel engaged on daily wage basis, Gomes demanded regularisation of their services. “They have been working for years without any hope of getting regularised. They are also deprived of decent wages,” Gomes said. He further pointed out that in the Cuncolim Municipal Council alone there were about 60 employees, many of whom have been in service for as long as 18 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-must-resolve-woes-of-municipal-daily-wagers/articleshow/86717383.cms||---

Congress also asked the Lokayukta to direct the state government to revive the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) and hand over the entire recruitment process to the SSC. State Congress president Girish Chodankar said he had evidence to prove that the recruitment and evaluation norms were manipulated during the selection of junior scale officers Chodankar also demanded a statement from chief minister Pramod Sawant explaining how Goa speaker Rajesh Patnekar’s son, Himanushu Patnekar, got the first rank in the junior scale officers (JSO) recruitment exam, when he was ranked 14th in the initial merit list. Chodankar alleged that the “asking price” for a police sub inspector’s job is Rs 25-35 lakh, for a constable’s post it is Rs 10 lakh, for a lower division clerk a bribe of Rs 15 lakh is sought, aspirants have to cough up Rs 15 lakh for a teaching post. The National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), Congress’ student wing, has filed the complaint before the Lokayukta, seeking investigation into deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar’s public statement admitting corruption in recruitment. “We also find the trend that children of BJP supporters, MLAs, ministers are suddenly topping recruitment exams. Our youth wing and NSUI will be watchdogs to see that nothing wrong happens in the recruitment process,” Chodankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hiring-process-is-flawed-cong-to-lokayukta/articleshow/86717439.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Insisting that the ongoing recruitment process is transparent, Sawant asked people not to pay any money for government jobs, but to file a complaint so the guilty could be booked. “If anyone is taking money for government jobs then a complaint should be filed. I will not look anywhere before I throw those people inside (jail),” Sawant said on the sidelines of an event in Ribandar. However, the chief minister dodged questions about irregularities in the selection of speaker Rajesh Patnekar’s son Himanshu Patnekar. Himanshu topped the junior scale officer’s exam after re-evaluation of the question paper though in the initial list he stood 14th on the merit list. “Let the allegations (of bribes being taken for jobs) be proved. I want to tell the public, if there is anyone who is asking for money in lieu of jobs then this government will not take it lightly. Please file a complaint with me, with police.

He said that the centre, situated at the old Goa Institute of Management complex, is the state’s first integrated health centre, where medical staff from Goa Medical College, Goa Dental College and the directorate of health services will be present. The 24x7 facility, with its own dedicated 108 ambulance, will be a full-fledged casualty unit with general out-patient department (OPD) and a laboratory for testing. Plans to procure X-ray machines, ultrasound machines and other key medical diagnostic equipment for the PHC are also in the pipeline. “There was a demand from the people for a health centre in Ribandar. This is the first integrated health centre with 108 ambulance, STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) services 24x7,” said Sawant after inaugurating the facility. Locals had demanded a 20-bed, 24x7 full-fledged health centre with X-ray, sonography, CT scan and MRI facilities, which would cater not only to Ribandar residents, but also those from Old Goa, Corlim, Chorao, the two panchayats of Divar, Chimbel and Merces. “This will be a full-fledged STEMI centre, 24x7 so that if there is any cardiac-incident, it can be handled,” said health minister Vishwajit Rane, who was present for the inauguration. “This place will have all the facilities so that the people of Ribandar don’t have to move far away for basic treatment. There is a 2D echocardiography machine that can transmit reports through telemedicine.” “In a few days, telemedicine services will also start across Goa. This will mean that at least half of the people who travel to GMC or to a hospital will no longer have to travel as they can avail tele-consultation,” said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ribandar-phc-will-be-1st-in-state-staffed-by-gmc-gdc-dhs-teams/articleshow/86717608.cms||---
---||Goa||Ponda farmers want cattle vaccination done immediately||Ponda: Fear of an outbreak of the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in milch cattle (milk producing) is causing concern among farmers. Fearing that the disease has affected some cattle in Sanguem, Ponda farmers have demanded that the government begin vaccinating the animals before an outbreak. Cattle infected with FMD need to be kept in isolation as the disease can spread through the cattle's saliva, urine, dung and even air and is highly contagious. Under the national animal disease control programme, vulnerable animals, mainly cows and buffaloes are vaccinated once every six months. The protection period of vaccination is 180 days. Anup Desai, a farmer from Priol Ponda said that the disease has been detected in cattle at Sanguem and could spread to other areas soon. “FMD is a devastating disease of livestock caused by a Picornavirus. There are seven serotypes of the virus and the animal husbandry department should immediately start the vaccination programme.” Picornavirus infects vertebrates including fish, mammals and birds. Dr Agostino Misquita, director of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services (AHVS) said that there is no outbreak of FMD in Goa. Admitting that some cases with foot infection have been spotted at Sanguem and Balli, Misquita said it would be immature to claim that the animals are suffering from the disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ponda-farmers-want-cattle-vaccination-done-immediately/articleshow/86717699.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Civic polls likely after bypolls, hints CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday indicated that polls to 112 civic bodies in Bengal and six municipal corporations — including Kolkata Municipal Corporation and Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation — could be held after the four assembly bypolls. The four bypolls will be held on October 30 and results will be declared on November 2. “After the bypolls, we also have some other elections in the state. We have to do it,” Banerjee said. The polls to the civic bodies and municipal corporations are due since June 2019. These are now being run by a board of administrators, headed by the chairperson. These in most cases are the outgoing civic councillors. After the 2021 assembly polls, the state had indicated that it would hold the civic polls. The plan, however, didn’t materialise due to the Covid second wave, which started ebbing only from August. Sources indicated that the polls can be held only after November last week. Bengal has already stepped into the festival season, which in November includes the Kali Puja and Diwali, followed by Bhai Phota (Bhai Dooj) and Chhath Puja. The month ends with Jagadhatri Puja and Rash Utsav. Even when these are completed, the State Election Commission must allow a 21-day window from announcing the polls and conducting them. Opposition parties have been demanding that the civic polls be held immediately, arguing that if the condition was conducive to hold bypolls there was no reason why the civic polls couldn’t be held. However, unlike the bypolls which have already been held in three assembly segments and will be held in four more on October 30, the civic polls will encompass the entire urban areas in the state. The Bengal SEC has to formally write to the state seeking to hold the polls and the state has to concur with it to set the poll process in motion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/civic-polls-likely-after-bypolls-hints-cm/articleshow/86716524.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Metro breaches 3 lakh ridership mark||KOLKATA: Metro on Friday clocked 3,27,515 footfall, nearly half the daily passenger count registered in pre-pandemic times. An average of 6.2 lakh to 6.5 lakh commuters travelled on the north-south Metro every day before the novel coronavirus first struck and services were suspended in the March 2020 lockdown. When it resumed after a 178-day hiatus on September 14, 2020, only 21,336 rode the city’s transport lifeline that restarted with 110 services. The highest passenger count the 32km north-south line had recorded before the 61-day second wave break from May 15 was 2,50,713 on February 19, when 240 services operated. The authorities are now elated that ridership breached the 3-lakh mark on Friday, when 256 services operated in both directions of the Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar corridor. With the festivities being round the corner, Metro officials expect a steep rise in daily footfall from next week. To accommodate the Puja shoppers’ rush, Metro will add 10 more services from Monday, taking the total daily services to 266. That will be the carrier’s highest in the pandemic times since March 2020. Before the pandemic, Metro’s daily fleet was 288. On September 3, also a Friday, Metro had breached the 2.5 lakh mark, and that was within 50 days of resuming services after the second wave break. In the earlier stint of post-Covid resumption, the carrier took five months to attain the milestone. On September 4, 2,57,453 rode on 240 trains. In fact, officials said, they had been witnessing a sharp rise in commuter count ever since services resumed on July 16 after a 61-day hiatus owing to the second wave. Trains remained chock-a-block from the very first day after the second break, with 1,28,957 people travelling by 192 services. The rush had prompted the authorities to immediately add 28 more trains and extend the hours. It seemed to have emerged as the most meaningful means of commuting and the cheapest, an official said. One can travel the entire 32km of the north-south line, from Dakshineswar to Kavi Subhas, for Rs 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-breaches-3l-ridership-mark/articleshow/86715201.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

But from November 1, no potholes should be there, we must take this upon ourselves,” Sawant said after inaugurating the new PWD annex building next to the department headquarters at Altinho. Sawant also urged the department to focus on delivering quality constructions speedily. “You people are planners. I know MLAs, sarpanchas and panchas keep coming to you and asking you to execute certain projects. But you all are in the best position to plan. You need to analyse first whether there is need for a certain work. I see that sometimes we are spending Rs 1.5-2 crore to construct a pathway with paver blocks. We need to analyse how much worth the project really is. We need to use government revenue for jobs that are a priority. Even if a panchayat tells you, that is not the priority. You need to decide what is the priority,” Sawant said. He said that in many places, government buildings are in a dilapidated condition. “We have so many buildings which are in a dilapidated state. We are spending money to demolish them. I feel bad. We should see how the buildings under each division can be brought back into use,” he said. Many buildings have been constructed by earlier governments, but no one has even stepped into them and now they are falling apart, the CM said. “One such example is the tourism department building in Keri, which was constructed and inaugurated, but no one ever entered. Not a roof tile or a door exists today. I handed over the veterinary department building, meant to be a guest house, to the Indian Forensic Sciences University of the home department of the Central government. It will be put to good use. We need this kind of vision,” Sawant said. He further said that PWD’s architectural wing should also adopt the swayampurna mantra, indicating that use of consultants by spending extra money should be reduced. “PWD should design more buildings by itself as it knows well the seasons of Goa and what type of buildings must be constructed,” Sawant said. He also encouraged the department to collaborate with the water resources department to address the issue of water shortage in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/not-a-single-pothole-should-be-seen-on-states-roads-from-nov-1-cm-tells-pwd/articleshow/86717002.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bhushan Steel case: Rs 191 crore bungalow in Mumbai's Worli attached||MUMBAI: The ED has provisionally attached a residential bungalow worth Rs 191 crore adjoining Ceejay House, Worli, in the money laundering case related to a bank fraud case against Sanjay Singal, ex-CMD of Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd (BPSL), and others. Earlier, the ED had attached assets worth Rs 4,230 crore in the BPSL case. Ceejay House, along with the bungalow, was constructed by Millenium Developer, a company of NCP leader Praful Patel. The ED investigation found that the funds utilised for the bungalow’s purchase by Assurity Real Estate LLP were siphoned from BPSL and routed through shell companies, projecting them as unsecured loans. The ED said it had found that “the unsecured loans were given without any documentation and repayment obligations.” Earlier, the ED had investigated the bungalow purchase transaction in a separate money laundering case registered against late drug smuggler Iqbal Memon alias Mirchi because a portion of the plot where Ceeyjay House and the bungalow was constructed belonged to Mirchi. In the BPSL case, the ED said the company and its directors deliberately defaulted in repayment of loan amounts to lender banks and financial institutions as per the time schedule and that their accounts remained continuously irregular. Subsequently, the lead bank, Punjab National Bank (PNB), declared the accounts of BPSL as a non-performing asset (NPA) in December 2015. The ED registered a money laundering case against BPSL ex-CMD Sanjay Singal based on the CBI FIR in April 2019, where it was alleged that the company availed loan facilities worth Rs 47,204 crore from 33 banks and financial institutions between 2007 and 2014 and defaulted on payment. The ED said that BPSL and the other accused entered into a criminal conspiracy among themselves and with unknown bank officials to cheat banks and financial institutions. The ED is investigating that the accused dishonestly and fraudulently diverted huge amounts of bank funds through companies, shell companies and entities and deliberately defaulted in repayment of bank loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bhushan-steel-case-rs-191-crore-bungalow-in-mumbais-worli-attached/articleshow/86720219.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Kolkata||Durga Puja: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee appeals for safe celebrations||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday appealed to people to abide by the court orders and Covid guidelines during the festivities in Bengal. CM Banerjee said she would also request the state chief secretary to urge the Election Commission to ensure that “no disturbance is created” during the Puja days in the four poll-bound assembly segments. “Mask is compulsory, please use sanitisers. You can move at night (during the Puja days) but after adhering to the court orders and our Covid guidelines,” Banerjee said. The CM’s statements came in the backdrop of Calcutta High Court on Friday reimposing the restrictions it had announced ahead of the festival last year. The HC again ruled that the interiors of Durga Puja pandals would remain off-limits for visitors for the second year in a row. According to sources, the CM, like last year, will also be inaugurating the Pujas virtually. “Some relief has been given for the Puja days. From October 10, we have given relaxation,” she said. While increasing the Covid restrictions till October 30, Bengal had two days back relaxed the “the movement of people and vehicles between 11pm and 5am” from October 10 to 20. “You cannot step inside the mandaps. But you can see it from close proximity without crowding. And inside the mandap, there will be organizers and priests,” she said. “I will urge the chief secretary to speak to the EC if political campaigning can not be done in the October 12-20 festival period. There will be a week left (before the October 30 polls) for all that. We must conduct the elections along with the festivities. I would urge all not to create any disturbance (during the festivities),” the CM said. “Mahalaya aascheh (Mahalaya is coming). I will pray to the Goddess that people get a respite from the calamity, distress and sickness,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-appeals-for-safe-celebrations/articleshow/86714592.cms||---

The aim is to highlight the pathetic condition of Goa’s roads. Youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar said the best pictures will be awarded prizes. The contest will run till October 14. “We welcome people of Goa to post pictures, selfies with potholes in their area and tag @IYCGoa on its social media platforms using the hashtag #SpotThePothole. They have to mention the location along with tagging three friends,” Mardolkar said. To encourage more and more people to participate, Congress is offering exciting prizes such as smartphones, electronic gadgets, Bluetooth speakers and #GoaDeservesBetter T-shirts. To try and draw the attention of the government to the pothole-ridden roads, the members also undertook another novel protest method in Bicholim. Congress workers, led by Meghashyam Raut, lay down in potholes while holding placards to protest against the dilapidated roads. The Congress workers were later detained by Bicholim police for hindering traffic. “Potholes and craters have caused the biggest discomfort to Goans and tourists alike and the Goa IYC is determined to highlight this failure of BJP government to the people,” said opposition leader Digambar Kamat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-highlight-bad-roads-cong-starts-spot-the-pothole-contest/articleshow/86717095.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||SUPER CAR DEALS, EVEN WHEN CHIPS ARE DOWN||Kolkata: Traditionally, Durga Puja-Diwali has always been a great time for car sales. Not only because people tend to get carried away in the festive spirit and make big-ticket purchases that get otherwise put off due to more practical considerations, the discounts offered by various companies also play a vital part in swaying the decision in favour of buying one’s dream car. This year is, however, different. With the auto industry battling a microchip shortage that has forced most companies to cut down on production, demand has outstripped supply in the market. So much so that some vehicles have a waiting period of up to a year with companies unable to produce them till chips are available. Hence, discounts that would have generally been offered on almost the entire range of cars is limited this year to select products. “The entire industry is battling a shortage in microchips. The industry would have recovered from the Covid setback but for this constraint. August has been a particularly bad month with Maruti Suzuki taking a major hit due to unavailability of adequate chips,” Maruti Suzuki executive director (marketing & sales) Shashank Srivastava said. Automobile companies usually introduce offers during the festive season to spur demand and drive sales. But with the situation the other way around this year: a long wait period for several cars and companies unable to roll them out in adequate numbers to meet customer demand, most companies don’t want to create additional pull till they are confident of meeting it. Despite this, there are great cars available with offers, either because the models have been around for a while and don’t generate the kind of excitement that new models do; or they are being phased out to make way for a new generation of the model; or the company has decided to exit production business in the country. The biggest discounts on offer are in Kia Carnival and Mahindra XUV500. While the former is a large-size premium multi-utility vehicle that does not have the type of demand that SUVs and hatchbacks command, the latter is being phased out and replaced by the XUV700 that has recently been unveiled. On Carnival, Kia Motors is offering a cash discount of Rs 2 lakh. While that does not entirely translate into a cash discount, the figure is arrived at by add-ing various benefits that will be extended to the buyer. For XUV500, the discount is more direct and amounts to nearly Rs 2.6 lakh. It includes a cash discount of Rs 1.79 lakh in addition to Rs 20,000 in accesso-ries, Rs 50,000 by way of exchange bonus and another Rs 6,500 in corporate discount. A very capable SUV that can seat seven, it is a great deal. “At present, only a few top-end models with automatic transmission are in stock on which the scheme is available,” said Mahindra & Mahindra dealer Royal Motor general manager Arnab Dey. Citroën is offering an incentive of Rs 1.8 lakh on its SUV C5. “This is by way of a five-year service package worth Rs 65,000, comprehensive insurance worth Rs 60,000, accessories worth Rs 20,000 and extended warranty worth Rs 35,000,” said Arijit Bhowmick, business head of Celica Motors that sells the Jeep and Citroën brands. For those aspiring for the true-blue iconic SUV brand Jeep, there is a Rs 94,000 offer on select models of Compass. Renault Duster, another capable SUV but one that has been overshadowed with newbies on the ramp, has a decent offer. Though the vehicle is moving in fewer numbers than compact SUV Kiger, its phase-out is still some time away with the company set to introduce the next generation Duster only sometime next year. The discount on offer on Duster is over Rs 1 lakh, including Rs 80,000 — Rs 20,000 in cash, Rs 30,000 in exchange bonus and Rs 30,000 in corporate discount — and additional five years’ AMC and warranty that costs a neat fortune. For those keen on electric vehicles, there is a decent offer on Hyundai Kona EV with Rs 1.25 lakh cash discount. This is in addition to government incen-tives that one may get on purchase of EVs. Hyundai is also offering Rs 50,000 on Grand i10 Nios turbo and Aura turbo (Rs 35,000 cash discount, Rs 10,000 ex-change bonus and Rs 5,000 corporate discount). Tata Motors is offering a discount of Rs 65,000 (Rs 25,000 in cash and Rs 40,000 in exchange) on its SUV Harrier. The petrol-powered compact sedan Tigor has an offer of Rs 43,000 (Rs 20,000 in cash discount, Rs 20,000 in exchange bonus and Rs 3,000 for Covid warrior). “At present, it is a seller’s market with companies unable to supply the number of cars that are in demand. The offers have been more vibrant in the past. It is only when the semiconductor crisis is over that we can again witness the kind of offers that used to be earlier given three times a year, once during the Durga Puja-Diwali festival season; once before the calendar year-end; and finally before the financial year-end,” said Tata Motors dealer Lexus Motors managing direc-tor Binod Agarwal. Maruti Suzuki has offers on just two cars: S-Cross and Alto 800. While it is offering Rs 50,000 on S-Cross (Rs 25,000 cash discount and Rs 25,000 exchange bonus), it is offering Rs 35,000 on Alto 800 (Rs 20,000 cash discount and Rs 15,000 exchange bonus). Those keen on buying well-built cars that are safe to drive can go in for Ford Freestyle, Aspire and Figo, all of which are now on sale with discounts of Rs 60,000 each following Ford India’s decision to stop vehicle production in India. “Customers who purchase the cars will not regret the decision as there will be no problem with service and spare parts,” said Subhendu Mondal, senior sales consultant at Kaikan Ford.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/super-car-deals-even-when-chips-are-down/articleshow/86717053.cms||Subhro Niyogi

If Gour Mistri still has a second chance at life, it is because his brother Srinibas and three other fishermen fought the big cat for 15 frightening minutes till it released its prey and fled. While Mistri is battling death at Canning subdivisional hospital with deep gashes on his head, neck and shoulders, the authorities at the tiger reserve have launched an inquiry into the attack. According to local sources, the fishing group was ambushed on the banks of Jhila river opposite Marichjhapi island in the morning. Fellow fisherman Nimai Mandal saw the tiger dragging Mistri away and raised an alarm. Srinibas and the others joined him in trying to scare the big cat away, but in vain. Mistri was already unconscious and bleeding profusely when the group decided to try throwing a fishing net over the tiger. The trick fortunately worked. The tiger released its prey before the net could capture it and retreated into the forests. Field director of Sunderbans Tiger Reserve Tapas Das said: “We have received a report about a tiger attack on a fisherman at Jhila compartment. We have started an inquiry. The victim is being treated at Canning hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fishermen-save-mate-from-jaws-of-tiger-in-sunderbans/articleshow/86716436.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: TMC-BJP war of words over ‘man-made flood’||HARIPUR (HOOGHLY): Trinamool Congress’s Arambag MP Aparupa Poddar alleged on Saturday that the deluge in Arambag and Pursura blocks in Hooghly was a “conscious step by the DVC authorities”, drawing a sharp retort from BJP leader Dilip Ghosh. Poddar, in presence of other TMC leaders Becharam Manna, Asima Patra and Tapan Dasgupta, said she will lodge an FIR against DVC. “We will lodge an FIR against DVC. A DVC team had come to Hooghly seven days ago to assess how much release would inundate these areas. It is a man-made flood,” the TMC MP said soon after CM Mamata Banerjee left for the Kalipur helipad on Saturday. Ghosh rubbished the charge. “Bengal has been suffering from floods for 100 years. The Trinamool has been making the man-made flood complaint since CPM days,” he said. The BJP leader pointed out that there was a state representative in the DVC consultative committee. “What was that person doing? He should have objected to the release,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-bjp-war-of-words-over-man-made-flood/articleshow/86716627.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Kolkata||West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee calls unplanned release of DVC waters a ‘criminal offence’||KOLKATA: The “man-made flood” in south Bengal just before the state’s biggest festival season is “a criminal offence”, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Saturday, accusing the DVC of “being responsible” for the “unplanned and untimely” release of water. The state will demand compensation from the DVC for the losses across eight districts, she said. “This is a criminal offence. We have decided to seek compensation. Please ensure that Bengal doesn’t repeatedly suffer. A flooded road in Howrah’s UdaynarayanpurI will write to the Prime Minister and have also asked the chief secretary to write to the Union agriculture secretary and Cabinet secretary,” she said at Nabanna after an aerial survey of the flood-hit areas. “I condemn this. I am sorry that during festivities in Bengal when people will worship, they are being forced to leave their homes with their belongings. If this isn’t a crime, what is?” Banerjee asked. “This can’t go on. The DVC released 1.25 lakh cusecs of water in July. But, this time, they released over 10 lakh cusecs, of which around 3 lakh cusecs of water were released just on September 30,” the CM said at Arambag. “When bridges, dykes and embankments are washed away, when people drown, when crops are damaged and homes destroyed, who should be held responsible? DVC should be held responsible,” she said. Banerjee added: “I would also request the (Union) home minister. At the drop of a hat, NHRC is sent to Bengal, central forces sent to conduct a small election. Officers are intimidated and summoned. When DVC releases water and Bengal gets flooded why don’t you release a single paisa? Just big talk wouldn’t do.” The CM said that Jharkhand released 80,000 cusecs of water from the Sikatiya barrage on the Ajay river at Deoghar. “Last time, they gave us intimation. This time, the state had no prior intimation from the DVC before the release. Crops have been damaged, houses have crumbled. The massive release hit people at night when they were fast asleep.” “We will write to the Jharkhand government to take initiatives to de-silt the dams on their side. The Centre should take up a master plan to prevent the recurrent flooding in Bengal,” Banerjee said. The CM also spoke to people shifted to a relief camp at Arambag and asked if they were getting food at the camp. Banerjee hoped that water would recede from the inundated areas fast. “Kanksa block in West Burdwan, Barjora block in Bankura, Arambag and Pursura blocks in Hooghly and Udaynarayanpur in Howrah are among the worst-hit. I will hold a meeting with disaster management officials to expedite the relief work,” she said. Minister of state for labour Becharam Manna and Trinamool Arambag MP Aparupa Poddar accompanied the CM to the relief camp on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-calls-unplanned-release-of-dvc-waters-a-criminal-offence/articleshow/86716574.cms||Falguni Banerjee

Chattopadhyay is likely to get a ticket from the constituency, where the bypoll is scheduled on October 30. Local Trinamool office-bearers have also found a temporary address for the leader where he could rest for the night during his campaign in Khardah. Chattopadhyay, however, refused to comment on the matter before the party formally announced its bypoll candidates. Trinamool’s back-room boys are nevertheless busy preparing the mode of campaign for the party candidate after Khardah SDO handed over a list of restrictions to be followed. “We will avoid mega rallies and meetings. We will stick to the EC’s stipulations and design our campaign accordingly,” a local Trinamool leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sobhandeb-inaugurates-tmc-poll-office-in-khardah/articleshow/86716845.cms||---

The first instalment of Lakshmir Bhandar for beneficiaries in the rest of Bengal will be released before Durga Puja, she added. According to Banerjee, the EC has also cleared the Rs 50,000 Puja donation for various clubs in Bengal. By-elections in Gosaba (South 24 Parganas), Khardah (North 24 Parganas), Santipur (Nadia) and Dinhata (Cooch Behar) are scheduled for October 30. Votes will be counted on November 4. Before the EC announced the bypoll dates, the state last week cleared Rs 54.7 crore, which is to be paid in direct benefit transfer (DBT) mode under the scheme. Each Bengal district received Rs 2.5 crore. The CM stressed that owing to the model code of conduct coming into play, disbursement would be delayed in the four districts but beneficiaries elsewhere would receive the money amid the festive season. “We started the project in September; so, they (beneficiaries) will get their share for September and October together. No one will be deprived,” she said. Beneficiaries in poll-bound districts will get the dole in November for three months. Lakshmir Bhandar — a special scheme offering financial assistance to women in the age group of 25 to 60 years who are without a government job or pension — has already received 1.8 crore applications. Under the scheme, general category women will get a monthly aid of Rs 500 and SC/ST women Rs 1,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lakshmir-bhandar-cash-before-puja-for-beneficiaries-in-non-poll-districts/articleshow/86716553.cms||---

State finance minister Amit Mitra said on Friday that the state has achieved the highest growth at a time when the country witnessed a negative growth in per capita net domestic product. Tamil Nadu and Karnataka came second and third in growth numbers respectively. Earlier this week, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant had also said, “West Bengal is among very few states, which have achieved a positive growth in gross state domestic product (GSDP).” The RBI data further confirmed better fiscal management in Bengal compared to other states during the pandemic, says Mitra. As per the RBI Handbook of Statistics, the growth of per capita net state domestic product for West Bengal was 7.1%. Tamil Nadu has achieved 5.2% and Karnataka has registered 1.6%. However, in India as a whole, the per capita net domestic product growth was at -3.9%. The data shows that 12 states had negative growth numbers in this regard. Some big states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana had negative numbers. UP witnessed -0.4% while for MP, it was -4.7% and Haryana -3.2%. Commenting on the RBI data, Mitra said, “West Bengal has shown the way for India under Mamata Banerjee’s leadership by being ranked number one in net per capita growth as estimated by RBI.” He argued that some major BJP-ruled states have produced massive negative numbers. According to him, the achievement demonstrates how demand stimulation and cash in hand of common people can achieve magical outcomes in the middle of the pandemic. West Bengal has turned out to be among only two states in the over-Rs 10 lakh crore club to witness a positive GDP growth in the pandemic-hit year, the other being Tamil Nadu. The Niti Aayog CEO has also said that West Bengal along with Bihar, Tripura and Sikkim were among very few states in the country that have witnessed a positive GDP growth rate in 2020-21 when the country as a whole has registered a negative GDP growth of 7.7%. West Bengal has the highest GSDP among all these eastern states at Rs 13.7 lakh crore in 2020-21followed by Bihar at Rs 7.6 lakh crore only. West Bengal ranked 6th by GSDP and experts pointed out that the base is considerable on which the growth has happened. The state finance minister in its budget speech, which was delivered by CM Mamata Banerjee earlier this year, had written that GSDP of the state has gone up 2.9 times from 2010-11 to 2019-20. He had also written that the state’s tax collection has increased 3.5 times from 2011 since Trinamool Congress came to power, and debt/GDP ratio had also declined from 40.6% in 2011 to 34.8% at present. Even fiscal deficit had also fallen from 4.2 % to 2.9% in the latest count.

---||Kolkata||Drive-and-darshan may lead to traffic snarls this year, fear Kolkata cops||KOLKATA: Kolkata Police will draw on last year’s experience when entry into pandals was banned to chalk out a final Puja crowd control plan this year. On Saturday, Lalbazar discussed at length two challenges — controlling visitors at the barricades to stop excessive crowding near the pandal entrances and ensuring revellers who enter the main puja zones like Rashbehari Avenue in the south and Rabindra Sarani-CR Avenue in the north move in a disciplined manner without impacting traffic flow. Since entry into pandals will be barred, more people are expected to drive by and get a peek into pandals and idols from the car itself. This might lead to clogging in front of pandals, it is feared. While coordination meetings of organisers in Jadavpur, Behala and Port area have been completed, cops are likely to meet those in central and north Kolkata on Monday. Thereafter, senior officers, led by commissioner Somen Mitra, will do the rounds of major pandals. Despite the ban on entry into pandals, police expect pandal hoppers, especially youngsters, to hit the roads. “From Sasthi to Nabami last year, we saw a large number of youngsters flocking pandals. At Chetla Agrani in the south or Kumartuli Park in the north, we had to ask people to keep moving and stop crowding at the barriers. We expect more people this year as many are vaccinated,” said an officer. Organizers like Tala Barowari in the north and Hindusthan Park in the south said they wanted police to suggest ways to control crowding at the barricades. “We have decided not to block the approach roads to the pandal in any manner that can affect dispersal,” said Abhishek Bhattacharya of Tala Barowari. Pintu Sengupta of 66 Pally said visitors will not be allowed to hang out near the pandal. What had led to crowding at the pandal barricades last year is the trend to take a selfie and post it on social media. Police have decided to keep 25-50 men at each of the major pujas of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/drive-and-darshan-may-lead-to-traffic-snarls-this-year-fear-cops/articleshow/86714612.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

This is a key risk factor driving serious illness and death, After several states sought clarification over differences in the estimated adult population, ministry of health and family welfare additional secretary Manohar Agnani sent the revised age specific population for TN to health secretary J Radhakrishnan.  Tamil Nadu had estimated its adult population as 6.06 crore based on state health intelligence bureau calculations, but the census projects it at 5.78 crore. However, it puts the number of people above 60 at 1.04 crore, higher than TNs estimate of 86 lakh. This pushed the vaccine coverage for the vulnerable elderly population from 51% (first dose) to 42% although the decrease pushed up the overall coverage for the first dose to 62% from the previous 59% (first dose). Worse, only 18% of the elderly are fully vaccinated compared to the state average of 20%. After the delta variant pushed up daily cases up to 36,000 in May, the pace of vaccinations rose state. “Yet, nearly 3/5ths of senior citizens remain deeply vulnerable,” said Radhakrishnan. Death audits from TN and from across the country show older people still account for most Covid-19 deaths. Vellore-based virologist Dr T Jacob John has been quoting from medical journals and epidemiological statistics from across the globe to show how increase in vaccination led to fewer deaths. “Senior citizens are among the most vulnerable, which is why the government offered them priority in the mass vaccination drive,” he said. “It is also important to remember that vaccine offers desired protection only when the person has taken the second booster dose.” Since September 25, TN has reported 149 deaths. Nearly 108 deaths (72%) were people above 60. More than 80% had comorbid conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. “Although younger, unvaccinated adults are making up an increasing share of positive cases, a vast majority of people hospitalised and those dying from Covid-19 are people who are older and unvaccinated,” said infectious diseases expert Dr Subramanian Swaminathan. Signing up senior citizens for their first shot is a struggle. “Most people who really wanted a vaccine have already gotten it. More people are resistant to immunisation mostly because they are ill informed, said health minister Ma Subramanian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tamil-nadu-has-more-senior-citizens-not-fully-vaccinated-than-estimated/articleshow/86720354.cms||---

---||Erode||Tamil Nadu has more senior citizens not fully vaccinated than estimated||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu has a far higher share of elderly people without full Covid-19 vaccine protection than estimated, analysis based on the Centre’s revised mid-year population tally shows. This is a key risk factor driving serious illness and death, After several states sought clarification over differences in the estimated adult population, ministry of health and family welfare additional secretary Manohar Agnani sent the revised age specific population for TN to health secretary J Radhakrishnan.  Tamil Nadu had estimated its adult population as 6.06 crore based on state health intelligence bureau calculations, but the census projects it at 5.78 crore. However, it puts the number of people above 60 at 1.04 crore, higher than TNs estimate of 86 lakh. This pushed the vaccine coverage for the vulnerable elderly population from 51% (first dose) to 42% although the decrease pushed up the overall coverage for the first dose to 62% from the previous 59% (first dose). Worse, only 18% of the elderly are fully vaccinated compared to the state average of 20%. After the delta variant pushed up daily cases up to 36,000 in May, the pace of vaccinations rose state. “Yet, nearly 3/5ths of senior citizens remain deeply vulnerable,” said Radhakrishnan. Death audits from TN and from across the country show older people still account for most Covid-19 deaths.

TN principal secretary, environment and forests, Supriya Sahu tweeted this information after a function with the traders. Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi was also present. Sahu is also the chairman of TN Pollution Control Board. The corporation is the competent authority that enforces plastic ban in the city. Bedi told TOI that they have exhorted the traders to use only paper and jute bags. A series of meetings has been conducted with traders and plastic bag manufacturers on this. An NGO provided cloth bags for the function today. "Zonal teams of GCC will be enforcing the plastic ban. We will initially be using persuasion instead of fines," Bedi said. According to official data, GCC seized 2173 kg of plastics and imposed Rs 5.54 lakh as fine in August. The seizures decreased to 488 kg and fine to Rs 1.01 lakh in September. During the meeting, Sahu said, “Every week, we eat microplastics equivalent to the weight of a credit card. This is why we need to move to cloth bags (yellow cloth bags),” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-koyambedu-market-may-become-plastic-free/articleshow/86720402.cms||---

A total of 14 fresh cases were reported on Saturday, taking the tally to 347 in the district. At 60, Harsaon has reported the most number of cases, followed by Vijay Nagar, Shastri Nagar and Govindpuram areas. “We have been carrying out regular inspections of households. But people in Harsaon are not taking precautions. They are allowing water to accumulate in their areas and providing a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes,” said RK Gupta, the district surveillance officer. “We have intensified fogging drives in the area. But we can’t do much without the support of residents,” he added. According to Gupta, Neeti Khand and Gyan Khand are emerging as new dengue hotspots. “More than a dozen dengue cases have been reported in these areas over the past few days. We have informed the GDA. On our part, we have been carrying out inspections and fogging drives,” said Gupta. An extended monsoon is also being blamed for the rising cases. “It is a fact that when it rains heavily, dengue numbers rise. But cases will continue to rise in the winter as well if proper steps are not taken,” said Gupta. Lauding the role of the Kaushambi RWA, Gupta pointed out that the township had reported just a couple of cases so far. “Kaushambi has emerged as a role model in tackling dengue cases, which are far less compared to other parts of the city. This has been made possible by the RWA, which is carrying out fogging drives on its own,” said Gupta. Seven of the 14 dengue patients had to be admitted to hospitals on Saturday. So far, 249 people with dengue have been hospitalised. “Of the 249 people who needed hospitalisation, many have recovered and have been discharged. As of now, there are 65 patients in hospitals. No malaria or scrub typhus cases were reported on Saturday,” a health department official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/gzb-dengue-cases-reach-347-harsaon-worst-hit/articleshow/86718159.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Chandigarh||Rules that deprive soldiers’ widows of liberalised pension void: Armed Forces Tribunal||CHANDIGARH: The Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) has declared the Army regulations that deprive a soldier’s widow of liberalised family pension if she is remarried to a person other than her husband’s brother as void as these are highly discriminatory and violate public policy. Although after the Fifth Central Pay Commission in 1996, the government had amended this policy, but the widows who were entitled to such pension prior to 1996 were deprived of LFP for marrying a person other than the brother of the deceased husband. “A widow is competent and entitled to remarry according to her choice and will. The conditions preventing the remarriage of the widow or restricting her choice to marry to the late husband's brother alone for claiming LFP will only be conditions imposed in restraint of marriage and hence, violate the public policy to be followed in respect of marriage. Therefore, those two conditions stipulated in paragraph 3 of Appendix-II to the Regulations are void as they are against the public policy in respect of marriage. Those conditions, are liable to be declared as void and hence, we declare so,” the tribunal has held.AFT's Lucknow bench, comprising Justice Umesh Chandra Srivastava, judicial member and Vice Admiral Abhay Raghunath Karve, administrative member, has passed these orders while allowing an application filed by Girija Devi, whose husband Sepoy Shree Kishan, a native of village Surwari in Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh was killed in the 1971 war. Widow given normal family pensionApplicant’s husband was enrolled in the Army on January 14, 1968 and died in action during 1971 Indo-Pak war and was declared as Battle Casualty. After this, the applicant was granted Special Family Pension from February 1, 1972, till her re-marriage with Hukam Singh on May 6, 1974. After remarriage, she was paid ordinary family pension. She had submitted an application to authorities in October 2011 informing that the parents of the deceased soldier had died prior to 2006 but a liberalised family pension was not granted to her. She had approached the AFT for grant of LFP. The LFP of the applicant, was discontinued on her remarriage as it violated paragraph 3 of Appendix-II of the regulations governing the matter. It specifies that the payment of allowance shall, however, be continued to a widow who remarries the late husband's brother and lives a communal life with the living heirs eligible for family pension. After hearing all the parties, the AFT observed that these provisions cannot be held to be valid in the light of the public policy in respect of marriage of a person. The tribunal directed the authorities to release her LFP within four months. Liberalised family pension is granted in special cases and is equal to reckonable emoluments last drawn by the soldier at the time of his death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rules-that-deprive-soldiers-widows-of-liberalised-pension-void-armed-forces-tribunal/articleshow/86720308.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Amritsar||Paddy procurement: Farmers gherao residences of top politicians, DC offices in Punjab and Haryana||BATHINDA/PATIALA/AMBALA: Hours before the Centre reviewed its order on paddy procurement in Punjab and Haryana, scores of farmers from both the states gheraoed several DC offices and residences of MLAs and ministers on Saturday morning in a bid to pressurise the two state governments to start the process at the earliest. The Centre on Thursday had deferred procurement of kharif paddy in Punjab and Haryana, which usually begins on October 1, to October 11 as the crop maturity is delayed and moisture content in fresh arrival is beyond permissible limits owing to recent heavy rains. In Haryana, violent clashes were reported in Panchkula and Karnal. Enraged farmers surrounded Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s at Prem Nagar in Karnal and even pitched a tent outside. Hundreds of farmers and labourers from various parts of Karnal district had gathered at the new grain market in Karnal. After holding a meeting there, led by BKU (Charuni) district president Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, they started their march in paddy-laden tractor-trailers and other vehicles towards the Haryana CM’s residence. The police, however, tried to stop them by barricading and using mild water cannons on the crowd, but farmers broke the barricades even as a heavy police force including paramilitary was also deployed at the CM residence to deal with any law and order situation. Elsewhere in Haryana, residences of several BJP and JJP leaders were gheraod. There was a serious law and order situation in Sirsa, as farmers broke barricades outside MP Sunita Duggal’s residence and staged a dharna. However, the situation was brought under control after senior police officials reached the spot. Later, the farmers organised a langar outside the MP’s residence. In neighbouring Hisar, the farmers submitted a memorandum to MLA Kamal Gupta, while in Fatehabad, MLA Dura Ram’s house was gheraod. In Ambala, the farmers started a march from the new grain market and proceeded with paddy-laden tractortrolleys towards the residence of BJP’s Ambala MLA Aseem Goel. According to sources, several police barricades were broken near the MLAs residence, but later the farmers sat on a peaceful protest outside the house. In Kurukshetra’s Shahabad-Markanda town, farmers assembled near the residences of Haryana sports and youth affairs minister Sandeep Singh and JJP’s Shahabad MLA Ram Karan Kala and staged protests. In Yamunanagar’s Jagadhri city, they staged a protest near the house of Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal. Heavy police forces were deputed by the concerned district administrations at all protest sites to protect the residences of the ruling party leaders in Haryana. In Punjab’s Patiala and Bathinda, farmers handed over memorandums to the respective deputy commissioners, and demanded paddy procurement from Monday. The protesting farmers also warned that if the deadline is missed, they will sit on an indefinite strike in front of DC offices across the state. In Patiala, a group of farmers also staged protests near the houses of MLAs Brahm Mohindra and Rajinder Singh. Interestingly, both Punjab and Haryana chief ministers claimed credit for the Centre’s decision to start procurement from Sunday. Khattar, who along with deputy CM Dushyant Chautala and agriculture minister Jai Parkash Dalal, met Union minister of state for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Ashwini Kumar Choubey in New Delhi on Saturday said the Centre had agreed to his delegation’s request of starting procurement from October 3 as most of the grain had already reached the mandis. “I am happy that he accepted our request,” he said. Similarly, the statement from the office of Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, who had raised the issue of kharif procurement during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, said the Centre had ‘acceded’ to the CM’s request. “Expressing gratitude to PM Modi for his immediate personal intervention in this regard,” Channi said this decision would be instrumental in ensuring smooth and hassle-free procurement of paddy to the satisfaction of the farmers. BKU Charuni national president Gurnam Singh Charuni termed the protest as a victory of farmers, saying, “Once again, a big victory for the farmers, assurance given to start paddy procurement from tomorrow (October 3) after gherao of MLAs and MPs in Haryana and Punjab. Thanks to farmer associates and if the government does not start procurement by tomorrow, then roads will be blocked on Monday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/farmers-gherao-residences-of-top-politicians-dc-offices-in-punjab-and-haryana/articleshow/86720368.cms||---

The motions are the mechanism by which members of the IUCN influence and guide the policy and programme of the IUCN, which is the world’s largest and the most diverse environmental network with more than 1,500 members — including states, government agencies, NGOs, and indigenous peoples’ organizations — and over 15,000 international experts associated with its six commissions. As the only international conservation forum that brings governments, civil society, and indigenous peoples’ organizations to the same table, the IUCN members’ assembly carries a powerful mandate. Members vote to approve motions, and once adopted, they become resolutions and recommendations, and therefore the body of IUCN’s general policy that guides conservation strategies across the world. The Corbett Foundation, a member of the IUCN, took the lead in reposting this motion in May 2019 and received support from organizations like Aaranyak, BNHS, Gujarat Ecology Society, Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT), Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), and Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), and global bodies like BirdLife International and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (UK). Due to the pandemic, the resolution was passed only last month. The resolution preventing extinction of the GIBs (Ardeotis nigriceps) in India would help to further intensify and strengthen the efforts to conserve and protect the last surviving population of the birds. Listed as critically endangered, less than 150 GIBs remain in the wild today, mainly in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, while a few are sporadically reported in the Cholistan parts of Pakistan adjoining Rajasthan and Gujarat. In the last couple of decades, the steep decline in the population of GIB is primarily due to their collision with the overhead power lines which have rapidly increased around the bustard habitat. In addition to this, hunting, uncontrolled livestock grazing, predation by feral dogs, changing crop patterns, indiscriminate use of pesticides, and conversion of grasslands and semi-arid regions for projects are other reasons for the decline of GIBs. Concerned over this, the Supreme Court on April 19, 2021, had asked to lay underground power lines passing through identified GIB habitats. The court has also ordered installation of bird-diverters on the power lines till these are made underground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/iucn-world-congress-pitches-for-gib-conservation-in-india/articleshow/86729806.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The district was left with only 5,000 doses of vaccine on September 30, when it reported 17,796 inoculations at 176 government sites. The next day, the authorities went all in, and put the 5,000-odd doses in the field. Around 500 doses were still left over, which the administration used on Saturday. District immunisation in-charge, Dr Tarun Gupta, said, “We will receive around 1 lakh doses on Saturday evening for use on Monday. The next schedule will be planned on the basis of this lot.” Asked about vaccine stocks, Dr Gupta said, “Vaccines are being distributed to districts that are yet to achieve 100% targeted doses. More vaccine doses were diverted to such districts so that they can cover their targets as early as possible.” Only four districts have achieved 100% of the vaccine target – Indore, Bhopal, Agar Malwa and Harda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/indore-district-uses-up-all-its-covid-19-vaccines-supply-of-1-lakh-doses-due-on-saturday/articleshow/86720604.cms||Antriksh Singh

In its interim order, the EC has directed both the groups to indicate the names of three free symbols so that any one of which may be allotted to their candidates. Both the groups have also been directed to submit, by November 5, their respective documents to support their claims for the substantive hearing on their dispute. The EC directives must have upset Chirag, who has announced to field his party candidates against JD(U) in the bypolls for which October 8 is the last date for filing nomination. On the other hand, NDA leaders claim that Paras would campaign for the JD(U) candidates. On June 14, Paras told the EC that he had been elected as the LJP leader in Parliament. On June 17, former MP Surajbhan Singh submitted that Paras had been elected as the LJP national president. Two days later, Paras informed the EC about the newly formed LJP national executive committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ec-freezes-ljps-name-symbol-till-chirag-paswan-pashupati-paras-settle-dispute/articleshow/86720591.cms||Ramashankar
---||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Punjab vaccination pace drops again||CHANDIGARH: The Covid vaccination drive has again slowed down in Punjab due to drying up of stock, throwing a spanner in state governments plan of providing at least one dose to the eligible population by October end. After struggling for long, the state government had managed to up the pace of the drive. However, due to non-availability of doses in required numbers, immunisation numbers have again dropped significantly in recent days. According to the state health authorities, Punjab ran out of Covishield doses on September 29, while the allocated stock of Covaxin was exhausted by October 1. Between September 1 to 26, the state health department managed to inoculate 2,18,134 eligible beneficiaries per day on average, the average per day count of which dropped to 58,381 during the five-day period from September 27 to October 1. If Punjab continues to have such lean days regularly, it might not be able to achieve its immunisation targets. Punjab’s nodal officer for vaccination Vikas Garg maintained that the pace of vaccination drive depends upon the availability of the stock. “The daily numbers are high when there are required number of doses in the stock. As the stock depletes, the numbers go down,” said Garg. He, however, said that the central government is replenishing the stock as per schedule. The Centre had last supplied about eight lakh doses in the second week of September. Against the allocation of 41,63,150 for September, Punjab received 45,25,610 doses — 38,49,690 of Covishield and 6,75,920 of Covaxin.

Against the recommended limit of 24 beds per one lakh population, hospitals in districts of Haryana had only 13 beds per one lakh population while in Punjab the number of beds stood at 18 per lakh. The hill state of Himachal Pradesh was found doing better than its two neighbouring states with 46 beds. In Himachal, only one hospital out of 11 (9.09%) fulfilled the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) norms for positioned required number of doctors while no hospital in the state met the laid down norms pertaining to staff nurses. In Punjab, 10 district hospitals out of 22 (45.45%) had the required number of doctors and only two (9.09%) had the requisite strength of staff nurses. In terms of the ratio of medical staff, Haryana outperformed both the states with 16 out of 18 (88.89%) hospitals meeting the mandated number of doctors and seven fulfilling norms related to positioning of staff nurses. For timely recruitment of doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff, the central government has recommended a periodic review of the vacancies in all district hospitals In Haryana, seven district hospitals fulfilled the criteria of having all the 14 mandatory support services including OPD, IPD, pharmacy, sterilisation and disinfection, fully-equipped blood bank, waste management, medico-legal/post-mortem service, hospital transport ambulance, dietary services for patient, electric supply, drugs and pharmacy, water supply and refrigeration. Two civil Hospitals of Haryana -- Hisar and Panchkula— featured in the list of top-performing district hospitals in the country having all the identified 14 services. None of the hospitals in Punjab and Himachal managed to make the cut. Hospitals in Punjab and Himachal on average provide 10 and 11 services, respectively, against the national average of 11. For improving the services, experts have asked for periodic review and reporting on the quality of services for identify the gaps and take necessary actions. Hospitals of the region do not have all the identified diagnostic testing services that hold the key to early detection and proper treatment. Not even a single district hospital had all the 14 diagnostics services which include urine analysis, stool analysis, PAP smear, sputum, haematology, microbiology, serology, biochemistry, cardiac investigations, ophthalmology, ENT, radiology, endoscopy and physiology. On average, hospitals in Himachal and Haryana offer 10 such services while 11 diagnostic services are available in the government-run hospitals in Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/performance-assessment-report-finds-region-dist-hospitals-lacking/articleshow/86717520.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Chandigarh||Ellenabad bypoll: INLD to pick candidate today, likely to field Abhay Singh Chautala||CHANDIGARH: As the countdown for filing nominations for the Ellenabad assembly seat begin, the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) is expected to finalise its candidate on Sunday in its national and state executive body meeting. The meeting has been called in Sirsa at 10am and INLD supremo and former CM O P Chautala and senior party leader Abhay Singh Chautala would address it. The main agenda of the meeting is to take the opinion of party leaders about nominee for the Ellenabad bypoll. However, highly placed sources confirmed that Abhay is likely to be the party nominee although there were speculations about his younger son Arjun being fielded from the seat. Sources said the party wants Abhay to contest, as a senior leader like him would be able to give a tough contest to the opposition party candidates because of his clout and influence. Abhay has been representing the seat since 2010. However, Arjun Chautala, who unsuccessfully contested the 2019 parliamentary election on the party ticket from Kurukshetra, is already active in the constituency and has been visiting the villages. Sources added that the party may consider the name of farmer leader Suresh Kauth, if it is decided to field a candidate from outside the Chautala family. As for Congress, there are three main contenders for the ticket — Bharat Singh Beniwal, who had unsuccessfully contested the October 2019 assembly polls as party nominee; and Pawan Beniwal, who recently joined the Congress and was runner up in the last assembly polls as BJP candidate. Captain Amardeep Singh, who is Congress leader and a close member of former deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal’s family, is also among the ticket contenders. BJP’s strongest candidate Beniwal has already joined the Congress. While the BJP candidate finished second in the last assembly election, the performance of the JJP candidate was worse as he could get only around 6,500 votes to finish fourth. This time there are reports that the saffron party may field Aditya Devilal, who is the great-grandson of Devi Lal. The ruling BJP-JJP coalition government, however, may also consider someone from JJP and the candidate may be asked to contest on party symbol. The Ellenabad assembly seat has been vacant since January 27 on account of the resignation of INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala. Recently, the Election Commission had notified the bypoll, for which the nomination process started from October 1 and the last date of filing the papers is October 8. The polling would be held on October 30 and the counting done on November 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ellenabad-bypoll-inld-to-pick-candidate-today-likely-to-field-abhay/articleshow/86717599.cms||---

Her mother had saved the money for her marriage and medical expenses, she said in a final audio message to her family. It’s probably the first suicide in Bhopal due to an online scam. From preliminary investigation, police suspect it was an investment fraud. Investigation officer SI Vinod Dwivedi said the victim had a masters in education and used to give tuitions at home. Around 6.30am on Saturday, her family suddenly realized she wasn’t in their fourth-floor apartment. They had just begun looking for her when neighbours told them that she was found lying injured on the ground. She was taken to hospital where doctors declared her dead on arrival. She had climbed to the seventh floor and jumped, SI Dwivedi said. She didn’t leave any suicide note. Woman had made an audio on why she was killing herselfIn shock, the family had no clue to what had happened until her brother, a Bengaluru techie who is now working from home in Bhopal, saw a text message she had sent her and an audio recording on her mobile phone, in which she explained why she was killing herself, said Kolar TI Chandrakant Patel. In her last messages, she had said that she lost around Rs 5 lakh in an online investment, and was depressed because she knew her mother had saved it for medical and wedding expenses, said ASP Zone-1 Ankit Jaiswal. She probably fell victim to cyber-frauds, said police. Kolar cops have registered a case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/rs-5-lakh-lost-in-online-fraud-woman-kills-self-in-bhopal/articleshow/86720713.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chautala will not contest Ellenabad bypoll||Hisar: Former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala will not be contesting the Ellenabad byelection. His son and INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala hinted as much during a conversation with media persons in Hisar on Saturday. Umed Singh Lohan, who joined INLD after leaving Congress, was also present at the venue. At an event organised in Sirsa on June 29, Abhay had said that if there is no legal hurdle, his father will be the candidate in the Ellenabad byelection. However, later he said the party will field Chautala in the general assembly elections, meaning the patriarch will not contest the byelection. The INLD leader also hit out at the Congress, after a party leader said that Abhay should not contest the elections before the farmers’ issue is resolved, saying it was on the same page as the BJP. “This is the reason that even when two assembly sessions were held after my resignation, the Congress did not raise the issue of holding the Ellenabad byelection even once,” he said. “The government is so scared of this election that it has written to the election commission that there is no need to hold elections in the state during Covid-19. At the same time, it has informed the high court that the conditions are right to hold panchayat elections,” he said. On the basis of these two letters, he wrote a letter to the election commission, after which Ellenabad byelection was announced, he added. BJP, Congress and JJP do not have candidates to contest the elections but have appointed many leaders each as election in-charge, he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chautala-will-not-contest-ellenabad-bypoll/articleshow/86717667.cms||---
---||Noida||Bonded labour case filed against realtor after 41 ‘freed’ from site||Greater Noida: An FIR has been lodged against the CMD of Migsun Group under the Bonded Labour Act after 41 people “rescued” from a project site alleged that they had been forced to work there without pay for the past two months. Sachin Sharma, the Migsun vice-president, did not respond to calls and messages for a comment. However, company officials at the project site in Jor Bagh called the allegations baseless. Prasoon Dwivedi, the SDM (Sadar), said they received information from an NGO, Bandhua Mukti Morcha, that 41 construction labourers and their family members had been confined at the project site for more than two months. “A team was constituted and the project site searched. As many as 41 labourers, including 14 women and children, were found to be working there. The workers said they did not want to stay there and requested us to send them home. They said they had been given just Rs 100-200 once since they started working there,” he added. The site was searched on Thursday by a team from the Surajpur police station along with officials from the labour department and the district administration. On Friday night, the 41 workers and their family members — all from Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh — were sent home. “Their statements were recorded. They alleged that the company officials would not allow them to leave the project site together. Only one person was allowed to go out at a time. Their release certificates were prepared and they were sent to their villages,” Dwivedi said. Nirmal Gorana of Bandhua Mukti Morcha, who informed the administration about the labourers on September 21, said the workers had come to the city around three months ago and were promised jobs at a construction site by a private contractor, Mahesh Yadav. “The contractor took his commission and vanished. The workers were made to slog for 12 hours every day. After one month, when they sought wages, they were told that they should not be asking for any money since they were being given food and a place to stay on the project site. Even if they wanted to, they could not leave. Only one person would be allowed to go out at a time,” Gorana said. One of the labourers, Dharmendra, got in touch with the National Campaign Committee for Eradication of Bonded Labour, which Gorana had convened. “I approached the officials on September 21. For the next seven days, the officials kept talking on the phone. It was on Thursday that a team searched the project site and freed the labourers,” Gorana said. Chandan Tiwari, the project site in-charge, denied the allegations. “The labourers came here only on September 5. We have the entry records. According to company rules, labourers are paid Rs 2,000 each through their contractor after 15 days of work because many leave without completing the job. In this case, the workers were paid the amount,” he said, adding that the dispute over payment was usually between the contractor and the workers. Dwivedi said the Migsun CMD, Sunil Miglani, had been booked under various sections of the Bonded Labour Act, 1976, following a complaint by the Sadar tehsildar. “They have said they will respond only in court with evidence. It’s true that some cases are motivated. The builder's arguments will be looked into once the case is heard and any suspicious element will be checked,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/bonded-labour-case-filed-against-realtor-after-41-freed-from-site/articleshow/86717695.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Chandigarh||Surjewala for judicial probe into HSSC’s sub-inspector post exam||Chandigarh: Nearly a week after the written exam for recruitment to the 400 posts of sub inspectors of Haryana Police was conducted by Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC), AICC spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjwala on Saturday alleged that three sets of question papers, instead of one, were opened for students in Rewari and Gurugram, and manifold OMR sheets were issued to exam centres. Surjewala hit out the BJP-JJP government, and HSSC chairman and its members, over the allegations. He demanded the disbanding of HSSC and a judicial probe by two sitting judges of Punjab and Haryana high court. “”In Gurugram and Rewari, three sets of question papers were handed out to candidates within the duration of one session. What does this mean and why did this happen? Examination centres were given additional stocks of OMR sheets; this too raises eyebrows as it is easy to change the OMR sheet at any stage at examination halls itself,’’ said Surjewala This clearly shows that HSSC has become a retail outlet of jobs for the government of Haryana and BJP-JJP. Notably, 1.58 lakh candidates had applied for the 400 posts of male subinspectors in Haryana police and 1.07 lakh candidates had appeared in exams conducted across the state on September 26. “What is the reason that even after a week, HSSC has not released the answer key of question papers. Now, they have asked for objections and candidates are questioning the reasons for change of question papers and retest at Gurugram and Rewari. They are now demanding the retest of entire batch. Will this government or Commission agree, certainly not?’’ said Randeep. He claimed that HSSC had changed the pattern of questions as well. This is in addition to the allegations of BJP leaders being glorified in the exam. “There was no such pattern which could suggest that it (the exam) was meant for subinspector of Haryana Police. Questions like name the BJP leader of Uttrakhand linked to Haryana and name the BJP MP whose father died recently? Name the Haryana DGP who died recently? How are such questions linked to exams?” He questioned||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/surjewala-for-judicial-probe-into-hsscs-sub-inspector-post-exam/articleshow/86717694.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Let’s have a race, Kamal Nath to Shivraj Singh Chouhan||BHOPAL: Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and LOP Kamal Nath on Saturday challenged chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to run a race with him, following repeated statements by BJP that he is unwell and recuperating in Delhi. Nath returned to Bhopal after a fortnight on Saturday morning, and said: “There has been a lot of discussion about my health. Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that Kamal Nath is unwell, he has aged. Shivraj ji, I challenge you to come and run a race with me.” In response, BJP state chief V D Sharma said there wasn’t any race left for Nath in Madhya Pradesh. Nath said he had gone for a “post-Covid check-up” because he had pneumonia. “It can happen to anyone,” he said. He had left Bhopal on September 17 after conducting an organizational meeting, and returned on Saturday. From the airport, he drove directly to Minto Hall, where he paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri. BJP reacts to Nath’s dare, says no race left for Cong veteran in MPI went through a complete checkup and everything is normal. There are two kinds of Covid, one minor and another that requires long treatment. I had got the long Covid. That is why I went for a check-up,” Kamal Nath said. “I was in New Delhi because I have a lot of responsibilities there. It was not as though I was unwell and taking rest,” he added. In response to Nath’s challenge to Chouhan, state BJP chief V D Sharma said: “There is no race left for Kamal Nath ji in Madhya Pradesh.” “PCC chief Kamal Nath is like a family member. I pray to God for his health and hope that he gets healthier. So far as a race is concerned, Congress leaders Natwar Singh, Kapil Sibal, Manish Tiwari and many others are presently running a campaign against the Gandhi family,” Sharma said. “Nath should look into who is winning in that race and who is losing there. Thereafter, he can think of a race in Madhya Pradesh. We believe in healthy races, based on welfare schemes for the poor,” he added. Nath, on the other hand, believes he is very much in the race in Madhya Pradesh. His focus is on the bypolls. “We need winnable candidates so we conducted a survey and discussed with all concerned persons. We will soon announce our candidates. The issue today is not the bypolls but how to save the tradition and culture of the nation, how to save the state,” the former CM said. “Today, Madhya Pradesh holds first rank for all the wrong reasons. The recent NCRB report shows that the state tops in atrocities against tribals and farm suicides of farmers. The state also tops in corruption, the reason why no investment is coming to the state,” he said, adding that the youth of the state do not have a secure future in MP. Nath said that his 15-month government provided people with 100 units of power at Rs 100. “Now, the same electricity bills are running into thousands of rupees. CM Chouhan is still speaking untruth and making false announcements. He just wants a dais, or a foundation stone so he can lay it anywhere. He made thousands of false announcements in the last 15 years and keeps misleading people with falsities,” the LOP said, adding that he is confident that the people of MP will support Congress to secure their future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-lets-have-a-race-kamal-nath-to-shivraj-singh-chouhan/articleshow/86720751.cms||---

Soon after receiving the news of her husband’s death, Meenakshi had rushed to the hotel where the incident had taken place. The video, shot during her hotel visit, purportedly shows that the scene of crime was tampered with. She has raised allegations that blood stains were also wiped from the floor and her husband’s wallet and ID card were taken away from the room but his slippers were left untouched. In the video, Meenakshi is seen questioning a cop why the area was not sealed and why people were being allowed after the crime took place. “Had the crime been committed by a common man, the entire premises would have been sealed but as the crime involves cops it has not been done,” Meenakshi is heard saying in the video.

According to an eyewitness, Ramesh, the driver did not slow down while approaching a speedbreaker in Betma (about 30km short of Indore), said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/dengue-patient-on-way-to-indore-hospital-dies-in-crash/articleshow/86720819.cms||---

It fell short of CM Bommai’s ambitious target of 5 lakh doses every day, totalling 1.5 crore doses a month, though more than 5 lakh doses were administered on multiple days in the month. The state administered more than 5 lakh doses on six days in September, including a record 31.7 lakh doses on September 17. However, of the 24 other days, the state crossed 4 lakh doses only on September 7, while nine days saw more than 3 lakh doses administered. The lowest daily vaccination was reported on September 26 (35,453), followed by September 10 (60,203). The state administered under 1 lakh doses on two other days — September 12 (79,410) and September 16 (81,385). Micro-level strategyAccording to health commissioner Dr KV Trilok Chandra, the state received 1.32 crore doses during September and it managed to administer 1.39 crore doses “as it had an opening balance” at the beginning of the month. He said the supply side was not a problem now and that the state is scheduled to receive another 1.3 crore doses in October, which may even increase. “...As we near the home stretch we are looking at a micro-level strategy at the GP (gram panchayat) and sub-GP level (village level) to cover the groups that have been left out,” Chandra said. By 7pm on Saturday, the state had administered the first dose to more than 3.9 crore people of the more than 4.9 crore eligible for vaccination. Of the 3.9 crore people, more than 1.7 crore had even been given a second dose. Third waveWhile the country’s wait for a children’s vaccine is not over yet, Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar said on Friday that it may be available this month. The state government continues to prepare for a possible third wave which according to some experts is likely to affect children more. Chandra said that compared to just 3% of all testing accounting for children last week, 11% of all testing this week has been of children (0-19 years). As reported by TOI earlier, the state has also been ramping up infrastructure and has already hired around 2,900 additional doctors, including specialists, while another 2,000 are expected to join soon. “As educational institutions have begun functioning, we expect some cases to be reported, but there are mechanisms in place to quickly isolate such cases and prevent further spread,” Chandra added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-administers-record-1-3-crore-vax-doses-in-september/articleshow/86720830.cms||Chethan Kumar

In August too, the city was in the ‘deficit’ category (41%) as there was only 114.3mm rainfall. However, due to a flurry of rainy days in July and then in September, now there is a 47% surplus. IMD data showed that in July and September, 112% (379.2 mm) and 158% (228.2mm) surplus rain was recorded in Gurgaon. Overall, the city has received 738.9mm of rainfall this season, considerably more than the normal (503.3mm). Since 2015, the city has reported either normal or rain deficits. In 2020, it saw 507.5mm rains, which was 1% more than the normal (503.3mm). The city had a 43% rain deficit in 2019 and received 284.7mm rainfall against the normal of 503.3mm. The monsoon this year was particularly kind to the city, which saw some heavy rainfall for short spells. Two days recorded heavy showers. The city saw 145 mm rain on July 19 and 64.2 mm on September 1. Also, there were nine days of moderate rain. Notably, the maximum rainfall was recorded in September, which had 14 rainy days, followed by 12 in July, nine in June and eight in August. “Normally, we don’t see much rain in September in the region. But, the city received nearly double the normal this year. This happened due to a weather system frequently forming over the Bay of Bengal as well as the easterlies bringing moisture into the region,” said RK Jenamani, a senior scientist at IMD. According to the IMD official, the conditions are likely to be favourable for the start of the withdrawal of southwest monsoon from some parts of northwest India around October 6. “The change in wind pattern and reduction in moisture is making it a favourable condition for the withdrawal. There are still 5-7 days before the retreat from NCR region starts. As a result, passing showers at isolated places may be witnessed in a few areas,” the official said. Meanwhile, warm and sultry conditions prevailed on Saturday. The maximum temperature was recorded at 35 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 24.6 degrees Celsius — three notches above normal. The relative humidity index oscillated between 80% and 91 % during the day. The weather department has forecasted cloudy skies for Sunday with the mercury hovering between 24 and 34 degrees Celsius. The city’s air quality index (AQI) slightly deteriorated on Saturday but remained in the ‘moderate’ category for the second consecutive day. The overall AQI reading was at 118 against Friday’s 102.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/monsoon-47-surplus-delayed-start-but-rains-cast-heavy-spell/articleshow/86716093.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Told to stop, three men open fire at police team, held||GURUGRAM: Three men have been arrested after they allegedly opened fire at a police team in Bajghera. Another person managed to escape, police said. The incident comes a day after a Faridabad police constable was killed during a raid in Haridwar. Earlier this week, a gang of vehicle-lifters had opened fire on a police team in Sector 50. Police had managed to arrest four of its members. Inspector Anand, in-charge of Sector 31 crime unit, said they received information that four-five youths were planning to execute a crime in Bajghera on Friday night and would be armed and travelling in a vehicle without numberplates. Anand and his team set up a checkpost on Sector 114 road near Bajghera village. In the meantime, they spotted a Mahindra Thar without numberplates coming from the Delhi side. When cops signaled at the driver to stop, instead of stopping, he accelerated and hit the police barricade. One of the policemen sustained minor injuries. Three youths then jumped out of the vehicle and tried to escape while opening fire at the police team. ASI Neerja managed to evade a bullet and it hit a police vehicle. While the team managed to arrest three youths, the fourth managed to escape. The arrested men were identified as Dara Singh, Amit alias Meeta and Abhinav Sharma, all from Najafgarh in New Delhi. An FIR has been registered against them under sections 186 (obstructing public servant), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault against public servant), 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (common intention) of IPC, apart from sections of Arms Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/told-to-stop-three-men-open-fire-at-police-team-held/articleshow/86716117.cms||---

They also threatened to intensify their protests if the government didn’t start the procurement of the paddy crops at the earliest. Santokh Singh, a senior SKM member, said, “The farmers’ movement against the three contentious farm laws is completely peaceful. The government is scared of the peaceful movement of the farmers, and that’s why it’s using unlawful means to end the protest. But these efforts will be counter-productive as the protest will only get stronger.” Farmers, united under SKM and Jai Kisan Andolan, are also up in arms against the government over the delay in the procurement of the paddy crops in the mandis. While the farmers have been staging protests and opposing the events of the BJP-JJP leaders in their districts to express their anger over the three new farm laws, the delay in procurement has further riled them up. Farmers have unanimously decided to intensify their protests outside the offices and residences of the top BJP and JJP leaders in the state and also launch agitations inside the mandis if the government doesn’t start the procurement of the paddy crops soon. “Paddy crops are lying in the field and getting ruined. Farmers need to clear them out to sow the next crop. If this window narrows, they’ll not only face huge losses but will also be under tremendous stress to clear out the stubble timely,” said Deepak Lamba, a member of Jai Kisan Andolan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/govt-scared-of-farmers-peaceful-movement-using-unlawful-means/articleshow/86716159.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: 3 gangsters held for attempt to murder||GURUGRAM: The crime branch of Gurugram police has arrested three criminals, including a member of the notorious Kaushal gang. They were allegedly trying to kill a pharmacist and his brother for refusing to give them narcotic injections. The Kaushal gang member had been out on bail since last year. The three-member group was active for the past several months and they were wanted in cases related to robbery, snatching and loot in different parts of the city. On September 27, Balram and Bahadur were admitted to Sunrise Hospital. On September 29, Bahadur filed a complaint with the police saying that on September 27, a two-wheeler stopped in front of his medical store near Harinagar sabzi mandi and the rider asked him to give narcotic injections. Bahadur told the youth that they don’t sell such injections. “The accused started to argue and fight with Balaram. Two more youth joined and took Rs 20,000 from the counter. One of the them hit Balram on his head with a brick,” said Bahadur. Based on the complaint, a case was registered under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 379A (snatching) and 34 (common intention) of IPC at Sector 37 police station. The crime unit of Sector 10 managed to arrest the accused from Rajiv Chowk on Friday. The accused were identified as Sujit alias Bullet, a resident of Hari Nagar, Ashlam alias Nazim from Shakti Park and Manish alias Gollu from Gurgaon. “During interrogation, it was found that Sujit was a member of Kaushal gang. He was in jail for the murder of Vijay Batra alias Tantrik in 2019. He came out of jail last year and formed his group to commit crimes like snatching and robbery,” said ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/3-gangsters-held-for-attempt-to-murder/articleshow/86716135.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Woman, who lost her husband to Covid, kills two kids, ends life||BENGALURU: A 40-year-old homemaker allegedly killed her two children before hanging herself inside her residence at Prakruti Layout in Madanayakanahalli near Nelamangala, Bengaluru Rural, on Friday. The deceased are P Vasantha, Yashwanth, 15 and Nishita, 6. Vasantha’s husband, Prasanna Kumar, a BMTC driver-cum-conductor, had succumbed to Covid-19 in mid-2020 pushing the family into a deep financial crisis, police said. Vasantha left behind a three-page death note written in Kannada, in which she concedes that the death of her husband and the subsequent challenges had pushed her into depression. The incident came to light late on Friday when Vasantha’s younger brother Nandish visited her house after his sister had failed to answer his calls. Nandish and a few neighbours peeped through the window and saw Vasantha and Nishita hanging from a ceiling fan of a bedroom and Yashwanth hanging from the fan in the hall. Nandish said Vasantha was treated for depression soon after her husband’s death. “She underwent treatment for more than four months. But she was dejected after her husband’s death and the financial crisis, which we feel could have been resolved, did not help either.” Stating that he had lived with his sister’s family for about five months after Kumar died, Nandish said he moved to Dasarahalli after his marriage. “Yesterday, my sister’s friend Renuka called me saying she was standing outside her house and that nobody was responding. Renuka wanted to purchase the house Vasantha lived in. I tried to contact my sister on her mobile phone, but in vain. Then I came to the house,” he said. Sources said Kumar had raised a loan of Rs 20 lakh from a bank for the construction of a house four years ago. Police said in her death note, Vasantha wrote: “No one will come to help and I have realised it. No one helped us when my husband died. I have no interest in life without my husband. We had raised a loan and now I have the responsibility to repay it. I request concerned persons to repay our loan. I don’t want to cheat anyone in life. No one is responsible for our death.” Police said the neighbours had seen Vasantha coming out of the house and turning on the water motor pump in the morning. “She was seen somewhere during the afternoon also. The incident might have taken place after 2pm or 3pm,” police said. The family hailed from Periyapatna near Mysuru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-woman-who-lost-her-husband-to-covid-kills-two-kids-ends-life/articleshow/86720886.cms||---

A total of 28,668 voters would seal the fate of four candidates. Polling will be conducted from 8am to 4.30pm and counting of votes will take place immediately after polling, officials have said. The district administration has imposed prohibitory orders near the polling booths on Sunday to ensure a peaceful election process. The four candidates in the fray are Rama Rani Rathee, a former councillor who is fighting on BJP’s ticket this time, while Zile Singh, RWA president of Saraswati Vihar, Jagmohan and Mohit Yadav — both residents of Sikanderpur — are contesting as independents. The seat fell vacant after Rama Rani’s husband RS Rathee succumbed to Covid-19 on May 30 this year. Election officer and Badshapur SDM Satish Yadav said, “All arrangements have been made, with 30 polling parties deployed across 30 booths, along with police personnel. Apart from these, there will be five duty magistrates, 13 supervisors and 17 videographers. Additional police force will also be deployed so that polling could be held peacefully. Section 144 has also been imposed within 200 metres of the booths.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mcg-bypoll-for-ward-34-today-four-in-fray/articleshow/86716189.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||No Covid lull, liquor boosts govt revenue in Karnataka||BENGALURU: Despite the lockdown earlier this year and extended night curfew, the government has earned significant revenue from excise duty on liquor. It collected Rs 12,305 crore between April and September compared to Rs 9,765 crore in the corresponding period last year. This represents a 26 per cent rise. It is also more than half of the revenue target of Rs 24,580 crore for the current fiscal. In September, the government earned Rs 2,081 crore from the sale of 53 lakh carton boxes of Indian-made liquor and 22 lakh boxes of beer. With the festival season beginning and the government relaxing night curfew by an hour (till 10pm), the revenue will likely jump further in the coming quarter. “There is usually a sharp increase in liquor sales in the October-December quarter because of festivals and the beginning of winter. We hope the trend continues this year,” said an excise department official, adding that the collection of excise duty might exceed this year’s budgetary target by at least Rs 1,000 crore. The owners of bars and restaurants in the tech capital have demanded that the government should remove the restrictions on timings so that they can conduct business till 11.30pm. “This will not only increase the revenue for the government but also help us earn extra through our food services. Right now, people are not dining in bars and restaurants as there are curbs. The money we earn from serving liquor is not enough to sustain the business,” said a bar owner in Bengaluru. There were no liquor sales during the nationwide lockdown from March 23 to May 7 last year. Later in May 2020, the state government allowed retail liquor stores to reopen and hiked the additional excise duty (AED) across all slabs of Indian-made liquor to mop up additional revenue of Rs 2,500 crore. That was the second hike in AED after the one announced in the budget. The move boomeranged as the economic slowdown had hit people’s spending power. “But now, the revenue graph is climbing, a sign that economic recovery after the second wave is underway,” said a senior excise official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-covid-lull-liquor-boosts-govt-revenue-in-karnataka/articleshow/86720934.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Lions dumped in Gandhinagar parking lot!||The lion family, often showcased at major junctions during VIP visits, is gathering dust in the open at Aranya Bhavan in Gandhinagar. These exhibits, along with a whale shark, a male lion, a walking lioness, have been dumped in the parking lot without any care. The state would have spent lakhs to get the exhibits made but thereafter no care is taken. It is only during a VIP visit that they leave their parking slot and step out on the road. A senior officer said that such exhibits which are lying unused should be permanently installed at junctions and put to use. When BJ doctors transplanted a tree and it survived!They transplant organs and give new leases of life to people, but doctors and employees of BJ Medical College also gave a new lease of life to a peepal tree near the college by way of transplantation. Dr Harish Khubchandani, a senior faculty member of the forensic medicine department, said that the tree gave shelter to many relatives of patients. “During cyclone Tauktae, the tree was completely uprooted. As the tree was a part of many staffers’ lives, we explored if we could salvage it. We got the equipment and permission from the then medical superintendent Dr J P Modi,” he said. The work paid off as recently the tree started developing new branches, signifying success of the process. “Every tree is important, and we would be happy if our small initiative inspired others,” said Dr Khubchandani. Agency officers or Hollywood stars?Through modern technology, one can easily find out names and identity details of people through phone numbers. This was an area of concern for sleuths working with various police agencies like ATS (Anti-terrorist squad) and crime branch. To avoid their identities being revealed, they made their profiles on social media using the names and pictures of Hollywood stars. An ATS officer who went on a secret operation to Kashmir used the moniker of Matrix star Keanu Reeves. A crime branch officer uses the name of Tom Hanks in his social media profile. Picking up someone from abroad at SVPI airport? Carry your own chair!While the flow of international flights has improved at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad over the past two months, with flights to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Kuwait, London and Sharjah resuming operations, passengers’ kin continue to crowd outside the international terminal, in absence of places to sit. “I came from Bharuch to receive my son, who is returning from Abu Dhabi, UAE. His friends drove me to Ahmedabad. But there’s no space to sit here outside the airport nor any places where we can get some food. I packed some food from home and we had no choice but to sit on the pavement and eat,” said the septuagenarian mother of the flyer who arrived on Friday night. Citizens say that with international flights resuming, infrastructure should be ramped up at the terminal. The concern of inadequate seating space for kin was repeatedly raised even when the airport operated by AAI. A doctor who is fond of taking gifts!Anephrologist who retired from a leading kidney hospital run by the government is still haunting his former patients’ relatives seeking special gifts which he called a gift of bonding. The doctor has made a WhatsApp group using which he seeks gifts like dry fruits, handkerchiefs, socks and even garments from relatives of his former patients. Even when he was working with the government hospital, he used to seek gifts from the patients’ relatives and he could not leave his addiction of seeking gifts. No way govt could have disputed Justice Mehta commission recommendationsThe Gujarat government agreed to most of the recommendations made by Justice D A Mehta commission in the probe report of Shrey Hospital and Uday Shivanand Hospital fire tragedies and it released an Action Taken Report simultaneously, which was a little unusual. By the time the probe panel comes up with suggestions, the Gujarat high court and the Supreme Court had already directed the authorities and hospitals to implement the aspects which have now appeared in the form of recommendations. While the government is already under scanner for strict implementation of fire safety laws, BU permission, ensuring hospital buildings have proper design, implementing new laws like the Clinical Establishment Act etc, it was difficult for the authorities to dispute any of the commission’s recommendations because they are already incumbent upon them as court orders. The road not repairedThe spells of rain this season have left city roads in a bad shape, once again. While the civic body owns up the responsibility for every patch of road damaged in the city, the stretch between the Gujarat University and LD Engineering College has always remained unattended, with potholes ensuring that university students always experience a bumpy ride. Earlier, it took a President’s visit for half of the stretch — up to the Physical Research Laboratory — be resurfaced, , and a PM’s visit for the entire stretch to be resurfaced. Without visits from such political dignitaries, the commutation of real dignitaries, the scientists at the premier institute, matters little to the authorities who pay the least attention to the damaged road. Torn between balancing political and professional livesElected representatives of BJP in Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) have been fighting on many fronts for the past fifteen days and the stress and fatigue is reflected now on their faces. The senior counsellors who hold chairmanships of various committees in the AMC were seen trying to complete their duties in AMC and then rushing off to Gandhinagar for the party's campaign for Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC) elections. “All of us have been given responsibilities for campaigning for the party in GMC elections. We have to do our duties here and then rush to Gandhinagar every day. We have been doing this for the past fortnight. At AMC we have been doing our duty as elected representatives, at GMC we are doing party work but what about our own businesses and professions? We have to take care of that too as our bread and butter comes from that,” said the chairman of a civic body committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lions-dumped-in-gandhinagar-parking-lot/articleshow/86713852.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Officials work on details of new commisionerates||CHENNAI: The newly-appointed special officers of the Tambaram and Avadi commissioner’s office have geared up to bifurcate the existing commissionerate jurisdiction. Chennai airport, which is now under the jurisdiction of the St Thomas Mount deputy commissioner jurisdiction, will continue to be in the Tambaram commissionerate. Though, the state government announced additional director-general of police (ADGP) M Ravi as the special officer of the Tambaram commissionerate, and ADGP Sandeep Rai Rathore as the special officer of the Avadi commissionerate, they are yet to assume office to build the infrastructure and facilities for the new commissionerates. Both officers had earlier worked as the joint commissioners of police and had served a long-stint as part of the city police force. The two officers have collated data and information from a few retired police officers, apart from a few professors and experts to build the new set-up within the least possible time. While Ravi is retiring from uniformed service in May 2022, Rathore is retiring in February 2028. The Greater Chennai police commissioner Sankar Jiwal had conducted a high-level meeting at the commissioner’s office with senior police officers and discussed with them bifurcation plans. Former DGP SR Jangid said, “The two police officers have to work very hard to establish the new commissionerate. The financial department shall have to give some leniency to them so that they can increase their strength to build a strong castle.” The initial plans include the bifurcation of the existing police stations like Ambattur, Mangadu, Selaiyur and Kanathur in the city. Adding more police stations from the adjoining districts – Kancheepuram, Chengalpet, and Tiruvallur – can be settled by discussing with the respective district superintendents of police and senior police officers. There are plans to create new deputy commissionerates in Thoraipakkam, Poonamallee, and Tambaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-officials-work-on-details-of-new-commisionerates/articleshow/86720985.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Haryana: Cost to access, last-mile gaps hit steps to stop stubble fires||KAITHAL/KARNAL/PANIPAT: In Badauli village of Panipat, Rajesh Singh is waiting for his three-acre paddy field — inundated thanks to a long monsoon — to dry up so that he can start preparing for sowing, which means burning the crop residue. “We set the field on fire every year to ensure our land is ready for sowing wheat,” said the 38-year-old farmer.  “The window between the harvesting of paddy and the sowing of wheat is small,” he added, indicating he will do the same this year as soon as the fields get dry. Each year, farm fires that accompany harvesting in Haryana and Punjab choke the region and elevate Delhi-NCR’s pollution to alarming levels in October-November. Over the past few years, the Haryana government has introduced several measures to check this. These include Happy Seeders, reversive plough, Super Seeders, rotavator and mulchers, all implements that have been introduced to lessen the incidence of farm fires. Custom hiring centres have been set up in ‘hotspot’ villages as well to provide machinery and equipment to small farmers for harvesting and managing crop residue. The centres also mark areas in panchayats to store stubble. Yet, many farmers are once again preparing to set stubble on fire to ready their fields for sowing. At farms in Karnal, Kaithal and Panipat that TOI visited, the common refrain is that it remains the most convenient way of getting rid of stubble. There is reticence about the alternatives, especially among small farmers, because they are either “too costly” or “too cumbersome”. This has created a last-mile gap between the tech interventions and many peasants. Karnal and Kaithal were among districts that reported most farm fires last year. According to government data, Haryana has 6,150 paddy growing villages and 16.17 lakh farmers. Since 2018, the state has provided 15,000 Happy Seeders on 50% subsidy to individual farmers and on 80% to cooperatives. Happy Seeders are tractor-operated machines for in-situ management of straw. The equipment chops and evenly spreads the stubble and adds its organic value to the soil. After this, farmers can directly sow wheat seeds in the field. Happy Seeders have had some success, especially in Karnal, but remain out of reach for many farmers still.  Asked if he had used a Happy Seeder, Rajesh Singh replied, “I applied once in 2018, but it is a tedious process. I was told by government officials to form a cooperative and apply. When the application was rejected for the second time, I never bothered to follow up again.” Medium and small farmers see the cost of Happy Seeders, even at subsidised rates, as prohibitive. A Happy Seeder costs Rs 1.5 lakh while a Super Seeder is for Rs 3 lakh. Most of the time, the equipment that is available on rent is captured by a handful of farmers, they say. Baldev Singh (37), a paddy and wheat farmer at Kaithal’s Chousala village, told TOI he has never used a Super Seeder.  “Small farmers like me can’t afford it or take a big loan. Besides, to use such a machine, one should own a tractor. That is an additional cost. The Super or Happy Seeder is used just once a year, so I don’t see any point investing in it,” he said. In Karnal’s Bassi village, Parveen, a 36-year-old farmer who has 3.5 acres, said bringing in a machine involved more costs. “After using such machines, the farmland becomes hard and manual farming for the next session is not possible. So, farmers end up purchasing more equipment like reversive plough, which comes with a price tag of Rs 70,000, rotavator that costs Rs 1.5 lakh and mulcher, which is for Rs 2.5 lakh,” he said. Many of the farms in the three districts had millet stubble dumped on the fields. “We aren’t happy with the practice of farm fires either,” said Preetpal Singh (53), a farmer at Babail village in Panipat. “I had a harvest of bajra (millet) on my land and the stubble is still lying around because I don’t know where to store it. It is wet due to the rain. Once it dries up, I’ll decide what to do with it.” Farmers in Haryana can broadly be divided into three categories – large farmers who own land between 20 and 25 acres, medium farmers with 3-15 acres and small farmers who have less than 2.5 acres. The state has 80% small farmers who cannot afford high-tech machinery and find it easier to simply burn the stubble, often in a staggered manner, to avoid attention from the authorities. Farm fires will reduce, say agri officialsGovernment officials are optimistic, though, that stubble burning this season will decrease from last year. One reason, says ACS (agriculture) Sumita Misra, is that the total area under paddy has been reduced from 38 lakh acres to 34.1 lakh acres. “We have several methods that the farmers can adopt to avoid stubble burning, such as decomposers that can be sprayed on the stubble, which dissolves after a month. We are also sensitising farmers about the harmful effects of stubble burning,” said Aditya Pratap Dabas, deputy director (agriculture), Karnal. Haryana has been using a bio-decomposer that usually takes 30 days to take effect. Delhi’s Pusa bio-decomposer, which will be introduced on October 5, takes about 20 days for stubble to decompose after spraying. On farmers’ claims about applications being rejected, Karam Chand, deputy director (agriculture), Kaithal, said, “A few applications were rejected because the farmers had already got Happy Seeders three years ago and the life of a machine is 10 years.” Chand expressed confidence that this season will see fewer farm fires. However, farmer unions pointed out that technological reforms on a mass scale are yet to reach needy farmers.  “Ensuring that innovative technology reaches farmers and taking them in confidence is the key. About 80% of the farmers in Haryana have less than 2 acres of land. They can’t afford a machine that costs lakhs of rupees. Stubble occupies space, which is just not available with small farmers,” said All India Kisan Sabha leader Inderjeet Singh. Meenakshi Sangwan, a scientist at Krishi Vigyan Kendra, said, “We have been working very closely with farmers to manage crop residue and bridge the gap between them and technological know-how. Machines are costly and used once a year, which demotivates them, but several farmers are also opting for the equipment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/cost-to-access-last-mile-gaps-hit-steps-to-stop-stubble-fires/articleshow/86717031.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Noida||3,800 families may be shifted for Noida International Airport phase II||GREATER NOIDA: A three-month-long social impact assessment (SIA) survey for the Noida International Airport phase II at Jewar has found that nearly 3,800 families in six villages are likely to be displaced for the project and many residents were “ready” to offer with their agricultural land for the “development of the region”. A six-member team from the Gautam Buddha University, which conducted the survey from June 1 at Karoli Bangar, Kureb, Mundhera, Birampur, Dayanatpur and Ranhera villages of the district under the provisions of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, submitted its report to the district administration on September 25. “We have submitted our report to the district administration. Our comments and remarks are mentioned in the report and will be examined by the officials. The villagers are aware of the opportunities the (airport) project will bring in for the region and are ready to offer their land,” Vivek Kumar Mishra, the nodal officer of the team and head of political science and international relations department at the university, told TOI. The team, he said, completed its field visits by August 31 and started compiling the report thereafter. Around 1,185 hectares (ha) of private land is to be acquired from the six villages as part of the second phase of construction. A total of 1363.45 ha will be handed over to the subsidiary of the Zurich AG, which is developing the Noida airport, for the second stage of the project.  On Saturday, additional district magistrate (land acquisition), Balram Singh said, “The SIA report will be examined and its findings will be shared with the state government for further procedure. We will finalise the schedule for public hearing in a few days.” The public hearing, to compile the objections and suggestions of the affected villagers, is expected to commence from October 10. According to sources, the survey team had met with some resistance at Karoli Bangar village, while a section of the surveyed population expressed apprehension about displacement. “The families, which have shifted to the rehabilitation and resettlement township in Jewar Bangar from the six villages that have been acquired in the first stage, have not given very positive feedback. Though everyone is ready to give away their agricultural fields, convincing them to move out of the village to some other place will take some time,” an administrative official, who has studied the SIA report, said. Karoli Bangar village, officials said, is situated extremely close to the Yamuna Expressway.  “People here feel their village land will also command a hefty premium once this area gets developed,” an official said. The village is home to about 230 people of whom more than 50% has opposed the idea of shifting out. The study to assess and sketch the socio-economic profile of the villagers affected by the project and the impact on their livelihoods was headed by professor Bandana Pandey of Gautam Budh University. The other members of the SIA team included faculty members RK Srivastava, Om Prakash, Amit Kumar Awasthi and Anand Pratap Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/3-8k-families-may-be-shifted-for-airport-ph-2/articleshow/86716864.cms||Shalabh

Under the scheme, the Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN) will not charge the interest amount on the power charge dues of defaulters and also allow them to pay up in easy installments. Moreover, consumers can take new power connections by depositing the entire principal amount of their outstanding bill in one go or installments. This scheme is applicable till November 30. Consumers of domestic, agricultural, industrial and non-domestic categories and consumers whose electricity connections were cut till June 30 due to non-payment of bills on time, will all be able to benefit from this scheme. “The power minister has directed us to roll out this special scheme for consumers. Those who have pending dues are requested to settle it by November 30. There’ll be no surcharge on the outstanding bill on payment of the principal amount,” said an official of UHBVN. The discom further noted that consumers can also opt for easy installment options where they will have to pay 25% of the outstanding dues and the remaining amount can be deposited in six installments. In rural areas, however, this scheme will apply only to the consumers of those villages under the Mhara Gaon Jagmag Gaon Yojana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/discom-to-waive-off-interest-on-power-bill-dues/articleshow/86716869.cms||---

These buses will operate on four routes — Anand Vihar to Muradnagar, Anand Vihar to the ALT roundabout, Dilshad Garden to Govindpuram and Tilla Mode to New Bus Adda. Ghaziabad is among 11 cities in the state where electric buses will ply. Officials said operations would start here in the second phase. In the first, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will virtually flag off buses in his constituency Varanasi, Lucknow and Gorakhpur this month. Initially, it had been planned to operate electric buses on 12 routes in Ghaziabad. The number of routes was reduced to 10, then to six and eventually four.  “Buses will be introduced in a phased manner. We will start with 25 buses on four routes. The next phase will have 25 more vehicles on additional routes,” said AK Singh, regional manager of the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation. The bus fare will range between Rs 10 and Rs 50. “The fare has been decided in keeping with the length of the journey. For the first 3km, it will be Rs 10. Between 4km and 6km, passengers will be charged Rs 15. It will gradually increase in this manner up to Rs 50,” said Singh. At 33km, the Anand Vihar to Muradnagar route will be the longest. The Tilla Mode to New Bus Adda route will be shortest, at just 15km. It will also have the most number of stops (15). The remaining three routes will have 10 stops each. As part of preparations, officials said that a workshop to house the buses had been built at Akbarpur-Behrampur at a cost of Rs 9.5 crore. The workshop will also have charging points. If fully charged, the buses can run up to 180km non-stop. Each vehicle will be fitted with CCTV cameras and GPS devices. A monitoring station will be set up at the UPSRTC office in Kaushambi to keep tabs on the buses. It was in 2019 that the Centre had given its approval for running more than 5,000 electric buses in 64 cities. There are 11 cities in UP where electric buses will be plying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/e-buses-may-ply-on-4-gzb-routes-from-next-month-rs-10-min-fare/articleshow/86716921.cms||Abhijay Jha

The officials collected water samples for testing and analysis. Besides, they set up a medical camp in the society in which around 55 residents were screened during the day. They had complained of diarrhoea and vomiting and were given medicines. According to the health department, three patients have been admitted to private hospitals. They include a three-year-old girl, two senior citizens — aged 66 and 73 years. The doctors have advised two people to visit a hospital for further investigation. Also, 12 blood slides have been taken from fever patients. “As many as 180 halogen tablets have been given to the RWA,” said a senior health official. Now, the district administration is awaiting test results to take further action on the matter. Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurgaon, said: “After receiving information on Friday, I asked the health department to send a team to the society and assess the situation. The department has submitted the initial report but we are awaiting the test results.” The residents suspect that due to lack of sewerage network, untreated water flowing openly is seeping into the ground, possibly contaminating the water or any other water source in the residential complex. RWA president Puran Singh said, “So many people can't get sick at the same time without any reason. There is contamination at some level or any negligence, the main cause can be ascertained through an investigation.” The water is being supplied from a borewell and the developer has yet to get the connection. Anudeep Saxena, a resident, said: “While the canal water is already being provided in the vicinity, we are not sure whether the developer has applied or not. This is a serious matter as over 1,050 people are at a health risk.” Meanwhile, the representative of the developer could not be reached for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/water-test-camp-set-up-officials-visit-coralwood/articleshow/86716945.cms||Akanksha Gupta

---||Mangaluru||Jackie Chan & GoT in gecko finds in Western Ghats||MANGALURU/BENGALURU: Researchers affiliated with the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, and National Centre for Biological Sciences discovered 12 new species of geckos in the Western Ghats. The paper authored by Saunak Pal, currently associated with BNHS, Zeeshan A Mirza of NCBS, Princia Dsouza and Kartik Shanker of CES was published in the current issue of international journal ‘Zoological Research’. While two species are from Baba Budan Giri range and Sharavathi Valley of Karnataka, five each are from Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Interestingly, one found in Tamil Nadu is named after famous actor and martial artist Jackie Chan as it was fast, moved rapidly on rocks and sneaked into crevices to escape when approached. This study was part of a larger survey of frogs, lizards and snakes of the Western Ghats, supported by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund between 2009 and 2014. The project, led by Kartik Shanker, aims to map the diversity and distribution of these groups in the Ghats. Saunak carried out field visits to collect morphological data, distribution information, specimens and tissue samples to understand the diversity and distribution of these geckos. He compared the new species with those at the museums of BNHS and Zoological Survey of India and conducted studies to understand the relationship between the species. He also conducted field work between 2012 and 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/jackie-chan-got-in-gecko-finds-in-western-ghats/articleshow/86721069.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
