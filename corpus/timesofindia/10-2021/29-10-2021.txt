A transformative experience through spoken word, music, percussion and movement, the evening promises to be an insight into one’s soul. “Our country has always worshipped goddesses. But over the last few decades, we have somehow suppressed the intuitive voice of the feminine. Women have been able to fight for their rights, but we have lost the balance along the way. We have become a part of a man’s world and not a world of balance. This imbalance has manifested itself into gender wars that are only creating a greater bridge,” explains Deepthi Sudhindra, a multidisciplinary artiste who will be presenting the spoken word and narrative at the event. The female has the energy to move everything that is animate and inanimate, believes Deepthi. “We can be gentle and compassionate, as well as angry and wild. Some of the most ferocious women are also the kindest. So, why can’t we embrace everything instead of labelling ourselves in a man’s world?” she asks. Deepthi will be joined by Gurupriya Atreya on vocals, Sarfaraaz Khan on sarangi, Sumukh Ravishankar on multi-percussions and Rishabh Nair on keyboard. “Through this concert, we hope to take people on an intuitive journey. The piece will continue to evolve and, hopefully, it’s not the end of the tunnel. We have to look within our roots to find the divine feminine in our relationship with nature, and this applies to men as well. It’s important that we open our thoughts and push our boundaries,” she sums up. - Deepa Natarajan||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/deepthi-sudhindras-concert-to-take-you-on-a-journey/articleshow/87332512.cms||---

The name change comes as the company battles criticisms from lawmakers and regulators over its market power, its algorithmic decisions and the policing of abuses on its platforms.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg, speaking at the company's live-streamed virtual and augmented reality conference, said the new name reflected its focus on building the metaverse.  "Right now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can't possibly represent everything that we're doing today, let alone in the future," he said.  "We've learned a lot from struggling with social issues and living under closed platforms, and now it is time to take everything that we've learned and help build the next chapter," Zuckerberg said. Name of apps to remain sameThe tech giant said the change would bring together its different apps and technologies under one new brand. It said it would not change its corporate structure. The names of the apps that it builds — Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp — will remain the same.  The metaverse, a term first coined in a dystopian novel three decades ago and now attracting buzz in Silicon Valley, refers broadly to the idea of a shared virtual environment which can be accessed by people using different devices. New symbolThe company unveiled a new sign at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on Thursday, replacing its thumbs-up "Like" logo with a blue infinity shape.  Skeptics pointed out that the name change appears to be an attempt to change the subject from the Facebook Papers, a leaked document trove that has revealed the ways Facebook ignored internal reports and warnings of the harms its social network created or magnified across the world.  Zuckerberg said he expects the metaverse to reach a billion people within the next decade.

Terming the million-plus deaths in road crashes every year a “tragedy of monumental scale”, UN General Assembly (UNGA) president Abdulla Shahid urged all the countries to step up their efforts to reduce these fatalities. The UNGA will hold a high-level meeting in July 2022 to discuss the roadmap for reducing the road deaths by half by 2030. Shahid said he will also host a supporting event regarding this on December 3. It is to be noted that one in every 10 lives lost across the globe is reported from India and it retains the notorious record of maximum road deaths among all the countries. “India has to play a big role to see that the global target is met since the number of fatalities registered here is much more than the combined road deaths of several countries,” said Deepanshu Gupta of India Road Safety Campaign, who represented the global collaboration of youth at the inaugural event. On the occasion, the Global Plan for the Decade of Action, prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN regional commissions in cooperation with other partners, was also released. The global plan outlines recommended actions drawn from proven and effective interventions, as well as best practices for preventing road trauma. “Globally, over 3,500 people die every day on the roads, which amounts to nearly 1.3 million preventable deaths and an estimated 50 million injuries each year, making it the leading killer of children and young people worldwide. As things stand, they are set to cause a further estimated 13 million deaths and 500 million injuries during the next decade, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. These are unacceptable numbers, both in absolute and relative terms. Road traffic crashes have remained a major cause of death globally, even though each of these deaths and injuries is preventable,” the WHO said in a statement. WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said so much of this suffering is preventable by making roads and vehicles safer, and by promoting safe walking, cycling and greater use of public transport. “One of the best ways to save and improve lives is to make our streets safer but that work often doesn’t get the attention it deserves,” Michael R Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies, who is also the WHO global ambassador for non-communicable diseases and injuries, said. “More than 50 million people have died on the roads worldwide since the invention of the automobile. This is more than the number of deaths in World War I or some of the worst epidemics,” said Dr Etienne Krug, director of the department of the social determinants of health at WHO.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tragedy-of-monumental-scale-unga-prez-at-launch-of-global-decade-of-action-on-road-deaths/articleshow/87346159.cms||Dipak K Dash

Tata Cha currently has 12 stores across Bangalore serving beverages (tea, coffee, coolers), snacks and merchandise. The business is a good strategic fit for IHCL, and can be synergized with its Qmin brand.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tata-consumer-products-to-transition-tata-cha-business-to-indian-hotels-company/articleshow/87346852.cms||John Sarkar

The company's attrition is at an all-time high at 33%. In an interview with TOI, Rajesh Nambiar, chairman & MD of Cognizant India, and president of its digital business & technology, spoke about how Cognizant is trying to deal with this, and how digital is a key growth driver. Excerpts: Your revenue growth is 11.8% in the quarter, a little better than HCL, but way below that of TCS, Infosys and Wipro. How do you see yourself stacked up against them?Our organic growth is as good as our peers. We grew 18% in digital, but we are conservative in how we report those numbers. The growth is broad-based. We have four digital battlegrounds within our portfolio – digital engineering, cloud, data, and IoT. Our ability to walk our clients through the digital transformation journeys is phenomenal, and our acquisitions add to the capabilities they drive. Your employee strength went up by 17,000, but CEO Brian Humphries said on the investor call that "the reality is we don't have enough headcount to fulfil our potential.” How do you see the talent crunch?I don’t know whether he said the exact words, but the industry is going through higher attrition and we are not unique. There is unprecedented demand for talent and everyone in the industry is impacted. Today, our hiring engine is performing well. Our bookings have seen a 24% growth year-on-year. If attrition comes down, it will help us grow even more. While we are undertaking a lot of interventions for the right set of hiring, we have been able to deliver all our commitments to our clients. The whole industry is waiting for some balance. Cognizant's attrition is at an all-time high at 33%, compared to 11% in the same period last year. Including involuntary attrition, it is 37%. This is despite several measures you've taken to retain talent...Attrition is an industry-wide concern. We had our own share of attrition and I’m not denying it. I believe we have a much stronger brand than ever before. If we don’t have a strong brand, we won’t be able to hire the 100,000 people that we are hiring today. We are the number 1 brand today on campus. We have hired 30,000 people and we have given offers for 45,000 for next year. The actions we have taken are bearing fruit. Attrition comparisons are also not apple to apple. These are unprecedented times. Our total headcount is the highest employee count ever. We have turned a corner and executed well. Involuntary attrition was 4%, compared to 1% in the quarter before...We don’t want to get into the specifics. It’s important to know that managing a workforce of over 300,000 is an art. There are areas where we have significant opportunities to grow.  There are many aspects of how we manage the broader talent pool. We have become a fertile ground for digital talent. We don’t have employment bonds and we don’t keep people artificially tied up to certain service agreements. Others have these bonds. It’s easy for employers to poach from us. We are a really caring employer for our associates. But we would like to have much lower attrition.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/if-attrition-comes-down-we-will-grow-even-more-cognizant-india-md/articleshow/87346952.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Business||Let rupee gain to contain imported inflation, boost exports: Report||MUMBAI: The RBI should let the rupee rally against the dollar to contain imported inflation coming in mainly from crude prices and help push exports, as the current account risks from rising oil price can be contained at 1.4 per cent of GDP, according to a report. Rallying crude and the resultant fear of the current account deficit have seen the rupee going down from 73.09 on September 1 to a low of 75.52 to a dollar on October 12. But it has again started appreciating and is presently at around 75, visible from forex market turnover $2.2 billion of excess dollar supply in August - clearly showing the appreciating bias on the rupee. The Reserve Bank has been continuously making forex purchases, and in FY21, it bought Rs 5.1 lakh crore worth of forex and the forex reserves swelled by $103.72 billion. Despite the second wave, the rupee gained strength and even went below 73 to a dollar, SBI Research said on Thursday in its report. Taking everything into account -- robust FDI inflows amid some volatility in FPI inflows of late -- our CAD projections stand at 1.4 per cent of GDP for the full year, which is comfortable, and if there is no extremely devastating third wave, the rupee is going to handle any taper news with relative calm, the report noted. Considering higher domestic inflation, as supply disruptions mount, it will not do any harm for the RBI to lean with the wind and let the rupee appreciate, as it can lead to reduced imported inflation when metal and oil prices are rising, and clearing the liquidity overhang to some extent, it added. This is more so since our backward linkages in the global value chains is higher than forward linkage and a weak rupee may not help in pushing the exports as much as is touted by traditional economic theory, the report said. The report also said that the RBI has been globally applauded for its effective exchange rate management. The IMF in its recently released article IV consultation welcomed the authorities' commitment to maintain exchange rate flexibility. Noting that wholesale price inflation has averaged at 11.6 per cent in H1 of FY22, and CPI at 5.34 per cent, the report said since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, consumer price and wholesale price inflation rates have been exhibiting considerable divergence. Such developments miss the concerns of manufacturers who are grappling with extremely high imported inflation and a falling rupee just adding to their woes, it added. The current rally in oil prices due to a global supply shortage and strong demand as the world recovers from the pandemic is reminiscent of the early 2010s when oil was way above $100 a barrel. The current account deficit, which had touched a high of 4.82 per cent of GDP in FY13, started declining and has not gone above 2.1 per cent since then. However, the rising crude prices and overall supply-side bottlenecks due to the pandemic are raising concerns again and between May and September 2013 the rupee lost as much as Rs 14 a dollar. September 2021 merchandise trade deficit at $22.59 billion is quite high and has the closest counterpart in October 2012 when it was $20.21 billion. So far exports have been doing quite well with merchandise exports in H1 of 2021, touching $197.9 billion, a robust increase of 24.3 per cent over $159.2 billion in H1 of 2019. Thus, achieving the target of $400 billion is not a pipe dream and this will provide a strong cushion to the current account balance, even if the oil import bills rise rapidly, the report said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/let-rupee-gain-to-contain-imported-inflation-boost-exports-report/articleshow/87347000.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to SBI, RBI, National Payments Corporation of India, and the Department of Financial Services and asked them to respond to the petition. CryptocurrencyLiveThe court listed the matter for further hearing on December 24. Petitioner Arnav Gulati, a law student, said he along with numerous account holders of SBI and registered users of cryptocurrency exchange, WazirX is aggrieved by the actions of the authorities which infringes his fundamental right of trade under Article 19(1)(g) and the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution. Advocates Siddharth Acharya and Simarjeet Singh Satia, representing the petitioner, said the petition has been filed against the arbitrary action taken by SBI to block the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) Services for the WazirX (leading cryptocurrency exchange) users violating the Supreme Court judgement of March 2020. The lawyers said the PIL involved the interest of almost one crore retail investors of the WazirX crypto exchange platform and sought direction to the authorities to take effective steps and take back the decision of prohibiting UPI payments in the crypto exchanges. The plea said in April 2018, RBI issued a circular prohibiting all the banks to deal with any virtual currency or provide services for facilitating any person or entity in dealing with or settling them including Bitcoins. Such services included maintaining accounts, registering, trading, settling, clearing, giving loans against virtual tokens, accepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them, and transfer/ receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase/ sale of virtual currencies, it said, adding that thereafter, all the transactions related to cryptocurrencies via banking institutions were stopped. “Later, the Supreme Court in March 2020 passed a final order nullifying the circular of RBI and paving the way for banks and their customers to deal in cryptocurrency. On the basis of the said order, the RBI issued another circular allowing the institutions under it to deal and facilitate transactions in virtual currencies,” it said. The plea said on September 15, SBI prohibited the use of the UPI platform for its account holders in the WazirX cryptocurrency exchange which has now been challenged. It sought direction to RBI to regulate and govern the cryptocurrency sector and thereby making provisions for the payment interfaces and decisions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/hc-asks-rbi-sbi-to-respond-to-plea-to-revoke-prohibition-on-use-of-upi-for-cryptocurrency-exchange/articleshow/87347115.cms||---

While it’s been a year of low-key festivities due to the pandemic, the fest of spooks also may not be as upscale as it was. But it’s giving Mumbaikars a much-needed chance to party and have some fun. The city’s stores are full of zany Halloween props and costumes, so you can rock the scene dressed up as your favourite character — witch, wizard, ghost or vampire. 'I've been checking out props and I'm excited about buying a costume this year'Minissha Lamba has fun choosing props for the spookfestWe caught actress Minissha Lamba browsing around for the spookfest at a party store in Bandra. Minissha says, “I love Halloween! It’s great to see that people are in the mood to celebrate it here. We’ve had close to two years of social deprivation and getting together to do something fun may just be the thing we need to dispel gloom and stress. Even though back here, we haven’t experienced it like how they celebrate it in America, people are making an effort in the last few years, so it’s fun. Of course, my friends and I will wear masks and carry sanitisers, too.” So what’s she going to be dressed like, we ask? She added, “I’ve been checking out a few props and costumes. For me, I love pretty stuff, nothing too scary or gory. At the last party that I attended, I went as a 17th century Victorian maiden, and I am excited about getting a Halloween costume this year, too!”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/say-boo-mumbai-its-halloween-this-weekend/articleshow/87346869.cms||Ismat Tahseen

In Ludhiana's Kesarganj Mandi, IT sleuths from the investigation wing of the department, assisted by local cops, were at the office of one of the companies since Thursday morning. Sources said the two companies are engaged in dry fruit imports, and trading and dealing in huge variety of dry fruits like almonds, walnuts, cashewnuts, raisins, pistachios etc . One of the company has its main base in Amritsar and Delhi, while the other one has its headquarters in Jammu. Both the groups have offices in different parts of the country. Both companies, besides selling dry fruits to distributors and dealers, also do huge online business. The raids have been conducted as the firms are suspected of evading tax by suppressing their actual sales and profits figures. Given the fact that so many locations are being covered in the action, it is likely that the raids will continue for 1-2 days more. Sources said that besides the raid in Ludhiana , IT officials are searching offices and other premises belonging to the companies in Amritsar, Jammu, Delhi, Mumbai and some locations in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/it-raids-on-offices-premises-of-indias-two-leading-dry-fruit-groups/articleshow/87347054.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Mumbai||Mumbaikars get all set for Halloween this weekend||This weekend, prepare to be scared. Halloween is creeping right up. Put on a witch or wizard mask, wear the famous ‘Scream’ mask or just step out as Salvador Dali like they do in a heist show! The spook fest was missed last year due to the pandemic, but this time around there’s a lot of enthusiasm for it. Here’s how Mumbaikars are getting into the mood to look their eeriest... In the city, party shops are all prepped upGo as scary as you like with the props and decorHalloween celebrations were muted last year, but this time, business is brisk. Jayesh Chhadva from a chain of stores affirms, “There’s definitely more demand for Halloween items this year as people had missed out on the fun last year. The excitement is picking up and there’s also a big demand for props from kids this time. Some want to buy blinking skulls, others mini brooms and capes, and they also want Halloween giveaway bags.” The city’s party shops are stocked with a bunch of fun props for adults, too — from witch hats to wands, to horror-themed masks and more. Nabil Ansari from a store at Crawford Market says, “Halloween is always such a favourite party theme in Mumbai. The rush for items starts at the end of September, and in fact, we’re now almost sold out. In demand are mini pumpkin buckets, lights and the hot favourite — vampire capes!” You can’t miss the fervour at the party store at Saint Andrews Road, Bandra. Dhiraj Daryanani, a store manager, shares an interesting trend — the Zoom call Halloween parties, which are on the cards for those not partying outside! “We have the usual headbands and masks, light-up ghosts and witch inflatables that can be kept at party venue entrances. But this year, we noticed that many folks have bought props for their Zoom call Halloween party. Though they aren’t heading out, they’re attending a virtual scare-fare party with colleagues, friends and family!” Mumbaikars get inspired by movies and charactersChoose scary masks to go with the look Movie-inspired props and looks are also a huge trend. Good friends and stock market analysts Ishant Tandon and Rahul Shah are going with that idea. Says Ishant, “Every year, we make sure we find something fun to wear. In 2019, I dressed up as The Joker for Halloween, and this time, we plan to go as knights or pirates, as it will be a theme party. It will also feel good to actually get out and party after so long. We are looking forward to it.” Stylist Pooja Singh, who was also spotted shopping for October 31, shares, “I’m a die-hard Halloween lover. I started attending Halloween parties at the age of 17 with my friends. My plan is to head to a club to celebrate October 31 as things are open now. I plan to go as Janhvi Kapoor’s ghost-bride character from the film 'Roohi' as the look is amazing. I’ve been shopping for that goth headgear look she wore and I got the maang tikka made from fabric for it. I will get the rest of the costume this week.” Stars get into the spooky moodWhile actress Minissha Lamba got into the Halloween mood at Bandra, quite a few others are also putting their party plans in place. Raai Laxmi can’t wait to dress up for the fest. She says, “I love the whole concept of Halloween and honestly, it’s the year’s most entertaining party to go to. One gets to unleash their inner child and dress up in whatever they want to without any qualms... the wilder you go, the better it is! Last time, I pushed the envelope and dressed up as a scary Cinderella with the goth look. Every year, I try to get creative, and this year is sure to be special as well.” Bhoot challenges to forbidden forest walks: Eateries get eerie, tooA café will be having a Halloween Forbidden Forest-themed partyThe city is also gearing up for all things spooky. A game zone in Bandra has converted its décor to match a popular Korean web show. The serving staff will be dressed like the characters in the show in red jumpsuits and black masks. To be authentic, each guest will be handed a triangle, circle, square card and stamp and there will be a Dalgona cookie challenge on every table where you will have to use a needle to break the cookie. Want to bite into a spiderweb pizza? (Pic used for representation only) Another pizza place at Kala Ghoda is hosting a pizza eating competition — The Bhoot Challenge, on Halloween. Patrons have to finish eating an eight-inch pizza within four minutes! And if you want some adventure, a café at Todi Mills, Lower Parel, is revving things up. Informs owner Sohel Lalvani, “This is our first Halloween and we are taking it very seriously, so prepare to be transported to the foreign and frightening world of the forbidden forest. People will start their journey by walking through a lush green corridor and enjoy the themed drinks that are on a special menu.” If don’t want anything too daring, you can still keep your appetite in place as several restaurants will dish up menus with a few scary-themed treats.

---||India||US returns antiquities to India in stolen art investigation||NEW YORK: US authorities returned about 250 antiquities to India on Thursday in a long-running investigation of a stolen art scheme.  The items, worth an estimated $15 million, were handed over during a ceremony at the Indian Consulate in New York City. The centerpiece is a bronze Shiva Nataraja valued at $4 million, authorities said.  The ceremony stems from a sprawling probe by the Manhattan district attorney's office and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The investigation has focused on tens of thousands of antiquities allegedly smuggled into the United States by dealer Subhash Kapoor, who has denied the allegations.  The case "serves as a potent reminder that individuals who maraud sacred temples in pursuit of individual profit are committing crimes not only against a country's heritage but also its present and future," District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement.  Authorities say Kapoor - jailed in India and facing charges there pending a US extradition request - used his Arts of the Past gallery in New York to traffic looted treasures from India and various countries in Southeast Asia. The investigation has resulted in the recovery of 2,500 artifacts valued at $143 million and convictions of six Kapoor co-conspirators, Vance said.  The Shiva Nataraja bronze was sold by the mother of Nancy Wiener, a gallery operator who pleaded guilty in the case this month to charges of conspiracy and possession of stolen property, authorities said. Nancy Wiener sold looted items to major museums in Australia and Singapore, they said.  In June, the district attorney's office returned more than two dozen artifacts worth $3.8 million to Cambodia as part of the investigation. Another 33 objects were sent back to Afghanistan in April.  Court papers filed in New York says Kapoor went to extraordinary lengths to acquire the artifacts, many of them statues of Hindu deities, and then falsified their provenance with forged documents. They say Kapoor traveled the world seeking out antiquities that had been looted from temples, homes and archaeological sites. Some of the artifacts were recovered from Kapoor's storage units in New York.  Kapoor had the items cleansed and repaired to remove any damage from illegal excavation, and then illegally exported them to the United States from their countries of origin, according to US prosecutors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-returns-antiquities-to-india-in-stolen-art-investigation/articleshow/87347455.cms||---
---||India||J&K administration okays premature retirement of eight employees over corruption charges||NEW DELHI: After sacking over two dozen Jammu and Kashmir government staffers under Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India for alleged terror links, the J&K administration has now okayed premature retirement of eight of its employees, including four J&K Administrative Service (JKAS) officers, under Article 226(2) of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Services Regulations, over alleged corruption.  The charges against the said officers, confirmed by the departmental committees and upheld by the designated review committee under Article 226(2), include misappropriation of funds, falsification of records and faking of bills, financial irregularities and amassing of assets disproportionate to their known sources of income. Most of these officers have faced probes by Anti-corruption Bureau and some were also suspended.  Article 226(2) of the J&K Civil Services Regulations, 1956, allows the government employees to be retired “in public interest” upon completing 22 years of qualifying service or attaining 48 years of age. The article is essentially meant to help in removal of deadwood from the government. The employees are retired with a three months’ notice or three months of pay. However, they retain pensionary benefits.  The eight government employees who face premature retirement include JKAS officers Ravinder Kumar Bhat, mission director, RUSA; Mohammad Qasim Wani, regional director, survey and land records, Srinagar; Noor Alam, deputy secretary in ARI and training department; and Mohd Mujib-ur-Rehman Ghassi (under suspension). The remaining four J&K staffers recommended for premature retirement by the designated review committee under Article 226(2) of the J&K Civil Services Rules are Fayaz Ahmad Banday, earlier BMO, Beerwah, but presently under suspension; Ghulam Mohi-ud-Din, junior assistant, posted as storekeeper as well as in the office of TSO Chasana; Rakesh Kumar Pargal, junior assistant, who was posted at food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department, Udhampur; and Parshotam Kumar, storekeeper who was posted at Pancheri. The case of a ninth employee, Pranab Gandotra, in-charge of TSO and posted at Kalakote, was also reviewed by the committee but he was not found eligible for action as he had neither completed 22 years of service nor turned 48.  Among the JKAS officers cleared for premature retirement on recommendations of internal committees of general administration department and health and medical education department dated September 6 and 23 respectively, Ravinder Kumar Bhat has allegedly been found indulged in corrupt practices during his postings in different departments, for which FIRs were also filed by the ACB. As assistant commissioner, Budgam, he benefited illegal occupants of the state land as part of Roshni scam by arbitrarily fixing prices lower than market rate. Mohammad Qasim Wani, regional director with Survey and Land Records, is an accused in an ACB case relating to purchase of substandard material at exorbitant rates for ICDS projects. Noor Alam amassed assets disproportionate to his income by indulging in corruption. Mujib-ur-Rehman Ghassi, in his capacity as registrar, cooperative societies, J&K, faced an FIR by the ACB for alleged illegal facilitation and sanctioning of loan worth crores of rupees to a non-existent society by J&K State Cooperative Bank. Fayaz Ahmad Banday, also under suspension, had allegedly, as BMO, Beerwah, got fake bills processed and disbursed as salary, GPS and arrears in the name of staff members, some of whom were non-existent.  The other four employees being ousted for alleged corruption are Ghulam Mohi-ud-Din, found to have misappropriated huge amounts of funds with respect to disbursement of payments to ration dealers. He was prematurely retired from service but reinstated for lack of prosecution sanction. However, the prosecution sanction came subsequently. Rakesh Kumar Pargal was also charged with preparing fake records and making false receipts of dispatched food grain. Parshottam Kumar, had, as storekeeper in Panchery, drawn an excess amount of Rs 36 crore on account of loading/unloading charges by falsification of records and misappropriated the said amount.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-administration-okays-premature-retirement-of-eight-employees-over-corruption-charges/articleshow/87348066.cms||Bharti Jain

---||India||India to push for climate justice at COP26: Environment minister||India will strongly highlight the need for “climate justice” at COP26 in Glasgow as the solution to global warming can’t be addressed in a piecemeal manner, environment minister Bhupender Yadav told TOI. While not commenting directly on whether 450GW renewable energy will be made part of India’s NDCs, Yadav said the target is a serious commitment. Amid pressure from affluent nations to get a ‘net zero’ commitment from all countries, environment minister Yadav added while India will take a call on carbon neutrality at an appropriate time, developed nations must remember their unfulfilled pre-2020 promises as commitments and action on climate justice is the need of the hour. Excerpts of a conversation with TOI: Will India commit to a ‘net zero’ goal at the upcoming UN climate change conference (COP26)?We will take a call on this at the appropriate time and this could come anytime. We are very clear that whatever our leadership will decide, they will decide at the right time. We are committed to a solution. We will not become a problem.We had made our ‘nationally determined contribution’ (NDC) commitments in 2015 and we have, unlike many countries, been on track to fulfil whatever we have committed. Declaration should not just be in terms of declaration. It must be acted upon and fulfilled. Declaration should be to save the planet. It should not be a mere statement. What would be India’s focus during negotiations at COP26?Discussions must be around fulfilling existing commitments by developed countries. We believe first there must be discussion on all issues which had already been committed by countries as the old pledges – be it cutting down emissions in pre-2020 period and extending financial support to developing countries as promised in 2009. All issues should be discussed, keeping in view principles of UN climate convention (UNFCCC) and Paris Agreements — be it ‘equity’ and ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’ and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). There are four key issues in the negotiations. First, the entire world is worried that the global temperature is rising quite fast. Second, the world is conscious of mitigation measures needed to check this temperature rise. Third, the entire world is not at a level-playing field (in terms of capacities to take mitigation and adaptation measures) and therefore there should be robust financial support and technology transfer mechanisms. Fourth, is the issue of ‘loss and damage’ on account of disasters, and so there is a question of how to evolve a system to support vulnerable countries. India wants to discuss all these issues with an open mind. This global problem must be dealt with comprehensively, not partly. Will the country’s new ambitious target of renewable energy (450 GW by 2030) and overachievement on climate actions be factored in under revised pledges?The NDC is a voluntary declaration, but it’s not just a declaration. It is a commitment. We have not only set ambitious targets but also achieved our goals and fulfilled our pledges much before time. The big fight is around commitments of those who have not fulfilled it. Developed countries had promised in 2009 to mobilise climate finance of US$ 100 billion per year by 2020 to support developing countries for adaptation measures so that they could face the challenges of climate change. It has not been fulfilled. Climate finance delivery plan, released this week, shows that the affluent nations would be able to mobilise finance only by 2023 – three years later than what they promised. Will the delay impact the negotiations at COP26?We will put it on the negotiation table. There is also an issue of public finance and private finance. We must remind the developed countries that the promise was made to extend help to developing countries through public finance – government to government. I must, however, remind everyone that India has fulfilled its promises through its own money and budgetary provisions. You had meetings with the US presidential climate envoy John Kerry and COP26 president designate Alok Sharma. Have you told them about India’s and developing countries’ concerns over these issues? Besides them, we had bilateral and multilateral meetings with around 30 countries ahead of COP26. Everyone accepts the seriousness... But the question here is about action and effect. Consensus is being built up in this direction. These issues will also be discussed during COP26 (October 31-November 12 in Glasgow, UK). We will urge all countries to get actively involved in three institutions/initiatives — International Solar Alliance (ISA), Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) and Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT) — which are being spearheaded by India and other countries such as France and Sweden. Both India and China have always been on the same page as part of ‘like-minded developing countries’ (LMDC) and BASIC climate negotiation groups despite differences elsewhere. Will this continue at COP26?I believe there should not be any difference with anyone for making the world a better place to live in. Our conduct should be one when our objective is one. We’ll, in fact, try to build consensus with every country at COP26.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-to-push-for-climate-justice-at-cop26-environment-minister/articleshow/87348533.cms||Rajeev Deshpande

An assurance to this effect was given by advocate general Prabhuling K Navadgi as the hearing went on and remained inconclusive and the petitioners pressed for grant of limited interim relief vis-a-vis prosecution under the new amendment act. While asking the counsel to submit the gist of their arguments for the benefit of the court, Justice Krishna S Dixit adjourned the hearing to post-Deepavali period. Earlier, continuing his arguments, senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi submitted that online rummy is a transparent activity as it is digitally recorded and contains several safeguards with regard to participation and registration of players. According to him, the inclusion of word “pure skill” in the new legislation virtually means banning all activities of skill games as no skill game is or can be 100 per cent pure as an element of chance is embedded in all such games. He added that paternalism has to be proportional and gave examples of cigarettes and Immoral Traffic Act, while adding that the law doesn’t ban tobacco or prostitution. Citing various judgements, senior advocate Sajan Poovayya said that they clearly exclude game of skill from the ambit of legislation, while seeking for protection from prosecution to the petitioners under the new law.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/govt-to-hc-no-precipitative-action-against-petitioners/articleshow/87348941.cms||---

However, none of the IMD stations confirmed heavy rainfall. According to the Met department, owing to various weather systems, coastal Karnataka and south-interior Karnataka are likely to experience isolated rainfall from October 29 to November 1. Weather will remain dry over north-interior Karnataka for the next three days followed by isolated showers. Bengaluru city has recorded a maximum temperature of 27.1degrees Celcius and a minimum of 18.5 degrees Celsius. City skies are expected to remain generally cloudy and mist is expected during the wee hours of the day. Experts from IMD pointed out that winter might set in by mid-November if there are no cyclonic or low-pressure systems bringing rainfall. “Winter starts setting in when the weather is dry and the sky is clear. Currently, the winds are south-westerly, southerly or westerly, all of which bring moisture along with them. Winter will set in when northerly or north-easterly winds set in, which are dry in nature. The peak of winter, however, is usually noted in January,” a scientific officer from IMD said. Dip in temperatureAlthough winter hasn’t set in yet, on days when the sky is clear, the city will wake up to a dip in temperature. “October to December are noted as months of cyclonic systems and hence one can’t predict when the sky will clear up and when winter will set in,” the officer added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/winter-likely-from-mid-nov/articleshow/87348943.cms||---

Residents living a couple of metres away from the lake say that the water gives off an unbearable stench and that lawmakers visiting the spot have not been able to do much about it. A resident from an apartment complex near the lake said: “We have been living here for four years and facing this issue since then. As the lake was earlier under the BDA and was developed by them, the resident association submitted a written complaint not just to the BDA but BBMP and BWSSB. Officials have visited this place, but there is no visible change.” Residents of Prakruthi Meadows, an apartment block near the lake, say that the apartment basements get flooded every time it rains as stormwater drains leading to the lake overflow.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/sewage-inflow-slowly-killing-amruthahalli-lake/articleshow/87348944.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

Bineesh has been in a Bengaluru jail for a year. A single bench of the High Court headed by Justice MG Uma granted bail to 38-year-old Bineesh with a bond of Rs 5 lakh with two sureties. The bench also laid conditions. Bineesh cannot leave the country without prior permission from the trial court and must appear before the investigating officer when needed and not attempt tampering with evidence or witnesses. Bineesh was arrested by the ED in Bengaluru in late October last year and was sent to the Parappana Agrahara prison complex here on October 29, 2020, after the central agency booked him under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. It all began after Anoop Mohammed, a city-based drug dealer and longtime friend of Bineesh, was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in August 2020 and in his confession he named Bineesh as his financier for his restaurant business in the city. The ED sleuths registered a case and summoned Bineesh for questioning and he was arrested later on the charge of transferring unaccounted cash through various accounts to Mohammed. Some benami companies and business establishments that Bineesh allegedly owned in Bengaluru and Thiruvananthapuram were raided by ED teams. Bineesh was also taken into custody by the NCB in Bengaluru for questioning on his drug links with Anoop Mohammed but the agency failed to establish anything. He is expected to walk out of prison on Friday evening and is likely to head to Thiruvananthapuram where his family resides, sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bineesh-kodiyeri-gets-bail-to-be-out-today/articleshow/87348948.cms||Petlee Peter

The initiative was organised by the state government. Over 1,000 people including musicians and singers gathered on the premises of the Vidhana Soudha in Bengaluru to sing the state anthem followed by Barisu Kannada Dindimava, written by late Jnanpith laureate Kuvempu, Jogada Siri Belakinalli, by the poet (late) Nissar Ahmed, and Huttidare Kannada Naadalli Huttabeku, written by noted lyricist Hamsalekha.

---||Bengaluru||Georgia state declares November 1 as Kannada Language Day||BENGALURU: The US state of Georgia has declared November 1 Kannada Language and Rajyotsava Day after multiple representations by resident Kannadigas. The proclamation, signed by Georgia Governor Brian P Kemp, came after a push from the Kannadiga community under the banner of Nrupatunga Kannada Koota. “This is for the first time that the Kannada language has been honoured at the state level in America. It is something that all Kannadigas in the world will be proud of. It is a big win for Kannada, which is one of the longest surviving classical languages,” Bharath Tejasvi, a Koota member and senior data analytics manager, told TOI. Georgia is home to around 2,000 Kannada-speaking families and the Nrupatunga Kannada Koota, with around 500 members, has been the most active linguistic and cultural group in the region for the last five decades. The Koota has been pushing the state authorities for a couple of years to recognise the language and to allow Rajyotsava celebrations. The Koota intensified its effort under the guidance and leadership of philanthropic couple Dr Subrahmanya Bhat and Dr Anu Bhat, its chairman Dr NS Prasad and president Diwakar Nidagatte Dyamanna. In the meantime, the Koota also increased its visibility and emerged as a strong linguistic group by organising programmes and undertaking initiatives aimed at showcasing and promoting the Kannada language. Atlanta Nagendra, a software architect who espouses the cause of Kannada, said: “The Koota made an impact at the local level in the recent years, it became stronger.” Joining him, Tejasvi said: “We made the request for the proclamation with the Governor’s office and kept following it up regularly. Kannada promotion activities were affected last year because of the pandemic but now it is a proud moment with the proclamation having been issued.” Tejasvi and Nagendra feel that the Georgia state proclamation will motivate Kannada communities in other states of the US to strengthen the language. The proclamation also acknowledges the Georgia Kannada community’s efforts to educate its future generations in Kannada through three local schools where working professionals devote time to teach the language. Governor Kemp’s note states the Kannada community has “played an important role in keeping the Indian heritage and culture intact, as well as enriching Georgia’s cultural diversity”. The Koota’s achievement has got congratulatory messages from Kannada lovers with many stating that its members have lived up to eminent litterateur Kuvempu’s popular line, “Elladaru iru enthadaru iru, Endhendigu nee Kannadavagiru.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/georgia-state-declares-nov-1as-kannada-language-day/articleshow/87348945.cms||Rakesh Prakash

State tourism minister Anand Singh condemned the goof-up and took the central team to task.A video clip of the minister speaking to the central tourism ministry officials went viral soon. He was seen questioning the bureaucrats on whose decision it was to not include Kannada signage. He went on to tell them that the state has made it mandatory for every central and state event to have Kannada signage for local people. With the situation getting heated, the officials took remedial measures and included a digital information display of the conclave in Kannada at the event. Later, when questioned about the missing Kannada signage, Singh said it was an inadvertent mistake by the central government officials.“While I condemn the missing signage, it was an inadvertent mistake and not deliberate. No sooner was the matter brought to the notice of the officials, they rectified it and displayed Kannada signage,” Singh said.This is the second incident involving a central government programme. The recently inaugurated Metro extension line between Mysuru Road and Kengri did not have Kannada signage. Kannada and culture minister V Sunil Kumar issued a showcause to the Namma Metro MD over this.Cross-border tourismCitting the tourism potential of the Rock of Peace stone located in Arunachal Pradesh along the Indo-China border, Union Minister of State for Tourism Ajay Bhatt said the Centre is exploring the options of border tourism in the country. Ajay Bhatt said the Rock of Peace is a place where a lot of tourists flock to write their messages from both nations. ‘“There is only a wall between the two countries, and tourists from both sides frequent that place to write their message on the stone. Now, imagine if the gates are opened from both sides then you will be able to understand the culture of both countries and people.

---||Bengaluru||Academicians in Bengaluru worry about college syllabus autonomy||BENGALURU: A section of academicians in the city has expressed concern over the infringement of freedom of autonomous colleges with the implementation of the National Education Policy. Additionally, in a recent WhatsApp message by the Karnataka State Higher Education Council vice-chairman B Thimmegowda, colleges and universities were told not to include controversial topics in the new syllabus planned under the NEP. “The Hon minister has asked us to ensure that the curriculum contents are not diluted and controversial contents are avoided,” read the message. Thimme Gowda has clarified that the message was only a cautionary one to tell colleges “not to hurt anybody”. “We should not hurt X or Y. It was sent with a good intention, to convey the message not to hurt anyone’s feelings,” he told TOI. Academicians pointed out that politicians should not be interfering in academic matters and the matter should be left to subject matter experts. “How are we to teach critical thinking on campuses if we are not discussing topics in a class? We should be teaching students to call a spade a spade and not evade questions the younger generation has,” said an expert. “Being controversial is very subjective. It varies from person to person,” pointed out another academic. According to some of them, the higher education council is also forcing universities to stick to a model syllabus provided by the council and prepared by 35 sub-committees. “Few of our colleagues are there in some committees of other colleges and universities for syllabus preparation. But the university nominees in the Board of Studies are reluctant to make the changes that we are proposing. In one instance, we had managed to change two papers in a subject. But the chairperson of the committee was under pressure to restore the model syllabus,” explained one academic. The lecturers in some of the autonomous colleges point out that their syllabi are more up to date than the ones drafted by the sub-committees, which makes them eligible for the top accreditations by NAAC. Following the outdated syllabi will be like turning back the clock by a decade or two, they say. According to the lecturers, the colleges and varsities are forced to stick to the same syllabus so that the academic bank of credits can function smoothly. As per the NEP, students can move from one college to another for valid reasons by transferring their credits. “We have never said that all colleges should follow the model curriculum. We have always encouraged them and given them the freedom to choose what they want. For the core papers, we have suggested keeping them more or less like the national curriculum because it should not affect the students when they try to transfer their credits. A drastic change in the content will affect their mobility. This is in the best interest of students. For the electives -- open or discipline -- depending upon expertise and needs of regions, they can change. We have only asked the colleges not to dilute the contents to an inferior quality because the teachers cannot teach them,” Gowda said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/academicians-worry-about-college-syllabus-autonomy/articleshow/87349092.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Based on the complaint filed by the professor after a gap of 26 days of the incident, police have detained the woman and her live-in partner and are looking for the other accused. Prof Shivu, a resident of Rajajinagar D Block, told cops that after retirement, he wanted to start a business and thought of opening a bar. Not knowing the exact way to get a licence and other procedures, he approached a friend, Chandru. In August, Chandru introduced him to Trisha, who reportedly had good links in the government department. “Chandru assured me that Trisha will help me in getting the licence. I was regularly speaking to Trisha over the phone and she asked me to keep Rs 5 lakh ready for some expenses,” he said. On October 1, Trisha informed Shivu that she had arranged one licence and asked him to meet her near Laggere, Rajagopalnagar. “I went alone near Laggere bridge at 1pm. Two men took me to a house where Trisha was there. Suddenly, three men barged in and accused me of having an affair with Trisha. They threatened to file a police complaint and demanded Rs 5 lakh. I told them that I had only Rs 3 lakh and did not carry cash at that point of time. They forced me to call my son-in-law, directing him to bring Rs 3 lakh near Laggere bridge. Two men went out and collected cash from him, and I was released,” he stated. Trisha and her boyfriend Muttu have been detained, an officer said. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/retd-prof-trying-for-bar-licence-loses-3l-to-fraudsters/articleshow/87349093.cms||---

But on a cloudy Thursday evening, the 17-year-old announced his arrival in the senior ranks by making a golden splash at the Basavanagudi Aquatic Centre. A product of the Bangalore Swimmers Research Centre, Sambhavv outpaced his fancied competitors to emerge the fastest male swimmer of the Senior National Aquatic Championships, winning the 50m freestyle event in 23.65 seconds. This was Sambhavv’s maiden senior National individual medal, having made his debut at the 2019 Nationals in Bhopal. At the junior Nationals last week, the youngster had claimed four gold and a bronze in individual events. Sambhavv began the single-lap event with confidence and maintained the lead throughout the race. “I was nervous before the swim. It was tough but I was expecting a gold. Training in the short-course pool helped with turns," said the Inspire PU College student who trains under seasoned coach Jairajan.Another Karnataka teenager to shine in a star-studded line-up was 14-year-old Ridhima Veerendra Kumar. The home pool talent (29.94) was quick off the blocks and pushed hard in the final stretch to leave Tokyo Olympian Maana Patel (30.26) and Nina Venkatesh (30.86) of Karnataka to fight for the other two medals. Kushagra Rawat set the only record of the day in 1500m freestyle, shaving almost three seconds off his own time of 15.41.45 set in 2019. The Delhi swimmer left his competitors behind before the completion of the first lap and didn’t look back, coming home in 15:38.13. Karnataka’s Aneesh Gowda and Vedaant Madhavan of Maharashtra took home the silver and bronze respectively.SAJAN, SRIHARI SHINETokyo Olympians Sajan Prakash and Srihari Nataraj continued to dominate in their chosen events. In the 200m butterfly, Sajan, representing Kerala Police, needed just 25 metres to establish a clear lead. He won the race in 1:58.74 as against his national mark of 1:57.73. Karnataka’s golden boy Srihari hardly broke sweat as he claimed the 50m backstroke gold in 25.77 seconds. Srihari later admitted he was looking to go faster. "But this is more or less where I am in backstroke at the moment. I have been training in backstroke since last November. So just to change it up, I've been training in freestyle a lot more. I think the speed will come back once I start training in backstroke again," explained the 20-year-old. Results: Men: 1500m freestyle: 1. Kushagra Rawat (Del;15:38.13; NR), 2.

Rise in cases prompted a three-day enhanced restrictions in Sonarpur-Rajpur municipality from Thursday till Saturday. All markets, even roadside tea-stalls, were asked to shut and maximum impetus is given on mask compliance. Till reports last came in 100 people were prosecuted for stepping out without masks. Hakim said the re-introduction of containment zones and sealing the border was necessitated due to a sharp rise in Covid numbers since the past two weeks. This apart, the KMC may also need to declare micro containment zones in large areas of south Kolkata to keep the infection at bay, Hakim said. “We are desperate to prevent Covid infection among people of particular neighbourhoods under KMC jurisdiction which are under threat from adjoining areas of a separate municipality. We may need to seal the border to save more people from getting infected,” Hakim said. Major housings like Sherwood, Sugam Park and high-rises like Belmond and Sarbani fall under the restrictions declared in Rajpur-Sonarpur municipality. On Wednesday, most of the markets operated till 11 pm as people bought their essentials for the next three days. From Saturday, the municipality will carry out sanitizaton at these markets. Whether people are in containment zone or not, everyone needs to wear a mask. Else, police will arrest people without mask under the prevention of epidemic act, said Pallab Das, administrator of Rajpur-Sonarpur Municipality.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-may-bring-back-containment-zones/articleshow/87346213.cms||Saikat Ray

The six issues include the one from tech-enabled payments major One 97 Communications, operating under the Paytm brand, which aims to raise Rs 18,300 crore. Paytm has priced its IPO shares in the Rs 2,080-2,150 band per share, indicating the company seeks a valuation of about $20 billion. This will make the Paytm IPO the largest ever in the country’s history. Till date the biggest IPO in India was the Rs 15,500-crore offer by Coal India in October-November 2010. According to market sources, this could have two major implications for Dalal Street and the economy. First, there are fears among traders that the deluge of IPOs could force several investors to offload part of their portfolio and divert that money to invest in these offers, especially for listing gains. Second, the inflows from foreign funds, estimated to be about 40-50% of the total offer, could mean Rs 12,000-15,000 crore of forex inflows. This, in turn, could help appreciate the rupee.

As was expected -- or perhaps I should say feared--the success of the Zomato IPO has triggered off a wave of similar IPOs. When I say ‘similar’, I’mOn Thursday, despite a sharp sell-off in the stock market, the domestic currency closed 11 paise stronger at Rs 74.92 to a dollar. Usually, the day the stock market slides sharply, the rupee also weakens against major currencies like the US dollar, euro, pound sterling and the Japanese yen. Thursday’s strength in the domestic currency came despite a Rs 3,819-crore net selling by foreign funds, BSE data showed. According to a note by the forex advisory firm IFA Global, the strength of the rupee was “because foreign banks sold US dollars for overseas investments into Indian companies raising funds through initial public offerings”. According to data collated from Sebi, merchant bankers and various brokerages, FSN E-Commerce Ventures, the company that operates under the Nykaa brand name, is raising Rs 5,350 crore while PB Fintech (under Policybazaar brand name) is raising Rs 5,200 crore, Fino Payments Bank Rs 1,200 crore, SJS Enterprises Rs 800 crore and Sigachi Industries Rs 125 crore. In addition to the big ticket listings, three more high profile IPOs are also lined up after these got the Sebi green signal in the last few weeks. Adani Wilmar is eyeing Rs 4,500 crore, One MobiKwik is expected to raise Rs 1,900 crore and the offer size for Star Health is expected to be in excess of Rs 3,000 crore, market sources said. These offers could open anytime now, merchant bankers said. The government is also planning to list life insurance behemoth LIC before the end of the fiscal year through its IPO. This offer is expected to garner anything between Rs 70,000 crore and Rs 1 lakh crore, merchant bankers said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/d-st-to-raise-record-rs-31k-cr-from-deluge-of-ipos-in-2-wks/articleshow/87346330.cms||---
---||Patna||High-stake byelection: JD(U) and RJD confident of victory||PATNA: Happening within a year of the new NDA government formation in the state led by CM Nitish Kumar, the multi-cornered byelection to the Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan assembly constituencies to be held on Saturday has acquired high-value stakes. For, after the results are out on November 2, not only the leaders of the ruling combine, but also the lead opposition parties like the RJD, Congress and the LJP (Ram Vilas), will know their existing strength to pull along the masses in their favour. During the early phase of the campaigning soon after the Dussehra festivities, the public imagination got fired, as the leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav claimed the victory of the RJD at the two seats would lead to his becoming the state’s CM even without the Congress support. However, whosoever wins the byelection, there would be no immediate impact on the NDA government led by Nitish, not till the assembly elections in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh are over by March next year, because the byelection is unlikely to make any substantial change in the strength of the NDA that has 126 MLAs in the 243-member House, followed by 110 of the Grand Alliance, including the 19 MLAs of the Congress, observers feel. Amid the surcharged atmosphere that has become progressively acrimonious, both the JD(U) and RJD claimed their victory even on Thursday. The Congress has kept its fingers crossed. “We will win both the seats. People will vote for our candidates taking into account the all-round development activities in the state,” JD(U) MLC and chief spokesman Neeraj Kumar said. The RJD was also sure of its victories at the two seats. “We know that the JD(U) has the administration at its control. They will try to manipulate and also disturb the election process, but our party workers will be at the booths even before the start of the polling,” RJD spokesman Chittaranjan Gagan said. The two seats had been won by the JD(U) in the assembly election held last year. They fell vacant following the death of sitting MLAs Mewa Lal Chaudhary and Shashi Bhushan Hazari.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/high-stake-byelection-jdu-and-rjd-confident-of-victory/articleshow/87344262.cms||Abhay Singh

The deputy CM said, “As per the 2011 census, the population of children in Bihar between 0-18 years is 5 crore. Nearly 90% of them reside in rural areas. We should think about furthering their improvement so that they become frontrunners in the future.” Bihar is one of the only three states which started child budgeting in 2013-2014. “There has been a continuous increase in the allocation and expenditure for children in the past nine years. Between 2013-2014 and 2019-2020, the overall expenditure for children registered an annual growth of 22.7%,” Tarkishore said. He added, “The government of Bihar is working earnestly to improve the lot of the girl child with the help of schemes like ‘Kanya Utthan Yojana’. Many new schools have been opened and this has reduced the dropout rate of children.” Additional chief secretary (finance) S Siddharth stated in his special address that there should be a separate chapter for girls in the child budget and its progress monitored continuously. “In Bihar most parents think of marrying off the girl child once she reaches 14 years of age. In order to rectify this problem, the state government is educating girls till they graduate. This will also help empower the girl child and reduce the fertility rate,” he claimed. Nafisa Binte Shafique, chief of the UNICEF office for Bihar, delivered the introductory remarks. She pointed out that in the beginning, eight departments were included in the child budget, but now 11 departments will report for the same. Prabhat P Ghosh, member secretary, ADRI opined in his welcome address that Bihar is close to the national level as far as IMR is concerned but that is not the case with regard to the field of education. In the second session, Barna Ganguli, assistant professor, CEPPF, ADRI introduced the Child Budget Manual, 2021. She described how it had become possible to bring out the manual. Pramod Kumar Verma, former additional director, planning and development department, focused on the 21 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators related to the Child Budget. Sanjeev Mittal, budget officer-cum-deputy secretary, finance department, imparted training to the nodal officers on the child budgeting process. Sudip Kumar Pandey of ADRI proposed a vote of thanks.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/deputy-cm-releases-manual-for-child-budgeting-in-state/articleshow/87344341.cms||---

Tejashwi said the byelection should be conducted under the supervision of central forces. Tejashwi said one Dilip Kumar Jha was brought on deputation to the police line in Darbhanga after the announcement of dates for the byelection. “Jha had served as SDPO at Biraul in Darbhanga for a long time and was transferred from there a month back only after the matter was raised in the assembly by the RJD. However, he was brought back on deputation to the Darbhanga IG’s office just before the election,” Tejashwi alleged. An RJD delegation also met the Election Commission officials in New Delhi in this regard on Thursday. After the meeting of RJD delegates with the EC officials, Darbhanga SSP removed Jha from the election duties. A day before, Jha and four other officials were given the charge of one super zone each, in which the assembly constituencies were divided. Jha was incharge of super zone 1 and there were 25 booths under him. However, on Thursday, Jha was replaced by DSP headquarter Amit Kumar. Amit was earlier given the charge of super zone 2. However, JD(U)’s former MLC and spokesperson Neeraj Kumar hit back at Tejahswi, saying the latter has accepted his defeat even before the polling. “He knows he will lose the election, so he has come up with such allegations,” Neeraj said. PATCH Ex-JD(U) MLC joins RJD Former JD(U) MLC Anuj Kumar Singh, who was recently discharging his duty as the party’s state vice-president, joined the RJD at Aurangabad on Thursday in presence of leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. Singh, who had a long association with JD(U), had joined the BJP in 2015. He had, however, returned to the JD(U) in October last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/dbhanga-cop-removed-from-election-duty-after-rjds-complaint-to-ec/articleshow/87344578.cms||Sheezan Nezami

There are fears among traders that the deluge of IPOs in the next two weeks may prompt people to withdraw money from listed stocks to invest in those offerings. The sensex closed 1,159 points lower at 59,985 with ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank contributing the most to the day’s loss. On the NSE, the broader Nifty too closed 354 points lower at 17,857 points. On the BSE, the day’s loss left investors poorer by Rs 4.8 lakh crore with market capitalisation now at Rs 263.5 lakh crore, official data showed. Thursday’s session started on a subdued note mainly due to weak global cues and, as sell-offs gained momentum, the sensex lost steam and closed near the day’s low. Of the 30 sensex stocks, 24 closed in the red, BSE data showed. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) led the selling with the day’s net outflow at Rs 3,819 crore, according to the exchange’s data. Domestic funds, however, were net buyers at Rs 837 crore. The selling by foreign funds was part of the recent trend. “Relentless selling by FPIs over the last two weeks has led to weakness in the market,” said Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka. “They have sold over Rs 10,000 crore worth of Indian equities in the past five sessions. Further, mixed earnings season along with premium valuations also exerted pressure in the market as there is little room for disappointment,” Khemka said. In addition to the domestic factors, global cues continue to be weak on account of high inflation hurting global growth, rising Covid cases in some countries making investors cautious and mixed earnings season. Investors are now awaiting the US GDP data and ECB monetary policy outcome (due later on Thursday). Markets are also waiting US Federal Reserve and Bank of England meetings next week, Khemka said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-crashes-1k-pts-on-fpi-selling/articleshow/87346273.cms||---

Recently, work has begun on reviving this Gujarati heritage in Kerala. Kerala had embarked on reviving this rich trading hub, including its buildings, private homes and warehouses, two years ago but the project was delayed due to Covid. To begin with, the Alappuzha heritage project will cover the entire ‘Gujarati Quarters’ that include beach road, Gujarati street, and Muppalam area. On September 14 this year, tenders for reviving the Gujarati Heritage Centre beginning with revival of the house of Anil Seth was taken up at a cost of Rs 1.41 crore. The Seth brothers were one of the leading spice exporters. Their father Manilal Tribhuvandas Seth bought the Ratna Pantikashala near their residence. In the 90s, Anil's two brothers sold all their property and moved back to Bombay. “The house will be restored with proper masonry, woodwork, finishing, freshwater supply works, internal drainage, sanitary fixtures and other miscellaneous works,” states a document of the Kerala tourism department. Seth’s grandfather came to Alappuzha in the 19th century. Tourism Corporation of Gujarat Limited managing director Jenu Devan told TOI, "The Kerala government had approached us for technical help in reviving the Gujarati street and its many heritage buildings that are part of the Alappuzha Heritage Project. The Gujarat government including the previous tourism minister had committed all help prior to the pandemic's second wave. We will extend all possible help.” Gujarati communities such as Parsis, Jains, Vaishnavites, and Kutchi Memons had joined the growing army of merchants who had come to set up shop and build warehouses in Alappuzha town. It is worth noting here that during the reign of Dharma Raja Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma in the 18th century, Raja Kesavdas, the Diwan of Travancore in Kerala, developed Alappuzha into a port about 1762. The Diwan constructed two parallel canals to transport commerce ships into the town's core. This was primarily to encourage Gujarati merchants to take advantage of the facilities for exporting coconut oil, coir and coir derivatives, and spices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/259-year-old-little-gujarat-in-kerala-port-town-to-regain-glory/articleshow/87346318.cms||Paul John

Apart from the rifle, 26 live cartridges and two military hand grenades wrapped in carbon papers were recovered from his house during a police raid on August 16, 2019. Singh had surrendered before a metropolitan court at Saket in New Delhi on August 23, 2019. He was later brought to Patna. Since then, he had been behind bars in Beur central jail. The stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act was invoked in the FIR against Singh, but was dropped from the chargesheet. The bail petition, filed in June this year, had come up for hearing before a bench of Justice Anjani Kumar Sharan. While rejecting the bail, the bench observed that Singh should support the lower court in getting the trial of the case concluded quickly. Lawyer Ajay Kumar Thakur, who appeared for the MLA, argued that the trial has not yet been completed in the case even though the high court had ordered its completion in nine months last year. Additional public prosecutor Ajay Mishra, opposing Thakur’s arguments, submitted that all prosecution witnesses had deposed in the trial within six months of HC order. He submitted that it’s due to Singh that the trial is delayed as he is not appearing before court to complete the procedures. It is for the second time that the high court has rejected Singh’s regular bail plea in the case. On June 11, 2020, a bench of Justice Prabhat Kumar Jha had rejected his bail plea and asked the lower court to conduct day-to-day trial in the case and conclude it within nine months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/arms-recovery-high-court-rejects-anants-bail-petition/articleshow/87344249.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Many patients had to return disappointed from hospitals as the interns staged demonstration and forced closure of the registration counters and OPD services at the PMCH and NMCH. Reports reaching from other places said interns of SKMCH, Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital also staged protests. At PMCH, over a hundred interns staged demonstration with placards reading ‘Healers should not get chillers’, ‘Kam hamara jyada hai, stipend phir bhi aadha gai’ and ‘One state, one stipend’. They also forced closure of registration counters and OPDs, causing inconvenience to many patients. The agitating interns said the amount of Rs 15,000 as stipend to them was insufficient to meet even the necessary expenses. PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said though patients reaching the OPDs faced problems due to the stir, all other works like surgeries and emergency services remained unaffected with the support of junior and senior doctors of the hospital. He said since the interns’ demand was related to the state government, the PMCH administration only requested them to withdraw the stir in the larger interest of the patients. A meeting of all heads of departments of PMCH will be held on Friday to chalk out the strategy in the event of continuation of the interns’ protest. The demonstrating young medicos also forced closure of OPDs at NMCH and sat on a dharna near the emergency department. They said while the interns at the Patna-based IGIMS receive about Rs 27,000 per month, others discharging the same duties in other medical colleges are being treated differently as they are paid lower amount as stipend.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/interns-stir-hits-health-services-at-govt-hospitals/articleshow/87344222.cms||VK Tripathi

A senior official said initial approval for six sites had been given to three companies. Announced earlier this year, the Electric Vehicle Policy of Delhi government aims to register around 5 lakh vehicles in the next five years, but supporting infrastructure, like battery charging points, is needed to instil confidence among the public to buy such vehicles. North corporation will get a share in the revenue generated from these stations and won’t get a fixed amount as rent. The matter has been listed for discussion in the standing committee meeting on Friday. The agreement done between the corporation and the companies in January 2020 had the condition of levying a fixed charge of Rs 2,000 as rent for a single car space. This was opposed by the companies. In March 2021, South Delhi Municipal Corporation had approved the proposal of the companies, which is likely to be adopted by north corporation too. Rajesh Goyal, deputy commissioner of north corporation, said the proposal was likely to be given a green light. “The work will commence after the standing committee approves the proposal. For now, we have given anticipatory approval for six sites,” he added. Energy Efficiency Services Limited, Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL) and Broadcasting Engineering Consultants India Ltd have shown interest in providing the charging stations. “We generally charge Rs 14-18 per unit of electricity to charge batteries. We have been given two sites where work will start in the next one week,” said an official from TPDDL. “The companies conducted a survey of all parking lots under north corporation’s jurisdiction. They showed interest in setting up charging stations in around 80 lots,” said Goyal. Jogi Ram Jain, chairman of the north corporation standing committee, said, “The proposal is up for discussion in the standing committee and the changes are under consideration.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/n-corpn-plans-50-new-ev-charging-stns-in-6-months/articleshow/87346249.cms||---

Following Justice Mayee’s recusal, Justice N V Anjaria referred the PIL to the chief justice for placing it to another bench. Justice Mayee was practising in the apex court and represented Gujarat government before his elevation to the bench earlier this month. The PIL was filed by advocate Amit Panchal after a fire incident occurred in Shrey Hospital on August 6, 2020 killing eight Covid-19 patients. He demanded proper implementation of the Fire Safety Act. Earlier this year, the high court insisted that the state government should also enforce the GDCR and ensure BU permissions for all buildings. It asked the government a plan to enforce GDCR norms. In response, the state government came up with a notification on July 8 saying that it would not take coercive action against building occupiers for not having valid BU permissions at least till March 31, 2022. It cited the pandemic for granting such relaxation. While seeking to recuse himself from the matter, Justice Mayee said, “Before the Supreme Court, I justified the July 8 notification. I was vehemently protecting the notification of the state government. So, I cannot hear this matter.” The lawyers requested the judge not to recuse himself and said they have ‘fullest confidence” in the bench. To this, the judge said, “For your confidence, I am thankful. But it is not proper on my part to hear this case.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/judge-recuses-from-fire-pil/articleshow/87346039.cms||---

An estimated 60% customers bought jewellery whereas the remaining bought coins and bars of gold,” said Jigar Soni, president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA). “A lot of investors who put money in gold had pre-booked bullion. People realised the importance of gold as an asset during the pandemic period and therefore, investors who diversify their investment portfolio, never part with gold,” Soni further said. The high price of gold was no more a dampener for purchases. Gold price settled at Rs 49,700 per 10 gram in the Ahmedabad market suggest estimates by bullion traders. Besides gold, even silver demand remained buoyant with a lot of coins, bars, artefacts and light-weight functional and designer jewellery being purchased. JAA estimates indicate that some 40kg gold was traded on Pushya Nakshatra last year in the city. This means sales have increased 450% against the pandemic times. However, this year’s muhurat sales on Pushya Nakshatra raced ahead of pre-pandemic period too. Pushya Nakshatra gold sales increased 76% against 2019’s festive muhurat backed by buoyant purchases and pent-up demand. Gold demand remained buoyant in other cities as well. With a slow start in morning, the sales of precious metals picked up in the afternoon in the Diamond City of Surat. Office-bearers of Jewellers Association claimed that city jewellers did business of Rs 80-100 crore on the auspicious day of Pushya Nakshatra. The overall market situation is better than 2019 say leading jewellers. The sales on Thursday included gold, silver and other precious metal jewellery and bars. "The market is improving and we are much better compared to 2020. We are also doing good in comparison to pre-Covid period as well. We hope good business in the upcoming marriage season as people have savings of the past 18 months and a portion of it will definitely go to buying precious metals," said Salim Daginawala, president of Surat Jewellers Association. The gold jewellery selling in Rajkot is around 75 to 80 kg in one day on Thursday on account of Pushya Nakshatra according to jewellers. Mayur Adesara vice president of Indian Bullion Jewellers association (IBJA) said "This year the small buyers who want to by two to five grams also came to market. There is heavy rush of customers at all the jewellers. Last year there was very negligible sell because of Covid but if we compare with the year before, there is 60% increase in sales this year." Vadodara however, reported slow uptakes. Raghav Chavan of Vadodara-based Prakash Jewellers said, “The sale on Pushya Nakshatra is less this time as compared to last year. Our business is about 40% down this year. It is possible that many didn’t buy gold as it is month-end. People must be waiting for their salaries or bonuses. So, we are expecting the sales to pick up on Dhanteras.” The purchase of wedding jewellery largely drove the demand for gold on Pushya Nakshatra. However, these were largely pre-booked orders for which delivery was taken on this day, suggest jewellers. “Besides wedding jewellery, the demand for lightweight functional jewellery was a hit. Younger generation focuses more on design and less on the carat value of gold. Therefore, trendy designs in 18- and 22-carat gold in addition to rose gold jewellery and diamond as well as silver jewellery sales remained good,” said Ashish Zaveri, a city-based jeweller. “We had already received a good number of pre-bookings for deliveries on Pushya Nakshatra. People also made ‘shagun’ purchases and booked bigger orders for wedding jewellery today,” Zaveri further added.

---||Lucknow||UP took giant green leap in 4 years: CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that UP has done a lot since 2017 for conservation of environment, but it still has challenges to meet. Incidents of stubble burning are a challenge. “The season is about to start when such incidents will take place,” he said, adding that there have been instructions from the NGT and the department for environment, forest and climate change has also made a lot of efforts to control it, but there is a need to do more to create awareness. “We still need more effort. Inter-departmental coordination is needed to control it,” said the CM. The CM inaugurated the two-day Uttar Pradesh Climate Change Conclave-2021 on Thursday and said, “Being the biggest state in the country we also have a bigger responsibility towards environment conservation. Also, when we conserve nature, it gives us much more protection. No wonder, we call it Mother Nature, it has the traits of a mother. “We have a culture of shaanti paath on auspicious occasions where the host takes the pledge to conserve every part of the environment. This culture shows that Indians have always been sensitive towards nature and environment,” he said, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken several steps for the conservation of the environment. “Namami Gange has infused life in the Ganga. Kanpur was the most critical point along the river. At one of the points in Kanpur, about 24cr litre of sewage was discharged into the river. Today, that point has transformed into a selfie point,” he said. The Ganga has got aquatic life and Gangetic dolphins are back in the river. Highlighting efforts done by his government for conservation of the Ganga, he said the state government took out two yatras, one from Ballia to Kanpur and the other from Bijnor to Kanpur, in February last year to increase awareness about the Ganga’s cleanliness and ecological flow. There were kavi sammelans and public meetings that were organised to increase public awareness on the issue. Farmers in Ganga villages (villages on the banks of the river) in Kanpur were trained in cow-based farming. “We also invited the Gujarat governor Acharya Devvrat who has done a lot of work on the subject to help train farmers,” said the CM. The state government has subsidised organic farming in these villages. Besides, farmers were encouraged to grow fruit-bearing trees on the boundary of their fields using organic farm inputs. “We give some money to such farmers for three years. They can also earn by selling fruits. Farmers have started doing all this,” he said. The state government is also raising Ganga nurseries in districts along the river which have trees like Peepal, Banyan, pakad, neem and others for plantation in the green belts along the Ganga. “The first thing we did in 2017 was take strict action against the illegal slaughter houses. It led to infections and diseases. We told people to follow the NGT guidelines and gradually it made people aware and they started informing the government about such illegal activities,” said the CM. Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) was another huge campaign that helped protect and conserve the environment. “More than 2.6cr people in UP got oilets. Now, the state government is getting a public toilet built in every gram panchayat.” CM Yogi Adityanath flagged off dry runs of ecotourists on the three ecotourism circuits on Thursday. The ecotourists included people from media, bloggers and influencers who are taking a tour to Agra-Etawah, Gorakhpur-Sohagibarwa and Vindhyan circuit (Chandrakanta circuit) between Varanasi and Chandauli.The dry runs will help the forest corporation and the department in gathering feedback on the existing and missing facilities and infrastructure on the circuits. “Chambal’s water has a pleasant taste,” said the chief minister while talking about the three ecotourism circuits. The Gorakhpur-Sohagibarwa circuit starts from Gorakhpur zoo and will end at Sohagibarwa wildlife sanctuary, Maharajganj. A 70-hectare Pargapur taal, Vinod van which is a mini forest, Budhiya Mata mandir in Gorakhpur, Darjinia taal (lake) and a 2-km nature trail in the dense forest in Sohagibarwa wildlife division in Maharajganj will be the attractions. In Varanasi-Chandauli circuit lie the Rajdari-Devdari waterfalls which are on the Chandraprabha dam in the state’s oldest wildlife sanctuary, Chandraprabha wildlife sanctuary, which was declared in 1957, in Chandauli. The waterfalls are about 65kms from Varanasi and are perennial. The site has quite a few facilities existing for tourists besides a forest rest house. The Agra-Etawah circuit will start from the Taj Nature Walk in Agra and have Sur Sarovar bird sanctuary (Keetham lake), internationally recognised National Chambal Sanctuary and over 300 bird species lying in Agra and Etawah. The circuit will end at the lion safari in Etawah.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-took-giant-green-leap-in-4yrs-cm/articleshow/87347926.cms||---

---||Goa||From aadolis to harvester machines, politicians woo voters ahead of Goa polls||PANAJI: As the 2022 assembly polls approach, ticket aspirants and political fronts have started wooing voters with gifts and freebies. Across the state voters are being offered everything from sound systems and aadolis (a traditional kitchen cutter-cum-grater) to harvester machines and umbrellas. While the two principal national parties — BJP and Congress — are battling for pride and redemption, their relatively younger rivals are out to upset the apple cart. Political observers say that as parties finalise their candidates closer to the election dates in February, the voter will be spoiled for choice — of gifts. With several aspiring politicos vying for votes in Cumbharjua, the local women have had a field day getting goodies such as sarees, aadolis, a free ambulance service, and health check-ups. In almost every constituency, the local MLAs have reached out to farmers during the on-going harvesting season and offered to pay the farmer’s share of fees for the harvester machines. Traditionally, the government pays half of the rent for the machines and the farmers have to pay the remaining half of the money. The Dussehra festive season also gave the ruling side and the aspirants a chance to dust off their dancing shoes and open their wallets a bit more. Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral, Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, Calangute MLA Michael Lobo and many others were seen trying their hands at dandiya, garba and dindi. While deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar organised dandiya classes at Shantadurga Fatarpekarin Devasthan Hall, Quepem, Lobo has organised an Aakash Kandil competition in his constituency. “This is all a joke. It’s so funny how everyone started working just before the election,” said Marlon Pereira, a netizen, after watching the efforts being put in. In St Andre, Goa Forward Party’s Jagdish Bhobe distributed umbrellas to local fruit and vegetable vendors, while Congressman Alton D’costa, who hopes to dethrone Kavlekar, sponsored athletes from Quepem who are representing Goa in the Grappling Wrestling Championship in Delhi. While such freebies are welcomed by everyone, it may not always go as per plan. Such largesse will always have critics. In their enthusiasm to endear themselves to voters, aspirants from the same party and constituency are now jostling and clashing, as witnessed in Siolim where Lobo and former BJP MLA Dayanand Mandrekar crossed swords to inaugurate harvesting machines. Mandrekar, a three-time MLA and former minister is keen on reprising his role as the local MLA of Siolim, a position that his Calangute neighbour’s wife Delilah covets. While political pundits agree that politics makes strange bedfellows it did not stop them from being surprised when Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao held a beach cleanliness drive in his constituency. And no, Alemao did not show up for the drive.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ahead-of-elections-its-raining-freebies-in-goa/articleshow/87346939.cms||Newton Sequeira

Its net profit has grown more than doubled at Rs 1,089 crore in the second quarter, as compared to Rs 412 crore in the same period last year. Its MD & CEO Shanti Lal Jain said the profit was driven by growth in non-interest income, (other income), which grew by 26% YoY and 8% QoQ. “It stood at Rs 1,966 crore as against Rs 1,558 crore in the second quarter, on account of increase in recovery of bad debts and forex income,” Jain said. However, the bank’s net interest income declined by 1% YoY and 2% QoQ to Rs 4,084 crore in the September quarter, 2021. The public sector bank said we have recognized eight accounts as NPA (bad loans) worth Rs 1,900 crore, which are to be given to the National Asset Reconstruction Company (bad bank). He said “We have already made 50% of provisions for those eight accounts.” Provisions and contingencies allocated to cover bad loans lowered to Rs 2,187 crore in this quarter, as against Rs 2,530 crore for the corresponding period last year, and Rs 2,234 crore sequentially. Gross NPA ratio stood at 9.56% in September 2021, marginally lower from 9.89% in September, 2020. The net NPA ratio stood at 3.26%, higher from 2.96% in the same period. The bank’s fresh slippages declined to Rs 3,952 crore compared to Rs 4,204 crore in the June quarter. Fresh slippage was high due to Corporate loans and crop loans.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-bank-classifies-2-srei-grp-a/cs-as-npa/articleshow/87345271.cms||Mamtha Asokan

As per Hindu belief, buying something new on this day makes Goddess Lakshmi happy after which she bestows her blessings on devotees. Manoranjan Kumar, a salesman at a utensil shop near Station Road, told this reporter that the festive rush was evident in the market. “We are expecting that the rush will continue till Dhanteras and Diwali,” he said. Saurabh Suman, the sales executive of a branded jewellery showroom on Boring Canal Road, claimed, “Several customers, who had booked gold jewellery, purchased it today. They also bought simple pendants, earrings, rings, and chains.” Umesh Tekriwal, the manager of another jewellery showroom, said, “Earrings, simple pendants, and bangles are in demand.

---||Business||Cognizant revenue grows at 11% in July-Sept qtr||Chennai: IT major Cognizant on Thursday posted 11% revenue growth year-on-year in constant currency (CC) terms at $4.74 billion for the July-September quarter narrowly beating analyst estimates. Analysts had estimated the company to post around $4.7 billion in revenue.Revenue grew marginally in sequential terms from $4.6 billion in April-June quarter. Cognizant’s net profit stood at $544 million, up 6% from $512 million in the last quarter and higher by 56% from the same period last year, when demand was hit by Covid-19 impact. Margins at 15.8% saw a 10 basis points decline YoY largely due to higher delivery costs and subcontractor charges. Cognizant marginally raised its revenue guidance for the full year 2021 buoyed by the quarter’s performance. It now expects to grow 9.8% (CC terms) YoY compared to 9-10% it guided to in April-June. However, the IT firm’s performance lags rivals TCS and Infosys for the comparable period when TCS posted 15% YoY revenue growth (CC terms) and Infosys revenue grew almost 19%. An unprecedented demand-supply mismatch in the tech sector continues to impact the IT bellwether’s talent retention efforts as attrition reached record highs in the quarter. Quarterly annualised attrition stood at 37% compared to 31% in the previous quarter and 18% in the same quarter last year. Voluntary attrition stood at 33% and is highest in mid-junior levels, primarily in India. In comparison, attrition at Infosys was around 12% for TCS, 20% for Infosys, and 16% for HCL in the September quarter. Cognizant CEO Brian Humphries told analysts in the earnings call that the company did not have “enough headcount to fulfill our [its] potential. And therefore we've been faced with choice points, which clients to serve, which deals to chase, where we walk away, where we're willing to make pricing stances that may put a deal at risk, but it's the appropriate thing to do given to the demand, supply and balance.” He expects elevated attrition in the industry in coming quarters and hopes it will right itself over time, and said “retention and recruitment have our leadership’s full attention.” “CTSH [Cognizant] is going full throttle on laterals to fulfill demand. Backfill of attrition is a margin headwind but is managed through cost discipline. High attrition environment entails execution risks in delivery,” analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note.Despite the elevated attrition, Cognizant’s net headcount increased by over 17,000 in the quarter. The IT firm also expects to make offers to 45,000 new graduates in India in the fourth quarter. For the July-September period, financial services revenue grew 4.3% in constant currency, healthcare revenue grew 9.8%, and Products and Resources segment revenue grew 18.1%. Communications, Media and Technology was the best growing segment at 19.1% growth.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cognizant-revenue-grows-at-11-in-july-sept-qtr/articleshow/87345194.cms||---

The anchor book, which will open and close on November 3, is likely to have a size of 8,300 crore, which is around 46% of the issue size. According to sources, bankers have received commitments for the entire anchor portion. These include several first-time India investors who want to be part of the anchor issue. In terms of the offer, shares will be offered in a price band of Rs 2,080-2,150 with a bid lot of six shares or multiples of six thereafter. The anchor investors can pick up to 60% of the issue, while retail investors can get up to 10% of the offer. The issue is set to be not just India’s biggest but also the largest from a tech company offering outside the US markets. One97 Communications, the parent company of Paytm, is positioning itself as a tech services platform rather than a financial services company. Addressing a press conference on the launch of the company’s IPO, founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma said that the company has no intention of getting into the lending business. Paytm Payments Bank, however, has the option of applying to convert itself into a small finance bank after five years of operations, he said. According to an investment banker, given the new-to-India funds who have shown interest, the issue will open up the country for newer categories of investors and not divert money from existing investments. “If we can say 2010-20 was for Asia at large, China and Japan for other countries, 2020-30 is 100% for India. This is the age of India. Whether you are a private company, young startup or potentially to list or a listed company. This is the time that the world is going to give you money,” Sharma said. In addition to being a super app that allows customers to shop, pay bills, transfer money, take loans and invest, Paytm generates revenues from a wholesale business like payment gateways. Paytm has said that it has 12 crore annual transacting users, 2.2 crore merchants and 13 lakh payment-acceptance devices. It has also enabled commerce worth Rs 4 lakh crore of gross merchandise value (GMV). “We have quoted GMV as a number in the document which is consumer-paying, that means there is commerce happening on our platform. We now have Rs 363-crore contribution profit. It is important to note that payment is a flywheel, monetisation is in payments and financial services. That’s our business model.,” Sharma said. He added that the brand itself is valued at Rs 47,000 crore. According to Sharma, the network effect is already visible and Paytm now does not need to go through NPCI’s unified payment interface for most merchant payments. “Most of the transactions are ‘on us’ as both customer and merchant are with Paytm,” said Sharma. Paytm president & group CFO Madhur Deora said that the company has been able to bring down its marketing and promotion expenses to Rs 533 crore from Rs 3,408 crore in FY19 even as the value of transactions on the platform grew. The GMV of transactions in September 2021 stood at Rs 1.95 lakh crore more than double the Rs 94,692 crore recorded in September 2020.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/paytm-anchor-investors-may-buy-46-of-shares-on-offer/articleshow/87346344.cms||Mayur Shetty

But the burglary gangs are expected to get active again this Diwali and it has the business community and citizens worried. The police, though, said that they have already made plans to tackle the burglaries and robberies by stepping up patrolling the city areas over the next fortnight. “We have approached the police officials and requested them to increase police patrolling in certain areas of the city. With Diwali around the corner, the burglary and robbery gangs are expected to target citizens. The police department can provide a sense of security to the citizens and business community,” said Paresh Parikh, convener of Vadodara Vepar Vikas Association (VVVA). During Diwali, thousands flock to areas like Mandvi, Nyay Mandir, Raopura, Rajmahal Road, Nava Bazaar, Mangal Bazaar and Chowkhandi for shopping. And many of them fall victim to pick-pocketers and robbers. Also, burglary gangs from adjacent districts strike when people lock up their homes and leave for vacations or their natives. Some of the gangs even break into shops that are stocked up with expensive goods during Diwali. City police commissioner Shamsher Singh said that the trader community has approached them for help. “Our teams have met the jewellers and shop-owners and asked them to keep their CCTVs in active mode. Those not having CCTVs are being urged to get them installed,” Singh told TOI. The police have also asked the traders to keep an eye on their area and report any suspicious person or activity to the police. “Many cops are patrolling the residential and commercial areas in civil dress,” Singh said. The cops will also step up night patrolling in different areas in the coming days. “Those going away for vacations should inform the local police station so that our team can patrol their area.

Devang Patel, 37, a resident of Sola, who works as network engineer with the UN Mehta Hospital, said in his FIR that the accused created the fake Facebook account on which he put the phone number and email ID of hospital director R K Patel.

He spotted the fake Facebook page with a note that read: “Hospital is going to shut down very soon. We will stop treating any cardiac patients. We will resume work after April 2022. We regret the inconvenience.” Patel said that he informed hospital admin manager Naitik Patel about the fake Facebook page . He verified that some miscreant had created the fake FB page of the hospital with an intention to misguide people. After this, the hospital staff approached cybercrime police and filed a complaint against an unknown person under the charges of the information technology act. “The fake page looks similar to the original page operated by the hospital.

While irate councillors levelled charges of corruption against the technical section, chief officer Agnelo Fernandes and chairperson Lyndon Pereira also cast aspersions on the integrity of the team of engineers. Uproar in Margao councilThe issue of missing files of Sonsoddo came to the fore when Sagun Naik, a councillor from MMC’s governing panel, demanded to know from the chairperson the “inordinate” delay in construction of a shed and an access road to the solid waste management plant at Sonsoddo. As Pereira failed to give a satisfactory explanation, Naik demanded that the relevant files be tabled before the council.  The technical section said that while one file hadn’t come back from the chief officer’s chamber, the other was forwarded to the “dealing hand”. Fernandes expressed his disapproval over the functioning of the technical section. “I have to beg with the engineers to speed up their work. Something (suspicious) is going on in the technical section. All the files are getting marked to only one particular junior engineer (JE). There’s a lot of interference (by the engineers) in matters beyond their jurisdiction,” Fernandes told the councillors at the meeting. As his instructions to the technical section to fetch the files failed to work, agitated councillors marched to the technical section in a bid to locate the missing files themselves even as the chief officer suspended the proceedings until their return to the meeting hall. During the file-hunting episode, the JE concerned was accused of “hiding” files, including those that were not related to his jurisdiction. While the missing files couldn’t be traced, the councillors laid their hands on a measurement book (MB) pertaining to the missing file on the JE’s table, raising further suspicions of malfeasance. Armed with the MB, councillors demanded that action be taken against the JE. A resolution was unanimously passed to the effect that he be stopped from processing any more files of the technical section, and that he be deployed for work on the waste management front instead. Councillor Naik who raised the issue, said, “They took a year-and-a-half only to prepare estimates for a simple task of constructing a shed and a road, and the work order has still not been issued to the contractor. The MMC is learnt to have deposited heavy fines with the Goa State Pollution Control Board for delay in construction of the shed. This is sheer misuse of taxpayers’ money. Such callous attitude of the municipality engineers needs to be stopped.” Later speaking to reporters, chairperson Pereira said that if the missing files aren’t traced soon, a police complaint will be filed. “I have already complained to the directorate of municipal administration that the technical section isn’t functioning, as a result of which development work gets hampered.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/sonsoddo-files-missing-from-mmcs-technical-section/articleshow/87347111.cms||---

Market players and analysts feel this decision of the government could weigh on the stock in the short term. Currently, IRCTC does not share collections from these charges with the government. However, some analysts pointed out that during its IPO in 2019, the company had pointed out this as one of the risks to the stock. On Thursday, after each IRCTC stock was split into five, from face value of Rs 10 to Rs 2, it closed at Rs 914 on the BSE, up nearly 11% on the day. In a disclosure to the exchanges, IRCTC on Thursday said that the railways ministry on October 28 has “conveyed its decision to share the revenue earned from convenience fee collected by IRCTC in the ratio of 50:50”. As a result, analysts are drastically cutting earnings estimates for IRCTC while traders expect a sharp sell-off in the stock on Friday. In the last one year, as the economy slowly opened after the March-June 2020 lockdown, the stock had gone up more than four times. According to analysts, this government decision could lead to a 27-30% cut in IRCTC’s fiscal 2023 earnings. “This is a huge negative development and we expect sharp correction in the stock price after this announcement,” one analyst said. However, traders pointed out that since the government announced this decision on the day each IRCTC stock was split, investors are yet to get credit for the extra four shares for each share they hold now in their demat accounts. These additional shares will reflect in their demat holdings sometime next week and till then the selling could be limited.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/convenience-fee-govt-to-take-50-from-irctc/articleshow/87346382.cms||---

A private firm will be hired to carry out the activities in all the wards throughout the year. A decision in this regard was taken at the 52nd standing committee meeting of the PMC held at Maurya Lok Complex on Thursday. The meeting was chaired by Patna mayor Sita Sahu and attended by municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma and deputy mayor Rajni Devi. The mayor said the IEC activities were important to bring about a change in people’s behaviour. “The selected firm will form a team in each ward to sensitize people to importance of segregating wet and solid wastes at home. In clean cities like Indore, such activities are carried out throughout the year.” Altogether 27 proposals were passed during the meeting, including beautification of ghats for Chhath Puja, introduction of electric crematoriums at three more ghats, regularization of jobs of sanitation workers who have completed 10 years of their services, renaming of several lanes, ‘Har Ghar Nal ka Jal Yojna’, and installation of submersible pumps. According to the members of the empowered standing committee, during the inspection of ghats on Wednesday, CM Nitish Kumar had directed the civic body officials to install one electric crematorium each at Digha Ghat, Bans Ghat and Nandgola Ghat.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/pmc-bid-to-promote-waste-segregation/articleshow/87344364.cms||Faryal Rumi

The accused, Mohd Dildar Hussain, was arrested by police early on Thursday with the help of some local residents when he was trying to escape from his house located at Dudhauti village under the Thakurganj police station area. Kishanganj Sadar sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Anwar Javed said on Thursday Dildar first attacked his mother Zainab Khatoon (62) with a sharp-edged weapon when she was sleeping on the veranda of the house. When his father Fazlu Rahman intervened, he was also attacked with the same weapon causing grievous injuries. He, however, succumbed to his injuries on the way to a hospital at Kishanganj district headquarters. “The information about the incident came to the police station concerned at around 12.30am. A police team was sent to the spot, which took the accused into custody,” the SDPO told this newspaper. Later in the day, an FSL team visited the spot and collected blood samples.

An action plan will be chalked out based on the recommendations for implementation before monsoon next year,” said a KMDA official. “The agency will recommend how the road medians and existing storm water drainage facilities on Bypass can be upgraded and revamped. It will also be coming up with the proposals for road safety and exploring the possibilities of developing cycle paths, underground cable ducts and other utilities on the Bypass stretch,” the official added. Officials said that the top layer of the Bypass surface had been laid last in 2013-14. Each year the condition of the Bypass road deteriorates after heavy rain during monsoon while the KMDA authorities conduct patch work on the damaged stretches as temporary measures. “Once we get the detailed report, we can start working on an overall repair project of the Bypass stretch at specific spots,” said the official. The authorities have decided to install a new drainage pipeline from near Dhapa crossing to Metropolitan Housing junction.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/17km-survey-for-bypass-drainage/articleshow/87346308.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The mishap took place around 9.30pm after eight Dhule-bound vehicles coming from Madhya Pradhesh crashed into each other from behind. Police said the car carrying the four victims first hit a truck ahead of it. Another truck following the car crashed into it, almost crushing it. Thereafter, another five trucks hit each other. Police said the accident happened on the descent of the ghat where the vehicles couldn’t stop quickly enough. The victims were identified as Sachin Gangurde, Raju Gangurde, Shiva Gangurde and Ramdas Dalvi. While the first three died on the spot, Dalvi died on the way to hospital, said assistant inspector Suresh Shirsath of the Shirpur taluka police station in Dhule. They were coming from Sendhva after making some purchases. Shirsath said the driver of yet another truck noticed the accident from a little distance. The driver could not control his truck either but drove off the road into the farms. “Had he not taken the decision to get off the road, the numbers of casualties could have increased manifold,” he added. The victims’ car was so badly damaged that it took about one-and-a-half hours for the police to separate it from the trucks using cranes and remove the travellers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/four-in-car-killed-on-dhule-ghat-descent-in-eight-vehicle-pile-up/articleshow/87343640.cms||---

They alleged that works of Congress councillors are approved easily while their claims are not being heard. The councillors staged a sit-in and shouted slogans against mayor (North) Kunti Deora and commissioner Rajendra Singh Kavia on Thursday. Councillor Rajesh Kachhawaha said that developmental and cleaning work are not taking place in the wards of BJP councillors while the same have been going on the wards of Congress councillors regularly. “We also gave complaints to the commissioner in written many times but even that has been of no use. It is a festive season and wards of BJP councillors are dotted with garbage. Even street lights are not working in many wards,” he claimed. Despite repeated attempts, TOI fails to get response from the mayor. A verbal duel with the mayor of BJP ruled South Municipal Corporation with the district magistrate Indrajit Singh at one of the camps under Prashasan Sahron ke Sangh abhiyan two days back had also hogged the limelight, which was triggered by the mayor Vinita Seth inquiring about the absence of the officials from PWD in the camp. She had sought reply from the district magistrate stating that roads were broken and officials of the PWD were not present in the camp and questioned him that whom should we look to for this if people come to the councillors and councillors look up to us. Though, the district magistrate did not like her aggression asking her to mend her ways but assured that he would do the need full to address the problem.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/bjp-councillors-stage-sit-in-over-no-devpt-work-in-jodhpur/articleshow/87346321.cms||---

This includes ensuring that those coming especially from abroad or states like Kerala and Maharashtra, are carrying negative Covid-19 reports. He has also said that the government must focus on innoculating more people who are eligible for the second dose. While UP has now registered the most number of people who are fully vaccinated, which has now crossed 3 crore, there are still about 1 crore people who are yet to take their second dose. “The CM has said that the efforts to ensure that all persons take their second shot on time should be ramped up. The state has already earmarked Saturdays exclusively for those who have to take their second shots,” said a government spokesperson. Meanwhile, as Covid-19 cases are going up in other states and neighbouring countries, the nigrani committees have been asked to become alert and focus on house visits once again. “The surveillance committees were a useful tool in controlling the spread of the pandemic in the state as members would visit homes, identify possible patients, distribute medicines and pulse oxymeters etc. These were highly active till July or August but now that cases around UP are rising once again, they have been put on high alert and asked to restart their visits to identify anyone who is showing influenza-like illness,” said the spokesperson, adding that the committees have also been asked to check the spread of vector-borne diseases . From Friday, over 73,000 surveillance committees will visit homes and carry out screening and tracing . The exercise will be stepped up in festival season when there may be a possibility of increasing cases. After several days of no Covid casualties in UP, one patient from Bulandshahr district succumbed to the attack of coronavirus in the last 24 hours. The latest casualty took the official death toll in UP from March 2020 to 22,900. Apart from one death, 11 positive cases were reported from 10 districts of the state with the highest two cases reported in Ghaziabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ensure-people-coming-to-state-are-tested-for-covid-directs-cm/articleshow/87347984.cms||---

The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu, however, said the three-member judges committee appointed by the state government to monitor the process could proceed with carrying out inventory of gold and other materials donated to temples. The court passed the order after it was contented that HR&CE commissioner could not suo motu decide on melting temple gold and such a proposal can come only from the trustees of the temples. Two petitioners, M Saravanan and A V Gopala Krishnan, had challenged the decision to melt temple jewellery and deposit the gold in banks. Responding to the plea, advocate-general R Shunmugasundaram told the court that advertisements have been issued for appointing trustees to temples and the exercise would take four to six weeks to be completed. Pointing out that the state has already commenced the exercise of installing trustees at the temples, Shunmugasundaram said: “The work of carrying out the inventory of the offerings at the temples and the properties of the temples may continue, but the decision of whether or not to melt the jewellery which has been offered in the temples would be taken after the trustees are installed in the relevant temples.” On October 12, the state informed the court that the scheme for melting gold jewellery donated to temples for monetisation is not new and it had been in existence since 1977. “So far, about 5 lakh grams of gold jewellery have been melted and deposited in various nationalised banks which is fetching around Rs 11 crore as interest,” the AG said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/hc-tn-cant-melt-temple-gold-must-wait-for-trustees/articleshow/87346311.cms||Suresh Kumar

A press statement, issued by the NCW, stated that it was “utterly humiliating to make women go through such harassment” while condemning the shameful incident. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma also sought an explanation as to why there were no female guards deputed to search female candidates at the exam centre. Some 3,20,034 candidates took the RAS test. To prevent cheating, ‘dupattas’ were taken away from female candidates, sleeves of their tops cut, shoes, even earrings and hairbands removed. In Thursday’s edition, TOI had published a picture of a male security guard cutting the sleeves of a top worn by a female candidate outside an examination centre for RAS in Bikaner district. A copy of the letter has also been sent to chairman, Rajasthan Public Service Commission (RPSC). NCW has to be apprised of the action taken in the matter at the earliest. At the recently held REET and patwari examinations too, female candidates were frisked in the presence of male guards.Sanjana Verma, a resident of Jaipur who took the patwari examination recently, had to remove her 'dupatta' during the examination. “We were frisked as if we were criminals. I had to remove my 'dupatta' in front of a male guard first and it was taken away. Later, a female security searched us physically everywhere to see if we were hiding any cheating material. Despite having such security checks, people were caught cheating at these examinations,” Sanjana said. Another student Priya Sharma said that she felt very uncomfortable writing the test without the 'dupatta'. “I was very disturbed during the examination. Even after all this harassment, we read in newspapers that many people were caught cheating,” Priya said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/ncw-takes-suo-motu-action-for-humiliating-women-at-ras-exam/articleshow/87347229.cms||---

The new cases in Maharashtra per 10 lakh people during the week dropped to 81 from 104 of last week (October 13-19), with 24 districts in the state registering a fall in cases per million. In Pune, new Covid cases per million population dropped below 200 too, at 188 in the latest week from 241 last week. Ahmednagar, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Raigad and Pune (in this order) recorded the maximum dip in new cases per million population in comparison to the week before, public health department data showed. Mumbai also witnessed a drop, with 210 new cases per million citizens during the latest week. Maharashtra disease surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI, “Irrespective of the indicators one sees — be it positivity rates or cases per million per week or mortalities — Maharashtra’s second Covid wave now seems flattened, with the disease entering the endemic phase in the state. There are many variables that can affect Covid endemicity, especially a genomic change in the virus. Surges in Covid-19 cases are driven by the appearance of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. However, we have not seen any major or significant genomic change in the virus in the last four months.” The state’s positivity rate is now 1.45%. “As per WHO, an epidemic is considered to be under control when this rate is below 5%,” said Dr Awate. A public health department official said the week-on-week new Covid-19 cases had been reducing in a majority of the districts.” Senior epidemiologist Dr Amitav Banerjee told TOI, “A number of citizens are now sero-positive and have antibodies against Covid. When a large number of people get exposed to the virus, it eventually leads to a high level of population immunity. This is the natural trajectory of an epidemic or pandemic. Those who were vulnerable have either already succumbed, or been vaccinated. So, the size of the vulnerable population has also reduced overtime.” On SARS-CoV-2’s endemicity, Dr Banerjee said, “A virus generally keeps mutating to a more benign form over a period of time for survival. The more virulent versions die with the host. People with a moderate to symptomatic infection generally isolate themselves, which further inhibits transmission. Such virulent strains do not perpetuate. Only those that cause mild or no symptoms tend to gradually transmit. Mild versions of the virus will not cause severe disease. In the long run, that is how viruses become endemic.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/new-covid-cases-per-million-maha-population-below-100/articleshow/87344801.cms||Neha Madaan

Vaccine hesitancy, misconceptions and a long gap of 84 days in between the two Covishield doses were the likely reasons for the low numbers, experts stated. “A total of 32,281 pregnant women have received the first dose of Covid vaccine in Maharashtra till October 27. Of them, 901 have received both doses. We are doing multifarious activities to increase the vaccination numbers in pregnant women,” state immunization officer Sachin Desai told TOI. He also underlined the likelihood of these numbers being slightly higher than reported because many pregnant women did not like to disclose their pregnancy status and preferred to get the Covid shots under the age category. “Many women might be opting for the first or second shot under the age group category, and not under the pregnant women category. This is likely to be the foremost reason why the overall vaccination numbers are so low in pregnant women. Besides, some of those who took the first shot might have delivered by the time their second dose was due and this might have led to an obvious delay in taking the second shot,” Desai said. Some wrong notions are also likely to be among the root causes of low vaccination numbers among pregnant women. Many of them may be avoiding vaccination during the first trimester (first three months of pregnancy). “Mass awareness activities and repeated counselling are needed to allay fears of untoward side-effects, including miscarriage. The Covid vaccine is safe,” said senior gynaecologist Sanjay Gupte, former national president of Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOSGI). “Pre-existing comorbidities, advanced maternal age and high body mass index are risk factors for severe Covid -19 in pregnancy. These women have a greater risk of severe illness from Covid-19, hence they should opt for vaccination 12 weeks from the infection or eight weeks from full recovery,” said gynaecologist Pankaj Sarode, the vice-president of the Pune Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society — a professional body of obstetricians and gynaecologists practising in Pune. TOI reported earlier that the vaccination drive has evoked poor response in rural areas of Aurangabad, too.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/only-0-04-pregnant-women-fully-vaxxed-in-maharashtra-health-dept/articleshow/87344827.cms||Umesh Isalkar

There are a total of 250 depots in the state; work was partly affected in 68 other depots, said sources. The spontaneous strike, called not by unions but workers, was to demand merger of the bus corporation with the state government (as a department) and increase in dearness allowances for 93,000 staffers in the workforce, among others. Partly acquiescing to their demands, state transport minister Anil Parab announced further increase in dearness allowance on Thursday evening — from previous 12% to 28%. He also said there will be a hike in house rent allowance and the state will also discuss the issue of annual increment for employees. A MSRTC official said bus operations were paralysed in Mumbai as well, including the AC luxury inter-city Shivneris that go to Pune. Citizens were inconvenienced across the state. Several tourists had to cover the distance of around four kilometres to reach the Ajanta caves by sitting in bullock carts instead of buses on Thursday, said agency reports from Aurangabad. Scores of commuters were stranded at bus depots in Parel, Kurla East and Mumbai Central as buses were lying idle since morning, said an official. “A strike during the festive season is really frustrating. We had planned to go to our native town to celebrate Diwali,” said Kashinath Dhuri, who was at the Parel depot.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-msrtc-staffers-flash-strike-at-182-depots-hits-ops/articleshow/87346334.cms||Somit Sen

The move will increase beer production in the state, create employment opportunities and push the state excise revenue up. The breweries will be set up at Sambhal, Sonbhadra and Barabanki and are expected to bring in a combined investment of Rs 210.30 crore. Additional Chief Secretary (Excise) Sanjay R. Bhoosreddy said the existing arrangements and rules of excise department were significantly eased in the new excise policy brought under the guidance of chief minister Yogi Adityanath and following the ease of doing business policy, the government has issued licences to Bestbrew Alcobev Pvt Ltd at Babrala, Sambhal, M/s Wallop Brewing Company at Ahraura, Sonbhadra, and M/s Bairagi Pvt Ltd at Somaiya Nagar, Barabanki. “The increase in beer production will naturally lead to increased demand for barley, which is the raw product for production of beer. This will subsequently increase the income of farmers while also creating employment opportunities,” he said. Bhoosreddy said Bestbrew Alcobev Private Limited will invest Rs 150.30 crore in its project while M/s Wallop Brewing Company will set up its unit with investment of Rs 30 crore. The third brewery will be set up in the name of Bairagi Breweries at Somaiya Nagar, Deva Road, Barabanki with an investment of Rs 30 crore. Excise commissioner Senthil Pandian C said around 700 people will get employment with the establishment of the three breweries. “With the proposed consumption of about 1.88 lakh quintals of barley in the production of beer by these new breweries, the income of farmers will also increase. Industrial units manufacturing bottles and other packaging materials will also be benefited by the establishment of these breweries. We are expecting as much as Rs 1,750 crore to be generated as excise revenue,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/govt-issues-licence-for-three-new-breweries/articleshow/87348007.cms||---

The first academic year began early this month with offline classes for 72 students from different nationalities, many of them of Indian origin. Milestone International Education (MIE), licensed by the ministry of education and higher education in Qatar, has partnered with SPPU to set up the MIE SPPU Institute of Higher Education. A large number of Indians live and work in Qatar, and though there are at least 16 Indian schools there is no Indian university that caters to higher studies. The institute offers Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Commerce, Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Business Administration. Bimalendu Nath, director of MIE SPPU Institute of Higher Education, said the campus started officially online on September 15. “The first few days were for induction and orientation programmes. The actual lectures started online on October 3 and the offline classes started on October 17,” he added.  “We have designed our courses with a global outlook. Each course is for four years and the students are taught all fundamental subjects in the starting years. Our idea is that the student needs to understand the basics first and needs time to mature before he or she chooses his or her field of specialisation. Also, the new world does not believe in compartmentalising education, hence the syllabus is flexible enough to accommodate future changes,” he added. Of the 10 faculty posts, nine have been filled and they are from different parts of the country. The gender ratio in students also favours girls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/sppus-campus-in-doha-begins-classes-for-first-batch-of-72-pupils/articleshow/87344885.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Lucknow||‘Danga’ hit ‘dhanda’ during festivals in SP regime: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday escalated the attack on the Opposition, terming political parties like SP, BSP, Congress and Asaddudin Owaisi-led AIMIM as a potential “threat to the very notion of security”. “People should not expect protection, if any of these political parties formed the government in UP,” Yogi said, while speaking at ‘Samajik Pratinidhi Sammelan’ organised by BJP to woo swarnkaars (goldsmiths). He specifically targeted the previous SP government, saying when it was time for ‘dhandha’ (business) during festive season, the state would witness ‘danga’ (riots) and the then government would shamelessly shelter rioters. Yogi said, FIRs would be lodged against traders, not criminals. “Dangon ka ek lamba silsila chalta chala gaya UP mein..(state would sit on a communal cauldron),” he said, maintaining people haven’t forgotten the anarchy during the previous government. He reiterated the previous SP government “lived for its family and people of their own caste”. “They had nothing to do with society and faith of people,” he said, asserting the Ram Temple in Ayodhya would never have been built, had BJP not come to power. He accused previous governments of “looting resources”, while providing benefits of government schemes to a select few. “Today, benefits of schemes are being provided to every section of society,” he said. “The Opposition parties went into “self-isolation” when people needed them at the peak of pandemic. They are rising from their slumber as elections inch closer. They will now come up with new slogans and try to rip off the social fabric with ‘jaateey thekedaars’ (contractors of caste),” he said. Yogi said, Opposition parties like Congress, SP and BSP had the chance to rule UP. “The state remains the same, the state machinery remains the same, but changes brought about at the ground level show what a party, through political will can do,” he said. He underscored the responsibility of various communities to assess the prevailing political situation and realise why BJP has become a “necessity of the country and the state”. He attacked Congress, saying before 2014, there was dissatisfaction and mistrust amongst people. “Scams would surface and the image of the country was dented. The youth faced an identity crisis and there was an environment of insecurity. The then government was more concerned about its ties with China and Pakistan, than retaliating against their malicious attempts of intruding into our territory,” he said. The situation has changed significantly after BJP came to power at the Centre in 2014. “The country has not only been able to establish its identity globally, but was also able to put forth one of the most effective models to tackle a pandemic like Covid-19,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/danga-hit-dhanda-during-festivals-in-sp-regime-yogi/articleshow/87348030.cms||Pankaj Shah

Not only were her lungs affected badly, she had also contracted a life-threatening fungal infection. She had a HRCT score of 25/25 with mediastinal puncture. On May 4, she was admitted to a private hospital with severe Covid. Two months later, she was shifted to another hospital with severe virus-associated pneumonia though she had turned Covid negative. She had a high oxygen requirement which could only be maintained through a high-flow mask and BIPAP ventilator. Her CT chest showed fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) along with pneumo-mediastinum or air leak around the heart. Even 60 litre/min oxygen flow was not adequate. She was kept on low pressure BIPAP settings with optimal doses of antibiotics, steroids and supportive treatment. She was unable to remove the oxygen mask even for a bite of food and nutrition was maintained through the food pipe. “There were many occasions of impending ventilator requirements. As she had a significant air leak around her heart, putting her on a ventilator was a further risk. However, she improved gradually. The oral diet was resumed,” said Dr Sheetu Singh, director, Covid pulmonary rehab, at a private hospital. After gradually shifting her from BIPAP/HFNC to venturi mask and nasal prong, there was improvement but she still required 4L/min oxygen. The doctors then started pulmonary rehabilitation which helped her come out from a bedridden state to moving around independently. But when they conducted her bronchoscopy, the report showed some bacteria. Her problems became worse when she contracted a life-threatening fungal infection. “Just when we planned her discharge, the oxygen requirement shot up, the coughs increased, the chest CT showed a new cavity in the lung and fungal markers turned positive. She was given antifungal amphotericin for seven days. The complications associated with the medicine were managed,” said Dr Singh. For a long period, her oxygen requirement remained more than 10 L/min. At many points of time, the doctors discussed the option of a lung transplant. But then they started advanced chest rehabilitation. With that, she showed signs of recovery. She was now able to remove the oxygen mask for 10-15 minutes and the requirement had reduced to 1L/min. She could move around herself, including going to the washroom. After staying in a hospital for almost six months, she was discharged from the hospital, just before Diwali, much to her family’s delight.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/city-woman-back-home-for-diwaliafter-six-month-battle-with-covid/articleshow/87347264.cms||---

Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Gilon responded to questions saying. “NSO is a private Israeli company. Every export by NSO requires a government licence.” Adding that he had been dealing with the issue, he said, “We grant export licences only to governments. They cannot sell to non-governmental actors.” Questioned whether the embassy would join the Supreme Court-ordered investigation, he said, “What’s happening in India is India’s internal matter.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/pegasus-tech-sold-only-to-govts-israeli-envoy/articleshow/87346412.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||Lucknow||With ear to ground, Amit Shah comes calling to assess, tweak & rollout UP poll blueprint||LUCKNOW: With BJP’s overwhelming electoral success in Uttar Pradesh during 2014, 2019 Lok Sabha elections and 2017 assembly polls under his belt, Union home minister Amit Shah will be back to the political drawing board in Lucknow on Friday. With an ear to the ground, the master strategist will do a micro-assessment after receiving feedback, before rolling out the poll blueprint. Known for deft political strategies, Shah is learnt to have summoned a joint meeting of former MLAs and MPs along with the incumbent in charge of assembly seats and sitting party MLAs. The move, experts said, could potentially arm the crafty politician with ground-level feedback to take on BJP’s political rivals, particularly regional satraps like SP and BSP, in the run-up to the high-pitched assembly elections early next year. Top sources in BJP said, the meeting, likely to be convened at Indira Gandhi Pratishthan immediately after Shah’s address to functionaries of 5,047 ‘shakti kendras’ and 377 divisions of Awadh region comprising 13 districts and 83 assembly seats. Party sources said, in charge and convener of shakti kendras (conglomeration of six polling booths), presidents and conveners of 377 divisions have been asked to reach the meeting venue — Sector 17, Vrindavan Yojana, Lucknow. The home minister will also launch a membership drive, besides flagging off campaign vehicles to various districts. Shah will be joined by Union education minister and state election in charge, Dharmendra Pradhan, BJP vice-president and UP organisational in charge Radha Mohan Singh, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal, besides a host of other state leaders. A meeting of former MPs, MLAs, sitting MLAs and assembly in-charge is seen with much anticipation amid reports of party high command planning to bench a number of incumbent lawmakers to tide over a possible anti-incumbency. BJP sources said, the feedback from party’s organisational brass, including general secretary (organisation), BL Santhosh and party vice-president Radha Mohan Singh are expected to play a crucial role. Party sources said, Shah will subsequently hold a series of organisational meetings at state BJP headquarters to work out a “well planned” and an adept strategy to put the state poll machinery on an unassailable electoral course by devising an exhaustive election campaign. “His vast organisational experience and a precise feel of raw political pulse in UP will play a key factor,” said BJP spokesperson Hero Bajpai. Shah’s visit to UP, not surprisingly, will ramp up the political temperatures of UP amid a bellicose Opposition rolling up its sleeves to thwart the ruling saffron dispensation’s bid of returning to office in 2022. Experts said, support of BJP ally-turned-rival SBSP to Samajwadi Party and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra setting an engaging narrative through sops for women may also have spurred the BJP brass to shift gears.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/with-ear-to-ground-shah-comes-calling-to-assess-tweak-rollout-poll-blueprint/articleshow/87348057.cms||Pankaj Shah

A state government spokesperson said that the state government has dispensed the relief package after assessing crop losses. Following reports of crop loss due to floods and heavy showers in some parts of the state in September and October, the state government had ordered a survey to assess agricultural damage which is still on. Around five lakh farmers are estimated to have suffered crop damages by the inclement weather conditions. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has also instructed the officials to give appropriate and immediate compensation to the farmers. The spokesperson said that the process of damage assessment has been stepped up in the flood-affected districts. According to official sources, the state government has assessed a damage of Rs 180 crore. Out of which Rs 160 crore assistance has been released from the State Disaster Response Fund. The districts of Purvanchal were the most affected by floods. The CM, too, had visited the flood affected areas and took stock of the situation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/rs-16cr-released-for-5l-rain-hit-farmers-in-up/articleshow/87348061.cms||---
---||Lucknow||BJP, oppn adopt ‘look east’ policy to woo Purvanchal||Lucknow: Ahead of the assembly elections, all key players in the Uttar Pradesh politics, including the ruling BJP and the opposition parties, are adopting the ‘look east policy’ with focus on eastern UP districts. Parties are trying hard to crack the caste code, which is more complicated in east UP than any other part of the state. While a few smaller parties have joined hands with the BJP, OP Rajbhar-led Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) has forged an alliance with the Samajwadi Party. BJP’s focus on east UP districts is evident from the fact that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been frequently visiting Siddharthnagar, Kushinagar, Varanasi and Gorakhpur, while most of the recent visits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been to east UP districts. This month alone, the PM has visited Kushinagar, Siddharthnagar and Varanasi. Several BJP leaders, including national organisation secretary BL Santhosh, UP election in charge Dharmendra Pradhan and UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh have also made visits to east UP districts. A party insider told TOI that the party was apprehensive of losing more seats in east UP as compared to western region primarily because of the complex caste structure and the opposition parties making efforts to make a dent to the BJP’s vote share. Elaborating the reason behind the apprehension, a party insider cited the latest example of Rajbhar joining hands with the Samajwadi Party. SBSP had contested 2017 assembly elections in alliance with the BJP but after parting ways with the BJP, SBSP chief OP Rajbhar had been accusing the state government of ignoring the backward community. A party leader said that if Rajbhar’s alliance with Akhilesh continues, it might hurt the BJP as the party could not find any other Rajbhar leader, who could counter OP Rajbhar in east UP. So far as Samajwadi Party’s possible gains are concerned, political analysts believe that if Samajwadi Party is able to get the votes of Muslims, Yadavs and Rajbhars, it might make a dent to BJP’s 2017 vote share. The Samajwadi Party is also making efforts to enter into an alliance with a few other smaller parties to consolidate its position. Besides SP, parties like Aam Aadmi Party and Congress are also trying to woo east UP voters. Congress general secretary and UP in charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been focussing on Varanasi and Gorakhpur while AAP convenor and Delhi CM also visited Ayodhya. However, it remains to be seen as to which party benefits the most from the ‘look east policy’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/bjp-oppn-adopt-look-east-policy-to-woo-purvanchal/articleshow/87348065.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||Pune||Pune: Jewellery sales soar; many takers for ‘digital’ gold too||PUNE: Jewellers in the city have reported an improvement in their festive season sales by at least 30% over the same period last year, as reopened markets and fewer restrictions are finally bringing back customers to brick-and-mortar stores. The high gold rates are not much of a barrier to sales. High-street jewellers, such as the flagship stores operating on Laxmi Road, say that despite gold prices shooting up throughout the year, customers have adjusted their purchases and ticket sizes according to the rates. “Business is definitely higher this festive season, almost 50% to 60% higher than last year. People are purchasing according to their age group, with people in the 45 and above preferring traditional gold jewellery, while younger people are opting for lighter jewellery, such as diamonds or 18 karat gold jewellery, with average ticket sizes of around Rs 45,000 to Rs 50,000. Younger people are going for the 18 karat gold because it fits their budget, as it costs 25% less than 22 karat gold, while getting the experience of gold jewellery,” Amit Modak, CEO of PN Gadgil and Sons Ltd. Jewellers added that while sales of ornaments have risen significantly, the uptake of bullion- both gold and silver- has also slowed in recent years, with them attributing low sales in that category to increased transaction costs, especially with the advent of GST, with sales never recovering to the pre-GST period. Others added that despite the consistently high prices, gold rates are showing signs of stabilization. “We have definitely seen a growth of around 30% over the last year, with most sales in the ornaments category. The gold rates don’t seem to be as much of an issue now, as prices have been stabilizing in recent times, with fluctuations only being around Rs 1,500,” said Fatehchand Ranka, president of the Pune Saraf Association. Besides lighter jewellery, investments in digital gold is also increasingly popular among a younger populace, say industry players, with the advent of specialised mobile applications for that purpose. Some payment services are also offering digital gold purchases as a value-added service. “Digital gold is appealing to generations across, be it Gen Z, millennials or older generations, as it allows Indians to marry traditions with a digitally savvy lifestyle. The purchase can be made right from the comfort of their homes and without having to risk themselves by going to retail outlets. This is also a key advantage during a time when most families might still not be able to gather for celebrations due to the pandemic and travel restrictions," Ashraf Rizvi, the founder and CEO of Gilded, a digital gold startup, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/jewellery-sales-soar-many-takers-for-digital-gold-too/articleshow/87344944.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Pune||Kiran Gosavi lands in Pune police custody in 2018 cheating case||PUNE: The city police early on Thursday morning arrested Kiran Gosavi, who recently hit the headlines by surfacing as the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) independent witness in the cruise drug bust case involving Aryan Khan, in an alleged Rs3.09 lakh cheating case lodged in 2018. The cheating case was registered by the Faraskhana police in the city. Gosavi evaded the Pune police for more than three years. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI, “A Pune crime branch team took Gosavi into custody around 3am from a lodge at Mangdewadi near Katraj. He was using an alias, ‘Sachin Patil’, to continuously travel on long-distance trains from one place to another, including Lucknow and Fatehpur Sikri, besides his native place Jalgaon, Hyderabad, Navi Mumbai and Mumbai. He reached Pune on Wednesday evening.” Gupta said, “The 2018 case apart, we will register a fresh FIR relating to complainant Chinmay Deshmukh’s claim that Gosavi had then threatened and abused him for withdrawal of the case. The police could not register this case against Gosavi then. Gosavi is also suspected to have cheated other young job aspirants in Pune. We issued an appeal to them to come forward and lodge their complaints.” He said, “We will also investigate Gosavi’s financial transactions through an export-import business and an NGO,’Stop Crime’, which he claims to operate from Ghatkopar.” Judicial magistrate first class R K Bafna-Bhalgat on Thursday ordered Kiran Gosavi’s remand in police custody till November 5. On court’s permission, Faraskhana police inspector Shabbir Sayyed submitted that a non-bailable warrant had been issued against Gosavi on March 29, 2019 and a local court proclaimed the latter as an absconder on April 5, 2019. The police had subsequently filed a chargesheet against Gosavi, and his aide, Shaerbanu Mohammed Irfan Qureshi, on April 25, 2019. Assistant public prosecutor Varsha Alekar argued that the police had added charges relating to forgery under sections 465 and 468 of the Indian Penal Code against Gosavi and sought sufficient time for police to investigate the case. Gosavi’s lawyer, Sachin Kumbhar, pleaded for a magisterial custody, arguing that the FIRs against his client at various places had nothing to do with the instant crime. Gosavi had gone into hiding again after his selfie with Aryan Khan went viral on social media soon after the October 2 cruise drug bust. The police had since renewed their effort to trace and arrest him and also issued a lookout notice for him on October 13. A couple of days ago, the police sent a team to Lucknow in search of him after he had surfaced in a video clip on social media to present his “version” of why he had to go into hiding. On Wednesday, a senior NCB official had appealed to Gosavi through the media to surrender before the Pune police. Following this, there were reports about Gosavi having set out for Pune to surrender himself. But this did not happen. DCP (Crime) Shrinivas Ghadge, assistant commissioner Laxman Borate, inspector Vinayak Vetal and assistant inspector Sandeep Buwa were tracking of Gosavi’s movement. “He would switch off his phone once getting into a train and would activate only for limited use,” an officer said.  Gosavi is also facing three cheating cases — two at Kapurbawdi in Thane and one at Andheri in Mumbai. ACP (Crime) Ramnath Pokale said, “Gosavi is married. He used to stay in Thane but later shifted to Vashi in Navi Mumbai.” Complainant Chinmay Deshmukh, who now runs a catering business in the city, told TOI, “Gosavi had abused me on phone and threatened dire consequences in 2018. However, the police did not register a complaint at that time. I will lodge a fresh complaint after discussing it with legal experts and police authorities”. Deshmukh, a resident of Kasba Peth, registered the case on May 29, 2018, stating that he had approached Gosavi’s firm — KPG Dreamz Solutions — at Ghatkopar in Mumbai after coming across an online advertisement claiming that the company provides jobs to young persons in the hotel industry in Malaysia. The company officials told him to send his biodata, collected Rs3.09 lakh towards air ticket fares, his passport and allied details as part of the deal. However, Deshmukh found himself in the lurch at the Mumbai airport on the day he was to fly to Malaysia. The company officials did not respond to his call. After futile searches in Thane and Mumbai, the Faraskhana police in August 2018 filed a chargesheet against Gosavi in the court under Section 299 of the CrPC which refers to the record of proof in the accused’s absence. On October 18, the police arrested Gosavi’s aide, Shaerbano Mohammed Irfan Qureshi (27) of Govandi in Mumbai. The Pune police on Thursday invoked sections 465 and 468 of IPC against Gosavi in the FIR registered with the Faraskhana police after finding that he got the SIM card with forged documents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/gosavi-lands-in-pune-police-custody-in-18-cheating-case/articleshow/87344955.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Delhi||'UP mein chalta hoga': Delhi HC slams UP police||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Thursday slammed Uttar Pradesh police for arresting and taking away the brother and the father of a man who married a woman against her family's wishes. "UP mein chalta hoga, yehan nahin," said Justice Mukta Gupta, saying the UP cops "violated the law at every step" referring to the arrests made without even informing local police. "I will direct a departmental inquiry if I see UP police arresting from Delhi. I want all the CCTV footage and the vehicle number. If I see UP police entering (in the footage), I will take action. We will not permit this. You can't do illegal acts here," Justice Gupta told the Shamli SHO. The SHO was present at the hearing. The UP police team was investigating an alleged kidnapping complaint by the woman’s mother. “When you got to know their address (of the man), you would inquire (about her whereabouts) and inform the local police. You can’t take away anyone as per your will. You violated the law at every step. This won’t be tolerated in Delhi,” the HC said. The SHO claimed that they were not aware if she was a major or a minor and that the arrests were made at the Kudhara bus stand in UP’s Shamli district. “They can file a case against you (UP police) for illegal custody. The FIR says she was 21 years of age, but you arrest the brother and the father without ascertaining her stand,” the judge said. “If you close your eyes and brains while working, nothing can be done. There’s no solution if you and your IO (investigating officer) can’t read...We will take action against you.” The court sought an affidavit from the SHO on how the two, now in judicial custody in UP, were arrested and directed that appropriate steps be taken so that they can seek bail. It also directed that the woman’s statement be recorded before a magistrate in Delhi immediately. The couple moved high court earlier this month, saying they married of their own volition in July, but the man’s father and the brother were taken away by UP police and that their whereabouts were not known for more than one month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/up-mein-chalta-hoga-delhi-hc-slams-up-police/articleshow/87349292.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune airport resumes operations tomorrow, extra staff and machinery to manage rush||PUNE: Additional X-ray machines, more staffers at security counters and widening the pathway on the airport premises near the departure gate are among the measures that have been put in place to manage crowds after the facility’s reopening from October 30, Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke said on Thursday. “The Lohegaon airport has been closed for all flight movements since October 14 and will open for traffic from 8am on October 30 as per the Indian Air Force’s communication. During this closure time, we have aimed to improve facilities in and outside the terminal building to improve the passengers’ experience,” Dhoke told TOI. Before the airport’s closure, there had been instances of long queues at security counters with many flyers being inconvenienced. “We have added one more X-ray scanner at the security counter, taking the total number to six. Hopefully, this will reduce the flyers’ waiting time. The number of CISF personnel in the airport has already been increased. Also, security hold areas (SHAs) of the airport have been enhanced so that flyers can wait in comfort for their flights,” the director said. Before the closure, the airport had been seeing 13,000-14,000 passengers and nearly 120 flight movements every day. With around 40% of the flyers choosing to reschedule their flights due to the closure and the airport to remain operational for 12 hours, there is likely to be a rush of passengers. “Diwali travel will also increase the crowd,” said another official. According to Dhoke, the pathway on the airport premises in front of the departure gate has been widened. “There was a tunnel like structure on one half of the pathway. That has been removed, resulting in the road becoming wider for safer and easier movement. Also, work on the multi-level parking and new terminal building is at advanced stages; we hope things will be better soon,” he added. With the DGCA’s winter schedule starting from October 31, the director said more flights were expected. “All airlines have been given slots and now it is up to them to start the flights. We hope the flight operations are back to where they were before the closure,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/airport-resumes-ops-tomorrow-extra-staff-and-machinery-to-manage-rush/articleshow/87344994.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Passengers left in the lurch over ST staffers’ sudden stir||PUNE: The state transport (ST) employees, mostly drivers and conductors, went on a sudden strike on Thursday, affecting more than 500 trips and thousands of passengers. Passengers whose trips were cancelled faced the double trouble of securing a refund and then looking for another mode of transport to their destination. Officials of the Pune division of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) said more than 526 trips had to be cancelled on Thursday afternoon. “The employees’ union has been agitating for many demands, mostly over payments. On Wednesday too there were some protests, but bus operations were not affected. On Thursday, however, they went on a sudden strike. Some buses plied in the, but towards afternoon, all our buses were off the roads,” Dyaneshwar Ranavare, traffic manager of MSRTC’s Pune division, told TOI. Several routes, including the one between Pune and Mumbai, were affected. “The Pune-Mumbai route saw just four to five trips on Thursday. Very few buses have plied across all routes from Pune and, many passengers faced hassles. At the moment, we are not in a position to say if buses will run on Friday. Talks are going on at the headquarters,” Ranavare. The Pune-Mumbai route accounts for 250 round trips per day. The MSRTC operates a total of 2,500 trips from the district daily. Thursday’s stir hit especially hard, coming as it did during the festive season — the state transport body has been running close to 1,000 buses from Pune to different districts and even cities outside the state. “From Baramati, MSRTC makes a total of 107 trips per day; around 50 trips had to be cancelled. Only four trips were made from the Shivajinagar depot,” another official said. Tirth Kadam, who had booked tickets for Dadar in Mumbai, reached the Swargate bus stop at around 1pm to find no buses. “I inquired and learnt that there has been a sudden strike. MSRTC officials assured me that a refund will be issued to me soon. I had to book a cab as my trip was urgent and it cost me Rs 3000,” Kadam, a resident of Mundhwa, said. “At present, bus services have completely stopped. Those passengers who got their tickets from counters can approach the counters anywhere, get the ticket cancelled and get an immediate refund. Those who booked tickets online have to apply for a refund online; the money will be transferred to their accounts,” an MSRTC official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/passengers-left-in-the-lurch-over-st-staffers-sudden-stir/articleshow/87344975.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Mumbai||Why no action on 2 ministers in phone tap ‘leak’: Shukla counsel||Mumbai: Counsel for the state’s ex-intel chief Rashmi Shukla on Thursday told Bombay high court that minister Jitendra Ahwad had at a press conference released details of a phone tap report on alleged corruption in police postings and transfers, and minister Nawab Malik too. “Why are they [state] not prosecuting their own two ministers then?’’ he asked during his final submission on her quashing petition against a cyber crime cell FIR against unknown persons over an alleged ‘leak’ of the report. “This is wholly partial, biased and prejudiced investigation. It is a selective probe meant to target honest officer,” counsel Mahesh Jethmalani said in his rejoinder, seeking quashing of FIR. Jethmalani said the evidence on which the report is based was put out by the two ministers and the leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. He said their press conference is a matter of record and the next day the Supreme Court, while hearing a petition filed by ex-Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh, remarked that they had seen on social media. The HC bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal sought written submissions on Friday from Jethmalani and state’s special counsel Darius Khambata and would then close the matter for orders. While stating that its FIR into a “leak” of a report by Shukla doesn’t name her an accused, Khambata had informed HC that it has moved Esplanade court for orders to the Union home ministry to hand over a pen drive it believes was the “third such pen drive” that contains Shukla’s phone-tap report. Jethmalani said the probe into the alleged ‘leak’ case is “óne-sided”. Shukla was unceremoniously transferred in September to the CRPF, said Jethmalani and the FIR was registered a day after the March 25, 2021 report by former Maharashtra additional chief secretary (home) Sitaram Kunte who, he said, had termed the report “innocuous’’ “But the state’s reaction is out of proportion to its innocuous ness.” Jethmalani said, “through out her interrogation not once was Shukla asked to explain if she had three not two pen drives and what she had to say about that.’’ “As far as Fadnavis is concerned, in his press conference he cited only the two covering letters and that he had the pen drive and report which he said he has not read but was going to hand over to the home secretary and he did hand it over on March 23,” said Jethmalani adding, “Fadnavis neither disclosed contents of the report nor the contents of any intercepts.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/why-no-action-on-2-ministers-in-phone-tap-leak-shukla-counsel/articleshow/87346470.cms||---

Around eight doctors and five nurses from police hospitals across the state have been requisitioned by city cops to reinforce the medical team at the hospital in police headquarters. District administration and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) would also set up camps at different places, like Vidhan Bhavan, Nag Bhavan and Ravi Bhavan to conduct RT-PCR tests. District collector R Vimala said most government employees are fully vaccinated, and the personnel coming to city for the assembly have also been told to get tested. “Our teams will be positioned in camps at different places where testing facilities would be available. We will conduct as many tests as required,” said the collector. Guidelines are soon expected from the state government, she added. District health officer Dr Deepak Shelokar said the two government hospitals and AIIMS would be available for isolation facilities. “We are working on our medicine stockpiling and other medical resources. If someone gets infected, treatment facilities will be available,” he said. City police too, under supervision of police chief (CP) Amitesh Kumar, joint CP Aswati Dorje and DCP Sandeep Pakhale, are trying to to ensure that their 16-bed hospital at the headquarters in Takli is ready to handle any emergency.

In fact, the fraudsters had managed to get Rs25 lakh transferred, but the amount was instantly retrieved by the college through the bank. The college authorities said the fraudsters had tried to play the same trick with three more cheques. This comes close on the heels of the Sinhagad Road police starting a probe into a complaint by a leading private bank accusing a company and its two representatives of presenting a bogus cheque of a nationalized bank branch in Lucknow for transfer of Rs92.99 to its account here. The administrative officer of the B J Medical College, Suresh Bonwale, told TOI,“On updating the bank passbook, we came to know that some unidentified men had deposited a cheque of Rs 25 lakh and got the money transferred to another account. We filed a complaint with the bank and instantly got the money transferred to our account in three instalments.” Bonwale said,“They also deposited three more cheques and attempted to transfer Rs25 lakh each from our account to another account. But the bank stopped the cheques from getting cleared because of our earlier complaint. After we filed a complaint application relating to the incident, the police registered an FIR relating to cheating and forgery.” Sub-inspector Tukaram Phad, who is investigating the case, said,“The fraudsters attempted to cheat the medical college, which is a government-run organisation. We will arrest them at the earliest.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/fraudsters-try-to-dupe-med-college-with-fake-cheques/articleshow/87344996.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar: Man who killed his uncle lynched by mob in Siwan||PATNA: A 35-year-old man was beaten to death by a mob while trying to flee after shooting at his 70-year-old uncle, Satyadev Gor, at Kushhara Mirpur village under the Andar police station area in Siwan district on Thursday. Satyadev succumbed to his injuries on way to the sadar hospital at Siwan. The trouble started around 10.30am when one Umashankar Gor alias Om Prakash shot at Satyadev over a financial dispute. As the news about Satyadev’s death spread, Umashankar tried to flee from his house, but was caught by the relatives of the deceased and some other residents. He was brutally assaulted with sticks and iron rods, leading to his instant death. Siwan SP Abhinav Kumar rushed to the spot and inquired about the double murder. “The incident is a fallout of a dispute over money,” he said. Siwan sadar sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Jitendra Pandey said Umashankar had criminal antecedents. “He was released on bail in a criminal case recently. He was known as a ‘dabang’ in the area,” he added. Another person, Kirani Gor alias Upendra (30), suffered serious injuries in the incident. He was admitted to a local government hospital. The police recorded the statement of Kirani at the hospital. “Counter FIRs have been lodged in connection with the incident,” the SP said. A local told the police that the uncle and nephew had a dispute over sharing money realised from a youth as penalty after the latter was caught with a girl at the village recently. Satyadev was not in a mood to share the money, which enraged Umashankar. The SDPO said Umashankar pumped five bullets into his uncle’s body to ensure that he was dead. The twin murder has sparked tension at the village. Armed forces were deployed at the village as a precautionary measure.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/man-who-killed-his-uncle-lynched-by-mob-in-siwan/articleshow/87345411.cms||Ramashankar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Public transport in MMR will need Rs 5 lakh crore upgrade over 20 years’||MUMBAI: The Comprehensive Transport Study (CTS) -2 for the period up to 2041 has envisaged investments worth Rs 5.01 lakh crore over a period of 20 years to upgrade infrastructure and transportation network in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). MMR is spread across 6,355 sq km of area. It includes Mumbai and partial districts of Thane, Palghar and Raigadh having a population of 2.5 crore. The final report on “CTS-2 for Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR)” which was released by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday will guide all Municipal Corporations, Councils, CIDCO, MRVC, JNPT and MBPT, among others, for the next 20 years on infrastructure development, institutional growth and resource mobilisation. Metropolitan commissioner SVR Srinivas said, “MMR will require Rs 5.01 lakh crore over a period of 20 years for various infrastructure projects like Metros, dedicated bus lanes and cycling lanes, etc. The purpose of this study is to give push to public tranport.” It is estimated that the money will be raised by levying development charges to residential, commercial and industrial units, besides monetising the land. The money needed for operations and maintenance of assets can be raised by taxes, cess advertising, etc. The updation of CTS for the MMR outlines the transportation strategies and guidance necessary to attain the vision under long-term (2041), medium-term (2031) and short-term (2026) scenarios. “The future transportation envisages a seamless, integrated system that would facilitate commuters to travel across the region without major inconvenience using various modes of transport. The use of public transit has been emphasised to enhance mobility, accessibility and reduction of the carbon footprint,” said Srinivas. The plan aims to improve share of those using public transport to 75.4 percent from 65.3 percent recorded in 2017. While releasing the report, Thackeray said, “Today, the percentage of people taking public transport has reduced. One reason could be Covid-19 related lockdown. But it will increase only when we give a clean and neat public transport system to the people. However, we should not kill environment while going for development.” Urban development minister Eknath Shinde said, “Every year, MMR experiences changes in our region’s dynamics with increase in the population. The CTS-2 highlights how transport system for the next 20 years will evolve.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-public-transport-in-mmr-will-need-rs-5l-cr-upgrade-over-20-yrs/articleshow/87346505.cms||Manthank Mehta

Molested and harassed by the man for entering into a relationship, the minor girl even attempted suicide on Monday. The accused man, a resident of Raiya Road in the city, was booked on Wednesday by the cops. It was only after the girl was discharged from the hospital and counselled that she narrated her ordeal. The girl said that Shehzaad Jogisha had been harassing her for some time now. On Monday night, the accused had come to the girl’s home to pressurize her into a relationship. Jogisha’s presence had woken up the girl’s grandmother due to which he left. The girl had then consumed poison but was taken to hospital in time and saved. Fearing that her parents would scold her, the girl initially cooked up a story that a drug peddler, who was forcing her to sell drugs, had come to meet her at home. She had also said that a female cop had introduced her to the drug peddler. Based on the girl’s statement, police had conducted an investigation, but they could not find anything concrete. Suspecting that the girl was lying, she was counselled after her discharge from the hospital and the truth was unravelled. “We have taken the girl’s complaint and booked the man for molestation and under sections of POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act,” said inspector A S Chavda of University police station. He added that the girl had come into contact with Jogisha through a social media application.

President of ICAI Nihar Jambusariya, who was in the city on Thursday, said that more papers in the CA final exam will be added in the open book system. “Currently only an elective paper is covered under open book system, but our committee is reviewing to bring in more papers so that students can have application-based knowledge,” Jambusariya said. He added that situational case studies can be given and students can be asked if they can find a solution to it by referring to the book. “The committee is still reviewing it so even if it is finalized by February 2022, we will be able to implement in the following six months to one year period,” said Jambusariya. Speaking to media persons, Jambusariya said that after the pandemic, placements of CA have increased. “Earlier only 35-40% CAs used to get placed but that ratio has now increased to 70%. The economy was struggling due to the pandemic but the need of CAs was realized in these times as CAs not only audit but can also bring in the revival of struggling businesses and also do financial restructuring,” he said. To improve the quality of audit, ICAI will also provide auditing tools to all firms without any charges. “Many big firms have developed auditing tools, but if all can use these tools there will be an improvement in auditing so we plan to provide these tools for two to three years and then members can buy them,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/icai-to-change-exam-pattern-more-papers-under-open-book/articleshow/87345637.cms||---

While biological research has legitimate scientific purposes, a dual-use application can be misused,” he said. “Deliberate weaponisation of dangerous pathogens is a serious concern. This has heightened the need to build comprehensive national capabilities in bio-defence, bio-safety, and bio-security,” he said. Doval was delivering an online speech on ‘National security preparedness in the age of disasters and pandemics’ at the Pune Dialogue on National Security-2021 organised by the Pune International Centre here. He said, “Wars are increasingly becoming cost ineffective instruments of achieving nation’s political and military objectives and are being substituted by other means. The new areas of warfare have shifted from merely territorial frontiers to civil societies.” “Covid-19 pandemic has brought science, data, and economic security to the centre of national security,” he said, adding, “Pune has played a seminal role during the pandemic as the National Institute of Virology, Serum Institute of India, IISER and Research and C-DAC have all contributed to meet the challenges generated by the pandemic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/weaponising-dangerous-pathogens-a-concern/articleshow/87345032.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Patna||Bihar Special Armed Police to guard Mahabodhi temple, Darbhanga airport||PATNA: The Bihar Special Armed Police (BSAP) was on Thursday given the responsibility to handle security at the world-heritage Mahabodhi temple at Bodh Gaya and Darbhanga airport under the provisions of the Bihar Special Armed Police Act 2021. The Bihar Military Police (BMP) has been renamed as BSAP under the new Act. Though the Act came into force in March this year, notifications for deployment of BSAP personnel at the two places were issued by the home department on Thursday. Under the Act, BSAP officers — havildars and officers above this rank — have been given special power to search, seize and arrest suspects without search warrants or orders from judicial magistrates. BSAP officers, however, will be able to use the power vested with them for security of government-notified installations only. The Bihar Special Armed Police Bill-2021 had created a furore in the state assembly during the monsoon session in the last week of March this year. Additional police forces were called to the office of the Speaker, for the first time, to bring the situation under control. Several legislators had accused the police of misbehaviour and assault, leading to injuries to a few of them. The opposition had also organised a day-long bandh on the issue. According to the Act, BSAP personnel will be deployed for security at airports, industrial establishments, temples, places of historical and cultural importance. According to the notifications issued on Thursday, the Mahabodhi temple at Bodh Gaya and Darbhanga airport have been notified as specified installations, which required extra security cover. Additional director general (headquarters) J S Gangwar said, “The new Act has emboldened the security set up of the government-notified installations in the state. BSAP will be able to do their special job more professionally and thoroughly with special powers given to them.” A senior police officer said suspects detained for interrogation will be handed over to the police station concerned for further legal action after evidence of their involvement in suspicious activities was found within the premises of government-notified installations. “The Act gives an independent identity to the BSAP,” he said, adding that Thursday's order will not affect the routine policing carried out by the personnel deployed at police stations on law and order duty. Earlier, the special power to search, seize or arrest any suspect without search warrants or orders obtained from the court was not given to havildars and other junior-rank officers. Only the officers in the rank of DSP and above were entitled to do so. Moreover, the new Act has made it clear that the BSAP officers will act much like the officers of the CISF at airports. This will help the BSAP officers ensure better security cover to the government-notified installations, which were not the case earlier.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bsap-to-guard-mahabodhi-temple-darbhanga-airport/articleshow/87345488.cms||Ramashankar

The shopowner said that the man was not happy with the brooms being shown to him. “I did not realise, when the other man quietly went behind the counter. After a few minutes, the man told me that he did not like the brooms, and they left the shop,” Chaudhari said.

---||Rajkot||18 Maharashtra boats caught for line fishing in Gujarat waters||RAJKOT: Following a video of illegal fishing sent by Gujarat fishermen, coast guard and Somnath marine police conducted a joint patrolling on Wednesday evening and caught 18 boats with Maharashtra registration fishing illegally near Gujarat coast. Under an ordinance to the Gujarat Fisheries Act, cops seized these fishing boats and reported the matter to the fisheries department. According to the police, these boats were found conducting line fishing nine nautical miles away from Sutrapada coast on Wednesday. Line fishing is a method which is considered harmful and Gujarat’s fishermen are opposing the use of this method. A local fisherman made a video and sent it to the authorities. According to fishermen, for the past few days nearly 200 Maharashtra boats were found conducting the illegal line fishing. All kinds of fish, including the juvenile are captured from a certain area in this kind of fishing, which results in drying up of catch for next few years from nearby areas. The ordinance, passed in the assembly with the intention of securing the rights of Gujarat’s fishermen, also empowers police officials of sub-inspector rank of marine police station to search and seize boats found fishing near the Gujarat coast. It has also has given adjudicating powers to sub divisional magistrate (SDM) to impose a fine of Rs 1 lakh to the boat owners and auction the catch. The SDM also has the power to collect a five-time penalty of the amount of auction. President of Veraval Boat Association, Tulsi Gohil, told TOI: “Maharashtra has since a long time implemented this law, but it has come into force in Gujarat since last year. Many Gujarat fishermen were made to pay heavy penalties comprising lakhs of rupees in Maharashtra while their boats also remained seized for two to three months. This is one of the exceptional seizures here, but we want all the marine police stations to remain alert and take action against the boats of other states found fishing in our territory.” Gohil further alleged that there are several Mafia gangs that are also actively providing protection to these illegal boats in exchange of money. “In this case too, such a gang helped the Maharashtra boats to escape, but the police and coast guard managed to captured them in the sea again,” he added. The seized boats have been anchored at Veraval coast. Somnath marine in-charge police inspector, N G Vaghela said, “We found 18 boats fishing illegally on Gujarat coast and have seized them. We have submitted a report to the fisheries department and the SDM who will start further process.” Meanwhile, the fishermen of those seized boats are at Veraval coast awaiting adjudication.

Earlier, the parking charges for cars and two-wheelers were fixed at Rs 10 and Rs 5 per hour, respectively. The agency has now requested the smart city body to increase the parking charges to Rs 30 per hour for cars and Rs 15 per hour for two-wheelers. The demand was made by the agency officials during a meeting with the smart city officials here held on Thursday. The agency had started parking spaces on 22 locations from March 4, 2020 and had received good response from the residents, but the smart city company had to stop the parking spaces in the second half of March due to lockdown imposed by the government due to the outbreak of Covid-19. Now, the NMSCDCL has asked the agency to start the pay-and-park service, but the latter is unwilling to resume operations. The smart city company has already given a 15-month extension in the contract period to the agency due to the pandemic, but the agency has demanded a three-year extension. NMSCDCL CEO Sumant More said they had a meeting with the agency concerned on starting the pay-and-park facilities in the city, but the agency wants relaxation in conditions to make the project viable financially. “We have asked the agency to give a detailed proposal on the issue within a week. We will hold another meeting after Diwali and take a call on the parking project,” he said. The pay-and-park facilities are to be started at 22 locations in the city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/hike-parking-fees-contractor-tells-smart-city-body-in-nashik/articleshow/87342762.cms||Tushar Pawar

Still, the authorities are unable to find a solution to the issue. Fortunately, all the accidents are mild ones and there had not been any casualties due to the cable menace. On Wednesday, TOI had carried an article on the cable menace. On Thursday, a fire broke out due to a short circuit on an electric line near Mullassery Canal on Chittoor Road. “The incident occurred around 1am. A line supplying power to the street light on an electric pole came into contact with the overhead dangling cables triggering the fire,” said Sahasranaman, a high court lawyer who resides in the area. “Fortunately, a security personnel guarding a shop in the area noticed and raised the alarm. They also tried to extinguish the fire by pouring water. Fire and rescue personnel, who rushed to the spot, put out the fire, preventing a major accident,” Sahasranaman said.  “The notable factor is that most of the cables are redundant ones. There were a bunch of cables when the fire occurred. As the cables were restored on Thursday morning, there were only four or five live cables remaining,” he said. According to the fire and rescue services, the cases of overhead cables breaking are on the rise in the city. “In August, there were four major cases while the number went up to six in September. In the past one week, there were six cases of overhead cables breaking,” an official with Club Road fire station said. Mayor M Anilkumar said the owners of cables are not taking a positive stand with regard to the removal of redundant cables. “We had held a meeting with them and asked them to help us identify redundant cables. We will convene one more meeting to discuss the issue,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/dangling-cables-spark-fire-on-electric-line/articleshow/87345116.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

I am seeking protection. The attempt is now to demoralise the police force of the state,” senior advocate Darius Khambata, for the state, told a bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal. The state has challenged summons to chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and DGP Sanjay Pandey in its probe against former home minister Anil Deshmukh for alleged corruption in police transfers and postings. Khambata sought time to respond to factual allegations in CBI’s reply and urged that no coercive action be taken against the officers in the meanwhile. “These are all police officers,” he added. Khambata said that CBI is probing the matter since April-May and the case was being argued in court but all of a sudden it started issuing summons. “The DGP of the state was not concerned at the relevant time. Notices, summons were sent to him. Now the chief secretary also,” he added. Pointing out that dates of earlier summons would have lapsed, the judges said that if CBI is to issue fresh summons, it should be beyond the next date of hearing. “We are not stopping you from issuing summons,’’ added Justice Jamdar. Additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, for CBI, reiterated the petition is “misconceived” and that “there is no cause in favour of the petitioner [state] to move court and make any grievance”. “The persons on whose behalf it is pleaded are not coming to the court,’’ he added. The judges said they are not commenting on the merits of the matter. “If you issue summons, see that it is beyond the date of hearing,” said Justice Jamdar. Lekhi assured that the CBI will issue fresh summons keeping in mind what the court has said. The next hearing has been posted on November 17.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-summons-to-state-officials-on-despite-court-plea/articleshow/87346584.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The move by the party’s senior functionary, who had grabbed a sizable vote share when he had contested against then Congress candidate Vishwajit Rane in 2012 and 2017, will come as a jolt to BJP in the run up to the 2022 assembly election, sources said. Political commentators said that Naik had felt sidelined after former Congress leader Vishwajit Rane shifted to BJP and was elected in the by-poll with a thumping margin. Naik had been reaching out to his voters and supporters over the past several months and could be the probable AAP candidate from the constituency, sources said. Known for his simplicity, Naik has a good rapport with core BJP supporters from Usgao and other panchayat areas. On his reasons for joining AAP, he said that he has seen the work AAP has done in Delhi and that he “believes AAP will bring change in the region”. Speaking to reporters, Naik hit out at the father-son duo of Poriem Congress MLA Pratapsingh Rane and Valpoi BJP MLA Vishwajit Rane. “They are running Valpoi and Sattari like it is their own personal property,” he said. “We have to end their dictatorship.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ex-secy-of-bjp-state-panel-joins-aap-in-valpoi/articleshow/87346578.cms||---

The PMC administration has come up with a rating system where assessment forms will be given to citizens visiting the civic body’s offices. The ratings given by the citizens will be used during the appraisal of officials and staff. Promotion and other perks offered to staff will also be decided on the basis of this feedback. The behaviour and efficiency of staff members will be checked using these assessment forms. According to PMC officials, the civic administration has nearly 20,000 staffers. “The feedback will be recorded in an annual confidential report which each employee has to submit. The data will be complied and recorded by the respective heads of departments,” said Ravindra Binwade, PMC additional commissioner. Binwade said the civic body will cross-verify complaints raised against officials. Any mala fide or dubious complaint will not be considered for rating. The employee in question will get a fair chance to offer his side of the story regarding adverse feedback. The PMC officials are not sure whether this rating system is a first-of-its-kind initiative in the state. Many PMC departments have direct public interaction, including property tax department, health department, water department and building permission department. Citizens also approach other departments like anti-encroachment and gardens for various works, the officials said. The public interactions happen at the PMC headquarters as well as the 15 ward offices. Feedback will be taken from all these offices. Though civic activists have welcomed the initiative, they feel the existing system should be strengthened. “The PMC has an online system to share public concerns. This system should be improved and made easier for common people to share feedback,” said civic activist Sanjay Shitole. He said on-paper feedback will be helpful but the method of data collection and processing is complex. PMC officials said both online and offline options for submitting feedback will be explored.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-to-take-citizens-feedback-use-it-for-staffers-appraisals/articleshow/87345131.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

As per the proposal, the annual fee will be brought down to Rs 1.45 lakh from Rs 4 lakh. Medical students signing a bond of agreeing to work in Uttarakhand for a period of five years after completion of their course, will have to pay Rs 50,000 fee per year. “With this, Uttarakhand has become the state charging the lowest fee from medical students in government colleges. We have taken a major step and it will go a long way in improving health services,” agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said. In what could be termed as a largesse, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami announced bonus for government employees, with 1.60 lakh benefitting from the decision that will cost Rs 130 crore to the state exchequer. In addition, the cabinet has also approved better health coverage facilities for government employees. Under the Atal Ayushman Yojana, employees will be given health coverage on a par with the Central Government Hospital Scheme. “If a government employee is being treated at AIIMS, the employee would be given financial assistance as per the charges of AIIMS. Similarly, health cover has been improved in both empanelled and non-empanelled hospitals,” he added. For pregnant women and lactating mothers, the cabinet has approved the CM Mahila Poshan Yojana. Under the scheme, they will be given milk, fruits, eggs or dry fruits for two days a week. “This is to ensure that they get nutritious food. The project, costing Rs 16.78 crore, will be run with the help of aaganwadi members,” Uniyal added. The government had earlier announced 3 lakh tablets for students. Making some amendments, the cabinet has decided that a laptop will be of 2GB RAM instead of 3GB announced earlier. Similarly, the condition of Rs 400 crore turnover has been reduced to Rs 100 crore for bidders. The cabinet has also decided that the firm, which is awarded the project, will have to supply all tablets in a span of 75 days. Nod for a two-day assembly session at Gairsain on November 29 and 30 was also given. The cabinet approved addition of 157 posts for Sohan Singh Jina Government Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Almora, taking the total number of posts to 387. It raised the exemption limit for all types of late fee for drinking water and sewer facility from December 31, 2021, to December 31, 2022. A conciliation committee of independent experts for settlement of matters related to investors, industrialists, contractors, lessees in context to the projects of Uttarakhand government was given the go-ahead. Approval was given to increase the incentive amount to 12,018 ASHA facilitators working in the state. In place of the permissible incentive amount of Rs 50 per visit for a maximum of 20 trips, which was a total of Rs 1,000 per facilitator, the government has increased the maximum amount to Rs 2,000 per facilitator. The project will cost around 1.45 crore to the state government. The cabinet has set November 15 as the deadline for river training in disaster-affected areas every year; and for river dredging, the authorities will have to complete all works like silt removal till June 30 each year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ukhand-cabinet-slashes-mbbs-fee-announces-bonus-for-staff/articleshow/87345111.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Dehradun||Despite DMC insisting on pet licences, very few dog owners comply||Dehradun: Officials of the Dehradun Municipal Commission (DMC) claim that the capital city has thousands of pet dogs but the registration of most canines is not being done. While the civic body issued a total of 3,996 licences last year, the number is around 800 this year. While issuing the licence, the DMC also gives an identifier collar tag for the animal. This tag, say officials, helps in monitoring the population of dogs in the city and checking any unlicensed breeders. “The licences are valid for a year. This year, we have issued over 800 licences. It is a very simple online process. The owner only needs to provide rabies vaccination proof and there is a nominal fee of Rs 200. Registration makes it is easy for us to monitor the canine population,” said senior veterinary officer, DC Tiwari. The officer added, “The tags are also helpful in cases of lost dogs. We can track the owners without the dog going through major trauma if a collar tag is issued for the pet. Also, accurate pet population figures will help us regulate medicines and other facilities for animals.” Several dog owners, however, are not very familiar with the process and often do not comply with the policy. “Currently, we have a six-year-old German Shepherd and a two-year-old Beagle. However, we didn’t know about the dog registration norm. Now, we will get the licencing done,” said Meghna Gupta, a resident of Dalanwala. Meanwhile, several other dog owners told TOI that they didn’t get the licence as they find the process “tedious and unnecessary”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/despite-dmc-insisting-on-pet-licences-very-few-dog-owners-comply/articleshow/87345184.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Diwali not only is about light, but also the delights the festival brings through unity and amity, despite many a diversity. Sumara’s diyas hold a light to this fact, in all its true sense. Once a limited family enterprise, this Muslim family settled in Jherda village of Deesa taluka of Banaskantha with help of bank loans has set up a small scale unit at his village employing 15 workers. The turnover of these clay lamps is huge while exports too are rising. Production is non-stop and a round the year business. “I have 15 workers and the production has been mechanized and goes on around the year,” said Sumara, adding that earthen lamps sell at 10 paise each. The turnover today has crossed Rs 1 crore as it not only enjoys a local and domestic market, but demand spans worldwide. Sumara exports his diyas to America, Australia, Britain, Canada, France and other countries where Hindus have spread wings and light up the Diwali spirit with traditional earthen lamps in foreign soil. Many in Banaskantha who know Sumara see him as a sign of Hindu-Muslim unity solely for his occupation of crafting clay lamps that Hindus need most for every festival, especially Diwali. What attracts customers to Sumara’s clay lamps in particular are that these are painted in pleasing colours by local businessmen, which also lend its beauty aesthetically in the decor while serving as a source of light.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/muslim-diya-maker-lights-up-hindu-homes-for-generations/articleshow/87345212.cms||---

MMC chief officer Agnelo Fernades informed the councillors at its ordinary meeting held on Thursday that not a single contractor submitted his bid for the project within the stipulated date. The new council had issued a fresh tender notice on September 24 for the project after the last such exercise in December 2018 by the earlier council failed to yield any response. MMC sources said that as prices of cement and steel had escalated, the contractors didn’t find the MMC’s offer a lucrative one to bid for. The Rs 3 crore ‘golden jubilee package’ granted by the government to MMC in 2011 for creating signature infrastructure projects in the town, will be utilised for the project. While the project was originally estimated to cost Rs 5.5 crore, as per the revised estimates the project cost has now been tagged at Rs 6.5 crore. Fernandes said the Rs 3 crore parked in the bank over the last 10 years has accrued an interest of Rs 2.5 crore. The failure of the MMC in setting up the multi-level parking facility, even after six years of laying the foundation stone, has caused much embarrassment to the civic body. The project had been trapped in a web of bureaucratic tangles and tendering issues over the last few years. The tenders and re-tenders floated by the MMC had evoked little or no response from contractors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/no-bidders-for-margao-parking-project-yet-again/articleshow/87346620.cms||---

Sensing something wrong, the family rushed him to a nearby hospital where he was diagnosed with a stroke. Dr Hetal Parikh, a neurologist with Shalby Hospital, said that the youth was operated upon to remove the blood clots. As October 29 is celebrated as World Stroke Day to create awareness about the life-threatening condition, city-based experts said that the second wave of Covid earlier this year also resulted in a spike in stroke cases. Dr Sudhir Shah, a city-based senior neurologist and professor of neurology, said that lifestyle disorders including tobacco, alcohol and narcotic substances often trigger strokes among the younger age group. “High blood pressure, tobacco use, high lipid levels, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and heart attack are the most important risk factors,” he said. Dr Arvind Sharma, a senior neurologist at Zydus Hospital and secretary of Indian Stroke Association, said that blood clotting among Covid-recovered patients surely caused a higher number of stroke cases than usual even as the numbers are normalizing now. “The efforts on the day are to create awareness about the golden time period for stroke patients. As one witnesses any signs associated with stroke, the patient must be immediately brought to medical settings to increase their chances of survival and recovery,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/second-wave-spiked-strokes-youth-susceptible/articleshow/87345223.cms||---

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare ordered that the tender process for MRI’s procurement for GMCH and installation be completed within four months. “If any additional funds are required, those will be provided without any delay. The government should also explore the possibility of utilizing the District Planning and Development Council (DPDC) funds if required,” said the judges. Before adjourning the hearing till December 8, the bench asked the respondents to submit a progress report regarding installation of fire safety machinery and equipment at GMCH and IGGMCH before the next date. “We direct Haffkine Corporation Limited and Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) to file additional reply outlining the progress made in Robotic Surgery System (RSS) and MRI machines procurement on the next date.” After being summoned by the court, top GMCH officials, including dean Dr Sudhir Gupta, surgery head Dr Rad Gajbhiye and radiodiagnosis head Dr Aarti Anand along with Haffkines general manager Vijay Baviskar were present. While hearing a petition filed by Bhushan Shingne (WP no 3427/2000) and others where amicus curiae Anup Gilda pointed out lack of efforts on the government’s part in procuring MRI and RSS machines and not taking adequate fire preventive measures, the bench said the minutes indicate that completion of tender process is likely to take quite a long time as certain compliances are noted to be achieved. “However, during arguments, it was informed that the major glitch in completion of the tender process was in respect of true meaning of word ‘refurbished’ used in the tender documents of one of the bidders, which has been used in relation to supply of necessary equipment that go into making up of RSS,” the justices said. What HC said * Explore possibility of utilizing DPDC funds for purchasing MRI machine * Submit progress report on fire safety machinery installation at GMCH, IGGMCH * Haffkines & DMER to file reply on progress made in procurement of Robotic Surgery System (RSS) * Complete new tendering process for RSS purchase within four months * Clear all financial sanctions and technical clearance for its tender soon||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/complete-tender-process-for-mri-machine-at-gmch-in-4-months-hc/articleshow/87344007.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

He was addressing a public meeting at Durgaji Intermediate College in Sehda area of his Azamgarh parliamentary constituency on Thursday where he also distributed laptops among meritorious students. Akhilesh further said, “Price of petrol has gone above Rs 100 while that of diesel is also skyrocketing. It has happened in the regime of BJP, which had sold dreams of boarding people in ‘hawai chappal (slippers) on aeroplanes. However, the increased prices have compelled the people to avoid riding even motorcycles.” “By doing this, the BJP government is hinting the people to ride bicycles now,” said Akhilesh, asking chief minister Yogi Adityanath “not to be worried about who will come to power next as people are well aware of the lies of the BJP”. Wooing the young voters, Akhilesh said, “Today’s laptop distribution by SP is not only for felicitating the meritorious and extending technical support for improvement in studies, but also to remind the BJP that it too had promised in its Sankalp Patra of 2017 assembly elections to give laptops, tablets, free data and even free Wi-Fi to selected institutes.” “But, in the past four and half years, it has failed to fulfil this promise and is now planning to distribute tablets,” he added. “SP had distributed laptops in its regime, which helped students in many ways. Even during Covid-19 lockdown the students having laptops had advantage in continuing their studies while others had to depend on smartphones,” said Akhilesh, adding, “Babaji (Yogi) doesn't know how to operate a laptop. Laptops would have been distributed by him if he knew how to operate them.” Directing his ire towards Yogi, the SP chief alleged, “To ensure that his favourite contractors get contracts for the Purvanchal Expressway, Babaji claimed to have reduced its cost which, however, resulted in the quality of the work being compromised. Now, people will suffer stomach and waist problems when they run vehicles on the expressway.” He added, “When I laid the foundation of the Purvanchal Expressway project, I had decided to engage the company which had installed the giant statue of Sardar Patel in Gujarat, by asking it to make the Purvanchal Expressway better than the Agra-Lucknow Expressway.” The construction of Agra-Lucknow Expressway was done by ensuring that aeroplanes could also land on it. Its inauguration was also done with the landing of jets. If I return to power, I would ensure the inauguration of the Purvanchal Expressway by landing a plane on it.” He also targeted the BJP-led Union government for privatising airports, airlines and other public sector companies. Akhilesh also took targetted the government on the issue of rise in price of LPG cylinders, farmers’ movements and issues of agriculture sector and unemployment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/by-hiking-fuel-prices-bjp-wantspeople-to-ride-bicycle-akhilesh/articleshow/87346610.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Praising the state’s performance in the field of education, he said, “I am happy to know Goa is performing well in the field of higher education and the gross enrolment ratio for women is 30% in the state as compared to the national average of 27.3%. In Goa, there are more female students than male. This is a very positive trend. It must continue and must be encouraged,” “This must serve as inspiration to other states,” the Vice-President said after inaugurating the new campus of the Sant Sohirobanath Ambiye Government College of Arts and Commerce at Pernem. Naidu said that the state government has plans to set up a Goa State Research Foundation to provide research fellowships in multi-disciplinary projects. “I am sure this initiative will lead and promote excellence in research and innovation in the field of higher education,” he said. He said that strict segregation of subjects is a thing of the past as the world today is increasingly adopting a multi-disciplinary approach. “Economy-wise no sector of the economy works solo and therefore equal importance must be given to humanities even in science and technology institutions and more multi-disciplinary courses must be started by all colleges and this is my advice to all education institutions.” The Vice-President said that the country needs to Indianise education and the process is on. “We cannot continue with colonial history and mindset. Whatever good is there in the world we recognise and welcome it, but at the same time we must know the greatness of our civilisation and values of our civilisation and ethics taught by our forefathers. The vice chancellors of various universities and educational institutions should focus on this. Syllabus has to be changed to include national heroes and that of the local region,” he said. Emphasising that innovation is the key driver of a knowledge-based economy, Naidu said that India with its “edge in information and communication technology and educated young population” has the potential to become a world leader in the sector. “Talent is everywhere in our country. It has to be channelised.” Governor P S Sreedharan Pillai, chief minister Pramod Sawant, Union minister for state Shripad Naik, deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar were also present on the occasion. The Vice-President said that people of Goa have a special place in his heart. “Higher education is important as it provides much-needed trained human resources for various sectors to drive economic growth and societal well-being,” he said. Naidu said that quality higher education is invariably a hallmark of all developed economies across the globe and it prepares students for more meaningful and productive roles and plays an important role in improving standards of living. Pillai said that substantial change in education is a need of the hour. “I am sure that the concept of education by Swami Vivekanand will be achieved by 2020 education policy int5roduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said. Sawant said that in the education sector Goa is at number one position and the state has the best infrastructure for education. He also said that hostel facilities will be made available for students of the government colleges.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/v-p-calls-for-multi-disciplinary-approach-in-higher-education/articleshow/87346606.cms||---

The chief minister office tweeted about the development and its commitment to Sanatana Dharma followers. “This will pave the way for overall development of the area, neglected for years. The town of ‘Soron’ houses a ‘kund’ held in high regard according to Hindu mythology and the believers come here for ‘visarjan’ (dispersing) the mortal remains. The location has its mention in spiritual literature and the site needs to be preserved as a ‘teerth’ (pilgrimage) in true sense,” said Bhupesh Sharma, a priest. Photo: Amit TiwariWelcoming the decision, social activist, Pradeep Raghunandan, said, “The decision of state government will facilitate not only heritage preservation but also provide pilgrims with basic facilities. With the protection of the ancient and holy shrines as a pilgrimage site, it will be easy to renovate small temples coming under these. CM Yogi has made this Diwali memorable for people of Kasganj.” Photo: Amit TiwariIn 2018, clamour for ‘teerth’ status for Soron gained momentum. Following which, the CM had promised to develop Kasganj, with an aim to promote religious tourism. The demand for declaring Soron as a pilgrimage site was again raised this year after Mathura was declared ‘teerth’ on September 10. Seven spots in Mathura district have already been declared pilgrimage sites. Towns on the list are Vrindavan, Gokul, Barsana, Nandgaon, Goverdhan, Baldev and Radhakund.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/cm-yogi-declares-soron-pilgrimage-site/articleshow/87345240.cms||Deepak Lavania

Fortunately, no casualties were reported as around seven people escaped with minor injuries. Seven shops located on the ground floor of the building were damaged.Yagnik road is the busiest commercial road in the central Rajkot. A five star hotel is also located adjacent to the Dhanrajni complex, where the accident happened. The building has two entrances — at Yagnik road and at Jagnath road. Both are busy roads and on Thursday there was heavy traffic on the two roads with many out for Diwali shopping. Police said that the slab of the first floor balcony towards the Jagnath road collapsed. For a few minutes the areas around the building was enveloped in thick dust. Three women customers, one employee and an owner of a general store got trapped inside the debris of the fallen portion. They were rescued by the pas sersby. Two other shopkeepers were rescued before the fire brigade personnel reached the spot. Apart from the shops on the ground floor, few two-wheelers parked in front of the building too were damaged. The incident brought to fore the lackadaisical attitude adopted by the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) towards dilapidated commercial buildings. Locals said that the 22-year-old building was in dilapidated condition because of lack of maintenance. P D Adhiya, town planning officer of the RMC, said, “Before the slab collapses, it develops cracks. It’s the responsibility of the building association and users to repair and maintain the building. Also, they did not report to RMC about the dilapidated condition of the building.” Generally, RMC conducts the surveys of the buildings and issue notices to the dilapidated structures. But no notice was issued to this building. Also, RMC has not initiated any inquiry to find out the reason behind the collapse. “We will do a survey of structural stability to see if the rest of the building can be used or not,” municipal commissioner Amit Arora told TOI. The cops have taken an application of the accident at the A division police station and started an investigation. “We have started the investigation and we will also ask for a report from RMC about structural stability of the building. If we find any negligence we will register an offence against those responsible,” deputy commissioner of police (zone 1) Praveen Kumar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/buildings-balcony-collapses-7-suffer-minor-wounds/articleshow/87345235.cms||---

Justice Sandeep Shinde’s verdict came on a petition by Amazon through its India head Amit Agrawal. A private complaint was filed with the junior magistrate, first class, by Ulhasnagar resident advocate Amritpal Singh Khalsa. In December 2019, he had ordered a hard drive and paid Rs 3,999 for it. However, he did not receive the product nor a refund. On August 16, 2021, the magistrate issued process under Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating) and 32 (common intention). Senior advocate Shirish Gupte, for Amazon India, argued that the magistrate issued a process summoning Agrawal in the absence of evidence to show his active involvement in relation to sale, despatch and delivery of product. Justice Shinde said that Amazon simply provides a neutral platform which allows sellers to interact with buyers. He said the allegations do not imply that Amazon induced Khalsa to buy with a dishonest intention not to deliver the same. On the contrary, Khalsa volunteered to buy the product from the platform through a seller.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/criminal-proceedings-against-amazon-india-quashed-by-bombay-hc/articleshow/87346630.cms||---

Soon after the body was discovered, a 19-year-old youth walked into the chief judicial magistrate's (CJM's) court in the city and declared to the judge that he had killed the girl since he was in love with her and did not like her speaking with other boys. The youth, identified as Tanuj Paswan, was subsequently arrested. Police said that Paswan’s family is in the meat business and he had used a knife meant for cutting meat to slit her throat, Eyewitnesses in the CJM court premises said that the dramatic way in which the youth confessed to his crime before the judge left everyone stunned. “It was around 4 o’clock and the proceedings of a matter were going on. This youngster who was sweating profusely came outside the courtroom and told people there that he had to urgently meet the judge. The staff members ignored him at first but he then barged into the courtroom and confessed his crime before the judge,” said a lawyer who was present in the premises. “It seemed he had the notion that it is better to surrender in court rather than to the police to avoid being beaten up by cops.” Meanwhile, the girl’s family claimed that Paswan had attacked the girl earlier as well. “On October 26, he met my niece at a park in Prem Nagar, where he slapped her several times and also tried to harm her with a knife. When she came home, she was scared and her hands were bleeding,” the girl's uncle alleged. The father of the deceased girl, who works as a daily wage labourer at a construction site, told TOI, “I was not aware that my daughter was being harassed by someone. We are still not able to come to terms with the loss.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/family-town-in-shock-after-murder-of-schoolgirl-in-doon-man-arrested/articleshow/87345233.cms||---
---||Kochi||Heavy rains cause spike in leptospirosis cases in Ekm||Kochi: Heavy rains have caused a spike in leptospirosis cases in Ernakulam. As many as six suspected deaths and one confirmed death due to leptospirosis have been reported in the district so far this month. Authorities noticed that vulnerable people do not take doxycycline tablets, while some take self-medication, making matters worse. In view of rising leptospirosis cases, an interdepartmental meeting will be held on Friday to discuss preventive measures for all communicable diseases. As many as 18 confirmed and 51 suspected leptospirosis cases were reported in the district in September. Twenty-nine confirmed cases were reported in October when the suspected cases stood at 48. A total of 304 suspected and 133 confirmed cases have been reported in the district so far this year. Meanwhile, four confirmed and 19 suspected leptospirosis deaths have been reported in Ernakulam so far this year. As cases are expected to rise further, vulnerable people should approach hospitals for diagnosis and start treatment at the earliest. The leptospirosis fatalities reported in Ernakulam were due to non-consumption of doxycycline tablets and delay in seeking treatment. The condition of these patients worsened in no time. Those engaged in cleaning works, MNREGS workers and farmers should take doxycycline tablets and ensure personal protection to prevent leptospirosis infection deaths. Workers engaged in cleaning activities should wear rubber gloves and gumboots during cleaning works. Those who have wounds on hands and legs should stay away from cleaning works until the wounds are healed. Children should not be allowed to play in waterlogged areas. A teenager died of suspected leptospirosis infection in Ernakulam after coming in contact with urine of infected animal while playing on a waterlogged playground. Fever, severe headache, body pain and fatigue are the symptoms of leptospirosis. One contracts the infection when she or he comes into contact with the urine of infected rodents or animals through water or soil. Health authorities said that as rain continues to lash the district, leptospirosis cases will rise if vulnerable people fail to adhere to the preventive measures and delay in seeking medical care when symptoms arise. “Multiple factors, including rain, non-consumption of doxycycline tablets given by health workers, delay in seeking medical care and self-medication, are the cause of leptospirosis deaths in Ernakulam. To control non-Covid communicable diseases, district collector will conduct an interdepartmental meeting under the chairmanship of district panchayat president on Friday,” said district surveillance officer for non-Covid diseases Dr Vinod Paulose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/heavy-rains-cause-spike-in-leptospirosis-cases-in-ekm/articleshow/87345228.cms||---

---||Goa||V-P calls for multi-disciplinary approach in higher education||Pernem: Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday urged educational institutions to start more multi-disciplinary courses that are in high demand in the 21st century. Praising the state’s performance in the field of education, he said, “I am happy to know Goa is performing well in the field of higher education and the gross enrolment ratio for women is 30% in the state as compared to the national average of 27.3%. In Goa, there are more female students than male. This is a very positive trend. It must continue and must be encouraged,” “This must serve as inspiration to other states,” the Vice-President said after inaugurating the new campus of the Sant Sohirobanath Ambiye Government College of Arts and Commerce at Pernem. Naidu said that the state government has plans to set up a Goa State Research Foundation to provide research fellowships in multi-disciplinary projects. “I am sure this initiative will lead and promote excellence in research and innovation in the field of higher education,” he said. He said that strict segregation of subjects is a thing of the past as the world today is increasingly adopting a multi-disciplinary approach. “Economy-wise no sector of the economy works solo and therefore equal importance must be given to humanities even in science and technology institutions and more multi-disciplinary courses must be started by all colleges and this is my advice to all education institutions.” The Vice-President said that the country needs to Indianise education and the process is on. “We cannot continue with colonial history and mindset. Whatever good is there in the world we recognise and welcome it, but at the same time we must know the greatness of our civilisation and values of our civilisation and ethics taught by our forefathers. The vice chancellors of various universities and educational institutions should focus on this. Syllabus has to be changed to include national heroes and that of the local region,” he said. Emphasising that innovation is the key driver of a knowledge-based economy, Naidu said that India with its “edge in information and communication technology and educated young population” has the potential to become a world leader in the sector. “Talent is everywhere in our country. It has to be channelised.” Governor P S Sreedharan Pillai, chief minister Pramod Sawant, Union minister for state Shripad Naik, deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar were also present on the occasion. The Vice-President said that people of Goa have a special place in his heart. “Higher education is important as it provides much-needed trained human resources for various sectors to drive economic growth and societal well-being,” he said. Naidu said that quality higher education is invariably a hallmark of all developed economies across the globe and it prepares students for more meaningful and productive roles and plays an important role in improving standards of living. Pillai said that substantial change in education is a need of the hour. “I am sure that the concept of education by Swami Vivekanand will be achieved by 2020 education policy int5roduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said. Sawant said that in the education sector Goa is at number one position and the state has the best infrastructure for education. He also said that hostel facilities will be made available for students of the government colleges.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/v-p-calls-for-multi-disciplinary-approach-in-higher-education/articleshow/87346623.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (KIIDC) floated the tenders for the reformation of damaged sunken seawall using tetrapods. The plan is to restore the broken seawall using tetrapods and rubble for 10km along the coast in between CP stone 976 and 1052 at Chellanam under KIIFB project. In the first phase, the construction of seawall will be done at a length of around 7km in between CP stones 986 and CP 1026 at a cost of Rs 252 crore. The stipulated period of completion of the works is 16 months and deadline for submission of bids in the form of hardcopies is 4pm on Monday. According to the tender, the contractor must construct the seawall using granite stones, weighing 10kg to 700kg, and tetrapods, weighing two tonnes to three tonnes, as per approved design on top of non-woven geo-textile mat as specified. Also, the contractors should have their own casting and stacking yard for stones and tetrapods and must establish weigh bridges. They also have to ensure necessary software and internet connection for the weigh bridge and the yard. “The technical committee for the project was constituted last week. We hope to get some good bidders before the deadline so that the work could be started at the earliest. The plan is the complete at least a major portion of the work before the monsoons next year. But everything depends on several reasons, including the availability of rock,” said a KIIDC source. The resident said that processes, including tendering, are lagging behind the schedule promised by the government and the works should be started at the earliest. “The seawall project is the last hope for the residents and it must be completed as per schedule,” said Jinson Veluthamannungal, a resident and coordinator of Care Chellanam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/seawall-renovation-set-to-begin-soon/articleshow/87345249.cms||---

From the 25 flats in the building, around 15 families had already vacated their flats, but others continued to live there due to a lack of alternatives.  Sukhramani told TOI, “Four months ago, when 12 people died in partial collapse incidents at two buildings, the state government had assured that within 15 days, they would solve technical problems arising in redevelopment of such dangerous buildings.

During the hearing, the HC bench asked SSP Udham Singh Nagar, Dilip Singh Kunwar, who attended the session via video-conferencing, as to why the probe was still pending when the court had ordered an investigation into the matter in February. To this, SSP Kunwar told the court that the second wave of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown impeded the pace of the probe. Also, the investigation officer was transferred during the period, the officer added. The case will next be heard on December 2. In a previous hearing, the state government was directed to inform the court of any “concrete” steps taken against the accused along with the status of the investigation. Notably, Umar Khan is accused of making fake ration cards between 2008 and 2019, an allegation denied by him. The case has been filed by Jaspur-resident Sardar Khan, who alleges that Umar scammed people by not providing ration to those with genuine ration cards. He also accused Umar of creating 191 fake cards within the aforementioned period. The local administration investigated Khan’s claims and found them to be true. Subsequently, an inquiry committee was asked to take action by the government, but that did not happen.

These small places went on to become very popular with both tourists and locals looking for cheap and wholesome food and snacks like bhaji-pao and omelette-pao,” Lobo said. “There is much more that these women can do. There are many traditional Goan dishes like xacuti, sorpotel, various vegetable preparations etc, but they don’t have a place to sell them or set up a restaurant,” he said. The solution, Lobo said, is to set up outlets where a group of women from that locality can get together and sell their food products. Calangute zilla panchayat member Dattaprasad Dabholkar said tourists visiting Goa hardly get an opportunity to eat Goan food. “Wherever you go in Calangute, Baga and other tourist spots, there are Punjabi restaurants, South Indian restaurants and joints serving Chinese food. But you hardly come across Goan restaurants. We need to change that and the way to do that is to encourage the local women to set up their own outlets,” he said. Lobo said they will be roping in professionals from the hospitality industry to provide basic training to the women to operate the restaurants. He said that to enable this, he along with various panchayats, comunidades and government departments, has initiated a process to identify land where shops can be built for local women’s self-help groups. “We’ve already identified spaces in Calangute, Baga, Siolim, Mapusa, etc to set up these restaurants and the first one at Arpora will be ready in two months,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/encourage-women-to-sell-goan-food-at-outlets-tap-tourists-lobo/articleshow/87346723.cms||---

A video of incident captured on CCTV camera later went viral.  Investigation by the fire brigade team revealed that gas was leaking from an underground cooking gas pipeline and it entered the drainage line. The gas was coming out from the manhole that caught fire. The boys were sitting near the entry gate of Tulsi Darshan Society II in Yogi Chowk area. Later, they came out of the entry gate and placed a paper piece on a manhole and tried to burn inflammable powder lighting a matchstick. Gas coming out from the manhole caught fire in the process, shows the video and suddenly engulfed the kids in a ball of fire. However, they immediately got up and got away. “The children did not suffer serious injuries. The fire occurred due to leaked gas from a damaged underground cooking gas pipeline that was coming out from the manhole,” said a fire official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/close-shave-for-five-kids-in-manhole-fire/articleshow/87345308.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s visionnext: Ethanol-fuelled drones||NAGPUR: Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, who is a strong advocate of ethanol as one of the alternative to petroleum, is now mooting even flying drones with the bio-fuel. Manas Group, a company run by one of his sons, is also into making ethanol as a byproduct of the sugar plant. Gadkari, while addressing a training programme for fruit growers organized in the city, said that he has suggested a scheme to the state’s agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse for providing two drones each in a village, which can be used for spraying in the fields. The city MP said that the drones can cost anywhere between Rs1.5 to Rs2 lakh if they are run on ethanol and “it can be done easily”. He had recently been to Rahuri in Western Maharashtra. “There I saw drone flying over fields. Normally, a drone costs Rs8 lakh but these were for Rs4 lakh because they were running on a lithium battery. I suggested that run them on a petrol engine designed for the drone and use ethanol instead,” said the minister. The minister said he would be launching an electric tractor in the next 15 days. He has also asked Toyota to make a car which runs on green hydrogen. “Some people don’t believe in new things and ridiculed my ideas. However, I have made things happen,” he said. Gadkari said he has also found shorter route to Bangladesh through which the cargo generated from the country can go to the eastern neighbour through a riparian area. “This was possible after dredging of Brahmaputra on the Bangladeshi side. The goods can now straightaway reach Pangoan river port in Bangladesh. The dredging was undertaken when I had the shipping ministry,” he said. “The request came from the Bangladeshi side and was given a go-ahead by late Sushma Swaraj who was the minister of external affairs then,” said the minister and added, “It will be half the cost as compared to that involved in shipping goods through sea route. A congestion on the regular route is also delaying the consignments.” There are plans to push export of Nagpur oranges to Bangladesh. “The country imposes high taxes on oranges. I had taken up the matter with the home minister who has agreed to look into it,” said the minister. Recently, Gadkari said, he also facilitated exports of consignments of Nagpur Orange Growers Association (NOGA) which is going through a lean phase.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/gadkaris-visionnext-ethanol-fuelled-drones/articleshow/87345296.cms||Shishir Arya

Many villages in Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar were littered with carcasses of hens, ducks, cows, buffaloes and goats. Nearly 21,100 hens were swept away in the gushing waters in Udham Singh Nagar alone. The animal husbandry department is working round-the-clock to provide compensation to the affected farmers. The latest data, collated by the animal husbandry department, shows that farmers have suffered losses to the tune of at least Rs 115 lakh. Livestock and poultry farmers in US Nagar, Almora and Champawat suffered the most, according to official data. “The maximum loss was reported from Udham Singh Nagar, where nearly 21,000 hens across nine poultry farms died. Also, nearly 50 cows, buffaloes, and goats have died,” said Dr Prem Kumar, director of Uttarakhand's animal husbandry department. The data, exclusively procured by TOI from the department, shows that 35 cows, 17 buffaloes and a dozen calves have died. Meanwhile, a single farm at Khatima in US Nagar lost a total of 200 ducks. The department is now grappling with infections that are surfacing among the animals that survived. Camps are being organised at several places to treat affected cattle. “Dermatology-related issues are now cropping among animals in the form of infections, fever and cold because of excessive exposure to rains. We are conducting camps across villages to provide care to the affected animals,” added GS Dhami, chief veterinary officer, US Nagar. The areas that saw mass mortality of birds and animals are being sanitised under the supervision of the local administration to avert avian flu or any other disease because of rotten carcasses. Villagers are upset because of their losses during the peak festival season, when otherwise they could have made money. "We have lost 6,000 hens in this tragedy, a major loss for us. This would have otherwise been the peak time for us to make money, owing to the festive season," said Balwant Singh, a poultry farmer from US Nagar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ukhand-rains-poultry-farmers-suffer-21k-hens-die-in-us-nagar-alone/articleshow/87345310.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Noon-meal staffer suspended for distributing rotten eggs||COIMBATORE: Tirupur district collector S Vineeth has suspended a noon-meal organizer for allegedly supplying rotten eggs to the students of Vavipalayam corporation primary school. It is to be noted that since the students are attending classes online, 10 eggs, 3kg rice and 1kg redgram are distributed to the beneficiaries of noon-meal scheme every month. The issue of rotten eggs surfaced on Tuesday, when parents took up the matter with school authorities. Photos of children holding rotten eggs also went viral on social media, forcing the district administration to launch a probe into the incident. In his inquiry report, M Sivashanmugam, personal assistant (noon-meal) to the district collector, said the corporation primary school at Vavipalayam had received 1,780 eggs on October 18 to be supplied to 178 students. “Noon-meal organizer (incharge) S Maheswari received the eggs from the supplier and logged the same in the registrar. While 600 eggs were distributed to 60 students on Monday (Oct 25), another 570 eggs were distributed to 57 students on Tuesday,” he said. Of the 1,780 eggs, he said, 1,170 eggs were distributed to the students of the government higher secondary school at Vavipalayam. “We had 610 eggs remaining for distribution to the corporation primary school students and 300 of them were found to be rotten. Subsequently, Maheswari dumped them in a garbage bin outside the school. However, she neither informed higher officials nor maintained proper records for the number of eggs.” The collector, who suspended Maheswari for bringing disrepute to the noon-meal scheme, said the rotten eggs were never distributed to the schoolchildren. “The egg supplier had replaced all the rotten eggs and the remaining 310 eggs on Thursday and they were distributed to the corporation primary school students, who visited the school along with their parents, on the day,” Sivashanmugam said. However, A Sigamani, CPM north rural committee member from Vavipalayam, said the rotten eggs were distributed to the corporation school students and officials were trying to cover up the incident by stating the rotten eggs were not distributed to the students. “While the corporation primary school and the government higher secondary schools are located at two different places, Maheswari was holding the additional charge of noon-meal coordinator of the primary school. While all the 1,170 eggs that were distributed to the higher secondary students were in good condition, 300 eggs that were distributed to 30 primary school students on Tuesday were all rotten. It was when the parents returned the rotten eggs that Maheswari dumped them in garbage bin,” Sigamani told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/noon-meal-staffer-suspended-for-distributing-rotten-eggs/articleshow/87346711.cms||A Subburaj

---||Kanpur||Div commissioner gives Nov 25 for redevelopment of Green park stadium||Kanpur: Kanpur divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar and district magistrate Vishakh G on Thursday asked the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association and sports department to equip the Green Park stadium with all facilities and latest technology to remain in the contest for conducting international matches. The two senior district officials said days had gone when Green Park stadium was alone in the state and organizers were forced to conduct the match in the then present state of the stadium. “Now there is a competitor which is just 80 kilometers away and waiting for a single opportunity to grab that," they said. The two officers reached this morning at Green Park stadium to witness the preparation of a forthcoming test match slated to be held there from November 25 and inspected the lift site at the media center. Annoyed with slow progress of work, the divisional commissioner instructed the officials to coordinate with PWD officials and prepare a work schedule for next 15 days as per day basis and try to complete the work on the same day to meet the deadline. The fixed deadline is November 10, for all renovation, repairing and maintenance work. He also directed UPCA officials to give reports on a daily basis to the district magistrate and deputy director sports posted there and they would give him feedback. Thereafter, his team would verify that. The DM said that every work must be completed in stipulated time and they had to make a deadline for each and every work instead of shifting the burden on each other’s shoulders. The media center is likely to be equipped with a lift in January 2022. In fact, there is a proposal to install two lifts at the media center- one for media persons (capacity of 8 persons), and second for TV and All India Radio commentators and players involved in commentary or interviews. For the second lift, representatives of the work agency which has been engaged by nodal agency Rajkiya NIrman Nigam under smart city project said that due to some difficulties in building, the structure they could give a time limit only after an inspection of the technical team. The work agency on the spot apprised the divisional commissioner about the plan and technical difficulties in lift installation. However, the divisional commissioner asked them to complete the second lift work till April 2022. The construction agency will install lifts manufactured by the Mitsubishi Japan company. They also asked about painting the outer boundary wall of the stadium. The UPCA officials assured them that they would complete the job in time . They had painted the walls in two days on earlier occasions. The district magistrate suggested drawing a caricature of players on the wall along with their record who had achieved a distinction at Green park. Thereafter, he and the DM visited the visitors gallery and witnessed the work progress. He also directed UPCA to provide a list of articles to the deputy director so that they could be checked before display in visitors gallery. During the inspection, besides Mudrika Pathak deputy director sports directorate, Deepak Sharma, Anil Kamthan, Ashu Mehrotra and Ravi Shukla from UPCA, Rajamani project manager UPRNN and others were present.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/div-commissioner-gives-nov-25-for-redevelopment-of-green-park-stadium/articleshow/87346716.cms||अनंत नारायण
---||Chandigarh||On demand of RWAs, councillors, civic body proposes hike in rates||PARKS’ MAINTENANCE Chandigarh: As the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) of the city and councillors have been demanding an increase in the charges to maintain the neighbourhood parks for the past few years, the civic body has proposed a hike from the existing Rs 2.48 per square metre to Rs 4.15 per square metre. Around 150 parks of the city are being maintained by different RWAs. The matter of revision of charges will be placed before the members of the MC general house for discussion and approval on Friday.While preparing the agenda item, the horticulture wing of the municipal corporation claimed that they studied the system and charges of the neighbouring Panchkula and Mohali and then proposed the new rates. However, cleanliness and lifting of horticulture waste from these parks will be done by the MC.“The councillors and RWAs requested that the rate of Rs 2.48 per square metre for maintenance of parks was not sufficient. A committee was constituted to review and analyse the rate and a meeting was held on October 5. It was found that Chandigarh was giving less than what Panchkula and Mohali were giving their RWAs. So, revision of rate was proposed,” the agenda stated.The councillors have, multiple times, raised the matter in the recent past, citing inflation that had made it difficult for the RWAs to maintain parks. Income from dhobi-ghatsThe MC is all set to bring in a policy to earn from the seven dhobi-ghats (washing areas) of the city. It is being proposed to charge Rs 50,000 per month rent from each dhobi ghat with an annual increase of 10%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/on-demand-of-rwas-councillors-civic-body-proposes-hike-in-rates/articleshow/87346689.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Surat||Vadodara bootlegger shifts base to Goa for ‘ease of business’||SURAT: Don’t get misled by the dry surface, scratch a little deeper and the state is soaking in illicit liquor that finds it way surreptitiously into the land through various inlets. And how profitable a trade is bootlegging in Gujarat is only proven yet again by this crafty Vadodara supplier who quietly shifted base to Goa for ‘ease of biz’ under the guise of chemical trade. Investigating into the seizure of liquor worth Rs 27 lakh in Mahidhapura on Tuesday, cops found that the consignment of contraband was sent by Shankar More (40) hidden inside chemical containers to his associate in the city, Jignesh alias Lalo Dabheliya. Dabheliya too has started chemical business to camouflage his underhand liquor trade. According to cops, More. who has his name attached in multiple criminal cases in Vadodara, shifted to Surat first and then Goa a few months ago where he registered himself there as a chemical businessman. He also took a GST number and started supplying liquor hidden in containers filled with chemicals. “It is the first case against More registered here since he shifted to Goa. Police did not have any idea that he had moved to Goa till his associates revealed the details,” said an officer in Mahidharpura police station. Police found that More decided to move to Goa lock stock and barrel after he was facing trouble in supplying liquor from Daman as well. “It is the first such case in which a bootlegger shifted his base to Goa after multiple cases in Gujarat. He modified the entire business model as well to avoid getting caught,” said R K Dhuliya, police inspector. On Tuesday, based on specific information police checked a chemical consignment transported in a truck. While the plastic containers were marked as containing aloe vera gel, it was only filled half with the gel, as the remaining half stocked Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) bottles. Police arrested Dabheliya and Sanjay Sadanand Karnik for their alleged involvement in the illicit trade. The duo also gave leads about a warehouse on Vasta Devdi road from where a huge quantity of liquor stock was found. Police recovered a total 6,351 IMFL bottles and 624 beer cans total worth Rs 27 lakh from the warehouse. The warehouse was taken on rent by Dabheliya to store chemicals, since he too got his chemical trading firm registered here. Dabheliya and More met each other in Rajkot jail as PASA detainees. Majority of the seized liquor is high quality products sold at much higher cost compared to its actual rate in Goa. But due to demand here, tipplers buy it at any cost. “The liquor was hidden below a thermocol sheet in the plastic containers, filled with the gel on top. It was covered with a cap and then sealed with a metal lid,” said a police officer at Mahidharpura police station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/bootlegger-shifts-base-to-goa-for-ease-of-biz/articleshow/87345357.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Dehradun||After 16 trekker deaths in 2 months, Uttarakhand to make registration must||DEHRADUN: Deaths of 16 trekkers, including three Navy officers and nine climbers from West Bengal, in the past two months in Uttarakhand has prompted tourism officials to propose mandatory registration for all those who aim to scale peaks in the hill state. Tourism officials said the department is considering framing guidelines where all trekking expeditions will have to mandatorily register their details before proceeding on their journey. Tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said a rise in the number of adventure sport lovers flocking to the Himalayan state had necessitated this move. “We are preparing a draft on the rules and regulations for trekkers and mountaineers. The proposal will be brought to the cabinet,” he said. Maharaj added that the state was mulling over tracking the movement of trekkers through GPS-embedded wristbands. Exact numbers are not available of trekker deaths in previous years in the state, but officials said that they were much lower and this year’s fatality figures were “unprecedented". The toll is expected to rise higher with five trekkers — two from an Indian Navy expedition, two from Harsil-Chitkul expedition and one in Sunderdhunga glacier in Bageshwar district — still missing, according to the State Emergency Operation Center (SEOC). At the start of the month, a team of Navy trekkers was caught in an avalanche en route to Mount Trishul in Chamoli district. The bodies of four naval officers were later recovered while two are still missing. After heavy rains lashed Uttarakhand on October 18 and 19, several trekkers were caught in bad weather in different parts of Uttarakhand. Seven trekkers died on Harshil-Chitkul trek in Uttarkashi district, while five bodies have been recovered from Sunderdhunga glacier. Colonel Amit Bisht, principal, Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM), said that October was the best month for trekking activities in Uttarakhand as the weather remains clear. “However, this time, the trekkers were caught off guard during extreme weather on October 18 and 19,” he said. Bisht suggested the government should allow trekkers to carry satellite phones during high altitude expeditions, as establishing communication remains key during such incidents.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sameer Wankhede didn’t arrest ‘rave party’ organiser, says Nawab Malik||MUMBAI: NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik on Thursday further intensified his attack against Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede, alleging that he deliberately did not arrest Fashion TV India head Khashiff Khan, the main organiser of the “rave party” on Cordelia cruise ship, during the NCB raid on October 2. “I have specific information that Khan, a leading arms dealer and main organiser of the rave party, is a personal friend of Wankhede, therefore he was not arrested, while NCB sleuths arrested three innocent persons—Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha under the stringent NDPS Act,” claimed Malik. “Khashiff Khan was present on the cruise ship along with his fiancee. I am reiterating that all the raids conducted under the leadership of Wankhede are fake and fabricated,” he added. Malik said that of the 1,300 persons onboard the ship, only 13 were detained, and after eight of them were arrested, including Aryan Khan, shockingly, the ship was allowed to sail to Goa without arresting Khan. Also three people, including the brother-in-law of a senior BJP leader, were let off for “obvious political reasons”, claimed Malik, adding: “I am told that while the cruise ship firm had the permission from the central government, it did not have the mandatory clearance from the state government and Mumbai Police. It was the responsibility of the central government to ensure that necessary clearances are sought from the state government.” Malik asked Wankhede to explain to the public why he was arresting innocent persons and letting off real culprits.

The deceased has been identified as A Balasubramanian. Police investigation revealed that the youth, a school dropout was running a two-wheeler mechanic shop. Police said that Balasubramanian had borrowed the country-made gun from his friend a few days back and brought it home. His father Azhagar, who did not like his son possessing a gun had a wordy duel with him on Wednesday. Later that night, Azhagar threw the gun outside the house and went out. Balasubramanian collected the gun and went to the grove and shot himself. His brother A Manikandan, 22, who went after him, heard the shot and found Manikandan dead with injuries in the jaw and the gun near the body. Though the Manapparai police had clues to conclude it to be a case of suicide, they also investigated if it was a murder and booked a case of suspicious death. The postmortem report concluded it as a suicide. “The autopsy showed that he must have pointed the gun between his jaw and neck and triggered it. Half of the pellets had pierced through his skull while the rest were found inside the skull,” said the inspector investigating the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/19-year-old-shoots-self-to-death-near-manapparai/articleshow/87346736.cms||---

The assurance followed pleas by rowing clubs and the state rowing association that the fountains installed to rejuvenate the Lake’s water would kill the sport here as this was the only rowing course in Bengal where many had learnt to row and won laurels in sub-junior and junior categories at the national level. At the meeting held at Lake Club, representatives of the rowing fraternity showed the map of the rowing course to KMDA director-general Supriya Maity and explained how the fountains installed to aerate the water and increase the dissolved oxygen level was a hazard to rowers and their equipment. They offered to look at alternative, non-intrusive means of aerating the water without blocking the course. “These installations will ruin rowing activities in the state,” said WBRA secretary Aniruddha Mookerjee, adding a rowing course needed to be obstacle-free as the athletes did not face the direction in which they row. “The fountains can injure rowers and damage the costly equipment.” KMDA sources said the agency would consider the issue as the fountains were installed to improve the quality of Lake water and not disrupt a sporting activity, being conducted there for nearly nine decades. “We have asked the clubs to allow the fountains to operate till Sunday. Meanwhile, we will look into alternatives,” a KMDA official said. A decision has to be taken soon as the national trials are slated for November 17 and participants will begin practice. Earlier in the day, green activist Bonani Kakkar wrote to KMDA CEO Antara Acharya, pointed out rowing itself helped aeration as it involved churning the water with oars. “Experts said a solution of bleaching powder and potassium permanganate may be worth exploring. The method was used by KIT for many years until recently,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rowing-row-kmda-looks-for-options/articleshow/87346738.cms||Subhro Niyogi

On his directions, his associates are allegedly not allowing the company authorised by the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) to collect garbage from the area and demanding that residents pay them for the service instead. The man, identified as Sector 23A resident Naveen Kumar, was earlier arrested for brutally assaulting a man for stopping him and his associates from collecting garbage, police said. He is currently in Bhondsi jail and police will take him on production remand for further investigation. The FIR was registered on Wednesday at Palam Vihar police station on a complaint filed by MCG. Kumar was booked under sections 186 (obstructing public servant), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 384 (extortion) of the IPC. According to police, a similar case had been filed against him earlier. “Even in his absence, his associates are threatening residents on his directions to pay them for garbage collection,” said police spokesperson Subhash Boken. In some areas, local goons are allegedly obstructing MCG’s garbage collection, instead collecting it on their own and charging residents Rs 100 to Rs 500 for it. These groups allegedly collect garbage without segregation and dump it in open areas and don’t allow garbage collection vehicles of MCG to enter their areas. “They threaten residents if they refuse to pay the charges.

With these, the city will have 80 electric buses. The first lot of 40 will reach the city by December-end. Talking to the TOI, UT adviser Dharam Pal said the secretary of heavy industries has assured him 40 more electric buses for Chandigarh, which (the second lot) the administration will receive in 2022.  Recently, Punjab Governor-cum-UT administrator Banwari Lal Purohit had asked the UT administration to ensure arrival of 40 electric buses by December-end. The directions were issued after the UT administrator’s advisory council’s sub-committee on transport issues submitted their action taken report. The report said, “In respect to electric buses, agreement has been made with Ashok Leyland for procurement of first lot of 40 electric buses on gross cost contract (GCC) model under FAME-2 scheme.” The report said, “The trial for electric bus has successfully been completed on city conditions. Nineteen buses are proposed to be delivered by November 15 and 20 by December 30.” As per the earlier arrangement, the city was to receive a fleet of 19 electric buses on September 30 and remaining 20 by October-end, but the manufacturer later expressed inability to supply by the scheduled date. The first electric bus had hit the UT roads on August 11. After the completion of a month-long trial run, the transport department had asked the manufacturer to make some technical changes. Three companies had submitted bids. However, the lowest bidder, Ashok Leyland, was awarded the contract to run the environment-friendly buses for 10 years on km scheme. As per the agreement, all maintenance expenditure, bus charging stations, suspension, HVAC system and major and minor repairs of the buses during the contract period would be the responsibility of the successful bidder. The department will pay Rs 60 per km to the company. The fare collection will be done by the authority. After being charged, the bus will cover a distance of nearly 200-300 km and take two to three hours to fully charge. In September last year, the Centre had sanctioned 80 electric buses for UT under Phase II of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme. The procurement of the buses will give a major boost to the plan of the UT to replace its entire fleet of ordinary ones of the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU). The transport department has planned to replace all the 358 diesel buses in the Tricity with electric ones by 2027-2028.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/centre-approves-40-more-electric-buses-for-city/articleshow/87346743.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Dehradun||Rains change course of four major rivers in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: Heavy rains that lashed Uttarakhand last week have led to four prominent rivers in the state to alter their course, prompting the forest department to rope in IIT-Roorkee to conduct a study on the river channels and the impact of this change. An analysis by the forest department following devastating rains since October 17 found that swollen rivers in Kumaon — Kosi, Gaula, Nandhaur and Dabka — have changed their course. In some areas, they have started flowing towards human habitations while in others, the change has adversely affected works of the forest department such as mining and patrolling. Tejaswini Patil, chief conservator of forests, western circle (Uttarakhand) told TOI, “The change in course of rivers is a concern for us. We have asked IIT-Roorkee to study the changes so we can build embankments on the river after a proper technical assessment.” According to Patil, instead of meandering through its usual channels, the waters of rain-fed rivers are now flowing across its traditional riverbed, which, in many cases, has been encroached upon. Environmentalists said encroachments on riverbanks have compounded the problem. “The rivers have not changed their course or taken up new channels, they are simply flowing in their own space — the riverbed — which humans have encroached upon,” said Himanshu Thakkar. Thakkar is coordinator of South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (Sandarp), a non-profit. “Illegal construction, waste dumping and muck dumping into the river — while clearing landslide debris during monsoon or during the construction of all-weather Char Dham road — has squeezed riverbeds,” he said. Historian and Padma Shri recipient Shekhar Pathak added that “anthropogenic pressure and blatant unscientific construction works” were the main reasons for the rains causing widespread devastation. “The road from Nainital to Almora was constructed by encroaching upon the Kosi river floodplain, and in this deluge, we have seen the entire road being washed away,” said Pathak. “Such unscientific construction by felling of trees, cutting of mountains, will cost Uttarakhand heavily. In fact, the Ravi Chopra committee (a Supreme Court-appointed expert committee to assess the Char Dham road project) had flagged this issue of over-construction in the river banks of Uttarakhand, yet authorities paid no heed to it,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/rains-change-course-of-four-major-rivers-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/87345378.cms||Shivani Azad

The Tamil Nadu governor must have sought details for presenting them in the conference,’’ she said.Tamilisai said that Telengana and Puducherry governments were forthcoming in providing the details she had sought about the implementation of schemes. “But in TN it is being unnecessarily politicised,” she alleged.Tamilisai said that all governors work for the development of the respective states they are serving. She said that governors would want to understand the implementation of welfare schemes and convey it to the Centre so that they can get more assistance for those states.To a query on the performance of the DMK government, Tamilisai chose not to comment stating that she was governor of Telengana and hence would not be appropriate to talk about TN government.On the law and order situation in Puducherry, she denied that the ‘bomb culture’ was rising in the Union territory. “I have sought a report from the DGP,” she said adding that all efforts to maintain law and order were being taken. Appreciating the frontline workers for their service during the Covid peak, she cautioned the public to follow Covid rules strictly as there was a resurgence of cases in several countries including China.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/guv-seeking-report-from-govt-is-being-politicised-tamilisai/articleshow/87346753.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Health admin aims to boost vax coverage before Diwali||Kolhapur: Anticipating low turnout of Covid vaccine beneficiaries during Diwali, the Kolhapur health administration is focusing on college students and village residents to boost the vaccination coverage. Earlier, during the 10-day Navaratra, the turnout at vaccination centres had fallen from about 8,000 per day to just about 2,000 a day. It caused piling up of vaccine stocks to around 2 lakh doses. The administration then carried out mass vaccination under the Kawach Kundala mission and targeted the elderly citizens on the occasion of World Day of Elderly Citizens on October 1. These two initiatives led to significant utilisation of the doses. However, the vaccine supply has continued even though the administration already has adequate doses. Farukh Desai, the district vaccination nodal officer, said, “The colleges have started in the district. We are setting up special camps for students. Also, we are holding camps in the villages where their is low turnout. We are even focusing on the beneficiaries who are up for their second doses.” The administration is planning to vaccinate 9,000 to 10,000 beneficiaries every day till the start of Diwali which falls in the first week of November. During Diwali, colleges and other establishments have a long holiday. Currently, 81% of the population has recieved at least the first dose of the vaccine. The highest number of beneficiaries due for the second dose is in the 18-44 years category. Most of these beneficiaries are working-class citizens. In over 70 villages in the district, the above 45 years population is fully vaccinated. District collector Rahul Rekhawar has asked the officials to plan innovative initiatives to boost vaccination in the district. The drop in the number of Covid cases has been making the citizens complacent and they are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. The authorities said due to the increased interaction during festivals, the number of Covid cases may increase over the next three to four weeks. Getting the highest number of people vaccinated before that is the administration’s aim.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/health-admin-aims-to-boost-vax-coverage-before-diwali/articleshow/87342929.cms||---

Those that fail to comply will be given eviction notices to vacate from the new municipal market complex. “This is the only way forward towards making any substantial difference in the new municipal market complex. Every time we delay, it is development money taken out of every single ward in CCP. We have already spent over Rs 3.5 crore on electricity and water bills in addition to incurring revenue loss. This money could’ve been used for the development of the wards,” mayor Rohit Monserrate said. TOI had earlier reported that the CCP has identified over 400 such tenants that were operating in the premises rent-free. Public interest litigations (PIL) filed in the high court of Bombay at Goa in July 2017 had given the corporation one year to recover rent/licence fee arrears and initiate action against illegal occupants. The ND Agarwal committee appointed by the government, in its report in 2013, had stated that 80% of the occupants of the market complex were illegal. A majority of the occupants in the new market did not figure in the list of tenants of the old market, it had stated. “We have inspected the shops to verify if the size and dimensions match the present status. As a result there is a lot of difference in the GSIDC list which was formed in 2011 and the current lease,” said CCP market committee chairman, Pramay Mainkar. “We will serve the 446 tenants that are yet to sign the agreement with eviction notices if they fail to comply. They can challenge the matter in the court if they wish to,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ccp-to-sign-leases-with-mkt-tenants/articleshow/87346914.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Realty check: Hyderbad housing boom to go on post-Diwali||HYDERABAD: It’s all set to be a bright Diwali for Hyderabad’s property market, with buyers lining up for new homes this festive season. Continuing the positive streak that set in about two months ago — following a significant drop in Covid-19 cases — industry insiders say that residential sales are on a roll, with many selling between 100 and 120 units a month (on an average). The fastest-moving segment: Rs 1 crore to Rs 1.2 crore apartments. There’s also enough demand for villas and plots, add developers. Encouraged by this trend many major construction firms are hoping to launch new residential projects, soon after Diwali. “We are hoping to announce two projects by November-December. That’s because we have exhausted most of our inventory and Provincia in Narsingi is the only one available. That too is selling fast,” said P Sreenivas Reddy, executive director of Rajapushpa Properties. Apart from residential, office space too is gaining tremendous traction, he said. This growth of the commercial and retail sectors, experts say, is a reason for housing sales picking up pace. “Our Tellapur projects — Ankura (villas) and Tridasa (apartments) — are almost completely sold out; as is Bhooja in Madhapur. And this is without any promotional activity. It is an indication of a healthy market,” said Shyam Rao Jupally, managing director, My Home Constructions. As is Bengaluru-based Prestige Group that sold about 50 units in the city in last 30 days. “We are hoping to start our Kokapet project somewhere around December-January. Though our focus is on entering the Mumbai market now, we have big plans for Hyderabad as well,” said R Suresh Kumar, senior vice-president (business operations), Prestige Group.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/realty-check-hyd-housing-boom-to-go-on-post-diwali/articleshow/87345201.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Officials have cited a lack of funds as the chief reason as to why this system of maintaining parks has not been implemented. While the GHMC has several themed parks with gyms and other amenities, the SCB is yet to develop one. “To set up modern gyms in the parks, we need around Rs 5 crore but we our financial problems have prevented us from doing so,” an SCB official said. Not only that, several parks built on ‘40 per cent land’ have remained neglected. In Trimulgherry’s Malani Enclave, a park had been closed for a few months as weeds had grown extensively. After several complaints from residents, the SCB agreed to clear the park charged the residents for grass cutting machines. “The park was supposed to be maintained by SCB and they should bear the charges but we ended up paying. This is unacceptable,” N Harshada, a resident of Malani Park, told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/fund-crunch-a-major-hurdle/articleshow/87345304.cms||Sunil Mungara

Malik further alleged that Wankhede, who was on a spree to send innocents behind bars, is scared of jail himself. “A week ago, Wankhede had approached Mumbai Police for police protection, while on Thursday, fearing arrest…he approached the high court for protection. What has changed during the week that prompted Wankhede to knock on the doors of the judiciary,” Malik asked. Reiterating that all cases filed by Wankhede were fake and fabricated, Malik said he will submit the evidence before the judiciary and the court will be urged to quash the cases against the innocent pers-ons. “Aryan and two others got bail on Thursday. They should have been granted bail long back by the special court, but they remained in jail as NCB lawyers continued to change their stand,” he claimed. —Prafulla Marpakwar||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/picture-abhi-baki-hai-mere-dost-netas-dig-at-officer/articleshow/87346836.cms||---

The five trekkers were part of a 10-member team that went on an expedition to the Himalayas and went missing after the weather turned bad, leading to an avalanche. The team including Chandra Sekhar Das, Sarit Sekhar Das and Sagar De from Bagnan in Howrah, Sadhan Basak from Thakurpukur and Pritam Roy from Ranaghat left for the Kanakata Pass in the Sunderdhunga glacier region near Devi Kund in Uttarakhand. The rescue began on October 21 but several attempts at helicopter salvage operation did not yield any result due to bad weather. On October 25, an SDRF team finally spotted the bodies and they were airlifted to nearby Kapkot town. On Thursday morning, the five trekkers’ bodies were brought to Dum Dum airport, where minister Sujit Basu was present. Sarit Sekhar and Chandra Sekhar were cousins. While Sarit initially did not have plans to join the group for the Kanakata pass trek, he subsequently replaced a trekker, who had dropped out. Sarit had trained under his father, Tushar Kanti Das.When the cousins’ bodies were taken to their village, Muralibar, in Bagnan, neighbours gathered to pay their last respects. Another deceased mountaineer Sagar’s father, Sunil De, was a trekker himself. When he heard about the calamity, he had feared the worst. Pritam Roy and Sadhan Basak were experienced trekkers, the latter being a veteran mountaineer with 11 years’ experience. He was a retired government employee, while Roy was an MBBS student.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/5-trekkers-bodies-return-home/articleshow/87346827.cms||Rupak Banerjee

Residents are demanding SCB officials to develop parks in such areas, similar to those in GHMC area, to deter encroachment. The Cantonment currently has around 100 acres of these ‘40 per cent lands,’ estimated to cost around Rs 600 crore in the current market. However, an SCB engineering wing official said that a lack of funds has held them back from building compound walls along such areas and installing CCTV cameras. “But we have conducted inspections on unauthorised constructions on such lands with help from whistle-blowers, to foil the efforts land sharks,” the official told TOI. As per present estimates, around 60 per cent of such lands have been encroached. Of the remaining 40 per cent, 20 per cent has been utilised by SCB to build parks and other amenities while 20 per cent is still vacant. Around four years back, SCB had passed a resolution to build community halls and gyms, develop lawns on the ‘40 per cent lands’ but built them in only one or two land parcels. Residents are now urging the board to either hand over the maintenance of such areas to GHMC or set up a horticulture wing for the same, similar to the one in GHMC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/40-land-under-scb-target-for-land-sharks/articleshow/87345281.cms||Sunil Mungara

On Thursday evening, the river was flowing at 113 metre mark. At 8 am on Thursday, the water level was at 113.04 metre. However, there had been a slight dip in the water level yet it was at the warning point. It was on Wednesday, the water level of Ganga had crossed the warning mark. For the first time in the month of October, water level in the Ganga had passed beyond the warning mark. The surge in the water level of the Ganga was due to extremely heavy rainfall in the hills of Uttarakhand. Around this time of the year, the Ganga flows at a much lower level than the current gauge. But this year, the scenario is very different. The increase in the water level in the Ganga has already caused loss to the crops. Crops in low-lying Katri region and areas in Shuklaganj have got washed away. Vegetable crops and flowering crops have suffered damage in the Katri villages. Some of the villages of this area include Lakshmanpurwa, Durgapurwa, Shivdeenpurwa. Increased water level has caused submerging of ghat stairs at Parmat and Sarsaiyya ghat. The relief being that the water level had slightly receded and there are hopes that the water level may start declining. The increase in water level in the Ganga is resulting in discharge of large quantities of water from Ganga Barrage into its downstream. The water discharged from the barrage would result in an increase in water level in Prayagraj and Varanasi. A whopping four lakh cusecs of water was released from the barrage into the Ganga downstream on Thursday. Similar quantities of water has been released into Ganga in the past few days ever since the water level was increasing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/swelled-by-ukhand-rainfall-ganga-flowing-at-warning-mark/articleshow/87346849.cms||---

---||Mumbai||NCB refers to WhatsApp chats to show ‘commercial quantity’||MUMBAI: The HC on Thursday granted bail to Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha in drugs seizure case. At the hearing of the bail plea of the trio, senior counsel Amit Desai, appearing as lead counsel for Merchant, along with advocate Taraq Sayed, had on Wednesday termed the very arrests as “illegal’’ as no notice under Section 41A of Criminal Procedure Code was issued to first seek an explanation since alleged recovery of charas was small and attracted less than a year’s punishment. Singh said tampering cannot be ruled out as “the affidavit by a witness named a person”. He did not name the person himself, though he was referring to Prabhakar Sail’s affidavit in which he has alleged a Rs 8 crore payoff to an NCB official and mentioned Pooja Dadlani, Shah Rukh Khan’s manager. The NCB stressed again that Khan and Merchant were together and Khan was in “conscious possession”, and that he was connected with peddlers and the entire case is one, which cannot be dissected, and it is of commercial quantity. When the judge asked on what basis the agency had found Khan dealing in “commercial quantity”, the NCB referred to his WhatsApp chats. “The grounds of arrest were shown within four hours of arrest. Four hours cannot be called a delay. Besides, conspiracy is difficult to prove. It is only the conspirators who know how they have conspired. We have WhatsApp chats which we will place on record.” Rohatgi, brought in from London for the HC hearing, then started his rejoinder to argue why NCB arguments ought not to be accepted. He argued for about 15 minutes and after mid-submission, the judge said he had heard enough. He tossed the three applications towards his staff and said, “All three applications are allowed.” It was around 4.45pm. The courtroom was packed, with other lawyers too. The suddenness of the pronouncement took many by surprise. Khan’s advocate Satish Maneshinde then sought permission to submit cash bail, which the court refused, and said it has to be a surety. “I could have also given the order tomorrow. But I gave it today,” Justice Sambre said. He said the detailed order assigning reasons would come later. Khan is presently in judicial custody and lodged at Arthur Road prison. The legal team will now try to complete the formalities for his release by Friday itself or Saturday, once the operative part is out, depending on the time the order copy is out. Rohatgi in his rejoinder said, “Aryan and Arbaaz were together. But the most important thing put against us is commercial quantity being recovered from others. While the ASG refers to Section 37 (provision making bail tough) of NDPS Act by referring to commercial quantities being recovered, Section 27A (the serious offence of illicit trafficking and financing of drug trafficking) is not invoked against them,” he pointed out. Both Rohatgi and senior counsel Amit Desai had on Wednesday argued that the arrest memo did not mention their arrest was for any conspiracy but that offence was inexplicably shown in the first remand application on October 3. “What is argued against me is what has been found on five others, which if you total up, will amount to commercial quantity. Aachit Kumar, whom NCB called a dealer, was arrested four days later with 2.5 grams. Can he be a dealer? Their case is that since they were there it is a case of conspiracy, but the conspiracy is a meeting of minds. Apart from Arbaaz none of the other accused have any connection with me, and there were 1,300 people in the cruise,” Rohatgi said. Rohatgi said, “It is the greatest travesty of justice if Article 21 (right to life and liberty) is not examined at the time of bail.” The three were arrested on October 3 and booked under relevant sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act for possession and consumption after 6gm charas was allegedly found on Merchant’s shoes and 5gm from Dhamecha’s cabin floor. Both had denied the recovery, and Khan’s case was that there was nothing found on him at all, yet he was arrested and alleged to be part of a “larger conspiracy” by the NCB. Meanwhile, after the day’s proceedings, solicitor Raian Karanjawal from Delhi, engaged by his school junior, Shah Rukh Khan for the HC bail hearing, said, “I interacted with Shah Rukh Khan before the matter, when he asked me about Mukul Rohatgi before the HC bail plea, and after bail was granted, over the phone. He thanked us. My daughter, part of the legal team interacting more frequently, found him well versed with all the facts, measured in the approach, not excitable as a lot of clients are in such situations and very balanced to talk to. He was also familiar with aspects of the case.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-refers-to-whatsapp-chats-to-show-commercial-quantity/articleshow/87345532.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Illegal country liquor bottling plant busted||AURANGABAD: The state excise department raided a defunct ginning and pressing mill in Beed district and unearthed an illegal country liquor manufacturing unit. State excise superintendent Nitin Ghule told TOI, “We have busted a country liquor unit, which we suspect was fully operational and was pumping innumerable bottles of hooch in the open market.” He said such illegal liquor units not only cause loss to the state exchequer but also pose a serious threat to the life of consumers. Articles worth about Rs 25 lakh have been seized from the mill, while a manhunt has been launched for the individuals suspected of running the racket. Superintendent of police R Raja said, “The joint action is the outcome of the police and state excise department taking steps to crack down on these illicit businesses.” He said that directives have been issued to scan all the previous criminal records of those associated with the unit busted on Thursday. Following the raid, an offence has been registered at the Beed rural police station against one Rohit Chavan, who was booked six months ago for being involved in similar activities. State excise authorities collected some samples from the seized stock to get them examined at the lab. “Suspects use spirit and add some essence to it, before packing the same in bottles, pasting stickers and selling them in the open market along with genuine liquor,” said assistant police inspector Yogesh Ubale. The seized articles include four brands of country liquor. These are the most consumed brands of liquor in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/beed-illegal-country-liquor-bottling-plant-busted/articleshow/87342997.cms||Mohammed Akhef

This month, I didn’t use the car much and the last time I checked, at the start of the month, diesel was still in the early 90s. I realised it has crossed Rs 100 per litre only after I asked for a full-tank refill. I remember I had stressed on paying more than a lakh extra three years ago for a diesel version of the car to ensure I spend less on fuel. But I believe that was a bad investment considering the state we are in now,” said the techie, a resident of Dunlop.On Thursday, when diesel crossed the century mark in Kolkata, hundreds of other car owners in the city who had bought diesel cars hoping for better savings in the long run echoed Mukherjee’s thoughts. They are in a fix as petrol and diesel prices are separated by barely Rs 8 now.“Since petrol price had crossed Rs 100, I had barely driven my petrol sedan and had resumed driving my old diesel-powered jeep from the garage. But now, with even diesel crossing the Rs 100 mark, I believe it is time I get back on my bike. I already sent it to get serviced in the morning and, tomorrow onwards, I will be back on my two-wheeler to ensure I make some savings,” said Rajiv Sculler, a former Armyman and a fitness trainer who regularly drives between Salt Lake and his home at Lake Gardens.While those who purchased small cars with diesel engines and drive around 45km daily are now regretting the decision, there is still a demand for diesel-powered large vehicles, like SUVs, for various reasons that include greater efficiency and more torque. This is particularly so if a person travels more than 50km in a day.Rahul Chowdhury, a 45-year-old doctor who drives regularly between his home in New Alipore and workplace at Kalyani JL Nehru Medical College, said he had bought the diesel version of the SUV considering he regularly had to drive for 60km.“The price rise is pinching everyone and I am no exception. But I am making some lifestyle changes now. I am driving my car only for work and emergency purposes, and am cutting down on all leisure rides. I can’t spend a large chunk of my salary buying car fuel three times a week,” said Chowdhury.With inputs from Amit Moulick and Subhojyoti Kanjilal||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/car-owners-in-a-fix-plan-fewer-drives-mode-change/articleshow/87345521.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The two editions, branded F250 and N250, feature slightly different builds and different colours, and are priced at Rs1.4 lakh and Rs1.38 lakh, respectively. MD Rajiv Bajaj said offerings above 250cc were not under consideration under the Pulsar range. “For the moment, I think the Pulsar range stops at 250 cc. For 300 cc and above, Dominar is the Bajaj brand. We are definitely considering a new 150cc or 200cc Pulsar,” Rajiv remarked. In an interaction with TOI, Sarang Kanade, Bajaj’s president of the motorcycle business, added that Bajaj, like the rest of the auto industry, has had to manage and prioritise due to the consistent supply chain issues through the pandemic. “Our suppliers have worked very well given the circumstances. The chip shortage issue is expected to continue in the first half of next year. However, alternative suppliers are also emerging within the country,” Kanade said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/bajaj-auto-launches-two-new-pulsars/articleshow/87345497.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Kolkata||Diesel@100: Commute & essentials hit hard in West Bengal||KOLKATA: The record spike in diesel prices had an almost immediate impact on the transport sector on Thursday with buses going off the road and app-cab surge prices touching new records. People were found stranded at bus stands for a long time. Many were spotted jostling for a foothold in buses. With the demand for cabs rising, the fare went through the roof. Prices of essentials also stayed high on Thursday. Some retail markets faced a supply issues. Behala market on Thursday received no truck carrying potatoes. “A majority of goods vehicles have increased the fare abruptly. Naturally, vendors often found carrying costs unreasonable, leading to new supply issues in some markets,” said Kamal Dey, president of the West Bengal Vendors’ Association. TimesViewThere has to be a planned solution so that commuters have options on the road. Yanking off buses and cabs is not the solution to rising fuel prices.The cab fare, which was pinching anyway, is now burning a much bigger hole in the pockets of riders. The surge fare has almost become a constant throughout the day. The app-cab fare from Behala to Howrah, which hardly exceeds Rs 250 during peak hours, hovered around Rs 500-Rs 700. The app cab fare from Tollygunge to Sector V consistently exceeded Rs 800 till 1am. “The fare refused to drop below Rs 900 from Garia to Lake Town as I kept trying for over an hour. I finally abandoned the plan to go there. The fare for this stretch seldom exceeds Rs 500 on a normal day,” said Argha Dasgupta, a freelance commercial artist who was scheduled to meet his client on Thursday. Metered taxis were fewer on the road and those plying demand hefty extra above the fare. “The diesel price is constantly moving north, our survival is at stake. It requires a lot of cajoling to make a commuter pay extra. We may have to leave this trade and do something else to survive,” said Anant Singh, a cab driver at Bhowanipore. “From pulses, spices, edible oil, foodgrains to phenyl, toothpaste and shampoo, prices of all items are jumped abruptly almost every alternate month, putting households in a never-seen-before stress. It has been increasingly difficult to do the tight-rope walking with savings getting exhausted fast,” said Gautam Sarkar, private company executive, whose salary cut is yet to be compensated by his company. At Hazra crossing, CITU-affiliated transport workers staged agitation against the hike of petrol and diesel prices. “The cost of transportation rose more than double of what it was in last December. We have lost clients as most of them have moved to railways. The consistently rising diesel prices put us in an existential crisis,” said Sajal Ghosh, general secretary of the Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators’ Associations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/diesel100-commute-essentials-hit-hard/articleshow/87345512.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Finding green crackers may be a problem this year||KOLKATA: People willing to celebrate Kali Puja and Diwali in an environment-friendly manner may find it challenging as green crackers aren’t easily available and are expensive. In absence of green crackers in adequate quantity and at affordable prices, conventional polluting crackers may again be used during the festival, fear environmentalists. There are no green cracker-manufacturing units in the state yet, both because they are expensive to manufacture and also because they have low shelf-life. As per CSIR-NEERI records, there are 212 registered green fireworks manufacturing units in the country, of which 139 are in Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu. The rest are scattered across Rajasthan, Haryana, Indore and Uttar Pradesh. There are no registered units in eastern India. “Fire crackers are handmade products that take time to manufacture. Even the imports from Sivakasi and other places take a lot of time to arrive. How are we supposed to sell green crackers when the entire stock has to be imported?” said a fireworks seller in Burrabazar. On Wednesday, West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) announced a blanket ban on fireworks except the green ones during Kali Puja, Chhath, Christmas and New Year’s Eve. The board even specified timings for burning of crackers. “Green crackers are those without harmful chemicals like lithium, barium, lead and arsenic. A buyer can identify a green cracker by scanning a QR code on the box using the NEERI mobile app,” said PCB chairman Kalyan Rudra on Thursday. There is a green version of all popular crackers. “However, they are way costlier and even if we want to sell them, very few here can arrangea large quantity of green crackers in such a short span of time. Moreover, what are we supposed to do with the large quantity of crackers stocked at godowns since last year?” said a senior member of Burrabazar Fireworks’ Dealers’ Association. With sale of now-illegal firecrackers still happening in Burrabazar and other popular hubs like Nungi and Champahati, environmentalists fear they will eventually enter the market and will be burnt again like other years. “Looking at the smoke and hearing the sound, how can someone check if the cracker is green or not?” said green crusader Subhas Dutta.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/finding-green-crackers-may-be-a-problem-this-yr/articleshow/87345554.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

According to the rules, family members of a bedridden patient or a differently abled person will need to register the name of the person who requires the shot with the medical officer running a KMC vaccination centre in the neighbourhood.The applicant’s representative must carry a prescription from a registered medical practitioner explaining the physical condition of the applicant. The KMC medical officer will then send the list of the aspirants to the senior health department officials for approval for the vaccination.Once the approval is granted, the medical officer of the vaccination centre concerned will confirm a slot and inform the applicant’s family about the date and time of arrival of the KMC paramedics. The family members need to call a doctor at home who will be present till the vaccination was over. According to a KMC health department official, the civic body was preparing for the special vaccination process at the ward level. In fact, the KMC had taken up such an initiative around two months ago. In the first week of August, the KMC Board of Administrators had announced a doorstep vaccination plan for the bedridden, elderly and infirm residents. However, the scheme didn’t take off as there was no official approval for implementation from the Centre. In July, too, KMC ward coordinator Ashim Bose had introduced a vaccination-at-home plan in several Bhowanipore neighbourhoods. However, it had to be called off as the scheme had no official sanction. However, despite high expectations, citizens are now in a wait-and-watch mode till the programme is officially launched.But a new diktat from the Centre may prove to be a shot in the arm for the KMC, which now wants to implement the scheme at the earliest. A month ago, the Centre had cleared hurdles for the doorstep vaccination programme for the bedridden and differently abled persons. According to a KMC health department official, the civic body will now activate its ward-wise health infrastructure to reach out to the eligible people. “We have no dearth of vaccines or vaccinators. But we need more doctors present at the time of vaccination of critical patients at home. These patients should be under supervision of a medical practitioner for at least half an hour after the jab. If needed, family members of such a patient may be asked to arrange for a doctor,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kmc-set-to-launch-vaccine-at-home-scheme-for-the-ailing-and-the-elderly/articleshow/87345544.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Mumbai||Two get double life terms for ‘diabolical’ murder of teen in 2017||MUMBAI: Two men were handed double life sentences each by the sessions court for what it called the “beastly” murder of their 17-year-old friend in his home in 2017. Niyaz Hashmi, 23, and Mohammed Sharif Shaikh, 25, both residents of Bandra (East), had called on Ajay Jaiswal at night when his family was away visiting his sister in UP, murdered him and stolen gold jewellery. The parents discovered his body on their return. “The diabolical manner in which the crime was committed, that is cut throat injury, head injury with deadly weapon, leaves one worried about the pervert mental state of the accused persons and the brazenness and coldness with which the act was committed in the night hours at the house of the deceased,” said additional sessions judge Kishore M Jaiswal. Hashmi, a welder, and Shaikh, a labourer, got a life term each for the separate charges of murder, and voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery. The sentences will run concurrently. They were also fined Rs 20,000 each. Shaikh was out on bail. Another accused, Shahjad Ali, 24, was acquitted for lack of evidence. A fourth accused, Saddam Shaikh, 20, died while the trial was on. Public prosecutor Iqbal Solkar cited the evidence of over 30 witnesses, including six who had last seen Ajay with the accused in the wee hours of September 26, 2017. Relying on this, the court said the gap between the circumstance of ‘last seen together’ and the death is so small that the possibility of any other person being with Ajay could be ruled out as the incident occurred inside his house. When Ajay’s parents returned home on September 26, the door was locked. When they enquired with a neighbour, they were told Ajay had taken the keys a few hours earlier. Ajay’s father then took a hammer from another neighbour and broke open the lock. When he entered, he found Ajay lying in a pool of blood and the house ransacked. The man immediately went to Kherwadi police station. Based on witness statements that Ajay was last seen with the accused and that they were also sleeping in his house while the parents were away, the police arrested them. The court also relied on an extra-judicial confession made by Hashmi to his relatives. Hashmi’s cousin and wife told court he had come to their house to hide a knife, which he claimed to have used to murder someone. The court said the confession is corroborated as the knife was seized after Hashmi later led cops to it. “So far as accused no 1 (Hashmi) and 2 (Shaikh) are concerned, the prosecution has succeeded in bringing positive evidence regarding homicidal death of Ajay and strong motive to commit offence with discovery of incriminating blood-stained weapon and stolen ornaments,” said the court. The court also pointed to forensic evidence and said the accused had failed to explain how blood stains belonging to another blood group were found on their clothes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-2-get-double-life-terms-for-diabolical-murder-of-teen/articleshow/87346867.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Officials have started drives at the village-level, and are even going door-to-door, to increase coverage. Deputy collector Ganesh Misal, who is also the the nodal officer for vaccination in the district, said they have started an awareness campaign. He said officials were going to beneficiaries’ homes to help them overcome reservations about getting the jabs,” Misal said. “Currently, only those people who are not willing to take the vaccine for any reason are being counselled and vaccinated at home. A full-fledged door-to-door vaccination drive has yet to begin, but our health teams are covering every lane and bylane in every village,” Misal added. He said the vaccination had initially begun at primary health centres, which have several sub-centres under them; each sub-centre has at two-four villages under its jurisdiction. “As the vaccination drive progressed, the availability of doses and syringes increased, so we decided to administer vaccines at the sub-centre level and at village-level,” he said.

Over 100 encounters related to cow slaughter have been reported in this district in the past. Police said that the 14 suspects were let off with “a stern warning.” The 14 villagers belong to Sandhawali area under Mansoorpur police station limits where 64 people had been booked earlier. When asked about the incident, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Abhishek Yadav acknowledged that more than 100 encounters had taken place in the district in the past two years. “Most of the accused are in jail. People involved in old cases of cow slaughter have been put under surveillance. Many such criminals are approaching police stations and pleading before us that they are no longer involved in the crime." SHO of Mansoorpur, Mukesh Gautam, told TOI, "We have contacted 64 people involved in old cow slaughter cases in Sandhawali village. Some of them are working in other districts. They are yet to visit us, but have assured that they are not involved in such activities." One of the accused, who wished not to be named, said, "I was booked for cow slaughter years ago. A police team recently came to my village and summoned me to the local police station. I went there and gave them an assurance that I'm not involved in this crime and would also inform them if I come across any such acts in the village." Sources said that a few months ago, three gangsters with three dozen criminal cases against their name along with several cow slaughter accused of Sikri village had also gone to Bhopa police station in Muzaffarnagar district with an affidavit to "seek forgiveness regarding their crime, pleading they won't repeat it.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/fearing-encounter-14-cow-slaughter-accused-in-up-arrive-at-police-station-pleading-they-wont-repeat-offence/articleshow/87345557.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Hearing a writ petition filed by one Vijay Kumar, Justice Saral Srivastava directed that the warrant be served through the chief judicial magistrate concerned and a copy of this order be handed over to the CJM for compliance. Earlier at one stage, while hearing this case relating to teachers’ recruitment matter, the court in its order dated September 30, 2021, had said that despite opportunity, the secretary (ministry of education) has not responded nor a counter-affidavit has been filed in the matter. According to the court, this matter cannot be decided without the affidavit of the state government. However, on request of the state counsel, the court had granted four weeks’ further time to the respondent to file reply. In this order, the court had also made it clear that no more time will be granted to the respondent to file counter affidavit in the matter. Today (Thursday), when the case was taken up, the court took a serious note of non-filing of counter-affidavit till date and passed the above order, observing, “Despite the last opportunity granted by this court, neither counter-affidavit has been supplied nor concerned respondent is present before the court. Therefore, in this view of the fact, let a bailable warrant be issued against the respondent concerned.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/hc-issues-bailable-warrant-against-education-secretary/articleshow/87346868.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Live-in ties more about personal autonomy than social morality: Allahabad HC||PRAYAGRAJ: Granting protection to a live-in couple, the Allahabad high court on Tuesday said that “live-in relationships have become part and parcel of life and are required to be viewed from the lens of personal autonomy rather than the notions of social morality”. While disposing of two separate petitions filed by interfaith live-in couples, a division bench comprising Justice Pritinker Diwaker and Justice Ashutosh Srivastava observed, “Live-in relationships have become part and parcel of life and stand approved by the apex court. The live-in relationship is required to be viewed from the lens of personal autonomy arising out of the right to live guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, rather than notions of social morality.” The Article 21 of the Constitution of India guarantees protection of life and personal liberty. The two couples had filed separate petitions alleging that the family of the girls were interfering in the day-to-day life of the petitioners. One was filed by Shayara Khatun and her partner of Kushi Nagar (both major in live-in relationship with each other since last more than two years) and another was filed by Zeenat Parveen and her partner of Meerut (both major and in live-in relationship since last one year). It was also stated that they approached the concerned police authorities, but the police authorities did not extend any help and consequently, they claimed that their life and liberty was undermined. Hence, they filed the present writ petition before the high court. The court, at the outset, underscored that the right to life enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India is liable to be protected at all costs and held that the police authorities were obligated to protect the rights of the petitioners. Therefore, the court in its order dated October 26, directed that in the event the petitioners approach the concerned police authorities complaining of any threat to their life and liberty, the police authorities concerned shall perform their duties as expected from them under law.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/live-in-ties-more-about-personal-autonomy-than-social-morality-hc/articleshow/87346877.cms||---

Gangurde told TOI that the operation was performed on Thursday morning and lasted for over one-and-half hours. “We undertook a laryngoscopy procedure to take out the foreign body stuck in the cricopharynx, a region just above the trachea. The patient was put on general anaesthesia. Her condition is stable and she is recovering at the hospital,” he added. The surgeon said that the girl, while playing at her home on Wednesday evening, had accidentally swallowed a Re one coin. “She started having throat pain and had difficulty in breathing. Her parents brought her to the civil hospital and the X-Ray showed that the coin was stuck in the cricopharynx . She was kept under observation in the paediatric ward of the hospital last night,” he said further. He added that he coin could not be on Wednesday as the girl’s stomach was not empty and hence anaesthesia could not be administered. She had eaten food and water at home before swallowing the coin while playing. Nashik civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat congratulated Dr Gangurde and the team for successfully extracting the coin from the girl’s throat. “I would appeal to parents to be extra vigilant when their children play with small objects,” stressed Dr Gangurde.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-doctors-remove-coin-stuck-in-girls-throat/articleshow/87343097.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Drunk’ bizwoman who hit barricade on Marine Drive injuring cop gets bail||MUMBAI: A businesswoman who rammed her car into a barricade, injuring a cop, during checking on Marine Drive earlier this month allegedly while driving drunk has got bail. She had fled from the spot, but the number plate had broken and fallen there. Additional sessions judge U J More granted bail to Zahra Alamgir Thakur, the proprietor of a cake shop in south Mumbai, on personal bond of Rs 50,000 and the conditions that she should not leave the country, present herself at Marine Drive police station three times a week till the filing of chargesheet, and not contact any witnesses or complainant. On October 9, at around 4am constables Aatish Kamble and Sagar Shedge were on nakabandi duty opposite Intercontinental Hotel on Marine Drive. They had put barricades and were randomly checking passing vehicles when a car suddenly came in at high speed, hit the barricade and zoomed away. “The car fled towards Mafatlal junction but the number plate broke and fell there. Shedge immediately informed the control room,” said an officer. The Nagpada patrolling van intercepted Thakur’s car and brought her to Marine Drive police station, where she is said to have told police that she was drunk and had been driving. “The police took her to JJ hospital, took her blood samples to find out the percentage of alcohol in her blood, and arrested her. Now she has been granted bail and we are still waiting for her blood report,” said Vishwanath Kalekar, senior inspector of Marine Drive police station. Thakur was booked under IPC section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), for rash and negligent driving, under sections of the motor vehicles Act, and the Bombay prohibition Act. The police claimed an accident case registered early this year by Gamdevi police is pending against Thakur. The incident brought to mind the infamous 2010 case when a drunk Nooriya Haveliwala, then 27, drove into people while trying to avoid a barricade, killing a policeman and a biker and injuring three others. When Thakur’s car hit the heavy barricade, it fell on constable Kamble, who was badly injured. He was rushed to GT hospital and treated, said the police. Granting Thakur bail on October 15, the judge said: “It is settled law that jail is an exception and bail is the rule. No purpose will be sufficed by keeping her behind bars as there is nothing to recover from her and she has been in jail since October 9 and, hence, bail is allowed.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-drunk-bizwoman-who-hit-barricade-on-marine-drive-injuring-cop-gets-bail/articleshow/87346886.cms||Ahmed Ali

On October 7, the principal of the college in question had suspended the student for one week for representing the institution in a political forum, without seeking approval of the management. Citing the rules of the college, the principal suspended the student. The principal then ordered the student, along with his parents, to attend an inquiry that was conducted by the former and members of the management on October 16. In addition to the student who was suspended, seven others from the college too had been associated with the political forum, and were asked to sign an undertaking. The principal accused the suspended student of threatening him, and abusing him on social media following his suspension. Taking a stern view of his actions against the principal, the management decided to dismiss the student from the college. The college principal said that both police and the Belthangady MLA were aware of the incident, adding that the institution’s alumni too had approved of the decision. However, representatives of the Campus Front of India visited the office of the deputy director of pre-university education, seeking action. The college is also expected to submit a detailed report to the pre-university education department about the incident.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/dismissed-pu-student-protests-seeking-revocation-of-order/articleshow/87345299.cms||---

The workers of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana in Sangli and Satara have taken to the streets demanding that the mills announce the amount they will pay the farmers. Most of the mills have not announced the prices though they have already started cutting and crushing the sugar cane. The angry farmers are now stopping sugar cane-laden vehicles tractors from reaching the mills by releasing the air from the tyres of the trolleys and tractors. Mahesh Kharade, the Sangli district president of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, said, “Most of the mills in Kolhapur district have announced that they will pay as per the FRP. Why are the mills in other districts not doing the same? We have appealed to the farmers to not let the mills cut the sugar cane if they do not give an assurance regarding the payment.” “We will keep obstructing the vehicles if the impasse continues. We have called a meeting of sugar mill representatives to make them agree to pay the FRP amount in a single installment as per law,” Kharade said. A meeting between farmers and mill representatives took place in Satara on Wednesday but ended without any resolution. The farmers’ representatives have threatened to sit on dharna outside the mills if the mills do not declare the prices. In the past few days, the sugar cane transport to the Krishna factory in Karad has been stopped. The cane crushed at mills in Satara and Sangli has a lower recovery rate when compared to the sugar cane crushed in the mills in the Kolhapur district. The mills in Kolhapur district are, therefore, in a good financial position to pay as per the FRP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/sangli-satara-farmers-want-sugar-mills-to-pay-as-per-frp/articleshow/87343119.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Tourists take bullock carts to Ajanta||AURANGABAD: Tourists visiting Ajanta and Ellora caves had to cover a distance of nearly 4km on bullock carts on Thursday to reach the world heritage sites due to the MSRTC strike hitting bus services. The guides said the tourists suffering from backache and other ailments preferred to walk to the caves from the parking area. The guides came up with the idea of using bullock carts to ferry tourists and hired the ones belonging to the farmers. Tourist guide association’s president Amol Basole told TOI, “This is the second time in past few years that tourists had to opt for bullock carts to reach Ajanta. Tourists did sit in the bullock carts, but very few of them could complete the ride due to poor conditions of roads.” Another guide Rizwan Shaikh said the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation should have a backup. “Due to this strike, the number of tourists has come down dramatically,” he said and suggested that electric buses should be operated. The archaeology department refused to comment on the issue. ‘Lodge complaint if pvt operators overcharge’  Kolhapur RTO has asked passengers to register complaints if they are overcharged by private bus operators. Complaints can be registered on helpline 022-62426666, emailed to dycommr.ent2@gmail.com or on www.transportcomplaints.mahaonline.com.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/tourists-take-bullock-carts-to-ajanta/articleshow/87343117.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Three people — Anil Bandivadar, Shashi Vadar, Rajesh Meherwade from Belagavi district in Karanataka — have been arrested so far. The police claim the local handlers too will be arrested soon. Shailesh Balkawade, district superintendent of police, said, “The accused used to steal mobile phones from crowded places. They then took the phones (mostly smartphones) to Karanataka and change the software, crack the pin codes and refurbish them. Such refurbished smartphones are sold in Karanataka and Kolhapur. They have a well-developed network. Both departments have been working on the case for the past 15 days.” One of the accused had come to Kolhapur to sell the smartphones. The police received a tip-off, set a trap, and arrested him. Upon inquiry, the police learned about the location of the smartphones sold in Karanataka. The police recovered 34 mobile phones, worth Rs 3.8 lakh from him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/inter-state-phone-theft-racket-busted/articleshow/87343120.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid-19 in Delhi: Immunity, maybe; herd mentality? Definitely not||NEW DELHI: Has Delhi achieved herd immunity against Covid-19? The results of the latest serosurvey says 97% of the sampled population showed the presence of antibodies against Covid, raising hopes that the city has reached an important stage in the fight against the coronavirus. However, public health specialists are wary of making any such declaration yet. Dr Neeraj Nischal, associate professor of medicine, AIIMS, said, “Covid remains an enigma despite it being around for two years. Delhi’s serosurvey results look promising, but it is too early to declare herd immunity. This virus is new and has shown it can mutate quickly into more transmissible variants.” Herd immunity occurs when a large portion of the population becomes immune to a disease, making infection from person to person unlikely. As a result, says Mayo Clinic of the US, the whole community becomes protected, not just those who are immune. Immunity can be developed through natural infection and vaccination. Delhi has already undergone two peaks of infection since March last year. Therefore, the experts say, it is likely that many Delhiites have developed antibodies against the virus through natural infection. Also, nearly 48% of the city’s adult population is fully vaccinated and 86% have received at least one dose of the vaccine. However, a senior doctor said one doesn’t know how long the immunity provided by natural infection or vaccination lasts. Dr Nandini Sharma, director-professor of community medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College, opined, “The serosurvey before the second wave showed 56% of the surveyed population had Covid antibodies. Many people thought this would help prevent a serious spike in infection. But we know what happened. Therefore, it would be better to err on the side of caution than be complacent about the risk of infection.” Scientists from NCDC, CSIR-IGIB and ASIR analysed the community samples from Delhi from the previous outbreak in November 2020 until May this year. They found that after the peak last November, new cases ebbed significantly before rising in January. The rise in cases coincided with the increase in the detection of B.1.17, or the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2. However, the researchers said, the real rise in cases began April onwards when the prevalence of B.1.617 (Kappa variant) and its sub-lineage B.1.617.2 (Delta variant) went up. Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder director, Ujala Cygnus Group of hospitals, said recently that newer sub-variants of the Delta variant had appeared in certain parts of the country. “Travel between states and even countries have picked up. So, the risk of a newer variant spreading and causing a spike in cases cannot be ruled out completely,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/immunity-maybe-herd-mentality-definitely-not/articleshow/87345648.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Advocate Virendra Kumar Sharma, representing Hasan, Firoz and Azhar in the case, had filed a discharge application before the court on October 25. Special public prosecutor Mohanlal Vishnoi said the matter was heard by the special MP/MLA court and the discharge application was rejected. The case will now be heard on December 2. Veteran SP leader Azam Khan had also reportedly filed a discharge application in the case earlier and the court rejected that, too. Notably, the complainant, Mustafa Hussain, a resident of Civil Lines in Rampur, had moved the MP/MLA court and had sought for collection of voice samples from the viral video of the incident to ascertain its authenticity. The court had granted permission, following which, the voice samples were sent to the forensics in Lucknow in August. As per the forensic report, the voice samples were matched and verified to be that of the SP MP. Hasan was produced before the court in September. An FIR was registered at Rampur Civil Lines police station in 2019 against Azam Khan, his son Abdullah, Hasan, Firoz, Azhar and another person under various IPC sections for making "inappropriate statements" against Jaya Prada during a poll meeting in Moradabad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/jaya-prada-objectionable-remark-casecourt-rejects-sp-mps-discharge-plea/articleshow/87345572.cms||Maria Khan

Madhusudan Hulgi, MDA vice-chairman, said, “Garbage was found strewn around the temples located in New Moradabad’s Sector 16 on Delhi road and Sector 13. Despite repeated warnings to residents, no one paid any heed and we had to lock the two temples. The action was taken in order to create awareness among residents regarding cleanliness and to also send out a message that action will be taken if they do not keep their surrounding areas clean.” The MDA officials said three days ago, during an inspection, garbage was found littered in the area around the temples, following which they were locked. Officials said several residents staged protests against the MDA’s action. The temples were thrown open on Thursday and prayers were offered in the premises.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/as-locals-fail-to-keep-surroundings-clean-authorities-lock-reopen-2-temples-in-mbad/articleshow/87345621.cms||Maria Khan
---||Kolkata||Iconic New Market eatery gets ready to serve heady mix of novelty and nostalgia||KOLKATA: For food lovers in the city, there is a chance to travel back in time and enjoy Nizam’s beef kathi kebabs, khiri kathi kebabs and beef rolls as the restaurant is reopening its beef counter on Friday after a gap of 13 years. “We got multiple requests from old timers to reopen our beef counter and bring back the authentic dishes. So we have decided to restart the beef section, with traditional dishes along with some new dishes from Turkey, Kazakhstan,” said Samar Nag, chairman of Nizam’s Restaurant. He added that there will be a separate kitchen and a separate sitting space for beef lovers in the restaurant as they don’t want to hurt anybody’s sentiment. The outlet was founded by Sheikh Hassan Raza in 1932 and named it after his son Sheikh Nizamuddin. In colonial Calcutta, the ‘sahibs’ would often visit the joint late at night for kabab-paratha after a movie at Light House or New Empire. However, they found it somewhat troublesome to eat the kebabs with their hands. To make their life easier, the shop devised a way to package the meat into the paratha and wrapped it up neatly in paper so that the ‘sahibs’ don’t soil their fingers. And hence Nizam’s kathi roll was born. Luminaries like Amitabh Bachchan, Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Nawab of Pataudi with wife Sharmila Tagore frequented the restaurant. Singer Kabir Suman in his song ‘Prothom Shobkichu’ wrote about his experience at Nizam — “Prothombar Nizame giye kabab bhorpet”. Talking to TOI, he said: “Nizam can be best described as a way of life. It gave us a free, homely environment along with delicious scrumptious meals at a pocket-friendly price.” Nizam’s beef rolls and cricket and football matches enjoyed a long relationship. Retired government employee Swapan Chanda and his group of friends during the 60s would pick up hot beef kathi rolls from Nizam’s before a football match between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal. His son, Subhajit has heard stories of Nizam but had not got a chance to taste its beef dishes. He promises to visit the restaurant soon. Thirty-six year old Sourabh Mitra, an engineer, who now lives in Brunei, shares his memories of Nizam. “We used to bunk school and watch movies at Light House and then enjoy Nizam’s paratha and beef bhuna as it was very cheap,”said Mitra, adding that the next time he is in the city, he will make a point to visit Nizam. Food blogger Indrajit Lahiri welcomed Nizam’s decision to reopen the beef counter. He said, “It is great news for every Calcuttan that Nizam is again back to its roots with authentic beef items.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/iconic-new-market-eatery-gets-ready-to-serve-heady-mix-of-novelty-and-nostalgia/articleshow/87345576.cms||Dipawali Mitra

The Vani police said the woman, who had been to a medical store to buy some medicines at 11 pm on Wednesday night, met an acquaintance near the ST bus stand at Vani. While the two were talking, four men approached them and forcibly dragged the woman away to a dark spot near the bus stop. They gang-raped the woman and beat up the man she had been talking to. The man, however, managed to run to the police station and alert the police. A team of police officials rushed to the location while a couple of other teams were dispatched to various areas in search of the offenders. According to the police, they found an unattended two-wheeler a little distance away from the spot. The cops decided to keep an eye on the same. After an hour, a man returned to the spot to get the vehicle and the police caught him. Initially, he refused to cooperate but eventually spilled the beans. His three accomplices were then arrested. All of them were presented in front of the local court that remanded them in police custody till November 1. The police said that all the four men involved in the incident have been arrested and the cases under section 376 of the IPC have been booked.

Schools said that with one to two first semester exam papers remaining, they decided to stick to their plans of closing for the Diwali vacations from November 1. Schools have also been told to open earlier, on November 11 (instead of November 22), and get students ready for the National Achievement Survey (NAS). Slated for November 12, the test is meant to gauge what students of classes III, V, VIII and X have grasped during online classes. Schools will be randomly selected, and a maximum of 30 students from each will take the test. In Mumbai, only students of classes VIII and X can take the test. Teachers’ unions have written to the centre to postpone it to November-end. Shivnath Darade, secretary of the Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Parishad, said teachers and students are travelling outside the city for Diwali. It is unlikely they will return before November 11.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-push-national-test-to-end-of-nov-teachers-write-to-govt/articleshow/87346925.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt members have declared me guilty of graft, says NCB officer Sameer Wankhede||MUMBAI: The HC bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal on Thursday told the state to show some “deference” to an officer of Sameer Wankhede’s rank. Wankhede’s petition said, “The material on record shows that members of the ruling regime/government in the state of Maharashtra, including but not limited to a sitting minister of the present state government and members of the political party (which forms part of government), have unleashed an open tirade against the petitioner and has/have already “pronounced a decision” through television interviews, Twitter and other social media that the petitioner is guilty of offences of corruption and hence any “investigation” conducted by any state agency will be vitiated by mala fides, and would be a gross abuse of the principles of a free and fair investigation, if not an institutionalized persecution by the state.” It further said, “The mala fides, malice and ulterior motives for harming the petitioner by implicating him in false cases is reflected by the repeated statements being made by politicians, including ministers in the state government, to the extent of making wild and reckless allegations involving the family members of the petitioner, including his father and his sister.” Senior counsel Atul Nanda, with advocate Ramiza Hakim, appearing for Wankhede, told court he is the zonal director of NCB and is investigating a case. “He is not a drug peddler,” Nanda said. The state has also set up a special investigation team (SIT) to probe Wankhede on some allegations. Nanda said either the CBI or NIA should conduct a probe, but the vilification has to be stopped. “I am being personally attacked by the state. My apprehension is that the state will arrest me any day. I want interim protection in the form of no coercive relief,” said Nanda to the HC, adding “I see a design in the posts against me. I am consciously not taking any names because I want to keep the majesty of the law.” He cited Section 17A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which, he said, provides prior sanction be taken from the Centre in case of central government officials, and yet the state has set up the SIT to investigate him. The HC asked Nanda, “If the statute itself protects you, why do you want protection from the court?” Nanda replied that under the law, the state cannot probe and “if the state is violating its duty and overstepping, the court may step in and protect me if my rights are likely to be violated. They may arrest me today.” Pai said, “The petition is premature. We have received four applications, which are also against private individuals, including a witness, Kiran Gosavi. We are just doing a preliminary enquiry. So far we have not registered any FIR against Wankhede.” When HC asked the PP on rights under Section 17 A, Pai replied, “We are conducting an inquiry against the private person Gosavi. Don’t know what comes of it. He (Wankhede) is asking for a blanket protection. I need time to answer.” Pai said Section 17 A will come into picture when an FIR is filed. The HC asked, “What is the sequitur of that?” The PP said, “It is very difficult for Maharashtra state to make any statement.” She took time again to confer with the officers in court. Pai finally said the state will give a 72-hour notice to Wankhede in a Prevention of Corruption Act case. Nanda said his apprehension was the state may then arrest Wankhede in an IPC case, and the petition would be infructuous. The HC bench looked at the PP and said that was a point. Nanda said notice be given for “3 clear working days” to enable his client to approach an appropriate forum. HC asked him if he had responded to summons he had got . Nanda said he had attended and was quizzed by NCB (which is doing a separate vigilance inquiry) for 3 hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-govt-members-have-declared-me-guilty-of-graft/articleshow/87345612.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik-Mumbai NH stretch is now pothole-free: NHAI||NASHIK: The Nashik division of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has said that the Nashik-Mumbai National Highway has been repaired and is now pothole-free. The 96km stretch from Vadape in Thane district to Gande in Igatpuri, which is a part of the busy Mumbai-Agra National Highway, was battered by the heavy rain during the monsoon and had developed many potholes that were inconveniencing the motorists. Last month, the Bombay high court had expressed concern about the road’s poor condition. Even the road users were critical of the NHAI as the travel time between Nashik and Mumbai had increased considerably due to the road’s bad condition Talking to TOI, Nashik division NHAI project director B S Salunke said that a total of 83,000 sqm of the Nashik-Mumbai highway was severely damaged, including the Kasara ghat section in Igatpuri in Nashik district. “The contractor, entrusted with the upkeep of the road has now completely repaired the damaged areas of the road. The contractor has also undertaken soil stabilisation work on the damaged sections to strengthen the road,” added Salunke. Both Nashik district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal and the Nashik highway police confirmed that the condition of the road is now satisfactory. Bhujbal, who frequently travels between Nashik and Mumbai, had chaired a meeting of the NHAI authorities in the third week of September and had set a deadline of October 15 to complete the repair works. “The road is now in good condition. I inspected it in the second week of this month and found no potholes. Some minor work is still being carried out, but the overall condition of the road is satisfactory,” said Bhujbal. The Nashik highway police said that with the road condition improving, vehicles are travelling at a much faster pace. “We have requested the NHAI to put up rumblers at some stretches of the road to reduce the speed of vehicles and prevent mishaps,” added the highway police officials. Nashik city MP Hemant Godse said that although the NHAI has undertaken the repairs, it must ensure that the condition of the road does not deteriorate in case there are more showers. “Commuters have had to bear the brunt of the bad road over the past couple of months. The NHAI must ask the contractor to maintain it properly as this road connects two important cities in the state,” said Godse.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-mumbai-nh-stretch-is-now-pothole-free-nhai/articleshow/87343158.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Agra||Agra: Sons from poor families, kin in Valley worry about future, careers||AGRA: Families of three civil engineering students from Kashmir who were arrested in Agra and booked under charges of sedition for allegedly cheering Pakistan’s win in the T-20 cricket match against India have appealed to the authorities to “show mercy” and not take away their sons’ “only chance at education and better lives”. The three pupils belong to humble backgrounds and were studying on a special PM scholarship for J&K students at Raja Balwant Singh (RBS) Engineering Technical Institute in Agra. All of them are first-generation college students with hopes and aspirations of their families pinned on them. “If my nephew has done anything wrong, please forgive him. We are very poor. We can’t do anything except apologise,” said the uncle of the 21-year-old student who is in his final year of civil engineering. The relative said the family had just celebrated the boy’s placement at an MNC. The student’s father, a farm labourer in Bandipora in north Kashmir, told TOI that he last spoke to his son on Wednesday and was left numb at the turn of events. “He was crying on the phone. He said, ‘Baba (father), we do not understand what we will do…” The 56-year-old said the authorities should give the students “a chance to correct their mistake”. “He has been studying in Agra since 2017 and has not been involved in any anti-national activity. He was often praised by his teachers. He had got placed in a big company and our future was secured,” he said, adding that the family won’t be able to afford legal fees. “The boy’s sister, an ophthalmic assistant, said it was “shocking” that a cricket match had ruined her brother’s career. The families also said they have been trying to reach UP police for information on their kin. Uncle of one of the arrested students, who is a J&K police officer, said he tried to get information about the 20-year-old from his counterparts in UP, but to no avail. “My nephew has two younger sisters to take care of since his father passed away several years ago. The family in Budgam had high hopes for him. We regret whatever happened. I urge PM Narendra Modi to give him a chance.” The father of the third student — a 20-year-old in his third year — said he doesn’t know where to go to get his son released. “I managed to speak to him after his suspension via his classmate and he seemed very scared. But I’m helpless,” said the father, a carpenter. College records show the students to be first division holders in class 12 who were “performing well” in college. The fate of the scholarship that funded the students also hangs in balance now. Director (administration) Pankaj Gupta told TOI that a report on the matter has been sent to the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). “Further action will be taken according to the directions we receive,” he said. The Prime Minister’s Special Scholarship Scheme (PMSSS) is given to meritorious class 12 students from Jammu, Kashmir & Ladakh. All three students funded under the scheme were getting Rs 1.22 lakh annually by AICTE to cover tuition, hostel and mess charges. The scheme has an upper limit of Rs 1.25 lakh. In the RBS Engineering Technical Institute campus in Agra, the scholarship is funding 11 Kashmiri students at present.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/sons-from-poor-families-kin-in-valley-worry-about-future-careers/articleshow/87345598.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Of this, 400kg was seized from godowns in central Kolkata's Jorasanko. The seizure has crossed last year’s haul. “Prosecutions will be stepped up and will include stopping entry of crackers into the city and taking action against local sellers. We are also trying to create awareness about the Apex court and NGT guidelines by talking to residents’ associations and making them aware of the legal implications of bursting banned crackers,” said a joint CP. Cases have been registered under the Explosives Act. Those who are caught bursting crackers will be kept in custody and taken to court for bail, an officer said. Environmentalists, though, said there was a gap between what Lalbazar planned and what it implemented. “Nothing significant has been obtained from the multiple FIRs registered last year,” said a spokesperson of NGO Sabuj Sathi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/firecracker-seizure-crosses-1900kg-in-run-up-to-diwali/articleshow/87345590.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh health department proposes opening of hospitals in public private partnership mode||CHANDIGARH: In view of the large number of patients coming from adjoining states, UT health department has submitted a proposal to establish hospitals in public private partnership (PPP) mode to NITI Ayog. “The existing health infrastructure in Chandigarh is of excellent quality but inadequate because of pressure from adjoining states. About 70% to 80 % patients in case of Covid, dengue and malaria issues from adjoining areas,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg. Published medical literature suggests that most of the tertiary and secondary care services are being utilised by people who are middle class and above. The PPP model can include services for profit and not for profit private sector in tertiary and secondary healthcare. The city has 11 multi-speciality and super-speciality private hospitals, 19 private nursing homes and 224 private health practitioners. There are 20 doctors per 10,000 population. Part of the services may be subisidised but to make the project feasible, the concession will not be high and not in all services. “The administration will invite bids from reputed hospitals. We will provide land and whoever agrees to share better revenue will get the deal. It is a totally transparent bidding process. However, minimum revenue is to be paid to the administration, eligibility criteria and terms and conditions finalisation is a time consuming and sensitive issue,” said the health secretary. Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) has an 8.3 acre hospital plot at Rajiv Gandhi Technology Park. It was put to auction in 2017 but couldn't be sold with the reserve price of Rs 344 crore. It has been identified for the PPP model. “Besides good private hospitals on PPP basis, we also need to have better health infrastructure in adjoining areas/states to reduce the pressure on Chandigarh. We have written to Niti Ayog and are trying to get some reputed transaction adviser firm to assist,” said Garg.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ut-health-dept-proposes-opening-of-hospitals-in-ppp-mode/articleshow/87345616.cms||Shimona Kanwar

In 75,416 cases, the first dose of Covishield vaccine was administered more than 16 weeks ago but the second dose is still pending. In 110 cases where Covaxin was administered more than six weeks ago, the second dose is pending. “Considering that festival season is going on and there are more possibilities of virus spreading, we should get the vaccination done prior to Diwali positively. However, it should be ensured that the second dose of the same vaccine is taken as per the first dose,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg. Primarily, Covishield vaccine is being administered in Chandigarh but in some cases, private hospitals have administered a few doses of Covaxin also. The health department has contacted these pending beneficiaries on the registered mobile number and a drive has been undertaken to administer the second dose in all the overdue cases. “The UT administration has sufficient number of vaccines and there is no waiting time to get vaccination either for the first dose or for the second dose,” said Garg. He added, “Persons who have got first dose from Chandigarh and then went to other places may get their second dose from anywhere in India and should not delay it further for their return to Chandigarh.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/second-covid-vaccine-dose-overdue-in-over-70k-cases/articleshow/87345640.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Pune police to register fresh FIR against Kiran Gosavi||PUNE: The 2018 cheating case in Pune against Kiran Gosavi was registered by Faraskhana police. Gosavi had gone into hiding after NCP minister Nawab Malik said he had several criminal cases lodged against him. Gosavi’s selfie with Aryan Khan had gone viral on social media soon after the October 2 cruise drug bust. Police had since renewed their effort to trace and arrest him and had issued a lookout notice for him on October 13. Gupta said, “The 2018 case apart, we will register a fresh FIR relating to complainant Chinmay Deshmukh’s claim that Gosavi had then threatened and abused him to ensure withdrawal of case. Police could not register this case against Gosavi then. He is also suspected to have cheated other young job aspirants in Pune. We have asked them to come forward and lodge complaints.” He added, “We will also investigate Gosavi’s transactions through an export-import business and an NGO, ‘Stop Crime’, which he claims to operate from Ghatkopar.” Judicial magistrate R K Bafna-Bhalgat remanded Gosavi in police custody till November 5. On the court’s permission, police inspector Shabbir Sayyed submitted a non-bailable warrant had been issued against Gosavi on March 29, 2019 and a local court had proclaimed him as an absconder on April 5, 2019. The police had then filed a chargesheet against Gosavi and his aide, Shaerbanu Mohammed Irfan Qureshi, on April 25, 2019. Assistant public prosecutor Varsha Alekar argued that police had added charges related to forgery against Gosavi and sought sufficient time for police to investigate the case. Gosavi’s lawyer, Sachin Kumbhar, pleaded for magisterial custody. A couple of days ago, the Pune police had sent a team to Lucknow in search of Gosavi after he had surfaced in a video clip on social media to present his “version” of why he had gone into hiding. “He would switch off his phone once he got on to a train and would activate it only for limited use,” a police officer pointed out. Gosavi is facing three other cheating cases — two at Kapurbawdi in Thane and one at Andheri. On October 18, police arrested Gosavi’s aide Qureshi from Govandi. She is accused of uploading material related to Gosavi’s ventures on sites and accepting money, police said.  Meanwhile, a team from Kelwe police in Palghar will be heading to Pune to get custody of Gosavi in a case registered last week for allegedly cheating two youths, Utkarsh Tare and Adarsh Kini, from Edwan village by promising them jobs in Malaysia and taking Rs 1.65 lakh in December 2018. -With inputs from Sandhya Nair||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-pune-police-to-register-a-fresh-fir-against-gosavi/articleshow/87345656.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Mumbai||Non-bailable warrant issued against ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh by Thane court||THANE: A court here has issued a non-bailable warrant against IPS officer Param Bir Singh in a case of extortion registered against him and 28 others, including multiple cops and gangster Ravi Pujari. In an order issued on Tuesday, chief judicial magistrate, Thane, R J Tamble directed the senior inspector of the Thane Nagar police station to arrest Singh and produce him before court. The Mumbai crime branch has filed an application before the 37th metropolitan magistrate court seeking a non-bailable warrant against Singh in another extortion case it is probing against him. The court will hear the matter on Saturday. Singh has not responded to several summons issued to him. An FIR was registered based on a complaint by Ketan Tanna, a 54-year-old builder, against Singh and 28 others for extortion and other crimes. Tanna alleged that when Singh was the Thane police commissioner between January 2018 and February 2019, the accused extorted Rs 1.3 crore from him by summoning him to the office of the Anti-Extortion Cell and threatening to frame him in serious criminal cases. He claimed they also extorted over Rs 3 crore from his friend and alleged bookie Sonu Jalan. This is the second FIR registered in Thane against Singh; the earlier one was registered at Kopri police station. Among the accused in this case are present and past police officers, including DCP Deepak Devraj, retired ACP N T Kadam, ex-cop Pradeep Sharma, inspector Rajkumar Kothmire, and gangster Pujari. Ankit Bhanushali, Vikas Dabhade and Binu Varghese, who allegedly served as middlemen and agents linked to cops in the Thane city police commissionerate, are also named. A senior police officer with access to the SIT probing the case said statements of over 100 people have been recorded. “We had made submissions before the court pertaining to the case, after which the non-bailable warrant was issued,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-nbw-issued-for-param-bir-by-thane-court/articleshow/87346947.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Meerut||After crop damage by rain, hailstorm, west UP farmers await official assessment to get relief||MEERUT/BIJNOR: The recent spell of heavy rainfall and hailstorm has caused widespread destruction of crops across western Uttar Pradesh. While chief minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered officials to assess damage to crops to compensate farmers for losses, assessment is yet to begin at many places. The maximum damage has been suffered by paddy crop. The other crops adversely hit are mustard, black gram and sugarcane, potato and pulses. National vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu), Diwakar Singh alleged, "The Revenue department is conducting a survey of crop damage only on paper. They are not contacting farmers. Officials are preparing reports arbitrarily. They are showing 25% loss to standing paddy crop and 50% to harvested crop. Whereas, in some places, the damage is more than 70%. Paddy crop has turned black. Heavy moisture has distorted the quality of the grain." The authorities, however, have refuted the charge. In Saharanpur’s Tehsil Behat area, the rain has severely affected paddy and other crops in 13 villages along the banks of the Yamuna. It is estimated that about 2,500 hectares of paddy crop has been destroyed in the area. For farmers in the area, the cumulative loss could be about Rs 1.5 crore, say experts. Their estimation is based on the fact that around 7,500 quintals of paddy is produced in this stretch. According to farmers in the area, over 50% of their paddy crop was standing in the fields and has been totally damaged. The affected villages are Sheikhpura, Mirpur Kadim, Majhari, Nuniyari, Jodhebans, Dhaulra, Araji Jodiyo, Nanauli, Alauddinpur, Tatohal, Baharampur Kansepur, Faizabad and Sherpur Pelo. Apart from paddy, mustard, black gram and sugarcane crops have also been adversely affected by the weekend rain and hailstorm. It is not just the natural calamity which has hit them, say farmers of Behat, the delay in procurement of paddy has aggravated their losses. “Our paddy couldn’t be sold in Haryana, which is the nearest mandi, and there is no purchase centre in Saharanpur, which is why most of the crop is yet to be harvested. Most of the farmers in this area have taken loans for agriculture inputs. There is no timely help from the government,” said Mahipal Singh, a farmer from Behat. The Saharanpur district administration has started the survey of the area. “We have a tentative estimate of crop loss but an exact figure of loss can only be shared once each plot is surveyed. This may take another one week,” said sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Behat, Deepti Dev. In Amroha district, paddy was cultivated in over 26,000 hectares. Here, too, farmers estimate 50% crop damage. Pulses sown across 2,000 hectares, potato in 5,000 hectares and mustard in 1,200 hectares have also suffered major damages. “Those who had grown vegetables have lost everything to the heavy rainfall,” said Ganpat Singh, a farmer from Amroha’s Nagaliya village. In Bijnor district, paddy was cultivated across 60,000 hectares of land while pulses and mustard was grown in 20,000 hectares. But the over 200 mm of rainfall in the last 10 days has left a trail of destruction. Bijnor district agriculture officer Avdhesh Kumar Mishra said, “Of the 11 blocks in the district, the crop loss in Nagina, Jajilpur and Afjalgarh was assessed between 30% and 33%. In other blocks, the crop damage was 25%. The farmers whose crops were damaged above 33% are entitled to get compensation. However, a survey is still going on."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/after-crop-damage-by-rain-hailstorm-west-up-farmers-await-official-assessment-to-get-relief/articleshow/87345658.cms||Ishita Mishra

The girl claimed that a couple she came in contact with assured her of a Rs 12,000 per month job, but forced her into flesh trade. The girl was later handed over to a child line team. Acting swiftly on the girl’s complaint, raids were conducted in an area under Majhola police station and three people were arrested from a house. On Thursday, SP Moradabad Amit Kumar Anand said, “Based on the information provided by the girl, teams were formed to nab the culprits. Three people - a couple and their driver - were apprehended.

The mines department along with the deputy collector, mamlatdar and Sanguem police had conducted a site inspection at the quarry a fortnight ago based on the complaint filed by the villagers stating that four quarries were operating in the area without the department’s valid permission. Local Mariano Fernandes said that one quarry operator has threatened him and other residents if they oppose the operations. “We are not scared of threatening calls. Our agitation will last till we get justice,” Fernandes said. Villagers also alleged that blasting has caused damage to most of the houses in the locality and a temple. The structures have developed cracks. “The polluted water from the quarries has damaged our crops,” one villager said. Soon after the inspection, officials of the mines department had assured the villagers that the inspection report will be submitted to the higher authority within 10 days to initiate action. “More than a fortnight has passed, but the mines department has not yet issued a report. The operators have restarted operation in violation of the department directions,” another resident Telotin Cab said. After noticing the quarry operations with heavy machinery, villagers thronged to the deputy collector’s office demanding immediate closure. The deputy collector told TOI that instructions have been issued to police and other departments concerned to stop the activities.

After three car thefts in the last 10 days, miscreants struck again on Wednesday evening, stealing bags, laptops and cash from two cars parked in Sector 11 and Sector 5. In the first case, Dr Akash Singhal, a resident of Sector 12/A, senior resident in the department of orthopaedics, GMCH-32, Chandigarh, told the police that he parked his car in front of Burn Gym in Sector 11 at around 5.45pm and when he returned at around 7.55pm, he found the right windowpane broken. He also said that his bag containing a laptop, white coat, official documents, medicines and charger among other articles was missing. He immediately called the police and filed a written complaint. A case has been registered under Section 379 (punishment for theft) of the IPC at Sector 5 police station and further investigations are on. In the second case, Dharm Preet, a resident of Railla village in Sector 12 said he parked his Verna car (HR-03-Z-7815) in the parking lot outside Vishal Mega Mart in Sector 5 and went shopping. When he returned after one and a half hours, he found the left side rear windowpane of the car broken. A bag lying on the rear seat, containing a mobile phone, Rs 15,000 cash and ATM card, among other documents was missing from the car. He said he called the police, who registered a case under Section 379 of the IPC at Sector 5 police station. Investigation officer ASI Pritam Singh said that CCTV cameras are being scrutinised and investigation is underway. Irate Panchkula residents alleged that despite having high-end CCTV cameras in the market, police had no clue about the miscreants. They alleged that the cameras only seemed to be used to challan traffic rule violators. Police have urged residents to keep their belongings in the boot and not in the seat of their cars.

---||Delhi||Even fully vaccinated can pass on Covid at home: Study||NEW DELHI: People who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 can still readily pass on the infection in household settings. This has been confirmed by a study conducted in the UK. The study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, looked at transmission rates among 621 people with mild Covid-19 infection. The analysis found that 25% of vaccinated household contacts tested positive for Covid-19 compared with 38% of unvaccinated ones. Professor Ajit Lalvani of Imperial College London, UK, who co-led the study, said vaccines were critical to controlling the pandemic as they were very effective at preventing serious illness and death from Covid-19. However, the findings of the study showed that vaccination alone was not enough to prevent people from being infected with the delta variant and spreading it in household settings. “The ongoing transmission being seen between vaccinated people makes it essential for unvaccinated people to get the shots to protect themselves from acquiring infection and severe Covid-19, especially as more people will be spending time inside in close proximity during the winter months. We found that susceptibility to infection increased within a few months after the second vaccine dose, so those eligible for booster shots should get them promptly,” said Lalvani. While vaccinated people clear the infection more quickly, the peak viral load among them is similar to unvaccinated people, which may explain why they can still readily pass on the virus in household settings. Dr Anika Singanayagam, co-lead author of the study, said understanding the extent to which vaccinated people could pass on the delta variant to others was a public health priority. “By carrying out repeated sampling from contacts, we found that vaccinated people could pass on the infection within households, including to vaccinated members. Continued public health and social measures to curb transmission, such as wearing a mask, social distancing and testing, remain important even in vaccinated individuals,” added Singanayagam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/even-fully-vaxxed-can-pass-on-covid-at-home-study/articleshow/87345669.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The ‘Laksha kanta gayana’, mass singing event was organised as part of Karnataka Rajyotsava celebrations in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi with thousands participating in multiple events.

Dr Manish Mandal, who led the surgery team, told this reporter on Thursday that the 30-year-old patient from Darbhanga was suffering from weight loss and fever. During medical examination at the AIIMS-Patna, a large tumour was found in his liver. “The IGIMS doctors decided to removed the tumour from his liver two days ago. After remaining in the ICU for some time, the patient was shifted to a ward where he is recovering fast,” Dr Manish said. He added, “It was a rare case as all his vital organs like lungs, heart, stomach, liver and spleen were transpositioned. This was the first surgery performed by laparoscopy at the IGIMS.” Dr Sanjay Kumar, Dr Nishant Kurian, and Dr Venkat Rao were also part of the surgery team.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/in-a-rare-surgery-igims-doctors-remove-tumour-from-mans-liver/articleshow/87344325.cms||---
---||Delhi||Anti-depressant may cut Covid hospitalisation risk||NEW DELHI: A low cost drug used commonly to treat depression and obsessive compulsive disorder has been found useful in reducing by a third the risk of prolonged hospitalisation of Covid-19 patients. A study published in The Lancet Global Health named this drug as Fluvoxamine, which was given to 741 Covid patients in Brazil as part of a randomised trial to investigate the efficacy of eight repurposed treatments for the infection. The trial of the eight treatments began in June 2020, with the fluvoxamine section beginning in January 2021 on Brazilian adults who were symptomatic, had tested positive for Covid-19, were unvaccinated and had at least one additional criterion for high risk. The researchers said 741 participants were given 100mg of fluvoxamine twice daily for 10 days while 756 others received a placebo. Four weeks later, when the data on hospitalisation among the two groups was analysed, it was found that of the 741 who received the drug, 79 (11%) required a stay of more than six hours in an emergency setting or hospitalisation. Comparably, 119 (16%) of the 756 participants who received the placebo required a similar extended stay in hospital settings. These results demonstrated a reduction in the risk of prolonged hospitalisation or emergency care in 5% of the participants with a relative risk reduction of 32%, the researchers claimed. Although mortality was not a primary outcome of the study, in a secondary “per protocol” analysis of patients who took at least 80% of medication doses, there was one death in the fluvoxamine group compared with 12 in the placebo group. “Our results are consistent with earlier, smaller trials. Given fluvoxamine’s safety, tolerability, ease of use, low cost, and widespread availability, these findings may have an important influence on national and international guidelines on clinical management of Covid,” Dr Gilmar Reis, co-principal investigator, told the medical journal. Dr Shamsher Dwivedee, director, clinical services, VIMHANS, said the structure of the study was robust but it was too early to say whether the drug was a game changer in Covid management. “It may be a promising start but is still not a eureka moment,” he said. Dwivedee said monoclonal antibodies developed for Covid remain the most promising drugs so far. Recently, the World Health Organization included this in its latest guideline for treating Covid patients with mild as well as severe symptoms. Monoclonal antibodies were used for treating former US president Donald Trump.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/anti-depressant-may-cut-covid-hospitalisation-risk/articleshow/87345728.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Civic officials said the administration will have to undertake restructuring of wards that will have to be increased from 31 to 48, as three members need to be elected from one ward. “Earlier, we had started restructuring wards on the basis of a total 122 corporators. We were in the process to prepare a draft of three-member wards. But after the state government’s decision, the number of corporators in the civic body will increase to 142. Hence, we will now have to start the work right from the beginning,” an NMC official said. “Apart from corporators the number of wards will also increase. We will start the work on restructuring of wards soon after the government’s decision,” he added. Civic polls in Nashik are due early next year. Ajay Boraste, leader of the opposition in the civic body, said, “The strength of corporators in the civic body will increase further by 20 members. Hence, this will provide opportunities to many aspirants to serve the citizens,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/no-of-nmc-corporators-to-rise-to-142/articleshow/87343233.cms||Tushar Pawar

The 45-year-old wanted to order a bottle of wine as a birthday present for her sister. She looked up phone numbers of liquor shops online and dialled one of the listed numbers. The frauster introduced himself as an employee at the liquor store. “The accused asked her to pay a sum of Rs 1,500. He also got her to pay a sum of Rs17,051 as processing fees. But he claimed that the money had not been received due to a technical error and made her repay the amount a second time,” said a police officer. When the woman demanded a refund, the accused sent her a link and asked her to fill in her bank details. She did as she was instructed, following which she lost another Rs 34,102. She lost a total of Rs 69,704, before she realised that she had been conned. The woman then approached the Samta Nagar police.

---||Nagpur||Senate members flay NU for vacant seats in its PG depts||Nagpur: Nagpur University Senate members on Thursday continued their veiled attack against the administration accusing it of deliberately helping private colleges in filling up their postgraduate seats. The house was then adjourned till Diwali vacations, as the entire agenda could not be finished in the first two days. For most of the meeting, issues not related to the students were discussed on both days. Some of those were related to members’ “personal agendas” and even the administration had complained about it, NU officials told TOI. NU Physics Department lecturer Omprakash Chimankar earlier pointed out that the administration had conducted a centralized admission procedure (CAP) for only its 40 departments while leaving out affiliated colleges. He said, last year, the university had included the affiliated colleges in the CAP, which significantly helped the students. Other members informed that NU had also started its CAP late and, by that time, the admissions in private colleges were full, despite the fact that their fees were on a higher side in comparison to the university and majority of them lacked facilities like laboratories and library. They further pointed out that on account of delay, seats in many NU departments were still vacant even after the admission deadline was extended till October 31. Senior member Rajesh Bhoyar pointed out that if private colleges were benefiting at NU’s expense, the administration should introspect on why students preferred admissions there despite exorbitant fees and incidents of exploitations. “Affiliated colleges cannot be held responsible for seats remaining vacant in the university. I used to come from Wardha to attend college in Nagpur.The department heads need to think on why students turned their back to NU,” he said. Replying to the discussions, vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari defended NU’s decision to exclude affiliated colleges from the CAP for postgraduate courses, stating that there were no rules to include them. He said conducting CAP for NU departments was the Management Council’s decision. Some members told TOI after the meeting that top private colleges had charged lakhs in donations from the students as NU’s CAP was delayed. They said, the students were made to run from one college to another for prospectus and admissions, in absence of centralised admissions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/senate-members-flay-nu-for-vacant-seats-in-its-pg-depts/articleshow/87345729.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) told Delhi High Court on Thursday that five “polycarbonate” lathis, the alleged weapons of the assault, had been sent for forensic tests after traces of blood were found on them, even as sample fingerprints of suspect jail staffers and blood samples of other victims of the violence were yet to be collected for an expert opinion. In a status report, CBI said 27 witnesses, including 11 inmates, had been examined and it had found evidence of online payments by Gujjar’s brother and the alleged acceptance of cash by jail staffers on one occasion. The online payment platform, Paytm, has been sounded out for details. CBI further submitted that the investigation with respect to the closure of CCTV cameras and footage seized by Delhi Police was ongoingand relevant samples had been sent for forensic examination. Witnesses have claimed there was a fist-fight between Gujjar and a deputy superintendent, and that one of them also witnessed the deceased being beaten along with two others by jail staffers, CBI stated. There were PCR calls by Gujjar’s brother and sister after one of the undertrials was released on bail and informed the family about the assault, it added. Meanwhile, the director general (prisons) said action had also been taken against the junior doctor on duty after it was found he was negligent in examining Gujjar. The prison authorities added that a departmental inquiry for being “negligent in performing duties” had been initiated against the jail superintendent who did not permit a Delhi Police official to enter the jail following a PCR call in relation to the incident. The prison authority has stated the work of installation and commissioning of the CCTV system in all prisons is complete and each jail has also been provided with body-worn cameras in case the CCTVs are not functional. “At present, 6,944 new CCTV cameras have been installed... The recording... is preserved for one month at two different locations, viz. one at jail itself and other at prison headquarters.” Gujjar, 29, was found dead inside his cell in Tihar on August 4. Last month, the court transferred the investigation from Delhi Police to CBI after opining that the deceased had “lost his life to custodial violence”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bloodstained-lathis-recovered-cbi-tells-hc-on-gujjar-probe/articleshow/87345788.cms||Abhinav Garg

A case is being registered against him at the Civil Lines police station. Action was taken following a complaint by Kulveer Sahani, managing director of a firm given the contract to shift the HT lines from Moradnagar in Ghaziabad to Pallav Puram in Meerut for the construction of the Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transport System (RRTS). He claimed, “The power corporation official had been demanding Rs 12 lakh for giving necessary approvals for the shifting of power lines. He even put a spanner in the works by not giving shutdowns when needed due to which our deadline got delayed by more than 45 days. In the end, we were left with no option but to approach the vigilance team.” Pashimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Litd (PVVNL) authorities are tight-lipped on the issue. When Sanjay Anand Jain, chief engineer, PVVNL, Meerut was contacted, he said, “I am not aware of the details of the development and hence, cannot comment on it at this juncture." The Rs 30,270-crore RRTS project is a high-speed railway project to connect the national capital to Meerut via Ghaziabad and is PM Narendra Modi's pet project slated to finish by 2025. The Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS corridor comprising a total of 25 stations will be elevated for around 70.5 km and 11.5 km of its stretch will be underground. Civil construction work is in progress on this 82-km-long corridor. Speaking with TOI, chief public relations officer of the National Capital Region Transport Corporation, the nodal agency entrusted with the task of facilitating the project, Sunil Vats said, “Work is going on in full throttle involving 10,000 workers and engineers.

---||Nagpur||Ahead of civic polls, focus on improving condition of roads||Slug: Road To SuccessNagpur: With civic polls due early next year, the ruling BJP in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) seems to be hoping for a smooth drive to retain power by improving the road infrastructure. Maintenance of roads in the city has been ignored for almost last five years. The opposition parties in the NMC, including Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena, have already threatened to corner the ruling party in the coming civic elections over potholes-ridden roads. TOI has been regularly reporting about the pathetic condition of tar roads across the city. The civic administration has prepared a plan to asphalt 14 tar roads and conversion of four tar roads into cement-concrete. Now, the NMC’s public works department has submitted a proposal before the standing committee as its chairman Prakash Bhoyar has convened a meeting on October 29. The NMC has proposed to spend Rs 10.21 crore for strengthening the 18 roads.In the last meeting, the panel had given its nod to convert four tar roads into cement-concrete and tarring 11 other roads across the city.Earlier this month, the panel had approved Rs16 crore proposal for recarpeting 15 tar roads.When the civic administration was not allowing road works, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari directed it to reappropriate the NMC budget to allocate more funds for improving condition of tar roads across the city. Subsequently, Bhoyar approved reappropriation of Rs 41.50 crore for roads, which was later okayed by the House.On checking the agenda for the standing panel meeting on Friday, it has come to fore that the department has not selected roads falling under Nehru Nagar, Gandhibagh and Mangalwari zones.The highest number of roads shortlisted are from Hanuman Nagar zone (5), followed by Dhantoli (4). In Hanuman Nagar zone, the department intends to revamp four tar roads and convert one tar road into cement-concrete.Under Laxmi Nagar zone, the department has finalized three tar roads where recarpeting will be done. Likewise, two tar roads will be renewed under Satranjipura zone, while two tar roads will be converted into cement roads.One tar road under Dharampeth zone too has been shortlisted. In Mangalwari zone, one tar road has been finalized for converting it into cement road.

No barricade has been taken off, an officer clarified. “Only four layers of containers and cement boulders were removed,” he added. On whether they were planning to open a lane to traffic, the officer replied no date had been fixed, but it might happen soon. Police may also take the same step at the Ghazipur border, sources said. Senior SKM leader and farm group BKU Ekta Dakaunda president Buta Singh Burjgill claimed the Haryana home secretary had visited along with the Jhajjar deputy commissioner and the SSP and given in writing that farmers had not blocked the way. “Delhi Police removed certain barricades and nails from the road, but not from the main point. The passage can’t be made functional,” he said. BKU Ugrahan secretary Jaswinder Singh Longowal called it a half-baked step. After deciding to stay at Singhu border, Nihang Sikhs on Thursday demanded that strict action be taken against those involved in sacrilege of the holy book across the country. Meanwhile, Delhi Police on Thursday dismissed a constable for making derogatory remarks about the Centre on social media.

---||Kolkata||Wimbledon home to get Nivedita statue||KOLKATA: Five years after Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee unveiled a heritage blue plaque at Sister Nivedita’s former Wimbledon home, permission has been granted to install a bronze statue of the Irish educator in this famous town. Sarada Sarkar, the London-based science teacher of Catholic Boys School who took the initiative to apply to English Heritage for installing the plaque, expects the statue to be unveiled by next summer. This will be the very first statue of Sister Nivedita in the world tennis hub. According to the Census records, Sister Nivedita had lived at 21 High Street, Wimbledon, with her mother, brother and sister in 1901. Swami Vivekananda had rented a house on 35 Woodside, a 15-minute walk from this house. He would walk up the hill from there to visit this house. There are two other houses in Wimbledon where Sister Nivedita had set up schools. The address of one is 10 Berkeley Place. Sarkar, who heads the Sister Nivedita Celebrations UK, applied to the Merton Council to install the statue at Wimbledon’s Cannizaro Park. “Despite the blue plaque, many are still unaware of Sister Nivedita’s contributions. Three years ago we had applied to install the statue at Cannizaro Park. Vedanta Centre UK had supported us. But the idea was rejected outright. This permission wouldn’t have been granted without Conservative councillor Najeeb Latif’s active initiative. After he went through a rigorous question-answer session, an alternative location was provided at Leopold Road,” Sarkar said from London. It is quite befitting for the Irish educator that the new location is just next to Ricards Lodge High School, a famous girls’ school. “The new location is even better since it is close to the girls’ school whose headmistress has high regard for Sister Nivedita after reading about her life,” she added. At Mamata Banerjee’s behest, a statue of Sister Nivedita – designed by Tushar Maharaj of Sargachi Ramakrishna Mission – was installed inside her family cemetery at Devon’s Great Torrington in England in 2019. “We will request Tushar Maharaj to design the Wimbledon statue too. With Bengal’s chief minister’s involvement in paying respect to Sister Nivedita, we are hoping she will donate the proposed statue to Wimbledon,” Sarkar added.

And although only three days are yet to elapse for the deadline, nearly 90% of the apartment complexes are yet to comply with the order. Failure to comply with the order by setting up a composting unit will invite a fine from the MCC. According to data from the MCC, there are 2,337 bulk waste generators across the city, of which 1,500 are apartment complexes, 450 are hotels and eateries, 11 are markets, 105 convention centres and 271 hospitals and healthcare centres. So far, only 128 of these bulk waste generators have set up compositing units. MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar, citing the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 and MCC Solid Waste Treatment Bylaws, said that apartment complexes with more than 30 units had to compulsorily have an on-site composting unit to process wet waste at the source. “We have issued notice on multiple occasions, and released statements in the press requesting the management of these bulk waste generators to set up composting units. But our orders have not been heeded. Apartments have failed to comply with the rules. Now, each flat will have to pay a fine of Rs 15 per month in November, a sum that will be increased to Rs 25 the succeeding month. Waste will not be collected from these apartment complexes, and action initiated against bulk waste generators, if they refuse to pay the fine,” Sridhar told TOI. Queried about the difficulties that many old apartment complexes constructed more than two decades ago were facing in setting up composting units owing to constraints of space, the MCC commissioner said, “Small compost bins can be installed, but they will have be managed by dedicated personnel.” Pot Compost: A compact solution Mangaluru Ramakrishna Mission appears to have alighted on the ideal solution for apartment complexes struggling to find space for a composting unit: Pot Compost. Convener of Mangaluru Ramakrishna Mission Swachh Mangaluru Swami Ekagamyananda said that the unique pot compost units need all of one square feet. “These units can be placed on the balcony or on the roof. Flats in many apartment complexes across Mangaluru have been using pot compost units to process wet waste. We have been distributing these units free of cost,” Swami Ekagamyananda said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/90-of-bulk-waste-generators-in-mangaluru-yet-to-set-up-compost-units/articleshow/87345580.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NU ‘misleads’ members on renaming Humanities Dept||Nagpur: The Nagpur University administration on Thursday tried to mislead the members on the issue of renaming its Humanities Department at the campus. When the issue was raised by Prashant Dekate, the administration led by VC, pro-VC and registrar clarified that the department was yet to be renamed. During the Management Council’s meeting on January 29, former humanities dean Nirmal Kumar Singh had proposed to rename the department on renowned trade union leader and RSS ideologue Dattopant Thengdi to mark his birth centenary. It was also reported by TOI the next day. That time senior member Rajesh Bhoyar had warned not to set such precedents which would be detrimental in future. However, the proposal was later passed with a majority on the pretext that it would be an honour for the historic institution that would be celebrating its centenary in two years. Many students’ organizations had opposed the university’s move that time. Last year Dekate had submitted a proposal to rename the same department as Babasaheb Ambedkar Anthropological Research Center’. It was later sent to the Management Council, which suggested the constitution of a committee to frame modalities for renaming of NU departments during the April 16 meeting, the administration informed him that there were no rules as of now to rename the departments on the popular personalities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nu-misleads-members-on-renaming-humanities-dept/articleshow/87345790.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

In the Nashik division, no MSRTC bus was plying on the roads. In Kolhapur too, only 15% of the buses were operational on Thursday morning from the Kolhapur MSRTC stand. “On Thursday, none of the MSRTC buses in the Nashik division plied from any of the three depots. The only buses on the roads were the ones that were already out for “night-halt” in villages. Those drivers bought the vehicles to the depots and shut the operation for the day,” said Mukund Kunwar, the in-charge Nashik divisional controller. The agitation began on Wednesday across the state. While representatives of various employees’ associations had promised not to stall the buses, the employees of the three depots in Nashik district — Malegaon, Peth and Manmad — went on a strike and they did not run the buses after 9 am. “On Thursday, all the employees joined the agitation spontaneously. This shows the gravity of the issues being raised by the employees,” said Vijay Pawar, the president of Nashik unit of Maharashtra ST Kamgar Sanghatana. The sudden strike has hit the passengers very hard. “This reminds me of the strike during Diwali in 2017. I was stuck up in Pune and had to pay Rs 1,200 to reach Nashik by private transport. Now, I have to reach Pune. The private operators are already charging Rs 600 per seat,” said Sarvesh Pathak, a civil engineer. In Kolhapur, Shreyas Mane, a Class XII student, said, “I am from Warna Nagar and I am waiting at the Kolhapur bus stand for the past one hour to return to my village. I came to know of the strike after I got here.” Uday Shendge (65), said, “I came from Pune on a private vehicle and have to get to Gadhinglaj. I was unaware of the strike. If I don’t get a lift, I may have to spend the night at the bus stand.” Sandip Patil, of the Sanyukt Kruti Samiti, however, said, “We had given prior notice to the state government and passengers about the strike on October 20. As there was no positive response, we have called for an indefinite strike. There are one lakh MSRTC employees and 26 have committed suicide during the pandemic due to financial issues. We don’t want to inconvenience the passengers, but we are also helpless.” Another protestor Aniket Chougale said, “The demands are for merger of MSRTC with the state government, 28% dearness allowance (like state government employees) before Diwali, increase in house rent, annual salary increase to 3%, salary to be given on fixed days and Rs15,000 Diwali bonus.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/msrtc-staff-stir-escalates-commuters-inconvenienced/articleshow/87343275.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||New Covid-19 cases per 1 million population dip below 100 in Maharashtra||PUNE: New Covid cases per one million (10 lakh) people slid below 100 in Maharashtra during the seven-day period between October 20 and 26. New cases in the state per a population of 10 lakh during the seven days dropped to 81 from 104 between October 13 and 19, with 24 districts registering a fall in cases per million. In Pune, new Covid cases per million dropped below 200 as well to 188 between October 20 and 26 from 241 during the previous seven-day period. Ahmednagar, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Raigad and Pune, in that order, recorded the maximum dip in new cases per million in comparison to the week before, public health department data showed. Mumbai too witnessed a drop, with 210 new cases per million in the latest week. The state’s additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas said, “The last time weekly new Covid cases slipped below 100 per million population in Maharashtra was before the peak of the first wave last year.” Maharashtra disease surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI: “Irrespective of the indicators one sees—be it positivity rates or cases per million per week or mortalities—Maharashtra’s second Covid wave now seems to have flattened, with the disease entering the endemic phase in the state. There are many variables that can affect Covid endemicity, especially a genomic change in the virus. Surges in Covid-19 cases are driven by the appearance of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. However, we have not seen any major or significant genomic change in the virus in the last four months.” The state’s positivity rate is now 1.45%. “As per World Health Organization (WHO), an epidemic is considered to be under control when this rate is below 5%,” said Dr Awate. A public health department official said week-on-week, new Covid cases had been reducing in a majority of districts in Maharashtra. “This is the scientific way to compare the district-wise burden of any disease. It is based on the per million population method. Different districts have different population sizes. Absolute Covid cases in various districts cannot convey the real picture of the disease burden in a region,” he said. Epidemiologist Dr Amitav Banerjee told TOI: “A number of citizens are now sero-positive and have antibodies against Covid. When a large number of people get exposed to the virus, it eventually leads to a high level of population immunity. Those who were vulnerable have succumbed or been vaccinated.” On the endemicity, he said, “A virus generally keeps mutating to a more benign form to survive.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/new-covid-cases-per-1-million-popn-dip-below-100-in-maharashtra/articleshow/87345806.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Nagpur||State govt defies Centre in Tadoba FD’s transfer||Nagpur: Even as the fifth cycle of All India Tiger Estimation (AITE)-2022 has begun, the state government has been caught on a wrong foot as it suddenly transferred Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) field director and conservator of forest Jitendra Ramgaonkar.On October 25, the state government shunted out Ramgaonkar to the forest ministry as joint secretary without any specific reason. He had joined Tadoba on August 13, 2020, and had just completed a year. Most of his tenure was marred by Covid-19 restrictions, and now when the wildlife management issues gained momentum, he has been shifted.The transfer is against the Central government orders. On August 2, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav had written to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking support for the tiger estimation exercise.Yadav said that “to accomplish the exercise effectively, it is prudent to ensure participation of officials and forest frontline staff across tiger bearing areas in the state. Transfer and postings in tiger reserves and protected areas during the period may also be avoided at all levels.”The Union minister had sought Thackeray’s personal intervention and cooperation in the matter. The fifth cycle of AITE is resource-intensive and forest personnel are being trained scientifically for data collection and analysis by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and Wildlife Institute of India (WII).Yadav also said that along with AITE, management effective evaluation (MEE) of tiger reserves will also be undertaken. This will need an office in charge who is aware of all the issues. However, Ramgaonkar is being shunted out of field posting to a desk job at mantralaya.The midterm transfer is not only in violation of the state government guidelines but also in violation of the tripartite memorandum of understanding between the NTCA, Maharashtra government and field director of TATR.According to Article II of the agreement, the state government should post motivated officers as field directors with proven track records. preferably trained in wildlife management, with a minimum tenure of three years, which can be extended if the situation warrants it. The forest department has been frequently violating this agreement with not even one field director completing full three-year tenure.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/state-govt-defies-centre-in-tadoba-fds-transfer/articleshow/87344379.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The deceased, Prabhunath Rai (60), was allegedly stabbed by a local resident, Suresh Tiwari, while returning home on Wednesday. Police said Rai was rushed to the Sadar hospital at Chhapra where he succumbed to his injuries on Thursday. As the news about his death spread, a number of his supporters indulged in arson and road blockade, paralysing vehicular traffic on NH-581 that connects Chhapra with Siwan. The SHO of Rivelganj police station, Om Prakash Chouhan, said Rai was attacked near Tekniwas market when he was returning home after closing his medicine shop. Earlier, he had visited a nearby locality for an arbitration. He added that business rivalry appeared to be the reason behind the murder of Rai who was the former mukhiya of Kachnar panchayat in Saran district. The traffic on Chhapra-Siwan road was restored after the intervention of senior police officers, who assured the protesters that the accused would be arrested at the earliest. “Raids are being conducted to arrest the culprit,” the SHO said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/medicine-dealers-murder-sparks-protests-in-saran/articleshow/87344381.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC submits final draft of rectified ward boundaries to state poll panel||MUMBAI: BMC this week submitted a final draft of rectified electoral ward boundaries of 227 electoral wards to the State Election Commission (SEC). BMC’s election department officials said they had completed the rectification of boundaries of constituencies and around 20% boundaries have been changed. Officials said changes were made based on deletion and addition of voters in those constituencies. While rectification had been done, delimitation of all 227 constituencies was not done. Once BMC gets a go ahead from SEC, officials said they would seek people’s suggestions and objections on changes in the draft. With changes in 25% ward boundaries, around 60 wards’ boundaries have been altered. In August, SEC had directed municipal corporations to begin delimitation of ward boundaries. SEC had told local bodies to send draft reports early. Officials said delimitation is usually done out based on new census data, and only if there is a more than 10% change in population of the constituency. “Boundaries were rectified based on population, updation of voters’ lists, inclusion/exclusion of areas in a ward based on change in residential population due to redevelopment, infrastructure projects and slum rehabilitation projects,” an official said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said suggestions and objections will be invited after SEC’s directions. As part of preparations for civic elections in February next year, BMC will add around 4,000 polling booths, keeping Covid-19 in mind. There are around 7,900 booths now. Each booth has 1,400-1,500 voters but will only have around 800 for the February 2022 polls. Shiv Sena and Congress sought rectification of ward boundaries, alleging that in 2017, they were marked to favour BJP candidates. Senior Sena leaders said some sitting and former corporators identified around 30 electoral wards where boundaries were modified before 2017 BMC elections, and which reportedly damaged Sena’s wining prospects and favoured BJP. There are 227 corporator wards or constituencies in BMC. Officials said delimitation or redrawing of ward boundaries was done to balance voter population equally among wards. Officials said that as per 2011 census, population growth in suburbs and drop in island city were taken into account while redrawing electoral wards. Each ward had a population of around 54,000. Delimitation of wards is usually done every 10 years. Delimitation had affected corporators in suburbs, whose wards were divided into four parts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-submits-final-draft-of-rectified-ward-boundaries-to-state-poll-panel/articleshow/87345838.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

"During this festival, the evil practice of black magic involving sacrifice of animals (particularly owls) is greatly prevalent, especially among the tribal communities living in areas along the banks of rivers. We are also sensitising people against this practice," said Rajesh Kumar, DFO, Meerut. Peril looms for owls during Diwali season in India. The bird is believed to be the vehicle of Goddess Lakshmi, the divine power symbolising wealth, fortune, power, beauty and prosperity. Tantriks sacrifice the bird as part of black magic rituals in the belief that it will bring prosperity and good fortune. A countrywide smuggling of owls flourishes in the country during this season. There are 30 owl species in India, and most of these are in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act. "The real culprits are the tantriks who encourage the masses to venture into the dark world of black magic, thus subjecting these poor birds to horrifying death rituals. There should be a sustained crackdown on these tantriks who openly advertise their skills in the form of posters on roadways, buses, city walls, etc. Though this cruelty takes place round the year, instances of owl sacrifice rises manifold during Diwali," said Abrar Ahmad, an ornithologist specialising in the illegal bird trade in India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/forest-dept-launches-drive-to-curb-owl-sacrifice-during-diwali/articleshow/87345830.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||India||Bias in FB algorithm a serious issue: Chandrasekhar||NEW DELHI: Expressing grave concern over potential harm of users on social media, the government said on Thursday that "bias in algorithms is a serious issue" and global tech giants and platforms have to ensure the internet remains a safe, trusted and an accountable medium for all Indians. The comments by junior IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar came in response to a question around concerns over inadequate content supervision/moderation policies at Facebook and group company Instagram after damning revelations by a whistleblower. Chandrasekhar said that the government is concerned about potential abuse and misuse of social media users, and wants that user safety be accorded primacy by internet giants such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google, YouTube and others that operate across the online space in India. “The issue of bias in algorithms is a serious issue for governments, consumers and regulators all over the world. Our jurisprudence and laws and regulations must — sometime in the future — be able to address this issue,” Chandrasekhar told TOI, in the first official comment by the government following the global outrage over Haugen’s revelations that the Mark Zuckerbergled Facebook and his company Instagram had been cavalier about user safety as they chased profits and neglected algorithms that fuelled hate. It is understood Facebook has been served with a notice on the issue, and the firm has been asked to give details about the algorithms it puts in place for content moderation, checking unlawful and fake messaging, and other illegal activities. The minister said effective checks should be maintained to guard against instances of hate crime, fake news, cyber bullying, child pornography and unlawful content around kids and women. “The internet should be a safe and trusted medium. It should be accountable, especially to its users.” Chandrasekhar said that the views of the government have been conveyed to the companies through meetings that he has had with their representatives after taking charge at the ministry. Also, he said that the updated IT Rules for social-media companies, announced in February this year, were a step in this direction. “India has taken a global lead in defining some of the measures that makes the internet and social-media a safe medium, while making the companies accountable to their users.” He said the rules stipulate that global companies — with a large user base in India — appoint statutory officers within the country to ensure adherence to laws and regulations. These include the chief compliance officer who is responsible for ensuring compliance with the IT Act and Rules, a nodal contact person to ensure 24x7 coordination with law-enforcement agencies, and a grievance officer to handle user complaints around content. Also, the platforms have been asked to publish monthly compliance reports, giving details about the user complaints received and action taken thereon, including on a voluntary basis.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bias-in-fb-algorithm-a-serious-issue-chandrasekhar/articleshow/87349624.cms||Pankaj Doval

The accused was arrested for alleged diversion of huge quantity of essential commodities such as grains and rice from Food Corporation of India (FCI) warehouse meant for public distribution system (PDS) to his company India Mega Agro Anaj Limited, thus causing loss of crores to the exchequer. He was booked under sections 166, 406, 409, 420, 467, 468, 471, 477A and 120B of IPC and sections 3 and 7 of Essential Commodities Act. The accused had applied for bail, which was opposed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) through special public prosecutor Sudhir Puranik and assisted by Divya Gontia. “Undoubtedly, the offence is very serious and as observed by the Supreme Court, this court will have to look very seriously at economic offences and their implications on country’s financial health and its effect on the poor and needy people for whom the food grains were meant,” additional sessions judge PY Ladekar said before rejecting the plea. “Considering all aspects, seriousness of the crime, necessity of further investigation and ill effects of such acts on the country’s economic condition, deprivation of the poor and needy people for whom the food grains were to be supplied, in my considered view, grant of bail to the accused would not be a viable option,” the judged added. According to Puranik, large quantities of food grains meant for PDS, which were targeted towards the poor and needy people, were acquired illegally and accumulated by the accused. Baheti is also involved in alleged activities of money laundering as per Section 3 of the Money Laundering Act and amassed unaccounted property of more than Rs55 crore, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/spl-money-laundering-court-rejects-businessmans-bail-plea/articleshow/87345865.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The state has asked the GRMB to send the DPRs to the Central Water Commission (CWC) instead, alleging that the board was exercising more powers than mandated under AP Reorganisation Act (APRA), 2014. In a fresh letter to GRMB chairman, Telangana irrigation engineer-in-chief (ENC) C Muralidhar said, “The government has submitted DPRs of six projects to GRMB. But the board is going into other aspects of DPRs and commenting instead of looking into the basic matter of a project not negatively impacting availability of water. All the projects are old and for which DPRs submitted to CWC and GRMB were either completed or taken up before the appointed day.” As per the APRA, 2014, GRMB/KRMB function was limited to appraisal of any proposal for a new project on Godavari or Krishna and giving technical clearances after satisfying they would not negatively impact availability of water as per awards of tribunal constituted under Inter-State River Water Dispute Act, 1956, for projects already completed or taken up before the appointed day, the government said. The state government cited how KRMB (Krishna River Management Board) had written to CWC chairman regarding DPRs of Rayalaseema Lift irrigation scheme submitted by AP, urging it to examine aspects such as hydrology, irrigation planning, water availability and inter-state issues as the board (KRMB) did not have the expertise.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-slams-grmb-overscrutiny-of-6-dprs/articleshow/87345870.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Lucknow||Big strides for vaccine drive, but women yet to catch up||Lucknow: Lucknow district has crossed the milestone of administering 44.8 lakh people with at least a dose of vaccine against Covid-19, but data also reveals a gender gap among all categories of beneficiaries. Out of 36 lakh population of Lucknow, the percentage of women is 47.7% and that of men 52.3%. The figures since the start of the vaccination campaign on January 16 till October 28 shows that 44.8 lakh shots have been administered so far. Of these, 20.2 lakh doses (45%) have been given to women and 24.5 lakh (55%) shots to men. This means that women’s share among beneficiaries is nearly 3 percentage points lesser than their proportion in the population. The reason, experts say, is hesitancy among women, especially those who are pregnant, lactating or planning to conceive. Another factor is their dependency on men in our societal setup. Prof Smirti Agrawal, faculty at the gynaecology department, KGMU, said, “Even after our constant appeals to women coming in OPDs for vaccination, they don’t get jabbed. Some fear that vaccination might harm them and their unborn, others are unwilling due to socio-religious beliefs and rumours that it affects fertility.” Prof Jamal Masood, head department of community medicine and public health, KGMU, said that women, especially in the rural belt, are mostly dependent on men to go to vaccination centres. “Our health authorities should launch a large-scale, woman-centric awareness campaign in which local women who have already been vaccinated including pregnant, lactating and those planning to conceive should be portrayed as examples,” he suggested. ACMO Dr Milind Vardhan said awareness campaigns are underway in urban and rural belts for pregnant, lactating women. Besides, special camps are being run in women’s hospitals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/big-strides-for-vaccine-drive-but-women-yet-to-catch-up/articleshow/87347737.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Senior inspector Kishor Nagrale, who was posted in the control room, has swapped position with Sheikh. The clash had taken place between ‘Beats’ gang and ‘Kasai’ gang of Hasanbagh. Irfan Khan (alias Bhola) of Beats is fighting for life at a private hospital. The ‘Kasai’ gang is backed by a goon-turned-property dealer and the elder brother of the accused Javed Sheikh who is now in police net. Javed’s brother is still not made an accused despite his involvement coming to fore. The Kasai gang is also involved in illegal cow slaughtering and smuggling. Kumar said Shaikh had manipulated the FIR to shield some goons. He added that Nagrale has been brought in as he had some past experience about Nandanvan. Three persons were injured after the groups clashed at Sadbhavana Nagar near KDK College. It's learnt that Irfan had taken away a scooter from one Vicky Farkunde and had been demanding money for its release. This triggered the incident. After Farkunde, now an accused, was thrashed by Irfan and and an accomplice, he summoned his gang members. Around 40 members of Beats gang confronted the Kasai gang. CP Amitesh Kumar said stringent actions are being initiated against the gangs. “We are updating our lists of gangs and their activities,” he added. Police sources said that Beats gang is fast becoming a threat to the public. After its kingpin Swapnil Salunkhe’s release from Central Jail, he has become active in in east and south Nagpur. His close aide, Aniket Kale, was booked for extortion by Hudkeshwar police station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/senior-pi-shunted-for-shielding-goons-in-gang-war/articleshow/87345859.cms||Soumitra Bose

All the three accused have been nabbed. The victim along with his sister and 17-month-old daughter came to Delhi on September 28 from Kashmir. They were staying at a guesthouse in Yusuf Sarai. His daughter was having a problem in breathing and her treatment was going on in AIIMS. Around 9.40pm, the victim was returning to the guesthouse after withdrawing Rs 50,000 from an ATM. “I was walking from AIIMS towards Safdarjung Hospital.

Reddy said that opposition parties were making false allegations and condemned BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay's statements on the issue. Addressing the media, Reddy also demanded that the Centre issue a letter to Telangana government for the procurement of paddy. “Even though Food Corporation of India (FCI) is not coming forward to procure paddy, the Telangana government has been purchasing paddy from farmers across the state. Despite the lack of support from the Centre on procurement, the TRS government is doing justice to farmers.” Reddy stated that in light decisions taken by the Union government and the FCI, the TRS government was only planning to reduce cultivation of paddy, and encourage alternative cultivation like that of palm oil, spices and other crops. Panchayat Raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao too said cultivation would be reduced, not stopped. “We are suggesting that wherever water sources are available paddy can be cultivated and fine varieties of paddy (sanna rakam) grown to avoid panic during the procurement period,” said Reddy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/state-govt-wont-stop-paddy-cultivation-palla-rajeshwar-reddy/articleshow/87345875.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna
---||Kolkata||Ahead of KIFF, Nandan to get new screen for viewing||Priyanka Dasgupta Kolkata: The existing Nandan screen, which has been showing films from 2013, will soon be replaced to give a better viewing experience to the audience. This decision was taken at a meeting held to discuss the preparations for KIFF 2022. Preparations for the 27th edition of the Kolkata International Film Festival is underway. Chairperson of the 26th edition of KIFF Raj Chakraborty said, “After discussion, a proposal has been drawn up to replace the existing screen of Nandan 1. In all these years, it is only natural for dust to accumulate on the white screen. All official protocol will be followed to get a new one in place.” Some 370-odd entries have been submitted for the national competition of contemporary Indian language films. The selection committee for Indian language movies comprises the likes of directors Prabhat Roy, Shekhar Das, Haranath Chakraborty, Sudeshna Roy, Judhajit Sarkar, Satrajit Sen and Premendu Bikas Chaki, among others. They will shortlist ten that will be in the final competition for best Indian language film. Said a source, “A Bengali film titled ‘Ami Ar Madhuri’ on a person’s obsession with Madhuri Dixit is in contention. Among the other Bengali entries are ‘Tobo Uposonghar’, ‘Dhulo Bali Katha’, ‘Demokkacy’, ‘18 Te 72’, ‘Jhilli’, ‘Ananta’, ‘Shimul Palash Katha’, ‘Jongom’, ‘Jhorapalok, ‘No Refusal’ and ‘Lullaby’.” An interesting entry is Amartya Bhattacharya’s Odia film – ‘Adieu Godard’ - on what happens when an old man addicted to watching pornography with his friends accidentally brings home a DVD with a Godard film inside it. Interestingly, he gets attracted to Godard’s film and initiates the idea of hosting a film festival in the village where Godard’s films will be screened. The film explores what happens after the festival gets organized. “Just like cricketers dream to play on their home ground, filmmakers like me too dream of showing our films at KIFF. I was thrilled when my ‘Runanubandha’ got selected in KIFF’s international competition. Now I am eagerly awaiting the decision on ‘Adieu Godard’,” Bhattacharya said. Gaurav Madan’s Hindi film titled ‘Barah By Barah’ is also vying for selection. Shot on celluloid instead of digital, this film is about a photographer who clicks the last photographs of the dead at Benaras' Manikarnika ghat. “In a day and age of digital, it is a rare Indian film to be shot on celluloid. I’m glad that I shot on film since I was able to capture the changing face of the ancient Kashi on film! My short film, ‘Sambhavtaha’, had won best short film at KIFF 2018. I really hope that my debut feature gets selected in one of my favourite festivals!” Madan said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/priyanka-nandan/articleshow/87345932.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Hyderabad||Hetero urges HC toquash CBI case||Hyderabad: Stating that the CBI had succumbed to political pressure bent on fixing AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in a quid pro quo case — and implicated several genuine entrepreneurs — the Hetero drugs and labs group on Thursday urged the Telangana high court to quash cases the CBI booked against them and their director, M Srinivas Reddy. Putting forward their case before Justice Shameem Akther, senior counsel T Niranjan Reddy said that the case against them was that they were allotted 75 acres in Jadcherla SEZ by YS Rajasekhar Reddy, the then chief minister of AP in 2008 in an undue manner and hence Rs 19 crore was invested in firms belonging to Jagan Mohan Reddy as part of a quid pro quo arrangement. But the fact of the case, he said is that this is a central project. Hetero was selected by the Union government as an anchor investor and entrusted the task of developing the barren land into an SEZ with modern amenities, he added. “We developed the project by investing Rs 500 crore and provided employment to 1,100 people. The price per acre in that area at that time was Rs 15 lakh. But the SEZ Act says that land should not be sold to industrialists and that it should only be leased out. As a result of this policy, we are paying a lease rent of Rs 7 lakh per acre per annum, he said. Describing the quid pro quo allegation as baseless, Niranjan Reddy said that the CBI’s own case is that we were benefited to an extent of Rs 8 crore on account of this land allocation. And the CBI says that we invested Rs 19 crore in Jagan firms in lieu of this benefit. Which prudent businessman would invest Rs 19 crore for a benefit of Rs 8 crore, he asked.  “Our branches in 65 countries have been contributing millions of dollars of foreign exchange to the country. The allegations made by CBI have damaged our reputation and we were losing several international contracts on account of this case”, Niranjan said. Former APIIC MD BP Acharya who also filed a quash petition on Thursday withdrew his case. The case was adjourned to Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hetero-urges-hc-toquash-cbi-case/articleshow/87345887.cms||---
---||Delhi||House staff flee with Rs 3 crore items in west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh||NEW DELHI: Police have arrested two men who allegedly sedated an elderly couple at their house in west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh last week and fled with jewellery, cash and valuables worth Rs 3 crore. The two men worked as house help for the couple. Two women associates of the men are absconding and a search for them is underway. When the incident apparently took place last Saturday, the couple, who ran a travel agency in Moti Bagh, was alone at home. Police said when the children returned home, they found the parents unconscious in their room and the two house workers similarly unconscious in the kitchen. The house had been ransacked. The children informed the cops and crime and forensics teams were called to the spot. "The family has claimed that four of the house helps, including two women, fled with diamond and gold jewellery, watches and Rs 80 lakh in cash, everything totalling around Rs 3 crore. They also claimed the accused had fled in a Fortuner car belonging to the household," said a police officer. Prashant Gautam, additional DCP (West), revealed that during investigation, the police team gathered information from the couple and their family members about the four domestic workers. “After they were identified, police launched technical surveillance that helped us zero in on two of them. Their location was determined to be in Uttarakhand,” the officer said. “We had information that they were planning to flee to Nepal. Our teams then informed the local police and the cops at the border. We then raided the identified location and arrested the two men before they could flee from the location.” Gautam disclosed that some of the stolen goods were also recovered. However, the two women suspects are still to be traced. “We have possible leads about the location of the two women suspects. They will be arrested soon. Our investigators are on their trail,” said Gautam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/house-staff-flee-with-rs-3cr-items/articleshow/87345938.cms||---
---||Meerut||Rain-fed swollen river proving to be a hurdle for Ganga snan logistics, say officials||BIJNOR: As preparations begin for Ganga snan fair, slated to be held in the third week of November this year, finding adequate space on the ghats is proving to be a major challenge for the authorities as the holy river is in spate due to incessant rainfall in the hills of Uttarakhand. Lakhs of devotees are expected as the Yogi Adityanath government has given the green signal to hold the religious bathing festival for four days from November 16 to 19. But with no let-up in heavy rainfall in the hills, officials are worried if they will be able to organize the Ganga snan fair at all. “The ‘snan’ (holy dip) was cancelled last year and we are expecting huge crowds this time. But to provide logistics support to manage such a crowd is going to be a major challenge for us as all the ghats are submerged now. We also need lots of space to hold the mela (fair), install tents for lodging devotees and create parking facilities,” said SB Sharma , Bijnor district panchayat apar mukhya adhikari (AMA). Sharma added, "Over four lakhs devotees take a holy dip in Ganga on Kartik Purnima here at Mahatma Vidurkuti. We had started making preparations for the same. Some kuchha pathways were levelled but were washed away by swift currents. The water level of the Ganga is fluctuating continuously causing hurdles in preparations." During the festival time last year, Ganga had a load of 20,000 cusecs of water but this year, it is flowing with 42,000 cusecs and this is fluctuating continuously, said Piyus Baliyan, junior engineer at Bijnor Ganga barrage. Officials here said a similar situation exists at Garhmukteshwar in Hapur and Tigari in Amroha. Ganga snan witnesses thousands of rural families arriving in bullock carts and tractor trolleys for a holy dip and participation at the fair.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/rain-fed-swollen-river-proving-to-be-a-hurdle-for-ganga-snan-logistics-say-officials/articleshow/87345930.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court refuses to stall Disha probe||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Thursday refused to interfere in the ongoing probe of the Justice Sirpurkar Commission, appointed by the Supreme Court to inquire into alleged encounter killing of four accused in the Disha rape and murder case, stating it has “the power to regulate its procedure”. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy said this while dismissing pleas filed by two policemen, who challenged the procedure adopted by the commission to examine them under Section 8-B of the Commissions of Inquiries Act. The bench, which heard and reserved the matter two days ago, pronounced a common judgment in both the pleas. DSP Vasam Surender and circle inspector Konda Narasimha Reddy, who were summoned by the commission as its witnesses, approached the high court, saying that they were aggrieved by the decision of the commission that rejected their request to treat them as independent witnesses. They also wanted to be examined at the end of the commission’s inquiry to enable them to avail the statutory protection available to them. They contended that they have a problem with the procedure adopted by the commission that was cross-examining them first and recording their statement later. Writing the judgment for the bench, Chief Justice Sharma said: “The commission is certainly empowered to frame its rules and procedure and it is the discretion of the commission to require any party to adduce the evidence first. It is certainly not at all open to the two police officers to state that they have to be examined as independent witnesses or that they have to be examined in the last after examination of all witnesses is over. The order passed by the commission, as the commission has the power to regulate its procedure subject to the rules framed under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, does not warrant any interference”. Referring to the judgment in the Kiran Bedi case, relied upon by the two cops, the bench said that in that case, the Supreme Court did not think it expedient to lay down any rigid procedure for proceeding ahead. Each witness or participant before the commission has to place its facts before the commission and it has to be in one or the other sequence. “The Commission of Inquiry has to look into the facts that are put by different parties and members of the public etc., and it has to ascertain only the facts in the matter and forward its report containing the findings of the commission.  It is only thereafter the government has to take a decision and to decide what measures or actions it has to take, if at all,” the bench said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-hc-refuses-to-stall-disha-probe/articleshow/87345892.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Merely 0.04% of expectant moms received both doses of Covid-19 vaccine||PUNE: Just 901 pregnant women in Maharashtra have received both doses of the Covid vaccine after they started getting the shots in the country in July, the latest state health department report has revealed. Considering the state has an estimated 20 lakh women in this category, barely 0.04% have been fully immunized. Vaccine hesitancy, misconceptions and a long gap of 84 days in between the two Covishield doses were the likely reasons for the low numbers, experts stated. “A total of 32,281 pregnant women have received the first dose of Covid vaccine in Maharashtra till October 27. Of them, 901 have received both doses. We are doing multifarious activities to increase the vaccination numbers in pregnant women, but we cannot force them as vaccination is voluntary,” state immunization officer Sachin Desai told TOI. He also underlined the likelihood of these numbers being slightly higher than reported because many pregnant women did not like to disclose their pregnancy status and preferred to get the Covid shots under the age category. “Mass awareness activities and repeated counselling are needed to allay fears of untoward side-effects, including miscarriage,” said Dr Sanjay Gupte, former national president of Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOSGI).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-merely-0-04-of-expectant-moms-double-vaxxed-in-state/articleshow/87345914.cms||Umesh Isalkar

If yes, you are among the countless victims of fake news menace who can easily fall for false or misleading information masquerading as legitimate news on social media platforms. Intrigued with what goes inside the minds of these ‘believers’, Anubhav Mishra, associate professor at Jaipuria Institute of Management, along with Sridhar Samu, professor at Great Lakes Institute of Management, Chennai, undertook a research, only to come out with interesting findings. Of over 400 respondents in the age group of 18-30 years who the duo approached, 74% said they believed that such messages (read fake news) were sent to them as a good gesture, perhaps meant to enlighten them. Not just that, 65% of them said they were happy to receive similar messages. Analysing how fake news patrons evaluate the image of the sender, the researchers found that ‘relevancy’ plays a significant role in the number of people believing in the message and forwarding it. For irrelevant information, 60% of the respondents said they were not interested in getting such messages in future. “During mob violence and riots, fake messages spread like wildfire and most people believe the information without checking the facts. This, probably, explains why internet access is disabled during such incidents,” said Anubhav. The researchers also studied the impact of sharing fake news on the sender's social image. If the information forwarded was relevant, the sender was either friendly for 78% respondents, or a narcissist for 63% people, said Anubhav. About 67% of the respondents felt those who didn’t share such messages were only conscious of their social image. Insisting that the findings of the study have relevance, Samu said it could be used to run awareness campaigns. “The fear of potential public shaming could become the driving force to stop the chain of fake messages. People should realize that by sharing fake information they are not doing a favour to others, instead they may be harming their image among their group of colleagues or relatives,” Samu said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/fake-news-is-fine-for-many-study-finds-out-why/articleshow/87347742.cms||Isha Jain

The accused was caught and thrashed by the family and locals. Both are in hospital and stated to be out of danger. The incident happened around 1.30am. The girl, Rookie Singh (21), a B Arch student, and accused Prem Singh (21), third-year degree, are distant relatives. Both have been admitted in two different private hospitals, police said. “When we spoke to the victim she claimed they were never in a relationship. She said that they spoke occasionally, but in the last one month she began to avoid Prem after she felt he was trying to take advantage of her. This perhaps upset him,” said Gachibowli inspector G Suresh . According to cops, Prem entered the girl’s house by picking the door lock and attacked her while she was studying in a room. Her screams woke up others in the house and they rescued the girl, cops said. The girl suffered injuries on her hand, leg and neck. The accused was beaten up by locals and the girl’s family. The victim was shifted to a hospital in Gachibowli. After police reached the spot, they admitted the accused to a local area hospital and then to a private hospital.

Inaugurating the event at Jhulelal Vatika on Thursday, Yogi said, “Over 1,500 vendors selling food, clothes and basic utilities of daily life have been provided space at the venue by Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) which is organising the programme.” A laser show depicted the development work in the cityThe event started with ‘Gomti aarti’ by the CM, which was followed by a laser show depicting development work being done. Later, the story of Ramayana was also narrated through a colourful laser show, leaving over 10,000 people who visited the mela mesmeised. The CM felicitated 1,200 street vendors and sanitary workers for their work during the pandemic. “Mohatsavs are being organised at 200 nagar palikas and 17 municipal corporations across the state to help street vendors who faced innumerable difficulties during the pandemic. The effort is in accordance with the PM’s vision of Vocal for Local,” the CM said. “While countries like China, US, Russia and England were forced to enforce lockdown, we are celebrating festivals – Deepotsav in Ayodhya, Rangotsav in Mathura and Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj – because of better and participatory governance,” the CM said. He said the previous government did not do much for the poor while the BJP government considered the entire 25 crore population of the state as one family. LMC officers said they expect daily footfall of 15,000-20,00 from Friday till November 4. Comedy shows by Raju Srivastava and Sunil Pal will be organised on Friday followed by ‘spiritual night’ by Kailash Kher on Saturday and performance by rap star Badshah on Sunday. Folk night by Malini Awasthi on Monday and ‘kavi sammelan’ on Tuesday will follow. On Wednesday, 1 lakh diyas made of cowdung will be lit on Gomti banks. Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan in his address said, “Earlier, street vendors were made to make rounds of banks to get a loan of just Rs 3,000, but Modi government has disbursed loans worth Rs 10,000 each to more than 8 lakh vendors at zero percent interest.” Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said festivals of all religions were celebrated peacefully under the BJP government, while riots and violence were common under the previous governments.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED searches at sugar mill owned by state minister||Mumbai: Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday searched premises of a sugar mill owned by Maharashtra minister of state Prajakt Tanpure in a case of money laundering. In another case, ED searched premises of Jagdish Kadam, an aide of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. Joint teams of ED officials from Delhi and Mumbai raided nine premises in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Ahmednagar in connection with Unitech Group case registered in Delhi and Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) case registered in Mumbai. Prajakt is minister of state for urban development and NCP MLA from Rahuri in Ahmednagar district. His father Prasad is a former MP. Tanpure’s family allegedly purchased a sick sugar mill through auction at rates lower than the then market rate. Ram Ganesh Gadkari mill had allegedly defaulted on an MSCB loan, after which the bank auctioned it. The mill was sold to Prasad Sugar & Allied Agro Products, which was managed by Prasad through Prajakt.  Prasad was director in MSCB bank when it sold Ram Ganesh Gadkari mill to his son’s company. ED searched Prasad Sugar mill too. Prajakt’s phone was switched off when TOI tried to contact him for his reaction. ED also searched premises of few consultants, reportedly known to Nagpur politician Ashish Deshmukh. Sources said they searched premises of Jagdish Kadam as they suspect his firms received money diverted from Unitech. Kadam and some others whose premises were searched allegedly had financial transactions with Unitech. Delhi police and CBI registered a cheating case against Unitech after home buyers were cheated. Company promoters allegedly diverted the money abroad and to other companies in India. In the MSCB money laundering case, the ED is probing why the bank granted loans to mills without required mortgages. Directors of the BSCB, mainly senior politicians, auctioned those mills to their relatives for less than the market rate causing losses to the bank. Last week, the deputy chief minister refuted all allegations regarding the Jarandeshwar sugar mill case. He said the Enforcement Directorate was investigating the matter and that facts would come out soon. “I have all the documents. All allegations being made by the opposition are baseless,” Pawar had said. He further said the auction of Jarandeshwar sugar mill was carried out as per all the rules and regulations. “A central agency is probing the case and the facts will come out. Other state agencies, such as the Anti-Corruption Bureau, CID and an inquiry committee chaired by a judge had already probed these allegations in the past,” Pawar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-searches-at-sugar-mill-owned-by-state-minister/articleshow/87345995.cms||Vijay V Singh

The remark came on the second day of his deposition on Thursday. A day earlier Madhar had already been quizzed about the alleged encounter at Chattanpally on December 6, 2019. Madhar responded “I don’t know” when quizzed over the arrest of accused in record time, public applause and the reason for commission’s appointment. On Thursday, Madhar’s deposition was on similar lines to that by ACP V Surender and CI K Narasimha Reddy earlier: He was threatened by NHRC team while giving statement, accused were warned with shots in air and then subsequently police fired towards the sound of firing in self-defence. The inspector said that six cops including him had collected long weapons as per ACP Surender’s order and that his AK-47 safety was on when they started with the four accused for recovery on December 6. Madhar said he first fired in air as ordered by the ACP, adding that he had kept it in single firing position and shot 18 rounds, including 8-10 rounds in air. Madhar said the ACP had instructed not to target the accused and claimed ignorance on how all the four ended being shot dead while running away on higher ground. He also said that he had no idea if any bullets fired by the accused were found on the fifth bund behind which cops had taken cover. The 6ft 2inch cop said that he had taken cover behind a two-and-half-feet bund and claimed he was “kneeling and bending” while shooting. On his mobile call data record (CDR) showing multiple places from 7.59am to 6.11pm, Madhar said that after the incident around 8.30am his as well as mobiles of all cops were taken away by SHO Shadnagar to stop them from talking to others. He also said that his mobile was not locked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/dont-know-why-sc-inquiry-commission-set-up-says-cop/articleshow/87345957.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Some persons were being examined by police. However, no arrests have been made in three cases registered so far. Adilabad police said that a section of locals wanted to take out a religious procession, though permission was denied. The organisers started to use a mike since morning. A group led by a local MPTC opposed its usage, while the other supported by the sarpanch supported it.  This disagreement between the rival groups over usage of the mike led to clashes, stone-pelting and vandalism between two groups of the community.  In fact, these two groups belong to the same political party. Of the 22 members identified as suspects in the case, the sarpanch has also been named an accused in the case. Two cases of murder and another case of attempt to murder was registered in connection with Wednesday’s violence. Ever since the clash broke out on Wednesday morning, high tension prevailed and security forces from neighbouring Asifabad and Nirmal were rushed to Gundala. By the time police reached the spot on learning about stone pelting, the situation was under control. “Members of a faction reached the houses of victims with an intention to attack them. When the victims started to run into agriculture fields, the rivals attacked them with sticks, leading to death of two persons," Adilabad superintendent of police M Rajesh Chandra told TOI.  The SP held discussions with villagers on Thursday and appealed to them to maintain peace.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/adilabad-clashes-cops-identify-22-miscreants/articleshow/87345968.cms||---

As a result, a never seen before scenario of professionals, in the age-group between 20 and 35 years, landing in emergency rooms (ERs).  “Previously, strokes used to hit patients over 60 years, but now we are seeing the episodes in 20-year-old. It is largely due to uncontrolled hypertension. We see at least 12 cases in a year of strokes in the 20-35 age-group,” Dr Vikram Sharma, consultant neuro physician, Sunshine Hospitals, said. A recent surge in stress levels was found to be the cause of stroke in majority of the young patients.  “Most patients give a history of sudden increase in stress in the previous 2-3 months. We have seen such cases in software engineers in the recent months,” said Dr Suresh Giragani, neuro interventional radiologist, Yashoda Hospitals. On the eve of World Stroke Day, there is a need to create awareness about risks posed even to youth, say experts. “Identifying stroke is often delayed by a lack of recognition that stroke can happen to someone in this age range,” said Dr Swathi Reddy, head, department of emergency, acute care, Gleneagles Global Hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/stroke-spikes-among-young-as-stress-takes-a-toll/articleshow/87345992.cms||Amrita Didyala

A big one-act play competition for Marathi and Hindi theatre activists ‘Khasdar Cup theatre festival’ began at the Scientific Society hall, the first such event in the last two years. Curtains went up for the first time after devastating the second wave of Covid-19, the auspicious theatre bells rang once again, and more than 450 amateur theatre activists and technicians got a fresh opportunity to showcase their talent on a new competitive platform. The festival will continue for the next three days at the same venue and its prize distribution will be held at Suresh Bhat Hall on October 31. While opening this maiden theatrical competitive event of the year, former mayor Anil Sole, who happens to be the president of the committee that has been organizing ‘Khasdar Sanskrutik Mahotsav’ since 2019 in Nagpur said that the next edition of the cultural festival will be held in November. Sole said that with government permitting open air events, they have chalked out dates for the “signature” cultural festival. “Khasdar Mahotsav will be held from November 28 at multiple open air venues,” he said adding that the event will be a memorable one like the first edition. Artistes welcomed this announcement with a round of applause. “Like the theatre competition, the mega cultural festival in November will help bring back life to normal. Artistes in Nagpur are waiting for such events,” said Naresh Gadekar, president of Nagpur centre of Marathi Natya Parishad. Earlier, Kanchan Gadkari inaugurated the Khasdar cup one-act play competition. This is the first year of the event in which 23 groups from the district are participating. The rules, regulations and judging norms have been framed on the lines of ‘Purushottam Karandak’ one-act play contest, which is considered as one of Maharashtra’s most prestigious competitive theatrical events. Girish Gandhi, trustee of State Marathi Natya Parishad, said that the competition should be tough. “Unfortunately, there are a few groups in Nagpur which enjoy taking objections on decisions of judges. We must ban such groups next year,” he said adding that the competition should invite entries from across Vidarbha from next year. The maiden edition of the drama competition is dedicated to the theme of 75 years of Independence ‘Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav’.

---||Lucknow||Electronic bazaar abuzz but buyers go for low-cost items||Lucknow: Footfall in the electronic gadgets and appliance markets is much better this festival season in comparison to last year but majority of people are going for low-cost items due to decline in purchasing power owing to high inflation, suggest traders. “This is the situation when we are offering heavy discounts and EMI facility,” said a trader. They also said that e-commerce giants have dented their business by offering better deals on electronic items such as smartphones, TV, refrigerator, washing machines. According to various associations of electronic and gadget dealers, total business in this segment in 2019 Diwali season was to the tune of Rs 121 crore. Sales dropped to Rs 59 crore in 2020 due to the pandemic. This year, though Covid-19 cases have dropped considerably, business has been only around Rs 42 crore till a week before Diwali “The sale of smartphones, LED TV, mixer-grinder and other kitchen equipment has improved, but very few buyers are coming for big items like washing machines, refrigerators and air conditioners. We are estimating that the sales of electronic gadgets will surpass last year’s business, but will not touch pre-Covid status,” said Tushar Kukreja, secretary, Lalbagh electronic traders’ association. “Footfall has increased significantly in comparison to last year but most people are asking for low-cost items as they say that they have very little to spare because incomes have gone down amid galloping inflation,” said Pulkit Shah, the owner of a prominent electronics store in Kapoorthala. Customers also say that they are buying new items only because it is considered auspicious for Diwali, he added. Atul Dubey, a shopkeeper in Bhoothnath, said, “We are charging 0% interest rates on EMI and taking no down payment just like online shopping outlets, but still the response is low.” Professor of economics Mahendra Mittal said, “The purchasing power of people has dropped because of high inflation across sectors triggered by fuel price hike, hence people are looking for cheaper alternatives.” “I wanted to purchase an iPhone for my birthday, but have settled for an android smartphone due to budget constraints,” said Chetan Singh, a customer at Shriram Tower. Similar is the case with Eeshu Sharma, who wanted to buy a home theatre system but deferred the idea because some basic household items needed to be replaced and their prices had gone up from last year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/electronic-bazaar-abuzz-but-buyers-go-for-low-cost-items/articleshow/87347799.cms||Pranchal Srivastava
---||Delhi||Parents may have to arrange for own transport as schools reopen in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Even as the announcement that schools and colleges would reopen from November 1 enthused parents and students alike, the institutions themselves have begun preparations for the resumption of academics. There’s work to be done on timetables and seating to ensure Covid norms are met. But among all these, and to the parents’ chagrin, most schools have decided they cannot provide school transport for the time being. With hybrid lessons — online and in-person attendance — still an option, the transport bugbear could mean parents will prefer keeping their children at home. Suruchi Gandhi, principal, Bal Bharti School, Dwarka, said, “Funds to run our buses and transport service are in deficit. It is economically unviable to provide school transport because just 10 to 12 students can board one bus under Covid protocols. Also, we feel attendance will be thin and wonder whether sending out our buses makes sense.” At Abu Public School, principal Jyoti Arora too said that transport facilities couldn’t be so suddenly restored. Tagore International School in Vasant Vihar will be among the institutions that will not have their buses ferrying the returning students. This has put parents like Bipin Tewari in a fix. “With private transport, hygiene and safety are issues,” said Tewari, whose children have to travel from north Delhi to Karol Bagh for school. “The authorities should think about the difficulties that parents will face.” The principals have other problems to deal with. “As long as hybrid learning has to continue, teachers will have a difficult time,” said Gandhi. “They not only take classes, but also monitor junior students and man the entry-exit gates.” Arora is awaiting guidelines from the Directorate of Education to begin planning for the resumption of classes. “I will probably divide the classes into two groups and call them alternately to school,” she said. “Earlier, due to the screen-time restriction rule, the classes were of shorter duration. Now, we have to get back to the pre-pandemic schedules.” Tagore International, Vasant Vihar, will call back only students of classes VI to VIII, that too not right after Diwali. Madhulika Sen, senior advisor at the school, said, “We will probably start junior classes only in January 2022. Board exams are scheduled in November and we will require more classrooms because of social distancing. We might even close the school for other classes at that time.” The Vasant Vihar institution will also seek Covid-negative test reports of the students attending classes. Bhatnagar International School too will do the same and ask parents to submit their vaccination certificates as well.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/parents-may-have-to-arrange-for-own-transport-as-schools-reopen/articleshow/87346035.cms||Shradha Chettri

The victim, identified as Pijush Biswas, a resident of Baguihati Hatiara, has alleged that a member of the infamous shoulder gang was standing behind him at a bank branch ATM and managed to read his PIN number. The accused then replaced the debit card of Biswas with a fake one and withdrew the huge amount from his account. Baguarti Police have started a probe and are ascertaining the identity of the accused using the ATM’s CCTV footage. According to Biswas, he had visited the nationalized bank’s Baguiati branch in the first week of October. He was withdrawing cash worth Rs 2000 and trying to get his balance statement when the printed slip of paper reportedly slipped out of his hand. In a fraction of a minute that Biswas left his card unattended to pick up his balance statement, the accused who was standing right behind him replaced the card, claimed Biswas. A few days later he found multiple withdrawals being made from his account. By the time he blocked his card, Biswas lost Rs 1, 56, 246. When Biswas contacted his bank, he was told he was not carrying his own card. The FIR was finally registered this week. The bank too is investigating the case through its vigilance wing. Cops have been repeatedly warning citizens not to trust strangers at ATMs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/it-consultant-falls-victim-to-atm-theft/articleshow/87346003.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Sirajuddin also said that he saw another accused, J Naveen, throwing a stone at SI Venkateshwarulu, causing injury on his forehead. Like inspector Lal Madhar who deposed before him, head constable Sirajuddin also said that initially when he saw the accused pushing away their handles and snatching firearms after throwing soil into the eyes of the police personnel nearby, he followed the brief given by the ACP and checked the surroundings to see if there were any people around who could pose a threat to the accused. “When I went a little forward, dust came towards me. By the time I wiped my eyes, all accused escaped from the handlers. Dust was thrown on all cops,” Sirajuddin said. Sirajuddin also stated that though he could see the accused intermittently while taking cover behind the fifth bund, he did not take an aim at them. “I fired in the direction of the sound of firing with an intention that they would become frightened and would stop running and hide somewhere,” he said. After the firing stopped from the accused, Sirajuddin said that he saw the bodies of the accused but did not look at the injuries. When the commission’s advocate K Prameshwar pointed out that paragraph 6 to paragraph 27 in his affidavit is verbatim with Madhar’s, Sirajuddin said, “I do not know.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/accused-snatched-sis-weapon-cop/articleshow/87345998.cms||---

Reacting to the allegations made by Vijaya Sai Reddy, the SP issued a clarification on Thursday. “The allegations made by YSRC MP against me regarding Andhra-Odisha Border (AOB) operations are false and the facts are different from what was alleged. The issue of ganja is not new in AOB. It has been a serious issue for the past 15 years. The allegations made by the MP that I am close to former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu are baseless. It is unfortunate that the MP has made such comments against a police official,” said Ranganath. He said that due to the migration of workers to villages during the Covid-induced lockdown, ganja consumption increased in the rural areas. He added that many from the rural areas lost their jobs and thus they turned to ganja peddling. “Ganja is smuggled into the entire country, including Telangana, through AOB. We conducted a detailed probe and found the smuggling routes and smugglers in AOB. AP police helped us in the operation in Vizag and East Godavari,” the SP said. The SP appealed to political parties in AP to not drag police into the political slugfest on ganja. “Parties in AP shall keep politics aside and fight to wipe out ganja. Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao has issued orders to curb ganja smuggling and not spare any political party,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ganja-curbs-take-political-battle-to-a-new-high-sp-refutes-allegations/articleshow/87346002.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Nagpur||BJP defaming Bollywood to help Yogi shift industry to Noida: Malik||Nagpur: Maharashtra minority development minister Nawab Malik continued to spew fire on the BJP by accusing it of being engaged in smear campaign to defame Bollywood by using the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). Interacting with media at the city airport on Friday, Malik, who is also NCP spokesperson, charged the saffron party of helping Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who is building a film city in Noida, to shift the film industry there. “The conspiracy to defame Bollywood started with actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide. NCB’s Sameer Dawood Wankhede was brought to Mumbai for the purpose, and he started it by arresting Singh’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty by showing a false payment of Rs4,000 for purchasing drugs. It was only after the judiciary intervened, such a campaign was stopped.” Before Malik’s arrival, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis was at the airport and he indirectly called the NCP spokesperson “parrot, who’s speaking daily to the media.” His barb was in reply to Malik’s comments that NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede is a “BJP parrot.” “He (Malik) keeps on speaking (to media) throughout the day, as he has no other work to do. We do not need to react to his every comment,” said Fadnavis. On this, Malik retorted saying, “BJP is worried about its parrot (Wankhede), which would soon be caged.” “Parroting is not my business. Your (Fadnavis’s) ancestors may have used the bird for astrology. Those who keep more information on parrots should not target others,” he said. Reminding the former chief minister about his prediction that Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government would not survive full term, the NCP spokesperson said the three-party alliance has successfully completed two years and would last till the entire term of five years. “We will be here till the next 25 years. You keep on threatening that half of our cabinet would go to jail. Politics cannot be played by such intimidating tactics. Those who took your threats seriously had switched on to your party, and are now repenting,” he said. Further accusing BJP of being involved in extortion from Bollywood stars, Malik said the deals were allegedly made in Maldives. “Wankhede had registered many cases against those working in the film industry for possessing 2gm-5gm quantity of drugs. His team has extorted crores by such modus operandi. In one of the cases registered last year, Wankhede’s team probed about 30 Bollywood personalities, but neither any arrest was made nor any charge sheet is filed till date. I would be sending a detailed letter to central vigilance commission panel head Gyaneshwar Singh on the bureau’s wrongdoings,” he said. On the allegations that BJP leaders were in regular touch with Wankhede, the cabinet minister said an associate of a top BJP leader was daily meeting the NCB official in his office. “I would be revealing the names of all leaders and their connections during the winter session of the state legislature when the issue will be brought up for discussion in the House.” Asserting that Bollywood would stay in Mumbai only, Malik added that the industry has got its name from the city. “It is the second biggest showbiz industry in the world after Hollywood, contributes 3% to India’s GDP and provides employment to lakhs. It evolved over the years with contributions of legends like Dadasaheb Phalke, Lata Mangeshkar, and V Shantaram. Yogi (UP CM) should know that Mumbai is a mini-India which has accommodated citizens from across the country and treated them with respect. Bollywood is India’s identity,” said Malik. Defending his act of bringing out personal details of Wankhede, the NCP spokesperson said the latter had jailed many innocents, including his son-in-law and was allegedly involved in extortion. “Therefore, it is my duty to expose Wankhede’s wrongdoings and prevent misuse of power. Wankhede has filed over 100 cases and jailed about 26 persons without concrete charges,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/bjp-defaming-bollywood-to-help-yogi-shift-industry-to-noida-malik/articleshow/87377413.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

All equipment like ventilators, oxygen equipments and other medical equipment installed at the makeshift hospital are being moved by the government from the premises of the Mahatma Mandir. The makeshift Covid-19 hospital at Mahatma Mandir was made operation in the wake of a massive bed shortage during the second wave of the pandemic and anticipation of a severe possible third wave of the global pandemic, which was expected around September-October this year. A key officer close to the development confirmed that the makeshift hospital is being dismantled. “Mahatma Mandir Covid-19 hospital was readied considering a possible third wave. Fortunately, the state has managed to control the pandemic now and has planned to host the Vibrant Gujarat Summit at Mahatma Mandir.” The officer added, “We have begun shifting all equipment of the makeshift hospital to other places as a spare capacity. If required again in the future, we will be able to use the infrastructure yet again.” “The government cannot keep Mahatma Mandir engaged without any use for long periods. The government plans to use the premises of Mahatma Mandir extensively before, during and after the Vibrant Summit and so we have decided to remove the temporary hospital,” said sources, who added that equipment worth over Rs 20 crore has been installed at the makeshift hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/shifting-of-covid-hospital-begins/articleshow/87346088.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||UT terminates services of NHM staff on strike||Times News Network Chandigarh: The Chandigarh administration has cracked down on protesting NHM workers by terminating their services. The health secretary said this would serve as an example for others as the workers went on strike at a time when the UT had a health crisis on its hands. Most of the NHM contractual staff went on strike on Thursday. The protesting staff included pharmacists, technicians, nurses, safai karamcharis and a few doctors demanding DC rates. However, the UT health department informed that also they want to avail leaves and benefits applicable under NHM, which is not available in case of DC rate. Thus the UT health department has agreed to their demands. The strike has been causing inconvenience with hospitals full of patients complaining of infections like dengue and seasonal viruses. “Such conduct of the staff is a clear example of indiscipline and indicates that they are not reliable. In the past, some of the staff went on strike and the present conduct of proceeding on strike without proper notice clearly indicates their habit of holding the administration to ransom,” said health secretary Yashpal Garg. He added, “We cannot allow such staff to risk the life of patients because of inappropriate conduct. To ensure smooth operation of health services in the city during the ongoing crisis of dengue and to avoid such incidents of indiscipline, we need to deal with it strictly.” The health department has decided to depute existing staff in shifts for extra duties to overcome the shortage. NHM staff members on strike will not be allowed to enter the premises of any health facility in an unauthorised manner. “Appropriate action shall be taken as per the law against the NHM staff which has not reported for duty. These employees will be terminated with immediate effect. The outsourcing agency has been requested to provide staff to substitute these NHM staff on strike,” said Garg.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ut-terminates-services-of-nhm-staff-on-strike/articleshow/87346074.cms||---

According to official documents, students will be given an additional two years, beyond the normal period, to complete their respective degrees. The existing norms state that, students enrolled for three-year undergraduate courses under the semester system are given six years from the first year of admission to complete their degrees. “All those students admitted from the session 2016-17, who, for whatever reasons, are unable to complete the programme within the normal period of the minimum duration prescribed for the programme, may be allowed additional two years to clear the backlog to be qualified for the degree,” the proposed amendment read. The official documents added that, under exceptional circumstances, further extension of one year may be granted. “The exceptional circumstances be spelt out clearly by the relevant statutory body concerned of the university. During the extended period, the student shall be considered an ex-student and not be eligible for ranking,” the document read. The document added that the time span for students who enrolled for three-year undergraduate courses in 2015-16 under the “choice-based credit system”, would continue to remain six years, while for those enrolled in the 2016-17 academic session, the time span would be five years.

Of 3,70,085 grievances received, 3,68,926 have been resolved, making it easier for farmers to avail benefits of the scheme, said a state government spokesperson. As per reports, many farmers were unable to receive benefits due to inaccuracies in documents and other errors. Also, due to discrepancies in bank records, payments were left pending and direct bank transfers aborted. The UP government was swift to carry out a campaign to resolve over 3.68lakh complaints. Merely 1,158 grievances are currently pending, the spokesperson said. Earlier, UP was awarded for fastest implementation of PMKSNS under which 2.54crore farmers had been enrolled. The state government further claimed Maharashtra, West Bengal and Rajasthan are behind UP in grievance redressal. Quoting latest data released by the Centre, the spokesperson said, maximum grievances under PMKSNS were received in Uttar Pradesh, but 99% of the cases were swiftly disposed of. Maharashtra received 85,715, of which only 48,403 have been resolved so far. Rajasthan and West Bengal stood at the third and fourth spot with 82,945 and 79,804 complaints respectively. So far, 82% cases have been resolved in Rajasthan and 98% have been resolved in Bengal, the state government claimed. Launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 24, 2019, the scheme entails an income support of Rs 6,000 per annum to small and marginal farmers having combined landholding/ownership of up to two hectares. The amount is transferred to farmers’ accounts through direct benefit transfer mode in three instalments of Rs 2,000 each.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/pm-kisan-scheme-up-tops-in-prompt-grievance-redressal/articleshow/87347828.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Monitoring, green steps must to cut air pollution||The entire world realised its own redundancy in view of the Covid-19 onslaught. So many deaths occurred all across the world. However, what draws a bigger line today is air pollution and climate change. Deaths due to air pollution have sadly been far more than Covid-19 deaths. The causes aggravating this threat lie in the human zeal to constantly achieve higher economic growth, without considering its consequences. This has led to uncontrolled industrial pollution, vehicular emission, fossil fuel-based power generators, stubble burning, forest fires, defective urban architecture, inadequate solid waste management and shrinking green cover. Judged by the new WHO standards, we have 10 times more pollutants of various grades in India. This is majorly due to our lifestyle. Indians already have 30% weaker lungs due to polluted air they breathe. The issue of clean air, therefore, must assume as much significance, if not more than ‘roti’, ‘kapda’ and ‘makaan’ (food, clothes and housing). Whatever policies or laws the government may legislate – and it has already done so with respect to vehicles, construction, industrial emissions, green cover, and agro waste management – it is amply clear that unless civic society makes it a movement, nothing much can be achieved. It is the power of civic society that has made smoking unacceptable in our drawing rooms and public places. For the sake of an awakening call, 51% pollution is emitted by our industries, 27% by vehicles, 17% by crop burning and 5% by fireworks. We can no longer afford to ignore this stark threat. Air pollution cannot be seen in isolation as ‘everything hangs together’. Even the rising temperature sets off a vicious cycle. The whole ecosystem is getting affected in terms of the loss of micro-organisms, unpredictable weather, rising sea levels, attrition in water resources, and melting glaciers. Taking a holistic view, the world is now contemplating new and effective solutions. With rising population pressures, the impact is increasing. The constant pressure for growth is compelling the corporate sector to be expedient and use half-baked technologies which are financially lucrative providing partial solutions but actually end up accentuating environmental problems. This entails survey and data collection, real-time monitoring of pollution levels and finding the cause and effect of the current technologies in vogue to zero in on its source. A source-based mitigation in a decentralised manner holds the key to sustainability. The surveys clearly indicate that life expectancy has actually reduced from 6-12 years at various places depending upon the intensity of pollution. The death toll too has gone up by 30%, solely due to air pollution, which claims at least seven million lives in the world every year. Similarly, public health has deteriorated, particularly among old people and children. Lack of proper oxygen has adverse multiple effect on the otherwise mutually supporting ecosystem. A weak link in the chain makes it vulnerable to accidental failures. Action points mainly include greener habitat, encouraging walking and cycling as well as use of public transport, segregating waste at source and converting it to manure. Further actions could include reducing and recycling plastic waste, encouraging use of natural fibres and earthen materials for making sustainable products, and sensitising children on various issues. We can eventually focus on asserting as well as pursuing the government to implement laws that support environmental health, adopting available technology to minimise carbon footprint, saving electricity, adopting solar options, using electric vehicles and evolving innovative ways in collaboration with stakeholders, locally as well as globally. Less developed countries have incongruence and inconsistency in their developmental cycle. But one needs to take action in a balanced and graduated manner with a positive mindset. To unlearn and relearn these harsh facts, critical decisionmaking for survival is the need of the hour. We need to take a fresh look at some data. What we thought would happen in 50 years, has actually occurred in 10 years, as the temperature of the planet has increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius. We as a country are reportedly below the WHO standards. UP has 13 times higher pollution as per the neo norms. A citizen loses 10-12 years of life expectancy in Lucknow, which is barely a digit less than Delhi. The annual particulate pollution rate is 22%. Even this needs to be reduced drastically.

The victim, Paromita Roy, who was posted as the sister-in charge at the CNCI’s Covid unit at Rajarhat, gave up travelling in public transport due to the pandemic. The incident happened when she was heading towards Park Street from Esplanade. “A pink manja that entangled in my neck when I was riding the scooterette inflicted a deep cut on my throat,” Roy recounted. She lodged a complaint on the Twitter account of Kolkata traffic police , prompting the cops at Lalbazar to order a probe into the incident. “I have handed over the thread, which got entangled around my neck, to the on-duty sergeant at the next crossing. Please take action,” she wrote in her complaint. Responding to the incident, senior traffic cops said they would write to civic agencies to set up height barriers like the ones on Maa flyover. They also want the barriers to be installed at AJC Bose Road and Park Street flyovers as well as Vidyasagar Setu. There have been reports of birds sustaining injuries from manja at Park Street flyover, but this is the first time that a two-wheeler rider has got injured. Police sources said surprise raids have been planned across eight police station areas in and around AJC Bose Road flyover-Maa flyover-Park Street flyover stretch. “We had carried out such raids in 2018 and could minimize accidents. We had managed to arrest over 16 people at that time,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/manja-slashes-mch-nurses-throat/articleshow/87346116.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Theatre actors thrilled to reconnect with live audience||MUMBAI: The last time Marathi actor Prashant Damle performed on the crescent-like stage of NCPA’s Tata Theatre, his character Manoj aka Manya was newly married. Today, more than a decade later, when Damle ascends the same stage, Manya would be flirting with a younger colleague while languishing in the rut of stale matrimony. The Marathi play ‘Eka Lagnachi Pudhchi Goshta’ will mark the reopening of NCPA on October 29 after a year-and-a-half-long Covid-induced gap. Like Damle, several actors are eagerly rekindling their romance with the stage in the wake of the reopening of theatres and auditoriums. While the audience’s appetite for live dramas does not seem to have been thwarted by Covid, some lament the loss-making-yet-essential 50% occupancy rule while others choose to see the glass as half full.  Seats for NCPA’s reopening day show on October 29 are fast filling. Several shows ranging from Indian classical music to Marathi and English plays too were sold out at Prithvi Theatre which opened on October 24. It’s evident, though, the term ‘housefull’ has become a misnomer. Kunal Kapoor, trustee of Prithvi Theatre, says: “While we will respect and abide by the SOPs (standard operating procedure) declared by the government, we cannot but feel the unfairness of it when the 50% rule does not apply to trains, buses, air travel, markets or anywhere else.” Raell Padamsee, head of theatre company Ace Productions, has seen production costs rise “astronomically” due to SOPs. “Only 50% rent must be charged for 50% seats,” says Padamsee, stressing the need for financial relief from the ministry of arts and culture. She has a ringside view to the dire situation of technicians, ironing men, make-up artists and others who make up theatre’s ancillary players. For set and light designer Bholanath Sharma, who has neither received any enquiries from theatre producers nor any feelers abating his fears of cost-cutting on their part, the backdrop is still bleak. “In this scenario, how do I tell technicians to come back?” asks Sharma. Deeply aware of the hardships of migrant crew workers, actor Ila Arun can empathize. “Theatre gives you a strange kind of dignity,” says Arun of Surnai theatre, which is all set to open a four-day festival in Prithvi on November 11. “You can’t beg for money even when you are in dire straits.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-theatre-actors-thrilled-to-reconnect-with-live-audience/articleshow/87346146.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

As the directions have put a spoke in the ambitious six-month special campaign ‘Shahar-2021’on a petition filed by Roshan Vyas, the urban development and housing (UDH) department is gearing up to move SC. A official source at UDH said, “A legal advise has been sought and UDH will approach SC for relief. The camps are organised to benefit the public living in urban areas in large numbers and department is majorly issuing lease deeds where people are inhabitant in the colonies.” As per rules, regularisation can only be done in cities with a population of over 1 lakh after implementing the zonal development plan. Out of 29 big cities, the zonal plans have only been put in place in few cities, including Jaipur. After the high court order, the UDH department will expedite the process of implementing zonal plans in bigger cities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/raj-to-move-sc-against-ban-on-illegal-colonies-regularisation/articleshow/87347148.cms||---

The department has advised replacing plastic wrapping papers with biodegradable ones and plastic utensils with ones made of leaves or bamboo and use bamboo sticks for earbuds, balloons and flags. With the Centre aiming to phase out single-use plastic by 2022, a notification of the Union environment ministry said polythene bags of less than 75 microns in thickness were to be banned from September 30 this year and bags of less than 120 microns from December 31. The department has advised use of environment-friendly alternatives “to control the menace of indiscriminate use of single-use plastic... to minimise (it) in day-to-day life and in order to prevent adverse effects on human beings, cattle population, soil, ecology and environment”. In its advisory, the environment department said single-use commodities like plastic sticks for ear buds, balloons, flags, candy and ice-cream be replaced with alternatives like reusable wooden or bamboo sticks. Reusable refill pens should also be used instead of use-and-throw pens. Water should be served in disposable paper glasses or reusable glass or bamboo bottles, it added. Government departments have been advised to avoid plastic decoration items like polystyrene (thermocol), frills, cellophane sheets and party bloopers and use natural flowers, leaves and paper and cloth decoration. Use of cloth or paper posters instead of plastic banners or posters has also been recommended.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/govt-depts-advised-to-avoid-single-use-plastic/articleshow/87346123.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

She issued the warning after receiving complaints in this regard. She also sought the support of Indian Medical Association (IMA) to fight dengue in Mohali. In a bid to fight dengue and other vector-borne diseases effectively, Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur held a meeting with IMA officials in her office on Thursday. She said that the directions have been issued to the medical institutions and laboratories to treat dengue patients in accordance with the guidelines of the Union government. They have also been asked not to overcharge for dengue tests and treatment. “There have been reports that a few private hospitals indulge in spreading dengue scare to earn more from patients suffering from viral fever. The hospitals should not get involved in such unethical practices,” she said. The civil surgeon directed private hospitals to report any suspected or confirmed dengue cases to the health department immediately so that remedial measures could be taken without delay. “The deadly disease can be controlled with the help and cooperation of all stakeholders, especially private hospitals which also provide services of dengue check-up and treatment,” the civil surgeon said. She added that private hospitals cannot confirm dengue fever on their own if they do not have Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test facility as the simple card based testing may lead to false results. All hospitals need to send suspected samples to the health department for confirmation. “There are three labs for confirmation of dengue fever at government hospitals in Mohali, Kharar and Derabassi,” she said. The institutions have also been asked to initiate an information, education and communication campaign (IEC) to sensitise people on precautionary measures. “There is no specific treatment for dengue fever as prevention is the best treatment. If symptoms persist, people should visit their healthcare provider immediately,” she said. District epidemiologist Dr Vikrant Nagra, Dr Surinderpal Singh, ,ember, executive committee, IMA, president Dr Sodhi, general secretary and owner of Helix Lab Dr Charandeep Singh, finance secretary Dr Dhankar attended the meeting.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/civil-surgeon-warns-pvt-hospitals-against-spreading-dengue-scare/articleshow/87346100.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Airfares, hotel tariffs soar as travel demand zooms||KOLKATA: An unprecedented surge in travel demand this winter is pushing up air fares and hotel tariffs to record levels. With demand increasing month-on-month as more people become confident to travel, the travel trade industry expects the surge to persist beyond the conventional holiday season. Tour operator Thomas Cook India senior vice-president (leisure travel) Romil Pant said domestic travel in September 2021 was up four-fold against September 2019 and was growing at a frantic pace. “Prior to the pandemic, 85% of the business revenue was from outbound and the rest was from domestic travel. But with many international destinations, including popular ones like Thailand in South-East Asia still closed to Indian travellers, the revenue pie from domestic travel has increased to 40%. In terms of travellers, 60% are in the domestic sector. While we are still at 50-55% of pre-pandemic level in outbound travel, domestic travel is increasing by 300%,” said Pant. Travel agents in the city said the huge spurt in travel was aided by both pent up demand and increased confidence due to vaccination. “The flights are going full. Fares for December at this time of the year are at record level. While the fares on domestic flights are twice the usual, that on international flights is up 2.5-3 times,” said Travel Agents’ Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni. Anil Punjabi, the eastern region chairman of Travel Agents’ Federation of India, said the surge in the domestic sector was fuelled by many outbound travellers also visiting domestic destinations. “The rush has prompted several hotels to charge premium rates. Revenge tourism has fuelled the boom,” he said. While Kashmir, Leh-Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Goa and Andaman & Nicobar are in demand in the domestic circuit, Maldives, Dubai, Egypt, Russia, France, Switzerland and Germany are sought after internationally. “There is a huge demand for honeymoon travel, both because couples who have got married in the past 18 months have not been able to travel till now and also because due to the restriction in the number of guests, spends at the weddings have been low and now they have more disposable funds for the trip,” said Pant. Apart from higher airfares and hotel tariffs, Covid SOP compliance and travel cover has also added to travel cost. Insurance is up 15-20% but includes Covid coverage. In Covid compliance, it is usually RT-PCR test requirements. Incidentally, travel options are open to only those who are fully vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/airfares-hotel-tariffs-soar-as-travel-demand-zooms/articleshow/87346126.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Delhi||Delhi-NCR: ‘Very poor’ measures under GRAP come into force, diesel generator sets banned||NEW DELHI: With the air quality likely to deteriorate, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Thursday enforced certain “very poor” measures of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) with immediate effect in Delhi-NCR. The use of diesel generator sets has been banned and parking fee enhanced by three-four times to discourage the use of private vehicles. Track the pollution level in your cityDiesel generator sets, however, can be used for emergency purposes. The essential services exempted from the ban include medical services (hospitals, nursing homes, healthcare facilities), elevators/escalators, railway services/stations, Delhi Metro services, including trains and stations, airports and ISBTs, sewage treatment plants, national security and defence-related activities. The enhanced parking fee would have to be implemented by the municipal corporations. Sources said the order was not enforced in the past because the charges were not decided under the parking policy. Other “very poor” measures of GRAP include increasing bus and Metro services by augmenting buses running on contract and increasing their frequency, ensuring uninterrupted power supply to discourage the use of generator sets, stopping the use of coal/firewood in hotels and open eateries and mechanised/vacuum-based sweeping of roads. Directions have also been issued to ensure water sprinkling alongside usage of dust suppressants (at least every alternate day) on roads, especially at hotspots, heavy traffic corridors, vulnerable areas (before peak hours) and proper disposal of dust collected in designated sites or landfills. The agencies concerned have been asked to do regular inspections for strict enforcement of dust-control measures at construction sites. CPCB has asked residents’ welfare associations and individual house owners to provide electric heaters during winter to security staff to avoid open burning by them. Citizens have been asked to check air polluting activities, including keeping PUC certificate up to date, keeping engines of vehicles properly tuned, maintaining proper air pressure in tyres, adhering to lane driving, optimising use of vehicles, not disposing of waste in the open and reporting air pollution activities through the SAMEER app, social media platforms and other public grievance portals. People have also been asked to avoid dust gathering construction activities from October to January, if possible.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/very-poor-measures-under-grap-come-into-force-dg-sets-banned/articleshow/87346155.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 2 middlemen held for taking bribe for ASI in Barmer district.||JAISALMER: The ACB arrested two middlemen for taking bribe of Rs 50,000 in Dhorimanna police station area in Barmer district. In the initial probe, it has been found that both the middlemen had demanded the bribe for an ASI working in Dhorimanna police station. The ACB team is inquiring ASI Magan Khan. The action was taken by Jodhpur rural police inspector Amra Ram Khokhar under the supervision of ACB DIG Jodhpur zone Kailash Chand Vishnoi. Vishnoi said that a person complained to the ACB that a case is lodged in Dhorimanna police station against his son and nephew, and that Khan was investigating the case. To get them out of the case, the complainant met Khan and e-mitra owner and middleman Tara Ram. Tara Ram demanded Rs 50,000 for Khan, to get his name out from the case. He said that after the complaint, it was planned to trap Khan and Tara Ram. On Thursday, Tara Ram was nabbed taking Rs 50,000 from the complainant.  Tara Ram, after counting the money, gave it to his colleague Birbal Nai. ACB recovered the amount from Nai and arrested the duo. The DIG said that investigating officer Magan Khan has been detained and is being inquired.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/2-middlemen-held-for-taking-bribe-for-asi/articleshow/87346149.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Not Net ban, experts bat for online tests to check cheating||JAIPUR: Turning off mobile internet services during government recruitment exams to prevent cheating have yielded little results even as the shutdown caused large-scale disruptions in digital communications. A series of incidents during recently held REET and Patwari recruitment exams demonstrated that the state’s cheating mafias are adept at using bluetooth enabled innerwears, slippers and small calling devices to rig the recruitment process. In other places, dummy candidates were nabbed from centres, raising questions about gaping holes in the security. Many experts and officials told TOI that examination agencies should consider bluetooth jammers, Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled tools and online tests that could make the process seamless and weed out unfair practices including proxy candidates. Former DG Kapil Garg believes that the online exam process could infuse greater transparency in the process. “There are many benefits of online-based tests. For instance, a question paper is uploaded only when the student logs into his or her account. No one else can access the particular paper other than the student. Also, there are AI tools that can scan if there are any inconsistencies at a particular centre,” he said.  The state had experimented with online testing for the first time during the constable recruitment exam in 2018, but scrapped it soon after an investigation agency busted a cheating gang trying to rig the test. After 2018, the authorities got cold feet and abandoned online tests once for all. However, several officials believe that the government should now look beyond its 2018 experience. “The pen and paper-based exams are far more susceptible to cheating compared to online tests. For instance, during an online test, a question paper will be decrypted only when the exam starts. Multiple sets of question papers can be used so that no student anticipate knowing which paper he or she will get,” said an official, adding that multiple exams conducted by central government agencies have successfully moved to online tests now. “If the central government can conduct online exams, then why can’t we do it here in Rajasthan. If there’s monkey business at a particular centre, it would not affect the overall process,” an official said. Meanwhile, cyber expert Mukesh Choudhary said internet shutdown alone cannot put curbs on cheating. “The range of a bluetooth device, concealed inside clothes or ears, can be extended up to 40 metres. Therefore, bluetooth jammers are needed too,” he said. Choudhary also said if jammers cannot be placed, then invigilators need to be trained to use scanners to identify active bluetooth devices. “I also believe that stringent regulations and monitoring processes should be accommodated to conduct online tests for transparency and minimizing rigging,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/not-net-ban-experts-bat-for-online-tests-to-check-cheating/articleshow/87347161.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Lone ground-handling agency at airport leads to flight delay fears||KOLKATA: The Airlines Operators’ Committee at Kolkata airport has expressed fears of flight delays next month when flight count returns to pre-Covid strength with just one ground handling agency (GHA) required to cater service to over 80 flights a day. A second GHA that was present earlier has exited after its term expired. A new GHA has been appointed but will be able to start operations only in December 2021 or January 2022 when various approvals are in place. Ground handlers are the wheels that run airline industry and provide a host of services that are crucial for aircraft operations, including guiding aircraft into and out of parking position, towing with pushback tractors, lavatory drainage, water cartage, airstart units, luggage handling, ground power, passenger stairs, wheelchair lifts and hydraulic mules. “Ground handling staff board passengers, load and unload bags, clean planes and get them ready. All these operations have to be done within an hour for international flights, and within 25 to 40 minutes for domestic flights. The only agency currently available at Kolkata airport has been handling a maximum of 40-50 flights a day. Handling twice the number is a big challenge and is already affecting services,” an airline official said. Apart from more manpower, AI Airport Services Ltd (AIASL) requires more equipment to handle so many flights. AIASL CEO Rambabu Chintalacheruvu said the organization was ready to handle the flights with the manpower and equipment. “Since scheduled international flight operations have not commenced as yet, entire staff are being used for the flights now. We are gearing up for handling the scheduled international flights. We are fully aware of the challenge and take every step to handle our client airlines flights,” he said. While IndiGo and SpiceJet have their own ground handling teams, all other airlines operating from Kolkata airport are serviced by AIASL after the exit of Bhadra International. Prior to Bhadra’s exit, AIASL was handling two domestic airlines — Air India and Go First. The second ground handling agency Indo Thai Airport Management Services may start operations in two-three months. “Till the second agency starts operation, AIASL has a monopoly. That is also a worrying factor as it discourages competition and service efficiency,” said a representative of a private carrier.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/lone-ground-handling-agency-at-airport-leads-to-flight-delay-fears/articleshow/87346157.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Alarming rise in dengue cases in Raichur||RAICHUR: At the time when the entire country is on guard against Covid-19, an old disease has snuck in, and caught the people and authorities in Raichur unawares: Dengue. Cases of dengue are rising at an alarming rate in the district, prompting the health department to constitute several teams to take stock of the scale of the crisis, and take steps to check the spread of the infection. In the past two months, more than 350 people are suspected to have caught the disease in the district, with 73 patients being confirmed. So far, four people have succumbed to dengue in the past two months, although the authorities are yet to confirm if they died of the disease, since they were not treated at a government hospital. Among the reasons being attributed for the spike in dengue cases in the district is the irregular supply of drinking water to various localities, which compels the residents to store water for long periods, turning those vessels into a fertile breeding ground for deadly mosquitoes. On the other hand, the recent spell of heavy showers that have left puddles aplenty on the roads and in open areas, too have contributed to the rise in the population of these mosquitoes. Manvi taluk in Raichur district has been affected the most by the dengue menace. Taking cognisance of the rampancy of the disease in the district, the administration has issued a circular to all private hospitals, asking them to report suspected dengue cases. Sources in the health department fear that many patients who may actually be reeling under dengue could be getting treated for viral fever. “We suspect that there are more than 200 people suffering from dengue in the district,” a health department official said. Syed Hafizullah, an activist in Raichur, said that the district administration did not take the issue seriously when dengue cases were initially reported. “They thought these were just isolated cases, and the situation has spiralled out of control now. Worse still, the district has no deputy commissioner. In the Bangladesh camp alone, four to five people have succumbed to dengue but the district administration does not have a record that can attest to this,” he rued. Raichur district health officer Dr Nagaraj said that members of each team would visit at least 100 homes every day, and ascertain the conditions to store water. “We have come across cases wherein residents store water in barrels for weeks together, and this water goes unused. I have asked the departments concerned to streamline supply of water. In the urban pockets, we are conducting operations to get rid of mosquitoes,” Dr Nagaraj added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/alarming-rise-in-dengue-cases-in-raichur/articleshow/87344646.cms||Shreyas HS

Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital has started a new comprehensive stroke care centre, where facility for immediate treatment is available. Earlier, the stroke cases were taken to emergency unit, where doctors in medicine were attending them initially, but now as the facility of a separate stoke centre in Bangar block of the SMS Hospital has been started, the patient can be rushed there directly and be treated on time.  “A patient who has suffered a stroke should get the correct treatment within four-and-a-half hours of suffering a stroke. The doctors have to give an injection which is life-saving which works effectively if given within four-and-a-half hours of suffering the stroke. Attendants should not waste time and directly take the patient to where the facility of treatment of stroke is available. Also, ambulance staff should also be made aware that they have to rush such patients directly to hospitals having stroke treatment facilities,” said Dr Dinesh Khandelwal, senior professor (neurology), SMS Medical College. Stroke is caused when blockage in vessels of the brain affects blood supply in the brain, and the same blockage can be removed with thrombectomy. The new stroke unit has come up after stroke cases increased during the second wave of Covid. “We have witnessed some cases who were brought to the hospital with stroke but when we got their test done, they were found Covid-positive,” said Dr Khandelwal. It was due to hypercoagulability developed in patients because of Covid infection that the hospitals saw more patients of stroke in Covid, but now such cases are not being reported as Covid cases are not being reported in increased numbers.  “A lot of elderly persons had suffered from stroke during the second wave of Covid. But, for us, the cause of worry was that we have seen a lot of young people infected with Covid who did not have any comorbidity such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking habits, sedentary lifestyle or high cholesterol. Despite that, they suffered from stroke during second wave of Covid,” said Dr Rashim Kataria, professor (neurosurgery), SMS Medical College. Several private hospitals and doctors are also raising awareness on importance of recognising early signs of stroke and timely treatment. “Good control of hypertension, diabetes and lifestyle changes regarding regular sleep, tobacco intake goes a long way in preventive recurrent stroke. Stroke normally occurs in older age groups. However, an increasing incidence is reported in younger population due to poor lifestyle,” said Dr Neetu Ramrakhiani, director at a private hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/stroke-care-centre-at-sms-hosp-for-timely-treatment/articleshow/87347168.cms||---

---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Family worships painting of Kannada goddess for 68 years||GADAG: Andanappa Doddameti, a politician of Jakli village, Ron taluk, played a vital role in the unification of Karnataka by motivating people to participate in that movement. His family has been worshipping the oil painting of Kannadambe (mother of Kannada) Bhuvaneshwari since 1953 to this day. His grandson and Kannada activist Ravindranath Doddameti told TOI that Andanappa persuaded artist CN Patil to do the painting in 1953. He said this portrait has been worshipped by Kannadigas and carried in all processions and events till the unification of Karnataka. He added: “It was a major attraction in all events of the unification movement. Those involved in the movement offered puja to this portrait and this painting became quite popular. Even after unification, people offered puja to the painting. Many organisations and activists made copies of it for worship.” Professor CR Govindraju, dean, social science faculty, Kannada University, Hampi, mentioned the painting in his book ‘Kannadamma’. Andanappa, who was a minister in the Mysore government, worshipped the portrait at home till his death on February 21, 1972. “Since then, his family continues with the ritual,” Ravindranath said. He added: “We preserved the original painting which measures 4.5ft x 3.5ft. We offer aarti in the morning and evening daily without fail. Many people visit our home to see it. They have got it reprinted for their offices, schools, colleges and other places.” Govindaraju said: “We’re really proud of Andanappa and his family. In the painting are important elements like the statue of Lord Gomateshwara, Jog Falls, etc. This family is setting an example to others to nurture Kannada.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/family-worships-painting-ofkannada-goddess-for-68-years/articleshow/87344657.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

---||Delhi||Delhi air pollution: Farm fire share nears 20%||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality, which was in the ‘poor’ category on Thursday, is likely to worsen from Friday when it is predicted to touch the ‘very poor’ range. The contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 rose from 16% on Wednesday to 19% on Thursday, the highest so far this season. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was 268 on Thursday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Though the overall air quality remained in the ‘poor’ category, eight monitoring stations— Shadipur, NSIT Dwarka, Nehru Nagar, Bawana, Pusa, Mundka, Anand Vihar and IHBAS-Dilshad Garden—were in the ‘very poor’ category on Thursday evening. Experts said stubble burning and calm wind conditions during the night time would affect the air quality. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the union ministry of earth sciences, said, “Delhi’s AQI is in the poor category. Effective fire count of stubble burning in the northwest region of Delhi is 502 and its share in PM2.5 is about 19% as transport level winds are north-westerly. As predicted by SAFAR, the AQI is now forecast to degrade to ‘very poor’ category by Friday and likely to remain so till Saturday.” An analysis done by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) reveals that over 7,300 and 1,796 farm fires were reported in Punjab and Haryana, respectively, between September 1 and October 27. The share of farm fires to Delhi’s air pollution has remained 10-20% so far, says CEEW. LS Kurinji, programme associate, CEEW, said Delhi’s air quality had started deteriorating to the ‘poor’ category since Wednesday. “With north-west winds being forecast over Delhi-NCR and if more farm fires happen in the next two days, smoke from farmlands coupled with emissions from local sources, declining temperatures and reducing wind speeds will worsen air quality in Delhi and surrounding areas,” said Kurinji.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/farm-fire-share-nears-20/articleshow/87346178.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Police and CU sources said the HoD of a department — whose name featured as a sender — has also presented her version of events to cops. A probe at the GPO, correspondingly, has led cops to believe that it was posted from a south Kolkata post office. Cops said they now have reasons to believe that the number of suspects need to be expanded. “Besides those on our radar, the fact that someone else might have used the contractual lab assistant’s name cannot be ruled out as yet,” said police. Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma refused to share any detail. “The probe is at an important stage and details cannot be divulged,” he said. Police said now that they have a rough timeline of when the letter was posted, CCTV footage in and around the post office will be investigated. The letter, which reached the CU VC three days ago, read, “Madam, your husband will be killed, and nobody can save the life of your husband.” CU VC Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee declined comment earlier.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ex-cs-threat-cops-record-statements/articleshow/87346169.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||As cases drop, 500 Covid-19 care centres shut in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: More than 500 Covid care centres (CCC) have been shut across the state following the consistent drop in Covid-19 cases over the past few months. The state’s recent data shows currently around 2,083 CCCs are functional, down from 2,589 in August. When the second wave was picking up pace in April, the state had 2,220 CCCs, which had to be promptly scaled up to 2,626 by May. The state had recorded its peak active cases in the range of 6-6.9 lakh between mid-April and May. CCCs were used to quarantine asymptomatic or positive patients with mild symptoms. Schools, marriage halls, offices and college classrooms were converted into CCCs during the peak. As cases started seeing a decline, most were handed back to their parent agencies, state officials said. The state currently has 23,200 active cases, of which 9,060 (39%) are in hospital. Around 1,544 patients are in the ICU while over 2,300 are on oxygen support. State officials said while CCCs have been scaled down, designated Covid health centres (DCHCs) and dedicated Covid hospitals (DCHs) have been kept in the readiness mode. There are 3,046 DCHCs and 1,148 DCHs in the state with more than 2 lakh beds. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said the decision to close down CCCs has been left to local administrators. “Districts collectors and health officials are taking a decision on CCCs based on cases and their local conditions. Due to a significant decline, many have shut as keeping them active also requires resources,” he said. The state, in one of its recent updates, said at least 20 districts have fewer than 100 active cases. Among them, Nandurbar didn’t have a single active case on Thursday. While eight districts, including Bhandara, Gondia, Washim, Wardha, had cases in single digits. Dr Avinash Aaher, district health officer (DHO) of Washim, said they have shut 14 of their 18 CCCs in the past two months. “We were hardly getting one or two patients sporadically. So, we decided to shut them and return the structures to the owners. We are sending the positive patients to DCHCs now,” he said. Dr D S Potode, assistant DHO of Jalgaon, said 90 of their CCCs have been completely shut. “We used to have 2-3 cases in the entire week. However, if needed we can start them at short notice,” he said. In Mumbai, there are 80 CCC1 facilities where high and low risk contacts of patients are shifted. Out of nearly 16,000 beds, merely 540 are occupied. The 182 CCC2 facilities for asymptomatic patients have 25,000 beds of which only 1400-0dd are occupied. The state plans build 60-70 field hospitals to cater to patients round-the-year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-as-cases-drop-500-covid-care-centres-shut-in-state/articleshow/87346189.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Police, however, have not confirmed that it was a case of witch-hunting. The incident took place at Magru village under the Kovali police station area in Potka block of East Singhbhum. According to locals, the woman was dragged out of her house by the two villagers, stripped and assaulted. Later, her body was found on farmland in the backyard of her house.

The husband of the deceased identified as Chand Murmu told the police that he was also beaten up by the accused when he resisted their bid to drag his wife out of the house.” Meena added that land dispute seems to be the motive behind the killing but a detailed investigation on the matter is underway. “Both the accused have been arrested. A detailed interrogation will reveal the truth,” he said. The accused were identified as Mangal Murmu and Dhapar Murmu both of whom are residents of Magru village. The duo is said to be the relatives of the victim. When asked, the SP said, “As per our preliminary investigation, it does not appear to be a case of witch-hunting, but it can’t be ruled out. We are probing the case from every angle.” Her body has been taken to MGM hospital for an autopsy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/woman-killed-in-suspected-witch-hunting-case-in-e-singhbhum/articleshow/87346282.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The civic body has decided to combine two proposed flyovers and build a continuous one in the eastern part of the city. VMC had taken up work on two different flyovers in the city. The Gujarat Municipal Finance Board had also given a nod for these flyovers at the Sardar Estate crossroads and Vrundavan crossroads in the eastern part. The project is aimed at easing traffic on Ajwa Road and Waghodiya Road areas. These were selected from a list of six prepared by the civic body after the state government had decided to construct 54 bridges in municipal corporations in the city in the 2019-20 state budget. The civic body proposed to construct a flyover at the Sangam Crossroads at a cost of Rs 55.39 crore and another at the busy Vrundavan Crossroads at a cost of Rs 56.74 crore. The works were taken up for discussion in a coordination meeting of the civic body with the elected representatives of the city in August. At the meeting, it was suggested that instead of two flyovers on the same road at short distances, one should be build so that it crosses over both the Vrundavan and Sardar Estate crossroads. The civic body got a fresh detailed project report prepared for a longer flyover. The flyover will cost Rs 130.9crore. It will be longest in the easter parts of the city. It will be around 1.93km long and the second-longest in the city after the under construction flyover from Genda Circle to Manisha crossroads.

---||India||30% drop in OECD migration||NEW DELHI: The Covid-19 crisis caused the sharpest drop of over 30% in permanent migration flow to the OECD nations. At about 37 lakh, permanent migration numbers were at their lowest level since 2003. Family migration showed the largest decline. Before the pandemic in 2019, the permanent migration flow to OECD nations stood at 53 lakh, with similar figures for 2018 and 2017. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is an association of 38 member countries, such as European countries, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. On Thursday, OECD's annual report - International Migration Outlook (2021) - indicated that foreign-born workers have been disproportionally affected by job losses since the pandemic began. The migration report dives deep into data for 2019. Here, Indians topped the charts when it came to acquiring citizenship in OECD countries. China continued to retain its top slot (which it has held for decades) as the largest source country of new immigrants, followed by India. Nearly 1.5 lakh Indians acquired citizenship of an OECD country during 2019. Nearly 63,578 Indians acquired US citizenship (which is 7.5% of the total new citizens during this period). Canada was another popular choice for the Indian diaspora, with 31,329 Indians acquiring its citizenship (12.5% of the total new citizens). Further, 28,470 Indians became Australian citizens and 14,680 acquired UK citizenship.  The report stated that countries for which 2020 data was available saw citizenship numbers drop by 17% compared to 2019. This is largely due to the major drop in absolute numbers in the US, where naturalisations (citizenships awarded) fell by 3.3 lakh, to reach their lowest level since 2003 at 5.2 lakh. Part of the decline seems due to delays by Covid-related office closures. The numbers fell in UK, Germany, France too. During 2019, Chinese and Indians continued to be the largest groups of new immigrants. With the arrival of 4.6 lakh migrants from China during 2019 (35,000 more than in the previous year), it represented almost 7% of the total new migrant inflow to OECD countries. Nearly 4 lakh Indians migrated to OECD countries during 2019, an increase of around 53,000 over the previous year. Migration from India represented 6% of the overall migration. In particular, the number of new Indian migrants increased sharply over 2018 in the UK (by 30 000), in Canada (by 15 000), and to a lesser extent in Germany (by 5000). Interestingly, the growth in new migrants from India over this two-year period is 15.5% whereas for China it is 8.3%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/30-drop-in-oecd-migration/articleshow/87349798.cms||Lubna Kably

The objective behind the proposed increase is to correct the problem of Inverted Duty Structure faced by a small segment of the textile value chain, which according to the stakeholders, constitutes not more than 15% of the total Industry. They argue that the proposed increase will create greater stress on the working capital requirements of the industry, especially the MSME Sector, which is already struggling to achieve pre-pandemic levels of growth given the ongoing increase in the cost of raw materials such as yarn, fabric, fuel, packaging materials, transportation, etc. According to Ashok Todi, President, WBHA & chairman, Lux Industries, “Adding another increment will lead to a very severe drop in consumption, or a shift to cheaper and lower quality goods. K B Agarwala, President, FOHMA, & MD of Rupa Company, said, “An increase in taxes by as much as 7% will lead to a much higher level of job losses - possibly in excess of 2 million.” As a result, the industry has urged the Central and state governments and the GST Council to review their decision and maintain the current GST rate on the hosiery, knitwear fabric and garment industry. “We believe that a far more beneficial and reasonable solution, which will not only resolve the inverted duty structure anomaly but also give a fillip to the industry,” said Sanjay Kumar Jain, vice president, FOHMA.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/textile-sector-worries-over-proposed-gst-rate-hike-from-5-to-12/articleshow/87346322.cms||---

There are fears among traders that the deluge of IPOs in the next two weeks may prompt people to withdraw money from listed stocks to invest in those offerings. The sensex closed 1,159 points lower at 59,985 with ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank contributing the most to the day's loss. On the NSE, the broader Nifty too closed 354 points lower at 17,857 points. On the BSE, the day's loss left investors poorer by Rs 4.8 lakh crore with market capitalisation now at Rs 263.5 lakh crore, official data showed. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) led the selling with the day's net outflow at Rs 3,819 crore, according to the exchange's data. Domestic funds, however, were net buyers at Rs 837 crore. The selling by foreign funds was part of the recent trend. "Relentless selling by FPIs over two weeks has led to weakness in the market," said Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka. "They have sold over Rs 10,000 crore worth of Indian equities in the past five sessions. Further, mixed earnings season along with premium valuations also exerted pressure as there is little room for disappointment," Khemka said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sensex-crashes-1k-points-below-60k/articleshow/87349851.cms||---
---||Goa||Board sends Vasco air pollution draft report back to IIT||Panaji: After discussing and suggesting changes to IIT-Bombay’s draft report on a source appropriation study it had undertaken to pinpoint the cause of air pollution at Vasco, the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) has given the report back to the institute to allow it to incorporate the corrections and submit a revised draft. The report is very important, an official said, which is why the board wants it to be fool-proof before it is accepted and released in the public domain. The state has witnessed several agitations due to air pollution in the port town and this report is expected to ascertain the exact cause of that pollution. IIT-Bombay had submitted its final draft report on the source appropriation study to the GSCPB in September, following which the board’s technical advisory committee perused it and gave its suggestions. “We have now asked IIT-Bombay to furnished a revised draft report,” GSPCB chairman Ganesh Shetgaonkar, said. The institute had been tasked with conducting a source appropriation study following allegations of coal pollution at Vasco. The first phase of the report had stated that coal was not the only mineral behind air pollution in the area. A senior GSPCB official said that while the interim report hadn’t pinpointed the reason for pollution in Vasco, the second phase would provide details about the exact source of pollution. The first phase began in April 2017 and was completed in May the following year. Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) is bearing the cost of the entire study, which has been pegged at over Rs 94 lakh, a senior GSPCB official had said. Identification of sampling locations, monitoring ambient air quality, and locating pollution sources are part of the study’s scope. These were conducted as per guidelines of the Central Pollution Control Board.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/board-sends-vasco-air-pollution-draft-report-back-to-iit/articleshow/87346528.cms||---

ICGS Sarthak, the fourth of the five offshore patrol vessels (OPV) being built by GSL as part of a follow-on order, will be based at Porbandar in Gujarat. The fifth and the last OPV of the indigenous project, ICGS Saksham, is likely to be delivered later this year. Chairman and managing director of GSL B B Nagpal said that the public sector shipyard has managed to adhere to the stipulated timelines despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. These 2,450 tonne offshore patrol vessels are multi-mission platforms capable of undertaking varied maritime operations. The 105-mt-long warship is propelled by two 9,100-kilowatt diesel engines designed to attain a maximum speed of 26 knots. The ship is fitted with state-of-the-art equipment, machinery, sensors and weapons, which enable it to function as a command platform and undertake mandated Coast Guard charter of duties including search and rescue, combating maritime crimes and preserving and protecting the marine environment. "Indian Coast Guard is a pioneer in inducting indigenous platforms and ICGS Sarthak is a glowing example of Atmanirbhar Bharat," said director general of Indian Coast Guard K Natarajan. According to GSL, the OPVs have 70% indigenous equipment. ICGS Sarthak is commanded by deputy inspector general MM Syed with a crew of 11 officers and 110 men. The ship will operate on India’s Western seaboard under the operational and administrative control of the Northwest Coast Guard Region. The ship, with critical surveillance machinery and weapon systems, will form a formidable part of the Coast Guard fleet and will be used for protection of India’s Exclusive Economic Zone and territorial waters as well as anti-drug trafficking operations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/gsl-built-offshore-vessel-joins-coast-guard-fleet/articleshow/87346581.cms||---

During her three-day tour, Banerjee is expected to interact with the party’s local unit, community members and also interact with local politicians. Banerjee was welcomed by TMC national vice-president and former Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro and Independent MLA from Sanguem Prasad Gaonkar among others. Saffron groups, who were also present at the airport, waved black flags and raised slogans of ‘Jai Shree Ram’ to protest Banerjee’s arrival. The groups also breached the police cordon set up during the protest. Coinciding with Banerjee’s visit, hoardings of ‘Jai Shree Ram’ have been put up across the tourist state, reminiscent of similar slogans being raised during the bitter Bengal elections. BJP had used the slogan to rile Banerjee, but thestate BJP unit has denied its involvement. Meanwhile, former legislator Lavoo Mamledar condemned activists for defacing and destroying posters put up by TMC. “There are video clips and photos of TMC posters being torn, painted over. This is the first time that we have seen so much hatred. Why is there such vitriolic practice and hatred now? It is clear that they are afraid of TMC after the chargesheet that we released. They don’t have any answers,” Mamledar said. Banerjee will meet the local TMC unit on Friday at International Centre Goa at 10am after which she will head to Betim to meet with fishermen at 12pm. Post-noon, the Bengal chief minister will visit a couple of religious places in Goa and then return to ICG for a meeting with civil society members. TMC said that by defacing banners across the state, BJP have proved that the law and order situation in Goa is poor. “This is very bad. Nobody would ever destroy posters and write some disgusting things. They want to make Goa into UP it looks like,” Jayesh Shetgaonkar said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/mamata-arrives-in-goa-to-chants-of-jai-shree-ram/articleshow/87346636.cms||---

Further, they have been asked to remove the hoarding within three days, failing which, action would be initiated and the hoarding will be removed by involving the police. Shristhal sarpanch Pandurang Gaonkar alleged that the group installed the hoarding in connivance with some members who might be registered in this ward.

---||India||6 charged with sedition in 2 cities||AGRA: Three Kashmiri students arrested by Agra police after they allegedly cheered on social media Pakistan's win against India in the recent T-20 World Cup match were booked for sedition on Thursday. A day earlier Kashmiri students had appealed to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath for leniency and prayed that the FIR against the youths be dropped. The sedition charge was added to other IPC sections - "promoting enmity, committing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony, making statements conducting public mischief" - and those under relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act that had already been invoked against them. The students from Agra's Raja Balwant Singh Engineering Technical Institute were remanded to 14-day judicial custody. There was drama outside the courtroom as members of the BJP youth wing tried to hit the students while raising anti-Pakistan slogans. A few lawyers, too, heckled the pupils and attempted to land punches on them as they were being escorted by police to the district jail. Circle officer Saurabh Singh confirmed to TOI on Thursday that section 124A (sedition) of the IPC has been added to the FIR. Jagdishpura station house officer, Pravin Kumar Singh, said the section was included after "initial investigation into the matter". TOI had earlier reported that B S Kushwaha, director (academics) at RBS Engineering Technical Institute, had said that the students did not shout pro-Pakistan slogans. College authorities had demanded action against the BJP workers for putting pressure on the management after barging into the institute and "misbehaving" with staff. The college has, however, suspended the students, reacting to allegations that they had said and posted things favouring Pakistan on social media. PDP president Mehbooba Mufti demanded immediate release of the students. The J&K Students' Association, which had written to Yogi on Wednesday, again sought mercy for the students on "humanitarian grounds". J&K hospital staffer sacked for celebrating Pak victoryThe Rajouri Government Medical College ordered the termination of service of an operation theatre technician for posting a WhatApp status celebrating Pakistan's win.

Councillor Ravindra Naik proposed the resolution that was seconded by councillor Vitorino Tavares. A few days ago, a group of Dambab’s devotees had met Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai with the demand. They had also urged Sardesai to have the traffic circle aesthetically renovated from an architectural point of view. “We Madgaonkars and many other devotees from Goa worship Lord Dambab with great divinity and fervour. Hence, I really felt good that MMC respected our word. This will help to spread spirituality and divine message among the devotees of Dambab,” Sardesai said. Councillors who are part of the Goa Forward Party panel had also passed a similar resolution to name the erstwhile Bolshe Circle at Borda as the St Joaquim Circle. The two traffic islands will be maintained by We For Fatorda, an initiative started by Sardesai. The Old Market Circle has also been developed by the charity group.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/margao-circle-to-be-named-after-dambab/articleshow/87346680.cms||---

Gosavi had evaded Pune police for more than three years. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI, "A Pune crime branch team took him into custody at around 3 am from a lodge in Katraj. He was using an alias, 'Sachin Patil', to continuously travel on long-distance trains from one place to another, including Lucknow and Fatehpur Sikri, besides his native place Jalgaon, Hyderabad, Navi Mumbai and Mumbai. He reached Pune on Wednesday." Gosavi had gone into hiding after NCP minister Nawab Malik said he had several criminal cases lodged against him.

The agitating teachers alleged that despite being hired as part-time teachers they were made to work full-time for several years. “The designation was part-time, but none of the headmasters or school principals treated us like part-time teachers. We worked full time and were give a lot of responsibilities and we have been working like this for 10-12 years,” one of the teachers said. The teachers said that former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had assured them that their demands will be addressed. “We have met chief minister Pramod Sawant at least 12 times and we got a lot of promises, but till date we are not getting regularised,” a teacher said. The contract teachers submitted a memorandum to GFP working president Kiran Kandolkar demanding to take up their issue of regularisation and salary increment. “Our joint secretary John Nazareth will write to the chief secretary today itself,” Kandolkar said. GFP organisational general secretary Durgadas Kamat said that party president Vijai Sardesai has asked the party to support the teachers. The teachers are paid Rs 15,000 to Rs 18,000 per month, which they said is difficult to make ends meet. TMC functionary Pratibha Borkar said that it hurts to see teachers, who educate the future generation of the state and the country, are forced to sit and protest for job security.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/gfp-tmc-rush-to-support-protesting-contract-teachers/articleshow/87346717.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Covid antibodies found in 97% of Delhi residents||NEW DELHI: The sixth serological survey in the capital has revealed that as much as 97% of Delhi's population has Covid-19 antibodies, a substantial increase from the 56.1% reported in the previous survey carried out in January, prior to the second wave in the country. An agency report on Wednesday had put the figure at over 90%. Prevalence of Covid antibodies ranges from 93.3% to 99.8% across 11 districts of the city. Almost all vaccinated people have developed antibodies. Four districts have over 99% seropositivity. The highest seroprevalence was 92.3% among people above 50 years, followed by 90.3% in the 18-49 age group and 81.8% in those below 18. The final figure across ages is higher at 97% after adjusting for presumed false negatives in the tests. Presence of antibodies lower in below-18 populationAnnouncing the results of the survey conducted across 280 wards, including the Delhi Cantonment and NDMC areas, during the last week of September and the first week of October, health minister Satyendra Jain on Thursday urged people not to get complacent and continue to strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. The presence of Covid antibodies has significantly increased in Delhi from the first sero survey which was conducted in June 2020 and had revealed only 22.8% positivity. The second sero survey conducted in August 2020 had showed 28.7% positivity, the third, conducted in September 2020, 25.1% positivity, and the fourth, conducted in October 2020, 25.5% positivity. The last one conducted in January 2021 had, however, showed a significant positivity rate of 56.13%. After the fourth survey, experts had advised the government to increase the gap between the two surveys and the government followed the advice. East district had the highest seroprevalence of 99.8%, followed by North East district with 99.7%. South West district had the lowest seroprevalence of 93.3%. All the previous rounds of the survey had revealed significant variations in the seroprevalence levels between the districts with the densely-populated ones reporting higher seroprevalence in some surveys and lower in some. The latest results point to herd immunity which means that the capital is currently safe from the coronavirus with almost its entire population having Covid antibodies due to vaccination or a Covid infection. More women have antibodies as compared to men. Health minister Jain said 100 samples were collected from each ward. "The government collected 28,000 samples of random people from all these 280 wards. Seroprevalence was higher in females (90.1%) as compared to males (88.2%)," he said. The samples represented all sections of the people, from those living in slums to residents of affluent areas, and covered a wide range, from five years and above. The sero survey has shown that the population with a history of symptomatic Covid-19 infection, irrespective of severity, had significantly higher seropositivity compared to those without such a history. Among those who had taken at least one dose of Covid vaccine, 94.9% reported the presence of antibodies while among those who had taken both doses, 94.8% had antibodies. The presence of antibodies was lower in the below-18 population, which was not eligible to take the vaccine, and those above 18 who did not receive any dose. Only 82% of people among them had antibodies. Experts say seroprevalence in 60% or more in a population indicates herd immunity because when such a large part of the population develops antibodies against a virus, the chain of transmission is broken and the spread of the disease diminishes. The Delhi government had launched a sero survey in April for which collection of blood samples had also started but the government was forced to cut it short because the capital began witnessing a massive surge in Covid cases. A health department official said the sero survey was conducted along with Maulana Azad Medical College. "We used CLIA technology, which is more sensitive than ELISA, and the samples were tested at ILBS so that there is uniformity across the city."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/covid-antibodies-found-in-97-of-delhi-residents/articleshow/87350053.cms||AlokKNMishra

Chairman of Central Election Commission of Uzbekistan Zainiddin M Nizamkhodjaev and Chandra held a bilateral meeting on October 21 regarding electoral cooperation on October 21. Nizamkhodijaev briefed Chandra about the measures taken for conduct of this Presidential election such as single electronic voters’ list, arrangements for in-person voting on poll day and early voting as well as Covid safety arrangements. Chandra spoke about the recent conduct of elections in India and various avenues for further strengthening electoral ties between the two countries through signing of MoU on electoral cooperation and training and proposed capacity building programs by ECI for Uzbekistan election officials. Delegates from Uzbekistan have been avidly participating in ECI’s International election visitors programmes (IEVP) organised during elections and officials from Uzbekistan have been attending training programmes at ECI under the ITEC programme. Under the Uzbekistan election law, the president is elected for a five-year term from a single nationwide constituency. Uzbekistan has an electorate of about 20 million. Each polling station caters to a maximum of 3,000 voters. Early voting system was in place from October 14-20 and 421,618 people used the early voting facility including 120,524 from abroad. Only registered political parties can nominate candidates to run in elections. Five candidates -- four men and one woman – contested elections for the president of Uzbekistan. The Indian delegation, led by Chandra, visited the 7  and 14  district election commissions to obtain an overview of the electoral administration, procedures and initiatives of the CEC of Uzbekistan. Thereafter, they visited polling stations in Uzbekistan in order to observe the election process in detail. Various aspects of conduct of elections, including voter lists, identification of voters, early voting mechanisms, arrangements for facilitation of the elderly and persons with disabilities, Covid safety protocols, polling station readiness and casting of vote by ballot paper were observed across different polling stations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chief-election-commissioner-shares-experiences-of-holding-polls-amid-covid-with-uzbekistan-counterpart/articleshow/87350269.cms||---

A video of the incident was widely shared on social media platforms. On Thursday, the supervisor of the security agency and five guards were arrested. They were booked under Section 151 of the CrPC. This is the second instance in two months of an argument involving guards turning violent at a housing society in the city and brings back under scrutiny standard operating procedures of security agencies in training guards they deploy as well as interactions between residents and guards. In September, a 55-year-old resident of Lotus Boulevard was assaulted by security guards following a dispute over handing keys to the common junction box. Several guards and the head of security were arrested for the assault. The security agency had also filed a police complaint against the resident. Additional DCP (Noida) Ranvijay Singh said, "While the youths have not given us a written complaint, we have arrested six people after taking cognisance of the video. The six men have been sent to jail as they had attacked the youths with sticks." An employee of the security agency said the matter had been resolved as the youths and the guards had apologised to each other after the incident.

The Bengal CM, who reached the coastal state on Thursday evening, is scheduled to first interact with the fishermen community. Trinamool Congress, which turned a strong critic of Congress following increasing distance from the party over delay in forming an opposition alliance, has been hitting out through its mouthpiece ‘Jago Bangla’. “I am coming from Kurseong and heading to Goa. I am happy that I am going there. I will meet the people there and let you know about my visit,” Banerjee said before leaving the Bagdogra airport on Thursday afternoon. She was received at the Vasco airport by former Goa CM Luizinho Faleiro, who left Congress in September. Also present were Independent MLA Prasad Gaonkar, who had earlier extended support to Trinamool, former Ponda MLA Lavoo Mamledar, and Swati Kerkar, Congress leader who moved to Trinamool last month Faleiro tweeted: “Goa TMC is a party which gives primacy to equitable representation. Our party will ensure that women get their rightful representation in the assembly and bring in change.” As Banerjee stepped out of the airport in BJP-governed Goa, a few activists gathered outside showed black flags. A restive gathering on the roadside chanted “Jai Shri Ram” slogan. Earlier this week, Banerjee’s posters and hoardings there were vandalised and defaced. Mamledar condemned BJP for the vandalism. “There are video clips and photos of TMC posters being torn, painted over. This is the first time we have seen so much hatred. It is clear BJP is afraid of TMC after the charge sheet we released. They don’t have any answers,” he said. Banerjee’s Friday campaign includes visits to three religious sites — Mahalasa Narayani temple, Mangueshi temple and Tapobhoomi temple — before she is scheduled to meet civil society members. The Bengal CM will start the day with an interaction with the fishermen community at Betim Panaji. The Goa Trinamool has already launched an audio-visual campaign titled ‘People’s Chargesheet’ condemning BJP for “betraying fishermen and farmers”. On Thursday, Banerjee concluded her five-day visit to north Bengal, where she held administrative meetings and interacted with various communities, including tea-garden labourers. “I have tried connecting with as many people as I could. I will come again next month,” she said before leaving for the airport.

---||Kolkata||BJP: GTA polls, Hills solution not aligned||Darjeeling/Jalpaiguri: BJP national spokesperson and Darjeeling MP Raju Bisht came down heavily on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee over her proposal of finding a permanent solution for the Hills and holding of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration elections. “This is sheer hypocrisy. Finding a permanent solution for the Hills and holding of the GTA elections do not go together. Stop-gap bodies like the GTA have failed to meet the aspirations of the people,” the Darjeeling MP said ahead of the second round of tripartite talks on the Hills sometime in November. Bisht clarified that the bottom line of a permanent solution was to address the “identity crisis” of the 1.5 crore Gorkhas spread across India. “Darjeeling is the heart and soul of Indian Gorkha community, and any political resolution for the Darjeeling Hills, Terai and Dooars will naturally cater to the political resolution of the Gorkhas across India…The political resolution of our region will also address the identity crisis of 1.5 crore Gorkhas across India,” the BJP national spokesperson said. Bisht didn’t spell out if the political solution meant forming a separate state or a Union territory under the Constitution of India but held that the Gorkha representatives in the meeting with the Union home ministry and the state government would be looking for a solution under the constitutional framework. If this sounds as a separatist proposal that the Bengal CM had mentioned about in the administrative meeting held at Kurseong Town Hall two days ago on Tuesday, Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said on Thursday that it was none other than the Trinamool that inserted the “Gorkhaland tag” in the territorial administrative body GTA. “I want to remind you that it was neither Congress nor the CPM to have inserted the Gorkhaland tag in the GTA. The Trinamool did it. You can understand who is playing politics in the Hills,” Majumdar said. The Bengal BJP president later clarified that his comment was in response to the CM’s blaming “outsiders” (BJP) for creating problems in the Hills and had no bearing on the tripartite talks. The contours of the permanent political solution in the Hills, a demand continuing for ages, are likely to unfold in the second round of tripartite talks when the state government would be floating proposals for the solution sometime in November. While the Bengal CM talked about her vision of making the Hills a destination for eco-friendly industry and tourism before going for the GTA and the panchayat polls in the Hills, the BJP and its allies in the Hills harped on lack of democracy, non-functioning of the panchayats in the first round of tripartite talks held in Delhi on October 12 with focus on the identity issue of the Indian Gorkhas. “We highlighted how the democratic institutions at the grassroots – the panchayats and the municipalities have been turned ineffective by the Trinamool government in the region. We had therefore requested the Centre to find a solution under the Constitution that can meet the aspirations of the people in our region,” the BJP leader said. The BJP during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls had promised a permanent political solution for the Hills people.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bjp-gta-polls-hills-solution-not-aligned/articleshow/87346726.cms||Deep Gazmer

The missive of October 25 says: “Consequent to the first meeting of the coordination committee held on August 31, to improve the process for management of the movement of goods and people across the land borders, it was decided that the Petrapole-Benapole port at the Indo-Bangla border will be operational 24x7on trial basis for three months.” Issued by Ajeet Kumar Singh, director (operations), Land Port Authority of India, the letter further says this will help end congestion and allow smooth flow of export consignments. All stakeholders at Petrapole have been told to take note of the decision and ensure compliance. Several senior officials, however, felt it would take some time to make Petrapole-Benapole 24x7 operational. Petrapole customs superintendent Abhijit Mukherjee said they were ready to start operations round-the-clock. Land port manager Kamlesh Saini said meetings were held with Bangladesh officials, who were willing to start full-time operations from November 1. The DM’s notification would be needed for such operations, Saini added. “District officials are being consulted for necessary notification by the DM,” he said. Sushil Patwari, of Federation of Indian Exporters Association (Eastern region), said the move would help minimise loss of perishable items but infrastructure needed to be improved. Kartick Chakraborty, of Clearing Agents Association, wanted a nodal officer to help sort out problems.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/petrapole-to-function-24x7-on-trial-for-3-mths/articleshow/87346783.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal Pegasus panel to continue probe||Kolkata: The two-member commission set up by the Bengal government in July to probe allegations of snooping in the state arising out of the Pegasus issue will continue its work. The commission, comprising retired Supreme Court judge Madan B Lokur and former Calcutta High Court Chief Justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya, will soon start scanning statements it has received so far and also send interrogatory questionnaires to those whose names have surfaced from the preliminary data. The Supreme Court on Wednesday constituted a committee to probe the Pegasus spyware snooping issue. On Thursday, Justice Lokur and Justice Bhattacharya held an online meeting to discuss their next course of action. To this end, they would be scanning around 37 statements received so far from various persons for names of people affected by Pegasus spyware. Even persons with knowledge of such interception of telephone conversations would be questioned, the commission decided. The names disclosed by various statements will be verified by the commission. Instead of directly questioning such persons or asking them to appear before the commission, it favours sending them an interrogatory questionnaire. The questionnaire would not be a prototype as posers would vary from person to person, depending on the context. The commission’s officials had been asked to analyse all the data received so far, and to track persons or agencies whose names had appeared in the public domain, including in court petitions. According to an official, statements had been submitted from across the country, including Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, other than from Bengal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bengal-pegasus-panel-to-continue-probe/articleshow/87346693.cms||Debasish Konar

Those who had purchased diesel cars banking on its lower price when compared to petrol are now regretting their decision with the difference between the two fuels at barely Rs 8 now. After another round of hike of 33 paisa and 36 paisa respectively, diesel was retailing at Rs 100.14 a litre and petrol at Rs 108.78 a litre at city fuel stations on Thursday.. “When I had first started driving a taxi in Kolkata back in 1990, diesel used to cost around Rs 5 per litre. We managed a healthy living. Though diesel prices have reached Rs 100 per litre now, our income has plummeted. Survival has become difficult,” said Biswambhar Jha (68), who has been driving a taxi in Kolkata for three decades. Dilip Purkait (47), a driver of bus route 39A/2, too faces an uncertain future. “When I first held the bus steering in 2004, diesel used to cost Rs 25 and the minimum bus fare was Rs 3. Seventeen years on, look where we stand: diesel has exceeded Rs 100 but we are still struggling to seek a minimum fare of Rs 10. My bus owner has given us an ultimatum of six more months, after which he says he will suspend the service,” said Purkait. Fuel prices in the country have been hovering at record levels since April this year. While diesel used to sell at Rs 77.41 at the start of the year and rose by Rs 6 per litre rise in the first four months, it shot up by close to Rs 20 per litre in the next six months and is expected to climb further, say fuel station operators. Globally, oil prices are on fire on the back of an energy supply crunch. However, oil prices have started slipping marginally in the international market since last week with benchmark Brent crude selling at $83.22. Brent had touched a three-year high of $86.10 last Thursday but started dipping then on. The surge in prices have meant a dip in business for pump owners too. “The Centre and state have reduced our business to a farce. Considering a zero tax situation, diesel can still be available for less than Rs 50 but see what the added tax has done to it. Business has gone down by 20% – 30% in the last one year,” said a petrol pump owner in north Kolkata. The prices are revised by the oil marketing companies including Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum. The new prices are implemented at 6 am every day. States and cities have different fuel prices because of the value-added taxes, local and freight charges by taking into account the crude oil prices in the international markets, and the rupee-dollar exchange rates.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/diesel-zooms-past-rs-100-in-kol-leaves-vehicle-owners-fuming/articleshow/87347453.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Campus SOP in West Bengal: Isolation rooms, distancing a must||By: Poulami Roy KOLKATA: The state education department on Thursday issued a set of guidelines for schools, colleges and universities, paving the way for the institutions to open for offline classes in mid-November. While the institutions will have to set up isolation rooms for students who fall ill on campus, teachers and professors will be assigned roles and responsibilities to ensure staff and students adhere to Covid protocols and safety norms. The standard operating procedure (SOP) calls for classes in schools to be held in two sessions, morning and afternoon. Classrooms are required to be numbered with revised seating arrangements to ensure adequate distancing. If there is a provision to seat three students on a bench, only two would now be allowed to sit at either end, followed by a single person in the middle of the next row. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier indicated that steps should be taken for educational institutes to reopen for on-campus classes on November 16. After the SOP was released on Thursday, several heads of private educational institutes said it would help them fine-tune and finalise their reopening process, too. The rules specified that online parent-teacher meetings would be held to communicate the dos and don’ts and Covid-appropriate behaviour to students, both on campus and at home. That includes wearing masks of proper size and fit at all times and avoiding physical contact with classmates. Sports and other co-curricular activities will remain suspended. While thermal checks will be carried out, guardians will be asked not to send their wards to school if they have fever, a cold or any other ailment. Such a student will be required to stay home for at least a week before physically returning to school. Class teachers have been entrusted to keep a note of this. Emphasis has also been laid on prevention of crowding at the gates before school begins and after it ends for the day. Students will have to sanitize their hands at the entrance. Assembly on school grounds will be suspended; prayers will instead be held in classrooms. The SOP has laid out sanitisation protocols for campuses, including classrooms, laboratories, washrooms and other common use areas. For colleges and universities, the SOP does not spell out the need for students to be vaccinated to attend on-site classes. Sanitization regimen will be same as schools. Everyone on campus would have to be masked. Thermal checks will also be carried out at the gates and those who display Covid symptoms would be asked to get clinically assessed before being allowed into campus. Institutions will also have to set up isolation and quarantine facilities or tie up with a health facility so that they could provide healthcare support to those who test positive. All institutions have also been asked to regularly monitor the health of students, faculty and staff. All activities, such as cultural functions, sports and study tours will stay suspended. Outsiders will be restricted from entering campus. To improve resilience and mental health, teachers have been asked to encourage students to share their feelings with friends, teachers and parents but discourage sharing anything in person like books, learning material and eatables.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/campus-sop-isolation-rooms-distancing-a-must/articleshow/87347444.cms||---

The final electoral rolls will be published on January 5, 2022. The Election Commission will hold special enrolment camps at every booth between 11am and 4pm on November 7, 13, 14, 20, 21, 27 and 28. It has asked citizens to enrol if their names are not on the voter list or have been dropped for some reason. At the meeting, Debashis Kumar of Trinamool demanded error-free electoral rolls while Sisir Bajoria of BJP said BLOs should display draft rolls at booths. Bajoria also demanded that the list be made accessible to political parties for “proper verification”. CPM leader Rabin Deb said those turning 18 by January 1, 2022, must be included on the voter list. He pointed out that there were 1,01,916 booths — including auxiliary ones — during the assembly polls this year and now the same should not be reduced to 79,702. “For fair polls, all multiple entries in the rolls should be erased,” he added. EC officials said if civic polls were held in December, the voter list used during the assembly polls in March-April would be used. “Civic polls will be based on the new electoral rolls only if they are held after January 5, 2022,” Aftab said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ec-to-hold-camps-in-nov-to-enrol-new-voters/articleshow/87346730.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bangla minister blames BNP, Jamaat for violence||Kolkata: Bangladesh information and broadcasting minister Hasan Mahmud on Thursday blamed Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat supporters for the recent violence in his country and said the Awami League government had exposed people who brought “ignominy” to a nation celebrating the golden jubilee of its independence. Mahmud’s statement at Kolkata Press Club — where he inaugurated the Bangabandhu media centre as part of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary celebrations — came on a day when several BNP supporters were arrested in Bangladesh and over 400 charged with vandalism and rioting at Durga Puja pandals. BNP leaders, however, described the police action as a ploy of the ruling party to malign them. Over 33,000 Durga Pujas are organised across Bangladesh and only a few pandals witnessed vandalism, which is “unfortunate”, Mahmud said and added: “Within three days, we exposed the criminals... It is clear who did the mischief and placed the Quran in a pandal.” Emphasising that Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Buddhists peacefully coexisted in his country, the minister said the Bangladesh government did not condone such violence. “It is a shame that even today we identify people as Hindus or Muslims, instead of Bengalis,” he said, adding that the masterminds of the violence would be brought to book. Mahmud recalled how he was attacked by the Jamaat and had a lucky escape. The Jamaat and BNP are trying to create disturbance in Bangladesh, he reiterated. Later in the day, the minister visited the Bengal assembly and invited Speaker Biman Banerjee to Bangladesh during the jubilee celebrations to commemorate 50 years of Indo-Bangla friendship. They discussed the economic ties between the two nations. The minister informed that they were working to conserve the ancestral home of late actor Suchitra Sen at Pabna. He said the Bangladesh government had allowed the Hilsa export to Bengal for another 10 days this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bangla-minister-blames-bnp-jamaat-for-violence/articleshow/87346679.cms||---

On the other hand, the imminent expansion of full service carrier (FSC) space with Tatas acquiring Air India is just what the market needed as "India really has scope for a full service carrier". "There will be another LCC (Akasa).... the field for LCCs will get crowded. There's IndiGo, SpiceJet, GoAir, Akasa (Tata's AirAsia India also at present). There will be more competition. That's how we see it," Dutta said on Thursday in an earnings call after IndiGo announced its July-September result. IndiGo accounts for almost 57% of domestic market share currently. Jhunjhunwala had in a media interaction some months back said some very weak airlines may not survive for too long. "While we do not know as yet what the Tatas are going to do, all indications are that they will be a full service carrier. They will be focussing a lot on international markets and markets that we don't even compete in. The Londons, New Yorks.. Having that whole group work in a full service carrier mode will be good for us," Dutta said In case Tatas also go in for a low cost and a FSC? "We will have to see how that evolves," he says. About Akasa's ultra LCC (ULCC) dreams, he said IndiGo had studied that model "at great length". All the features of such a concept - like having maximum number of seats in an aeroplane is something that is already being done by all LCCs here.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/low-cost-space-getting-crowded-indigo-ceo/articleshow/87350346.cms||---

The city-based lender, which recently came out of the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) measure of Reserve Bank of India, has witnessed a significant improvement in its asset quality during the second quarter despite the fact that it recognized its exposure of around Rs 1,000 crore in Srei Infrastructure Finance and Srei Equipment Finance as non-performing assets (NPAs). The Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) earlier this month gave its approval to start insolvency proceedings against Srei Infrastructure Finance and its wholly-owned subsidiary Srei Equipment Finance after the Reserve Bank of India had filed insolvency applications against the two non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). Uco Bank MD & CEO AK Goel, without mentioning the name of Srei, said, “It will be very premature to talk about the bad loan recovery from these two NBFCs. But we will remain optimistic that a good recovery should come (through insolvency resolution process).” During the second quarter, the bank’s NPAs in absolute terms fell 3.6% quarter-on-quarter to Rs 10,909.7 crore from Rs 11,321.7 crore in the first quarter this fiscal. The Gross NPA ratio during the quarter under review declined 39 basis points sequentially at 8.9%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/uco-bank-posts-7-fold-jump-in-q2-net/articleshow/87346300.cms||---
---||India||CPCB measures: Diesel generator sets banned, parking fees up 3-4 times in NCR||NEW DELHI: With the air quality likely to deteriorate, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Thursday enforced certain "very poor" measures of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) with immediate effect in Delhi-NCR. The use of diesel generator sets has been banned and parking fee enhanced by three-four times to discourage the use of private vehicles. Diesel generator sets, however, can be used for emergency purposes. The essential services exempted from the ban include medical services (hospitals, nursing homes, healthcare facilities), elevators/escalators, railway services/stations, Delhi Metro services, including trains and stations, airports and ISBTs, sewage treatment plants, national security and defence-related activities. The enhanced parking fee would have to be implemented by the municipal corporations. Sources said the order was not enforced in the past because the charges were not decided under the parking policy. Other "very poor" measures of GRAP include increasing bus and Metro services by augmenting buses running on contract and increasing their frequency, ensuring uninterrupted power supply to discourage the use of generator sets, stopping the use of coal/firewood in hotels and open eateries and mechanised/vacuum-based sweeping of roads. Directions have also been issued to ensure water sprinkling alongside usage of dust suppressants (at least every alternate day) on roads, especially at hotspots, heavy traffic corridors, vulnerable areas (before peak hours) and proper disposal of dust collected in designated sites or landfills. The agencies concerned have been asked to do regular inspections for strict enforcement of dust-control measures at construction sites. CPCB has asked residents' welfare associations and individual house owners to provide electric heaters during winter to security staff to avoid open burning by them. Citizens have been asked to check air polluting activities, including keeping PUC certificate up to date, keeping engines of vehicles properly tuned, maintaining proper air pressure in tyres, adhering to lane driving, optimising use of vehicles, not disposing of waste in the open and reporting air pollution activities through the SAMEER app, social media platforms and other public grievance portals. People have also been asked to avoid dust gathering construction activities from October to January, if possible.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dg-sets-banned-parking-fees-up-3-4-times-in-ncr/articleshow/87350476.cms||---

A video of the incident was widely shared on social media platforms. On Thursday, the supervisor of the security agency and five guards were arrested. They were booked under Section 151 of the CrPC. This is the second instance in two months of an argument involving guards turning violent at a housing society in the city and brings back under scrutiny standard operating procedures of security agencies in training guards they deploy as well as interactions between residents and guards. In September, a 55-year-old resident of Lotus Boulevard was assaulted by security guards following a dispute over handing keys to the common junction box. Several guards and the head of security were arrested for the assault. The security agency had also filed a police complaint against the resident. Additional DCP (Noida) Ranvijay Singh said, "While the youths have not given us a written complaint, we have arrested six people after taking cognisance of the video. The six men have been sent to jail as they had attacked the youths with sticks." An employee of the security agency said the matter had been resolved as the youths and the guards had apologised to each other after the incident.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/noida-housing-society-guards-thrash-resident-friend/articleshow/87350477.cms||---
---||Business||D-St to raise record 31k cr from deluge of IPOs in 2 wks||MUMBAI: The Indian capital market is set to witness one of the busiest fortnights in its history as six companies have lined up to together raise about Rs 31,400 crore by November 10. The six issues include the one from tech-enabled payments major One 97 Communications, operating under the Paytm brand, which aims to raise Rs 18,300 crore. Paytm has priced its IPO shares in the Rs 2,080-2,150 band per share, indicating the company seeks a valuation of about $20 billion. This will make the Paytm IPO the largest ever in the country's history. Till date the biggest IPO in India was the Rs 15,500-crore offer by Coal India in October-November 2010. According to market sources, this could have two major implications for Dalal Street and the economy. First, there are fears among traders that the deluge of IPOs could force several investors to offload part of their portfolio and divert that money to invest in these offers, especially for listing gains. Second, the inflows from foreign funds, estimated to be about 40-50% of the total offer, could mean Rs 12,000-15,000 crore of forex inflows. This, in turn, could help appreciate the rupee. On Thursday, despite a sharp sell-off in the stock market, the domestic currency closed 11 paise stronger at Rs 74.92 to a dollar. Usually, the day the stock market slides sharply, the rupee also weakens against major currencies like the US dollar, euro, pound sterling and the Japanese yen. Thursday's strength in the domestic currency came despite a Rs 3,819-crore net selling by foreign funds, BSE data showed. According to a note by the forex advisory firm IFA Global, the strength of the rupee was "because foreign banks sold US dollars for overseas investments into Indian companies raising funds through initial public offerings". In addition to the big ticket listings, three more high profile IPOs are also lined up after these got the Sebi green signal in the last few weeks. Adani Wilmar is eyeing Rs 4,500 crore, One MobiKwik is expected to raise Rs 1,900 crore and the offer size for Star Health is expected to be in excess of Rs 3,000 crore, market sources said. These offers could open anytime now, merchant bankers said. The government is also planning to list life insurance behemoth LIC before the end of the fiscal year through its IPO. This offer is expected to garner anything between Rs 70,000 crore and Rs 1 lakh crore, merchant bankers said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/d-st-to-raise-record-31k-cr-from-deluge-of-ipos-in-2-wks/articleshow/87350483.cms||---

As many as 10 employees of the sub-treasury office functioning from the mini-civil station in Pathanamthitta had to bear the brunt of the court's displeasure after the government sat on its directive to act upon a petition filed by one Omanayamma of Pandalam. The woman had approached the court in 1998 seeking compensation for giving away her land for the Kallada irrigation project. In her complaint she had pointed out that the compensation she received was far too little and subsequently, the court issued an order to allot Rs 76,384 more to the petitioner. There are 20 employees in the sub-treasury.

The government also said in a statement that the infant mortality rate in Delhi dipped from 24.2 per 1,000 in 2019 to 20.4 in 2020. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia ascribed the reduction in infant mortality to changes in health infrastructure and better access to health facilities to all citizens. Sisodia said that the rise in the sex ratio rate demonstrated increased social awareness. He said that our culture was becoming more educated and appreciating the importance of the girl child. Maternal mortality rate in Delhi has also decreased from 0.55 per thousand births in 2019 to 0.54 per thousand births in 2020, the deputy CM stated. In Delhi, the birth rate fell from 18.35 per thousand in 2019 to 14.85 per thousand in 2020. In 2020, a total of 3,01,645 births were registered compared with 3,65,868 in 2019.

The water level at Mullaperiyar dam was 138.30ft at 10pm on Thursday. “Needless to observe that it will be open to the committee to review its decision from time to time including on an hour to hour basis if the situation warrants,” the bench said, while posting the matter for hearing to November 11. The bench, comprising Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar, adjourned the case after Kerala government sought time to inform its views on the rule curve adopted by the Tamil Nadu government. It said Kerala would file an affidavit on or before November 8 and it would be open to parties to file affidavits or pleadings through e-filing before the next date of hearing. Maintain water level at 139ft: StateRepresenting Kerala government, senior advocate Jaideep Gupta submitted that the water level proposed by Tamil Nadu and agreed by the supervisory committee is not safe. He said the dam would not be able to take anymore water if the level reached 142ft and sought a directive to maintain it at 139ft until the next hearing. He pointed out that the apex court had directed that the water level should not go beyond 139ft in 2018 when floods occurred in Kerala. Senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, representing Tamil Nadu, said it can agree to maintain the water level at 139ft only until November 10. He alleged that Kerala tried to keep the water level below 142ft every year. Earlier in the day, Kerala submitted a written note saying the 126-year-old composite gravity dam is in a deteriorating condition in spite of strengthening measures taken up twice. Raising apprehensions about the life and safety of over 30 lakh people of five districts residing downstream, it said there would be an exponential increase in the water pressure on the dam when the water level is raised from 136ft to 142ft. “The logical next step is the construction of a new dam to ensure water to Tamil Nadu and security to people living downstream and to decommission the existing dam,” the note said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/sc-fixes-rule-curve-at-139-5-ft-keralas-mullaperiyar-dam-already-at-138-3/articleshow/87351049.cms||---

"We do not want to come in the way of enjoyment, but for enjoyment one cannot play with the fundamental right of others," a bench of Justices M R Shah and A S Bopanna said. The court said a ban order on polluting firecrackers was passed by the SC after conducting extensive hearings and elaborate reasons were given for passing the order and 'green crackers' were allowed. The ban on crackers becomes relevant ahead of Diwali and this year so far the impact of farm fires has been limited. It has been pointed out that Diwali pollution lasts just a day or so, but the court held that a sharp increase in pollutants is a serious health hazard. The bench said authorities must ensure implemention of its order while noting firecrackers were still being sold in violation of its order. The bench said it is not against any particular festival and also not against celebration, but it cannot permit anybody to play with the right to life of others in the guise of celebration. "We want to send a message that we are here to protect the rights of people. We have not put a 100% ban on firecrackers. Everybody knows what the people of Delhi are suffering," the bench said.

Eight new cases were detected in Indore on Thursday, for the second day, and 19 infections statewide. In the last three days, 66 new Covid cases have been detected which is a 135% jump over the previous three days’ tally. Indore and Bhopal account for the bulk of these cases — 25 each in the past three days, or over 75% of the tally. The active-case count has again crossed 100 and stood at 115 on Thursday. Only two of the eight new patients in Indore were found to have travelled to Mumbai, and the rest don’t have any travel history. Indore collector Manish Singh went public with the concern and appealed to people to follow Covid precautions. “The rise in Covid cases in the last three days is worrisome. People should follow Covid-appropriate behavior and take their second dose to complete immunization,” he said. Singh pointed out that Russia, China and Israel have begun imposing lockdowns again due to a surge in the pandemic. “If any wave again hits Indore district again, full immunisation will protect people. The 5 lakh who are due or overdue for their second doses should come to take their shots before any wave strikes,” appealed collector Singh. If another wave hits, vaccination might also get affected because the focus would be on crisis management, Singh cautioned. The health authorities are tracing, sampling contacts of positive cases. District sampling in-charge Dr Abdullah Farooqui said, “In Rau, 39 contacts of a single patient were traced.” Three of the 25 new cases are in institutional care, including a teenager who celebrated his 18th birthday a couple of days ago and is now in a Covid centre. The other two are in hospital.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/madhya-pradesh-66-covid-cases-in-3-days-75-of-them-in-bhopal-indore/articleshow/87351139.cms||---

---||India||SC: Compensation for accident-crippled must factor in assistants' cost||NEW DELHI: In an important ruling, the Supreme Court has said that crippled survivors of accidents while seeking compensation cannot be viewed by courts as a modern day Oliver Twist, having to make entreaties as the boy in the orphanage in Charles Dickens's classic, "Please Sir, I want some more". A bench of Justices R S Reddy and Hrishikesh Roy said not only would the injured person be entitled to be compensated for all the bodily sufferings, future loss of earning and future medical care expenses, he/she would also entitled to the cost of hiring assistants for leading a dignified life if he/she is unable to conduct the daily life without assistance. The bench enhanced the compensation to an accident survivor from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 28 lakh. Writing the judgment, Justice Roy said, "A person therefore is not only to be compensated for the injury suffered due to the accident but also for the loss suffered on account of the injury and his inability to lead the life he led, prior to the life altering event." This ruling came in a case from Kerala, in which one Jithendran, while riding pillion on a motorcycle, was hit by a speeding car. He suffered multiple injuries in his body and head, leaving him almost a paraplegic, unable to conduct his daily life without assistance. Justice Roy narrated the case of the 21-year-old Jithendran after he suffered injuries in the accident that happened in April 2001. "While the permanent disability as certified by the doctors stands at 69%,the same by no means, adequately reflects the travails the impaired claimant will have to face all his life," the Supreme Court bench said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-compensation-for-accident-crippled-must-factor-in-assistants-cost/articleshow/87351194.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Bhopal||NGT bans crackers in areas with poor air quality in MP||BHOPAL: Fireworks cannot be burst in areas where the ambient air quality is poor, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) said on Thursday, a week ahead of Diwali. According to the NGT guidelines, crackers will be allowed only at places where air quality is ‘moderate or below’ and it will be limited to two hours. Those violating the norms can be fined. The tribunal’s Bhopal bench on Thursday observed that the Covid pandemic is not yet over and said the guidelines issued by the NGT principal bench on use of crackers in 2020, in the wake of Corona, would apply to Madhya Pradesh this year, too. The petition was filed by N G Najpande and Rajat Bhargava of MP Nagrik Upbhokta Margdarshak Manch, a Jabalpur-based NGO. The bench, comprising judicial member Justice Sheo Kumar Singh and expert member Arun Kumar Verma, referred to studies, media reports and articles on the impact of air pollution on Covid patients, greater vulnerability to Covid mortality due to prolonged exposed to air pollution and earlier observations of Supreme Court and NGT on petitions seeking a ban on crackers. The judges said that the main issue raised in the application is remedial action against firecracker pollution, which would aggravate the Covid-19 menace and heighten the risk to the lives and health of vulnerable groups. Advocate Prabhat Yadav, who appeared for the petitioners, had contended that in Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior, people indulged in fireworks in Diwali far beyond the stipulated time last year despite clear directives of NGT, severely affecting the air quality in these cities. He sought a ban on use of crackers in these cities, and said that since the risk of a third wave persists, fireworks on Diwali and other occasions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/ngt-bans-crackers-in-areas-with-poor-air-quality-in-mp/articleshow/87351251.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

He was speaking after a review meeting to assess the arrangements made for the opening of the dam. Earlier in the day, the minister said he is hopeful the SC will rule in the state’s favour when it resumes hearing of the case. He said the apex court has asked Kerala to submit a detailed affidavit about the new rule curve prepared by Tamil Nadu."Now we hope we can submit the actual details and condition about the dam before the court," he said. The water level at Mullaperiyar dam was 138.20ft at6 pm on Thursday.

---||Noida||As dengue cases cross 900-mark, Gzb pvt hospitals told to defer elective surgeries||Ghaziabad: The health department has urged private hospitals in Ghaziabad to defer elective surgeries by a week to meet the rising demand for beds with a spike in dengue and viral fever cases. The move comes as the two government hospitals in the city are seeing around 700-800 fever patients in the out-patient departments daily and their beds are almost fully occupied. On Thursday, the district added 22 more cases which took the number of dengue patients to 905 this season. The first dengue case was reported from the district on September 1. A total of 104 dengue patients -- 54 in government and 50 others in private -- are under treatment in hospitals at present, health officials said. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, however, said the situation was under control. “There is no shortage of beds at present anywhere and the positivity rate is slowly coming down. As a precautionary measure, we have asked private hospitals to defer elective surgeries in case they are running out of beds,” the CMO said. Earlier, Dr Shankhdhar had asked private hospitals with 100 beds’ capacity to keep aside 20 beds for fever and dengue patients. Meanwhile, health officials said Muradanagar was the worst hit by dengue in the district and has reported nearly 250 cases. It is followed by Vijay Nagar (136 cases), Harsaon (71) and Shastri Nagar (66). Long queues, high bed occupancy The District MMG Hospital and District Combined Hospital (DCH) have been witnessing long queues of fever patients in OPDs. At MMG, the out-patient department was reporting over 500 fever patients daily. Between September 15 and October 27, as many as 20,528 fever patients visited the hospital, of whom 5,938 were children and 14,590 adults, according to official data. During the corresponding period, 877 patients were admitted to the hospital. The situation is no different in DCH. Dr Sanjay Teotia, the chief medical superintendent of the hospital, told TOI, “Viral fever and dengue cases have gone up in the hospital in the past 10 days. About 200 fever patients are coming to OPDs daily. Of the 100 beds of the hospital, 75 are occupied by fever (47) and dengue (28) patients. There are five-six patients, whose platelets are in the range of 15000-20000. However, the good part is that no one is suffering from the dengue haemorrhagic shock syndrome.” Dr Vinay Bhat, a consultant with Columbia Asia Hospital’s internal medicine department, said the occupancy rate in the hospital was around 70% at present. “Due to the extended monsoon, the number of dengue and viral fever cases has gone up. Last year, there were hardly any cases at this time of the year. One of the reasons was Covid-19, due to which people were maintaining strict hygiene even inside their homes.” The hospital is seeing 15-20 viral fever and dengue patients every day, Dr Bhat said, adding that there were just three-four severe cases in the past one and half months. Dr Vandana Garg, a senior consultant at Max Hospital Vaishali, said attributed the spike in cases to the heavy rainfall in late September and the intermittently showers throughout October. “Most patients, however, do not need hospitalization. It is required for patients who are not eating well and have developed complications like vomiting, bleeding from the nose and gums, and whose platelet count has gone down drastically. Patients with comorbidities are also required hospitalization. Being a tertiary care hospital, we have admitted about three-four serious patients in ICU every week over the past fortnight,” she added. The private labs are also seeing a surge of dengue tests. A lab incharge with a private diagnostic company’s Raj Nagar Extension branch said, “We alone are seeing at least 30 fever patients every day who have been advised to undergo dengue test. Many of them turn out to be positive, but most are viral fever cases.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/as-dengue-cases-cross-900-mark-gzb-pvt-hospitals-told-to-defer-elective-surgeries/articleshow/87347283.cms||Aditya Dev

These plots are in sectors 2 and Omicron 1A. The e-auction will take place next month. The construction of one and two-room flats is expected to begin early next year. Santosh Kumar, the in-charge of the builder’s cell of GNIDA, said, “We have identified two plots for developing flats for the economically weaker section of the society under PMAY. These include a plot of 53,071 sqm in Sector 2 and another with an area of 20,350 sqm in Sector Omicron 1A. The land will be sold through e-auction to builders next month.” According to Kumar, GNIDA had sought applications from those seeking affordable houses under PMAY. Due to the pandemic, the application deadline had to be extended three times since the launch of the scheme earlier this year in January. “A total of 750 applications have been received.” And to attract builders to develop the project, GNIDA has also made the provision of providing 10% land use for commercial purposes by the developer as against the earlier 1%. The facility of downloading the application for this scheme is provided online from October 25 on the etender.sbi portal. Applications with relevant documents can be submitted till November 18.

Temperatures dipped sharply across the state on Thursday, with Bhopal shivering at 13.4 degrees Celsius, 3 degrees below normal, and the maximum in Indore dropping by three notches as well. The lowest temperature in the state was recorded at 11 degrees Celsius in Raisen. The minimum temperature in Bhopal and the state were the lowest since last winter. Temperatures have been below normal for the past week in most parts of the state, but Thursday’s drop was a sharp 5 degrees in 24 hours. Weather officials said northerly winds are bringing in the chill and clearing of clouds is accentuating it. It will remain this cold for the next few days. The day temperature in Bhopal was 28.8 degrees Celsius on Thursday, three degrees below normal. The chill caught people by surprise, although the trend had been there for the past two weeks. This time, the cold seems to have set in early but it cannot be said that winter is here. Also, the difference in maximum and minimum temperatures is accentuating the chill. Bhopal will have Friday too — clear skies, dry climes and a 16kmph wind blowing the cold winds. Day and night temperatures are expected to be 29 degrees Celsius and 14 degrees Celsius. Indore is expected to have the same maximum as Bhopal, but two degrees warmer at night.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/cold-catches-bhopal-by-surprise-this-octobrrr/articleshow/87351296.cms||---

MCG says will snap water supply, file FIRs||GURUGRAM: MCG has asked residents to pay their penalty dues or be prepared to face disconnection of water and sewer lines. Further, an FIR will be registered against the defaulters. The civic body penalises people for violating various civic and green norms such as dumping garbage or construction waste in the open, and setting up illegal shops and advertisements. Vijaypal Yadav, deputy commissioner and nodal officer, on Thursday asked the enforcement team of the MCG to initiate a special drive after Diwali to recover dues to the tune of Rs 3.41 crore from 8,938 people in the city. The penalties have been imposed on the offenders over the past two years, officials said. “As the deadline to pay their penalty has already been over, we have given a last chance to violators to pay their challan amount to the MCG at the earliest to avoid further action,” Yadav said. “Our enforcement team will communicate the same to defaulters through telephone, notices or physical meeting. If they still fail to clear their dues, we will disconnect their water and sewer connections. An FIR will also be lodged.” “The special drive will kick-off after Diwali. So, people have been advised to clear their dues as we don't want to bother them, rather want them to be responsible citizens,” Yadav added. According to officials, the civic body has the mandate to recover the penalties imposed for violating various norms, including pasting of illegal advertisements, burning of garbage, water wastage, carrying out construction activities despite a ban, open defecation, leaving animals open on the roads, and carrying construction material without cover.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/penalty-dues-not-paid-mcg-says-will-snap-water-supply-file-firs/articleshow/87347333.cms||---

At present, there are 28,535 teachers in the country, while CwSN number 22.5 lakh. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar directed the Centre to forthwith fix and notify the required pupil-teacher ratio for special schools and till then directed it and states that a ratio of 8:1 be maintained for children with cerebral palsy; 5:1 for those with intellectual disability, and 2:1 for deaf-blind as recommended by state commissioner for persons with disabilities in Delhi. It said until sufficient number of special teachers are available for general and special schools, the services of special trained teachers can be availed as "itinerant teachers" under 'Samagra Shiksha' - an integrated scheme for school education - within the school block (cluster schools) to optimise resources and as a stop-gap arrangement. It said that Rights of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act applies to all schools, including the schools admitting children with disability and gives equal and same rights to such children to pursue free, quality and compulsory education in the neighbourhood school. "It further provides children with multiple disabilities and children with severe disabilities may opt for even home based education. The fact remains that for meaningful and effective imparting of education to CwSN, different norms ought to be followed and for that purpose, the concerned schools are obliged to create posts of rehabilitation professionals/special education teachers commensurate to number of (CwSN) students in the given school.," the bench said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/appoint-more-tutors-for-kids-with-special-needs-sc-tells-govts/articleshow/87351336.cms||---

There are speculations that he will be rejoining the Congress party, which he had left in 2001. His one-time mentor Oommen Chandy himself had asked him to return to the party during an award function recently. After that several Congress leaders had held discussion with him. KPCC president K Sudhkaran and opposition leader V D Satheesan have also welcomed him back to the party. Philip is likely to make the new announcement in the press conference he has convened on Friday. He is also likely to meet senior party leader A K Antony in Thiruvananthapuram on Friday. Philip had quit the Congress in 2001 when he was denied an assembly seat to contest. He had contested against Oommen Chandy at Puthupally as an LDF candidate in that election. The LDF had given him various positions under its governments. He had served as KTDC chairman and also the coordinator of Nava Kerala Action Plan. Recently he was also given the vice-chairman post of the Khadi Board, which he declined to accept. Philip was considered for the Rajya Sabha seat by the LDF twice but was denied in the last minute. The last instance was when John Brittas was given the Rajya Sabha seat by the CPM.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-cherian-philip-may-reveal-his-cards-today/articleshow/87351332.cms||---

Coming days ahead of the Thevar Jayanthi (the birth and death anniversary of Muthuramalinga Thevar), leaders on both sides have been asked to tone down their pro and anti-Sasikala rhetoric. AIADMK minority wing secretary Anwhar Raajhaa, however, declared that party workers wanted to see Sasikala as general secretary to make the party stronger against arch-rival DMK. Meanwhile, in a slight change in itinerary, OPS would visit Pasumpon on November 1. A section in the AIADMK said Palaniswami's schedule was not certain due to a health issue. Sasikala would pay homage to the thevar leader on Friday morning. There was drama earlier in the day when the AIADMK expelled its minority wing deputy secretary J M Basheer from the party's primary membership hours after he made a demand that OPS should sack EPS for his 'anti-Muslim' stand. Basheer alleged that EPS let down the minority community by supporting CAA/NRC in Parliament and failed to pass a resolution in the assembly opposing the contentious legislation. "He (EPS) skipped visiting the memorial of Quaid-E-Millath on his birth and death anniversaries," Basheer told TOI. "The party has gone against the principles of MGR and Amma (J Jayalalithaa), and is shaping into a casteist party," he said. He said there was nothing wrong in OPS's statement on Sasikala's reinduction and accused EPS of allowing his supporters to speak against the leader. Raajhaa said cadres wanted Sasikala back as AIADMK general secretary since it was she who offered the post of chief minister to OPS and EPS. "Let the leaders invite her," Raajhaa told TOI. The former MP said the party under the dual leadership lost the assembly election and put up a poor show in the local body elections in nine districts. Raajhaa said cadres had lost confidence in the dual leadership and have begun talking about the reinduction of Sasikala for the betterment of the party. "Cadres say a united party is the need of the hour," the leader said, accusing EPS and some leaders of using the party to promote their own interests.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/aiadmk-attempts-damage-control/articleshow/87351403.cms||Julie Mariappan

Police said five years ago, Pawan, who is from Palwal’s Dakora village, had left his wife to live with a man named Lokesh. Pawan used to work in the fields and Lokesh used to take care of household chores. An argument broke out between the men a week ago, after which Lokesh decided to part ways and left for his home in Faridabad. Police said Pawan suspected that Lokesh’s family members were pressuring him to leave him. On October 21, Pawan went to Lokesh’s house in Faridabad, where he met his cousins Sonu and Shravan. When Pawan asked Shravan where Lokesh was, he refused to tell him and said he should stay away from his cousin. Pawan allegedly took out a dagger from his pocket and pointed it at Shravan’s chest. He then took out a pistol and fired two shots at him, police said. Shravan narrowly escaped and ran away along with Sonu. “No one has been injured. The accused is in our custody and we are investigating the matter,” a police official said, adding that a countrymade pistol and three live cartridges were recovered from Pawan’s possession. He has been booked under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (common Intention) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Arms Act at the Sector 48 police station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/man-open-fires-at-his-friends-cousins-held/articleshow/87347392.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||India||SC removes Bombay HC hurdle, permits NTA to declare NEET '21 results||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday paved the way for declaration of the results of the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to undergraduate medical courses across the country and stayed the Bombay HC order, which had restrained National Testing Agency from declaring the result. The Bombay HC had on October 20 passed the stay order on the plea of two students who had raised grievances against the all India test conducted on September 12. It had directed the agency to hold fresh exams for the two students and declare their results along with the main result of all other medical aspirants who took the exam. The NTA thereafter immediately rushed to the SC and pleaded for an urgent hearing. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the agency, submitted before a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Sanjiv Khanna and B R Gavai that the confusion regarding two students could be examined and rectified but the agency should be allowed to declare the result as more than 16 lakh students took the examination and are waiting for the result. The bench agreed with the plea of the solicitor general and allowed the agency to declare the exam. "There shall be stay of the impugned order passed by the HC, until further orders," it said. "We will decide what happens to the two students upon reopening. But we can't hold the results of 16 lakh students," it said. The two students had moved the HC alleging that their test booklets and OMR sheets got mixed up during the NEET exam. The HC had directed the NTA to conduct fresh examinations for them before declaration of results.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-removes-bombay-hc-hurdle-permits-nta-to-declare-neet-21-results/articleshow/87351448.cms||---

Surging crowds in markets, which doesn’t leave any room for social distancing and people rubbing shoulders with each other in the market without wearing masks on their faces should also be a matter of concern for the administration but it also doesn’t seem to be bothered to ensure compliance of Covid protocol. So much so that for the last several days, there has not been a single case of penalty for violation for Covid protocol reported in the city by either police, administration or Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC). “People somehow feel that Corona is gone. Vaccination has definitely boosted their confidence. There were also statements by some experts ruling out the possibility of a third wave, which till August seemed to be imminent to them. Media is also focussing more on dengue than Corona. Administration also doesn’t seem to be concerned any more. All this has led to people giving up on Covid protocols. It’s not that they were very particular about observing the Covid norms in the past but even those, who were wearing masks and avoiding crowded markets, are not doing it any more”, said Santosh Singh, who works as an accountant in a private firm. He further said that in his office itself, where Covid protocol was being followed quite strictly in the past, staff has now become lax in observing the Covid protocol and bosses in enforcing it. Prerna Sharma, a teacher, while referring to the heavy crowd in the New Market on “Karva Chauth” said, “There was so much of crowd in the market that there was no space in the parking and yet the crowd was only swelling as the dusk fell. To be honest, I also don’t wear a mask all the time now and only put on the mask only when I am getting into a crowded place but I pulled out my mask and put it on but a lot of people were without masks and social distancing in such a situation was out of the question. We are trying to forget about the horrors of Corona and there is nothing wrong about it but if we don’t observe caution, we may end up bringing it back”, she said. When asked, general secretary of New Market Vyapari Mahasangh, Ajay Devnani said “We make regular announcements asking people to wear masks. Besides, our market is safe as 100% shopkeepers and workers are vaccinated. Vaccination has also given people confidence but we wish people celebrate Diwali in a befitting manner and also stick to Covid guidelines.” An official of the district administration said “As far as enforcement is concerned, I agree nothing is being done. But, you are talking of crowds in markets and enforcement agencies not working to make people observe Covid protocol but the state government in the foundation day programme of the state on November 1 has made arrangements for 40,000 people to sit. There will be a heavy crowd there as well. The fact of the matter is it’s festival time and nobody is showing any concern about Corona at this point of time.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/bhopal-high-on-festive-spirit-people-throw-covid-caution-to-wind/articleshow/87351451.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

A pollution body official said crop burning, low temperature and slow wind coupled with increase in particulate matter will lead to a rise in the AQI by Friday. “Dust is the primary cause of air pollution in our city. Also, air quality is likely to turn poor from Friday if the weather condition is unfavourable,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional official, HSPCB. An analysis done by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) reveals that over 7,300 and 1,796 farm fires were reported in Punjab and Haryana, respectively, between September 1 and October 27. The share of farm fires to Delhi’s air pollution has remained 10-20% so far, says CEEW. “With north-west winds being forecast over Delhi-NCR and if more farm fires happen in the next two days, smoke from farmlands coupled with emissions from local sources, declining temperatures and reducing wind speeds will worsen air quality in Delhi and surrounding areas,” CEEW programme associate LS Kurinji said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/farm-fires-waste-burning-may-turn-air-poor/articleshow/87347414.cms||Ipsita Pati
