Dell Technologies conducted a research by Forrester Consulting, which revealed that most businesses in Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) are struggling with proliferation of data. Instead of offering a competitive advantage, data has become a burden due to an array of barriers: a data skills gap, data silos, manual processes, business silos and data privacy and security weaknesses. The findings are based on a survey of more than 4,000 decision-makers from 45 countries globally including 1,000 respondents from nine countries across APJ. The research indicates that while 74 per cent of businesses in India believe they are data-driven, only 24 per cent testify to treating data as capital and prioritizing its use across the business. “These findings clearly indicate that this data deluge has put immense pressure on businesses to embrace digital transformation and become a data-driven business. Currently, technology innovation is the only constant factor for business growth,” said Ripu Bajwa, director and general manager, data protection solutions, Dell Technologies, India. More than two-thirds admit that they need more data, but even more businesses claim that they have more data now than they can handle. Most believe in the data benefits of transitioning to an on-demand model, but only a few (24 per cent of businesses in India) have made the move. “Businesses are investing their energies in deploying new-age-technologies and gathering actionable insights from their data. It is important for businesses to assess their existing infrastructure and deploy solutions that will help them derive better business results from this data. Following this approach, will help them maintain their business continuity and safeguard themselves from any future roadblocks. Adopting a data driven mindset will help businesses fast-track their digital journeys and stay ahead of the competitive curve,” he said. The study builds on the Dell Technologies Digital Transformation Index research, which assesses the digital maturity of businesses around the globe. The new digital transformation index revealed that “data overload/inability to extract insights from data” was the second highest ranking barrier to transformation in India up from 12th in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/85-indian-businesses-yet-to-progress-data-technology-processes-research/articleshow/87169487.cms||Preeti Biswas

According to officials of Karnataka Examinations Authority that conducts the CET counselling, students can pick Kannada engineering programmes during the option-entry process. They are also free to mix Kannada and English programmes in their list of preferences. This is the first time that Karnataka is offering engineering in Kannada. Launched as part of the National Education Policy (NEP), Kannada courses will be available in four engineering courses this academic year — Bheemanna Khandre Institute of Technology, Bhalki (civil), BLDAE VP Dr PG Halakatti College of Engineering, Vijayapura (civil), SJC Institute of Technology, Chikkaballapur (mechanical) and Maharaja Institute of Technology, Mysuru (mechanical). The courses have an intake of 30 each. Currently, the document verification process is still under way at KEA. Officials said the option-entry process will start in the first week of November and will continue till the end of the month. The calendar is delayed as the class 12 exams were deferred owing to the second wave of the pandemic in March-April. CET was held on August 28 and 29. Meanwhile, M R Doreswamy, former adviser to the government on educational reforms, has written to the higher education department to expedite the CET process so that the academic calendar is not disturbed. Officials at KEA said this is the fastest that can be done and it would at least require a month for the option-entry process to be completed. “We will decide on the reopening date for first-year students after the first round of counselling. If the counselling starts by October end, it might take another 10 days for the first round to be over. NEET results are yet to be out. Merit students will drop out when they get seats in NEET. So, we need to wait. Once classes begin, we will start with 21 days of student induction programme,” said Karisidappa, vice chancellor, Visvesvaraya Technological University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kannada-engg-seats-to-be-picked-via-option-entry/articleshow/87169501.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

A resident of Chennai, the 42-year-old man had concealed two pieces of gold in his mouth — they weigh100 grams and are valued at Rs 4.9 lakh. Fifteen other gold pieces, worth Rs 49.6 lakh, were found hidden in the Indigo flight 6E 096. It is unclear if the same person had abandoned the gold on the flight that landed here from Dubai early Wednesday. Sources with the Air Intelligence Unit of Bengaluru Customs said that following passenger profiling, sleuths intercepted the man and questioned him. They realised he had some difficulty while talking to the investigators. The customs officers then checked his mouth and found two pieces of gold hidden inside. The suspect was booked for customs duty evasion and the gold seized. He had travelled to DubaiDuring questioning, the suspect said he had travelled to Dubai from Chennai on October 14. The officers boarded the flight and found 15 pieces of gold hidden in the aircraft. They weighed over 1kg.

The investment syndicate is called LV Fuel, and consists of 375 portfolio companies, including Trell, Khatabook, Classplus, Dukaan, Airmeet, Bobble AI, Aureus Analytics, MyUpchar, Biddano, and Absolute Foods. These companies are collectively valued at over $3 billion.LV Fuel, along with LetsVenture, will invest between $30,000 and $2 million in the selected startups. The syndicate will invest in 20 startups initially. About 20% of the investments will be deployed towards women entrepreneurs and founders from tier-2 and 3 cities. The idea behind LV Fuel was to enable wealth creation, empower next-gen entrepreneurs and generate employment -- as a way of giving back to the community through knowledge sharing and mentorship. These portfolio firms have raised over $300 million through the LetsVenture platform.Shanti Mohan, co-founder and CEO of LetsVenture, said, “There were two main drivers for LV Fuel. First was a maturing ecosystem where we have many founders who have built scalable businesses and would be the best mentors to new founders. Second is the large number of founders who are now signing up as investors on LetsVenture. Our goal to make private market investing easy and accessible remains key to all our initiatives.” These founder-investors will extend their support to startups in multiple aspects including technical advisory, mentoring, business continuity assistance, providing CXO connections across industries for growth and partnerships. Mohan said that with the maturity in the start investing ecosystem, seed rounds will change from friend and family, to friend, family and founders.LetsVenture will also play a significant role in supporting startups with infrastructure credits, the opportunity to become a founder-investor in LV Fuel, marketing support, and VC connections for follow-on rounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/letsventure-cos-give-startups-a-hand/articleshow/87169539.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

The deal value was not disclosed. This is the first acquisition in India for Stripe, which was valued at $95 billion in March.Recko, founded by Saurya Prakash Sinha and Prashant Borde in 2017, has a tech stack for reconciliation, commission calculation, payout creation, and reporting. Businesses use it to track and manage financial data. Sinha graduated from IIT Gandhinagar in 2013. He previously co-founded Townrush (acquired by Grofers), and worked at Phonepe and Flipkart. Borde passed out of IIT Gandhinagar in 2012. He co-founded Cubeit.io that was acquired by Myntra, and worked at Reliance Jio.Recko customers include Grofers, Meesho, Dunzo, Pharmeasy, Curefit, Udaan, MPL, and Khatabook. Recko has processed over $5 billion worth of transactions. It processes over 50 million transactions on average each month. In a blog post, Stripe said Recko will join Stripe’s integrated suite of products that helps users optimise growth and efficiently manage revenue."Payments reconciliation shouldn’t be a mild headache that balloons into a migraine as a company grows—it should be an easy, highly automated process,” said Will Gaybrick, Stripe’s chief product officer, in the blogpost. “Stripe helps millions of businesses around the world streamline their revenue management—from subscriptions and invoicing to revenue recognition and book-keeping. With Recko, we’ll automate their payments reconciliation, a critical input into their overall financial health.”Stripe said that Recko removes barriers to seamless payments reconciliation by automating the collection of transaction data from financial systems and non-Stripe payment processors, including Excel or CSV attachments saved in emails. It also accurately matches thousands of individual transactions with just a few clicks, saving finance teams countless hours of manual reconciliation tasks such as identifying which lump-sum deposit maps to which combination of individual sales.“Joining Stripe is a perfect next chapter for Recko, and we can’t wait to help grow the GDP of the internet by removing the burden of reconciliation complexity,” said Sinha, CEO of Recko. “Internet businesses need new financial tools that can scale with their growth and automate the tasks required to produce an accurate picture of their financial health.”Recko’s team will join Stripe’s remote engineering hub. Recko had raised $7 million from investors that include Vertex Ventures and Prime Venture Partners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/us-payments-co-stripe-acquires-bluru-based-recko/articleshow/87169559.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Others in the top 10 include Deutsche Bank, Genpact, IBM, Infosys, Mastercard, and ZS Associates.The report, called Best Companies for Women in India (BCWI), finds that the number of women who were promoted this year in the top 100 companies it mapped was 6.1%, compared to 5.6% among men. And among the top 10 companies, 4.3% of women employees were promoted, compared to 3.9% of their male counterparts.However, the number of women who got promotions in 2021 in the 100 firms fell from a high of 13% in the year before. “The deep trough being witnessed in promotion of women in 2021 best companies, as compared to the previous year, is mirrored in the dip in leadership in sectors such as BFSI and pharma. However, when compared to the lakhs of women who lost jobs, across the hierarchy because of Covid, this is a silver lining, as companies within the 100 best, were able to elevate women to positions of greater responsibility during a time of crisis,” said Avtar founder Saundarya Rajesh. The 2021 edition of the report covered 334 companies across industries and had 300 questions related to their practices, programmes and policies to ensure gender inclusion at their workplaces.The number of women in the workforce in the top 100 companies increased to 34.5% in 2021, from 34% in 2020. It was 25% in 2016. There has been a 2% rise in representation of women at managerial levels from 23% in 2020 to 25.4% this year. It was only 19% in 2016. Career sponsorship, where senior leaders become mentors and advocates advancing senior women talent in the organisation, was at 66% in 2021, compared to 45% in 2016, indicating structured interventions to effect people side changes.About 84% of the companies have put mechanisms in place to measure and benchmark gender pay equity, showing this is an important prerequisite for gender inclusion. The maternity retention rate this year is at 97%, compared to 91% last year. About 73% of the firms have formally structured reintegration programmes for returning mothers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/accenture-infosys-best-cos-in-india-for-women-workers/articleshow/87169563.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Two Army personnel were injured in the same encounter at Cheerbagh. One slain terrorist was identified as Adil Ahmad Wani who, according to the police, was the LeT (TRF) Shopian "district commander". Earlier, IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said that Wani was involved in the killing of a carpenter, Sageer Ahmad of UP, in Litter Pulwama last weekend. "The terrorist identified as Adil Ahmad Wani was active since July 2020," the IGP said. So far, he said, 15 terrorists have been killed in two weeks. The Kishtwar police, meanwhile, claimed they had foiled a terror plot with the arrest of one LeT member with a hand grenade during checking at a security point in Drabshalla Thathri, Kishtwar district. ADGP (Jammu zone) Mukesh Singh said the checking was carried out "based on inputs about inimical elements planning to carry out a grenade blast in Kishtwar district". "A joint naka was established by Kishtwar police, 26 RR (Army) and CRPF 52 Bn personnel at Drabshalla Thathri at 5.30 pm," Singh said. "The individual, identified as Sohail Ahmed Bhat, son of Noor Mohammed Bhat, a resident of Bathri Gandoh in district Doda, was arrested on the spot. The arrested terrorist belongs to LeT and was sent the grenade by LeT terrorist Khobaib, who is based in Pakistan," the senior police officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/soldier-2-let-men-killed-in-shopian/articleshow/87169421.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The residents are seeking help to assess the condition of their buildings and fitness certificates, which, however, the civic agency does not issue.BBMP officials said their zonal offices across the city are swamped with calls from residential areas like Horamavu, DJ Halli, Hennur, Bellandur, Dickenson Road, Benson Town and Shivajinagar. The eight zones and the BBMP control room have received over 300 calls, requesting engineers to inspect the condition of buildings and give a fitness certificate.“After a structurally weak building was demolished in Ibrahim Street, many people from neighbouring localities are calling us to inspect the condition of their buildings. This is a big task,” said a senior engineer, BBMP East zone. “We do not have such a service but due to the rise in accidents, residents living in old structures or those close to such buildings are fearing for their lives and properties. We can only check the building's condition based on the year of construction. If there is water seepage inside, by just looking at the building we cannot tell whether they are structurally fit or will collapse anytime,” said an official from the West zone. Sheela Nair, who has recently moved into a 15-year-old apartment in Benson Town, said: "There's water seepage and algae-like patches in the building. My family and I are worried. How do I know if the building is safe or not? Why doesn't the building have a fitness certificate?”Daniel Sukumar, a resident of Kamaraj Road, said BBMP must conduct a drive to check the structural stability of buildings in the city. “We wouldn't know if there's anything wrong with our building. If the civic body conducts a drive and issues fitness certificates, it will help prevent major accidents,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/citizens-swamp-bbmp-with-calls-seek-building-fitness-certificates/articleshow/87169648.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Irked by bigamy charges, HD Kumaraswamy threatens to expose BJP leaders||BENGALURU: A day after calling Rahul Gandhi a drug peddler and an addict, the BJP on Wednesday accused former chief minister and JD(S) legislature party chief HD Kumaraswamy of bigamy. The Karnataka BJP unit tweeted: “Signal jump, breach of trust, corruption, nepotism and more than anything else bigamy. Should H D Kumaraswamy, who always ridicules the mistakes of others, not be careful about these things?” It warned Kumaraswamy that these attract punishment under the Indian Penal Code. Karnataka has been witnessing personal attacks in the run-up to the Hangal and Sindgi byelections on October 30. ‘My life is an open book’ Kumaraswamy retorted that his life is an open book. “Some things do happen sometimes in life. It is in our hands to reform. I had taken a wrong path, and rectified it,” he added. He warned BJP: “Speaking about personal lives will not help anyone, but only deflects attention from the real issues. Neither am I afraid nor disturbed by such statements. But be careful. I can also speak on personal lives. Every BJP leader has a history and if I start talking about them, they’ll run for cover. I can speak on what Kateel (BJP state chief) has done to families of senior pracharaks in Mangaluru,” he said. ‘ Cong, JD(S) competing for minority votes’Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and home minister Araga Jnanendra said Congress and JD(S) leaders are maligning the RSS, a patriotic organisation, as both are competing for minorities’ votes. “RSS was founded by nationalists and is working to build a strong nation,” Jnanendra said This follows Kumaraswamy saying he had nothing to learn from RSS shakhas, alleging that people trained there watched blue films in the legislative assembly during the session.  “I don't want their companionship. Haven’t we seen what was taught in RSS shakhas? How to behave in the Vidhana Soudha...watching a blue film while the assembly session is on?” He was responding to Nalin Kumar Kateel’s invitation to visit an RSS shakha and learn about its activities. This followed Kumaraswamy attacking the RSS for the past week, accusing it of controlling the Modi government and BJP-ruled state governments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/irked-by-bigamy-charges-hdk-threatens-to-expose-bjp-leaders/articleshow/87169651.cms||---

But the mission statement — “Bringing Bengaluru suburban rail project in 2190 days (six years) — that adorns the home page of the K-RIDE website (kride.in) has remained unchanged for nearly a year now. K-RIDE is a joint venture of Government of Karnataka and the railway ministry.In October 2020, the Centre cleared the long-pending 148km suburban rail. However, the Rs 15,657-crore project is still on the drawing board. K-RIDE is yet to float civil work tenders.The project comprises four corridors: KSR Bengaluru City-Devanahalli, Byappanahalli-Chikkabanavara, Kengeri-Cantonment-Whitefield and Heelalige-Rajanukunte.In fact, the project saw massive delays even though it was announced in the 2018-19 Union Budget and cleared by the railway board in November 2019. While sanctioning the project in October 2020, the Centre had stated that entire project (four corridors) to be completed in six years (2026) and the airport corridor (KSR Bengaluru City-Devanahalli) in three years (2023).In November 2020, however, the state urban development department instructed K-RIDE to take up Byappanahalli-Chikkabanavara and Heelalige-Rajanukunte in the first phase and another two corridors, which will be running parallel to Namma Metro, in the second phase.Sources said the plan was to lay the foundation stone of the project before BBMP polls and make at least one corridor operational before the assembly elections in May 2023. Going by the slow pace of the work, this seems unlikely.In fact, then chief minister BS Yediyurappa in June 2021 stated that suburban rail work would start in three months after completing all tender process. Yediyurappa had also instructed K-RIDE to complete all tender work and commence Byappanahalli- Chikkabanavara corridor by October 2021. Though K-RIDE officials had earlier said they will float the civil tender by March 2021, it missed several deadlines. It will take at least three-four months to start work even after inviting the tender. Amit Garg, MD of K-RIDE, was not available for comments.K-RIDE officials said two other tenders — engagement of general consultant for the project and engagement of transaction advisory services for selection of an entity for procurement, operation & maintenance of rolling stock on PPP model — will be finalised by the end of October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/year-after-centres-nod-suburban-rail-project-still-on-drawing-board/articleshow/87169653.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Delimitation delay may push zilla panchayat-taluk panchayat elections by one year||BENGALURU: The zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat elections are likely to be delayed by more than a year with the state government dithering on nominating members to the Panchayat Raj Delimitation Commission after it was constituted under a law passed a month ago. The situation may even lead to an unprecedented scenario of a narrow gap between ZP-TP polls and assembly elections due in early 2023 or the clash of two hustings posing huge logistical and administrative challenges. Both the elections are equally big in terms of geographical coverage and size of the electorate. The elections are to be held for all 31 ZPs and 232 TPs. The government has shown little progress in constituting the delimitation commission except appointing retired IAS officer M Lakshminarayan as the chairman after enacting the Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Act on September 16. While the new law wrests the powers of the State Election Commission (SEC) to redraw the boundaries of the ZP-TP wards, the delimitation will now be done by the commission and the panel will also decide on the reservation of wards. The tenure of the commission is one year. The government is yet to nominate members to the three-member panel (a retired IAS officer of secretary rank and an expert in rural development and panchayat raj sector) and allocate an office space. “We’ve been asked to complete the delimitation exercise in six months from now, although the tenure of the commission is one year. We’ll start the work soon after the members are nominated,” said Lakshminarayan. Long procedures RDPR principal secretary LK Ateeq said the department has started the process to nominate members and it will be done shortly so that elections are held at the earliest. The government officials, however, said the panchayat elections are likely to be delayed beyond January-February next year considering the procedures to be fulfilled. The delimitation commission has to call public objection after preparing the draft of the delimited wards and it takes three months. This will be followed by the exercise of fixing reservation that entails publication of the draft reservation and calling objections. The elections are to be scheduled only after 45 days of finalisation of reservation and electoral roll. Meanwhile, the SEC is planning to move the high court seeking its directions to conduct the elections immediately. “The SEC had completed all required steps including delimitation and reservation before the government requested to postpone the polls because of the pandemic. The rules mandate to conduct the elections with the present delimitation and reservation, while the new delimitation can be applicable for the next one. We are planning to move the court on these grounds,” said SEC secretary Honnamba S.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/delimitation-delay-may-push-zp-tp-elections-by-one-year/articleshow/87169657.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bengaluru||Bommai: Will try to meet quota aspirations of all communities||Bengaluru/Haveri: Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday promised to look into the demands of various communities, including Valmiki, for an increase or reclassification in reservation quota. “We have already set up an expert committee to study the legal framework involved and suggest to the government how to go about it. Since all reservations should be under 50%, it will be a big challenge. But I will do my best to meet the aspirations of all communities,” Bommai said, speaking at a function to mark Maharshi Valmiki Jayanti. The CM’s statement holds significance because the state is witnessing a movement by various communities seeking an increase in reservation quota and re-classification of their communities in the reservation list. The Valmiki community is demanding that their reservation level should be increased from 3.5% to 7.5% while Panchamasali Lingayats want 2A category status, which will increase the reservation quota for them. The Kuruba and Kodava communities, which are in the backward classes’ list, have been demanding the tag of Scheduled Tribe. The state government has already constituted a three-member committee headed by former high court judge and Upa Lokayukta Justice Subhash B Adi to look into these demands. In his maiden cabinet meeting, Bommai said they decided to create a separate secretariat for ST welfare and earmarked Rs 7,600 crore for ST welfare.Personal attacks on PM unwanted: BSYIn Sindgi, Yediyurappa took on the Congress by chiding the opposition for making a futile attempt to make “unwanted” personal attacks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The crass language used by the Congress will not have any bearing on PM Modi and that it will hurt them instead,” he said.Yediyurappa also played the emotional chord by asking the people of Sindgi to vote for the party candidate, and that he had come “from far” to ask for their support.Meanwhile, AICC national general secretary and Karnataka in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala, who campaigned in Hangal, targeted the central government over rising prices of petrol and diesel, alleging “fuel loot”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bommai-will-try-to-meet-quota-aspirations-of-all-communities/articleshow/87169660.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Auto drivers have free run as officials look other way||Bengaluru: Complaints about autorickshaw drivers fleecing commuters and refusing long-distance rides are common in the city now. The fares, despite the LPG price rise, have not been revised since 2013. Auto drivers are often heard telling commuters: “Meter mele enaadru kodi, saar (give something above meter),” or ‘Meter mele wonandaaf’ (one and a half above the meter fare).” Bengaluru traffic police records, however, show that the number of cases for demanding excess fare has reduced from 23,002 in 2019 to 11,808 in 2020. Between January and August 2021, only 525 cases were booked. Similarly, cases of refusal-to-ply violations have reduced from 27,344 in 2019 to 11,623 in 2020. In total, 323 drivers were caught till August this year.Traffic police cited the Covid lockdown for the reduction in cases, but commuters complain that the cops have stopped running enforcement drives. A traffic police officer said: “The government is in the process of revising autorickshaw fares. We will start special drives once it is done.”‘Fare revision proposal is with minister’At present, the minimum autorickshaw fare for the first 1.9 km is Rs 25 and Rs 13 for every additional kilometre. The Road Transport Authority, after taking into consideration factors like inflation, rise in the LPG prices and maintenance costs, has proposed to increase the minimum charge to Rs 30 and Rs 16 for every subsequent kilometre. “The proposal to revise the fare is with the transport minister. We will revise it once we get the nod from the government,” said an official source.An auto union said that fare revision is necessary to make rides economically fair for auto drivers. TOI had carried a report titled ‘minimum auto charge could go up to Rs 30’ on April 3, 2021. Auto drivers had not been pushing for the fare hike in the recent past fearing that commuters may shift to app-based cabs.

The railway ministry on Monday decided to close IRSDC, which was set up in 2012 mainly for the redevelopment of stations. The ministry stated in a notification that all stations managed by IRSDC would be handed over to the respective zonal railways. “...Zonal railways will further develop the station projects,” it said. IRSDC was maintaining KSR Bengaluru City railway station since February 2019. It also had plans to take over and maintain a few more stations, including Yeshwantpur, KR Puram and Bangarpet under South Western Railway (SWR). Many passengers say cleanliness of KSR Bengaluru City railway station improved after IRSDC took over. It had brought UK-based Knight Frank for facility and asset management services. Many branded outlets and eateries were started there in the last two years. “There was a visible improvement in City railway station in terms of cleanliness during the IRSDC period. They also brought more branded and hygienic food joints. But we don’t know how going back to the old system helps passengers,” said Ramesh Kumar, a commuter. At City railway station, IRSDC also put in place a 12-foot tunnel aquarium, the first such facility in a railway station in the country. Another initiative was the Dawa Dost, a store selling generic medicines at discounted rates to passengers. IRSDC also introduced premium parking charges: Rs 25 for four-wheelers and Rs 15 for two-wheelers for the first two hours. This reduced the number of vehicles entering the station. It was also planning a fish pedicure facility, gaming zone and a music foundation, among other facilities, at the station. Many IRSDC employees are in shock after the closure announcement. Station redevelopment plan affectedSources in the know said four railway stations in the city — KSR Bengaluru City, Yeshwantpur, Cantonment and the existing Byappanahalli station — were identified for redevelopment. With the closure of IRSDC, the fate of these projects also hangs in the balance. IRSDC has already redeveloped Habibganj in Madhya Pradesh and Gandhinagar in Gujarat. Sources said the corporation has completed drawing up the plan for development of Byappanahalli station and sent it to the railway board for approval. For Cantonment, the land is now with the Rail Land Development Authority. It is likely to be used to set up a suburban rail terminal. For KSR Bengaluru City and Yeshwantpur, IRSDC has submitted the conceptual drawing to the Bengaluru division for approval. “IRSDC was supposed to be an independent body, but its hands were tied...There were several irregularities in the allotment of shops at stations but that reduced after IRSDC took over,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/move-to-shut-irsdc-may-hit-rly-stations-upkeep/articleshow/87169688.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The protests were at spots where potholes were particularly bad — incense sticks were lit and coconuts smashed.“I had three accidents in recent weeks. Forget the roads not being motorable, they are not even fit for pedestrians. I’ve fallen three times but thankfully didn’t have any major injuries because I was riding slowly. Given the road condition, it is impossible to go even moderately fast,” Syed Yousif, a resident of KG Halli, said. Protesters pointed out that their vehicles have suffered extensive, and expensive, damage. Another resident of KG Halli, Noor Mohammad Taj, said, “Earlier, we used to go to the corporator and ask for help, but now that’s not an option. The MLA and MP are not very helpful; they haven’t visited even this street for a long time.”The recent rain has worsened the situation and therefore, protesters demanded BBMP immediately fix the roads. “When it rains, it’s a mess here. Some potholes are deep and some filled with gravel. It’s hellish for two-wheeler riders and they end up either skidding or losing balance. It’s a common sight on the three roads where protests were held,” Taj added. The roads link HBR Layout to RT Nagar. Abdul Hafiz, vice-president, AAP, Sarvagnanagar assembly constituency, who was at the protest, said, “There are only potholes, no roads. When traffic piles up on any of these roads, it takes a long time to clear as vehicles cannot move fast.” BBMP chief engineer BS Prahalad, in-charge of fixing potholes, was unavailable for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/aap-workers-perform-puja-at-potholes/articleshow/87169692.cms||---

---||Business||VIL to opt for 4-year moratorium on spectrum payments||NEW DELHI: Vodafone Idea on Wednesday said its board has approved availing the four-year spectrum payment moratorium being offered by the government as part of its relief package for the telecom sector. The other options offered in the Telecom Department's notification will be considered by the board of directors within the stipulated timeframe, it said in a regulatory filing. "...we wish to inform you that the Board of Directors of the company has approved the exercise of the option of deferment of the company's spectrum auction instalments for a period of 4 years (October 2021 to September 2025) in accordance with ...the notification dated 14 October 2021 issued by the department of telecommunications (DoT) to the company," it said. In line with the bold reforms announced recently for the telecom sector, the government last week wrote to telcos including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio asking them to convey by October 29 if they would be opting for the four-year dues moratorium. It has also given 90 days time to the operators to indicate if they want to opt for converting the interest amount pertaining to the moratorium period into equity. Along with this option, the audited financial statements of the immediately preceding financial year (2020-21) would have to be submitted, according to the letter sent to the telcos. The government has offered the option to defer payment of the spectrum auction instalments due up to four years, with immediate effect, excluding the instalments due for spectrum auction 2021. This option is applicable from FY 2022-23 to FY 2025-26. These deferred amounts will be spread equally over the remaining instalments to be paid, without any increase in the existing time period specified for making the instalment payments. Interest as stipulated in the relevant year of auction of spectrum will, however, be charged so that the Net Present Value (NPV) of the payable amount is protected. The letters were sent by the department of telecom (DoT) on Friday to the individual operators. "Option for converting the interest amount, arising out of protection of NPV on account of deferred spectrum dues, pertaining to the moratorium period, by way of equity, shall be exercised within 90 days of this notification," the DoT letter to telcos had said. The letter spelt out the fine print related to the option for moratorium of deferred spectrum auction instalments and AGR related dues, as also the modalities for converting interest amount into equity. The method of arriving at the price and valuation for equity conversion of interest dues is different for listed and unlisted companies. One of the letters issued by DoT to a listed company had mentioned that equity shares would be issued by the company to the government on preferential basis. It went on to add that the NPV of the interest amount will be calculated as on the date of exercise of option. The interest amount will continue to be treated as a loan to companies till the completion of the equity infusion process, DoT had said. The government recently approved a blockbuster relief package for the sector that includes a four-year break for companies from paying statutory dues, permission to share scarce airwaves, change in the definition of revenue on which levies are paid and 100 per cent foreign investment through the automatic route. The measures, aimed at providing relief to companies such as Vodafone Idea that have to pay thousands of crores in unprovisioned past statutory dues, also include the scrapping of Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC) for airwaves acquired in future spectrum auctions. For the past dues, the government has allowed a moratorium or deferment of up to four years in annual payments. But the telecom companies will have to pay interest during the moratorium period. Also, the government will have an option to convert the due amount pertaining to the deferred payment into equity at the end of the moratorium/deferment period. It has also given an option to the telcos to pay the interest amount arising due to the said deferment of payment, by way of equity. Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal had last month said the company will opt for payment moratorium and redirect the cashflow to aggressively build networks. With regard to interest dues on payment moratorium, Mittal had said Airtel will take a decision, when the offer comes from the government, on whether to go for equity conversion mechanism or pay cash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vil-to-opt-for-4-year-moratorium-on-spectrum-payments/articleshow/87169676.cms||---

---||World||Human remains found in Florida amid search for Gabby Petito's fiance||ST. PETERSBURG: Items believed to belong to Brian Laundrie were found Wednesday in a Florida wilderness park as the search continued for clues in the slaying of Gabby Petito, according to the FBI and a Laundrie family attorney.  Laundrie's parents, Chris and Roberta Laundrie, took part in the search Wednesday with the FBI and police from North Port, Florida, more than a month after Laundrie was reported missing after heading to the vast Carlton Reserve park.  "After a brief search off a trail that Brian frequented some articles belonging to Brian were found," attorney Steven Bertolino said in a text to The Associated Press. "As of now law enforcement is conducting a more thorough investigation of that area."  The FBI field office in Tampa also issued a statement on Twitter confirming that "items of interest" were found in the Laundrie search but did not describe them further.  "An FBI Evidence Response team is processing the scene. The reserve is closed to the public and no further details are available at this time," the statement said.  The Sarasota County Medical Examiner's Office confirmed it had been summoned to the reserve but would not comment further.  Laundrie, 23, is a person of interest in the killing of Petito, who was reported missing Sept. 11 by her parents while the couple was on a cross-country trip out West.  The case generated enormous public interest but also raised uncomfortable questions over the unequal attention given to the hundreds of cases of Native American and other minority women missing or murdered across the United States. Petito is white.  Petito's body was found Sept. 19 on the edge of Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park, which the couple had visited. The coroner there concluded she died of strangulation and her body had been where it was found for three or four weeks.  The couple was stopped Aug. 12 by police in Moab, Utah, after they had a physical altercation, but no charges were filed.  Laundrie returned home alone Sept. 1 in the Ford van the couple took on their trip. He was reported missing after telling his parents on Sept. 14 that he was going for a hike in the Carlton Reserve, a nature preserve in Sarasota County that has for weeks been a key area in the search.  The activity Wednesday was focused on the nearby Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park, where television news reports showed numerous law enforcement vehicles arriving and a tent set up inside the woods. The location is where a Ford Mustang that Laundrie drove to the wilderness was found.  Laundrie is charged in a federal Wyoming indictment with unauthorized use of a debit card, which would allow authorities to arrest him if he is found alive.  It alleges Laundrie used a Capital One Bank card and someone's personal identification number to make unauthorized withdrawals or charges worth more than $1,000. It does not say to whom the card belonged or what type of charges were made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/human-remains-found-in-florida-amid-search-for-gabby-petitos-fiance/articleshow/87169805.cms||---

The residents are seeking help to assess the condition of their buildings and fitness certificates, which, however, the civic agency does not issue. BBMP officials said their zonal offices across the city are swamped with calls from residential areas like Horamavu, DJ Halli, Hennur, Bellandur, Dickenson Road, Benson Town and Shivajinagar. The eight zones and the BBMP control room have received over 300 calls, requesting engineers to inspect the condition of buildings and give a fitness certificate. “After a structurally weak building was demolished in Ibrahim Street, many people from neighbouring localities are calling us to inspect the condition of their buildings. This is a big task,” said a senior engineer, BBMP East zone. “We do not have such a service but due to the rise in accidents, residents living in old structures or those close to such buildings are fearing for their lives and properties. We can only check the building's condition based on the year of construction. If there is water seepage inside, by just looking at the building we cannot tell whether they are structurally fit or will collapse anytime,” said an official from the West zone. Sheela Nair, who has recently moved into a 15-year-old apartment in Benson Town, said: "There's water seepage and algae-like patches in the building. My family and I are worried. How do I know if the building is safe or not? Why doesn't the building have a fitness certificate?” Daniel Sukumar, a resident of Kamaraj Road, said BBMP must conduct a drive to check the structural stability of buildings in the city. “We wouldn't know if there's anything wrong with our building. If the civic body conducts a drive and issues fitness certificates, it will help prevent major accidents,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/citizens-swamp-bbmp-with-calls-seek-building-fitness-certificates/articleshow/87170049.cms||Nithya Mandyam

But the mission statement — “Bringing Bengaluru suburban rail project in 2190 days (six years) — that adorns the home page of the K-RIDE website (kride.in) has remained unchanged for nearly a year now. K-RIDE is a joint venture of Government of Karnataka and the railway ministry. In October 2020, the Centre cleared the long-pending 148km suburban rail. However, the Rs 15,657-crore project is still on the drawing board. K-RIDE is yet to float civil work tenders. The project comprises four corridors: KSR Bengaluru City-Devanahalli, Byappanahalli-Chikkabanavara, Kengeri-Cantonment-Whitefield and Heelalige-Rajanukunte. In fact, the project saw massive delays even though it was announced in the 2018-19 Union Budget and cleared by the railway board in November 2019. While sanctioning the project in October 2020, the Centre had stated that entire project (four corridors) to be completed in six years (2026) and the airport corridor (KSR Bengaluru City-Devanahalli) in three years (2023). In November 2020, however, the state urban development department instructed K-RIDE to take up Byappanahalli-Chikkabanavara and Heelalige-Rajanukunte in the first phase and another two corridors, which will be running parallel to Namma Metro, in the second phase. Sources said the plan was to lay the foundation stone of the project before BBMP polls and make at least one corridor operational before the assembly elections in May 2023. Going by the slow pace of the work, this seems unlikely. In fact, then chief minister BS Yediyurappa in June 2021 stated that suburban rail work would start in three months after completing all tender process. Yediyurappa had also instructed K-RIDE to complete all tender work and commence Byappanahalli- Chikkabanavara corridor by October 2021. Though K-RIDE officials had earlier said they will float the civil tender by March 2021, it missed several deadlines. It will take at least three-four months to start work even after inviting the tender. Amit Garg, MD of K-RIDE, was not available for comments. K-RIDE officials said two other tenders — engagement of general consultant for the project and engagement of transaction advisory services for selection of an entity for procurement, operation & maintenance of rolling stock on PPP model — will be finalised by the end of October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/year-after-centres-nod-suburban-rail-project-still-on-drawing-board/articleshow/87170056.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Auto drivers have free run as officials look other way||BENGALURU: Complaints about autorickshaw drivers fleecing commuters and refusing long-distance rides are common in the city now. The fares, despite the LPG price rise, have not been revised since 2013. Auto drivers are often heard telling commuters: “Meter mele enaadru kodi, saar (give something above meter),” or ‘Meter mele wonandaaf’ (one and a half above the meter fare).” Bengaluru traffic police records, however, show that the number of cases for demanding excess fare has reduced from 23,002 in 2019 to 11,808 in 2020. Between January and August 2021, only 525 cases were booked. Similarly, cases of refusal-to-ply violations have reduced from 27,344 in 2019 to 11,623 in 2020. In total, 323 drivers were caught till August this year. Traffic police cited the Covid lockdown for the reduction in cases, but commuters complain that the cops have stopped running enforcement drives. A traffic police officer said: “The government is in the process of revising autorickshaw fares. We will start special drives once it is done.” ‘Fare revision proposal is with minister’At present, the minimum autorickshaw fare for the first 1.9 km is Rs 25 and Rs 13 for every additional kilometre. The Road Transport Authority, after taking into consideration factors like inflation, rise in the LPG prices and maintenance costs, has proposed to increase the minimum charge to Rs 30 and Rs 16 for every subsequent kilometre. “The proposal to revise the fare is with the transport minister. We will revise it once we get the nod from the government,” said an official source. An auto union said that fare revision is necessary to make rides economically fair for auto drivers. TOI had carried a report titled ‘minimum auto charge could go up to Rs 30’ on April 3, 2021. Auto drivers had not been pushing for the fare hike in the recent past fearing that commuters may shift to app-based cabs. With cabs also becoming expensive after the transport department fixed minimum and maximum rates, auto drivers now feel the tariff should be revised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/auto-drivers-have-free-run-as-officials-look-other-way/articleshow/87170069.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

---||India||Priyanka Gandhi meets family members of man who died in police custody in Agra||AGRA/LUCKNOW: Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday night met the family members of a man who died in police custody in Agra after being detained for allegedly stealing Rs 25 lakh from a police station. Earlier, she was stopped in Lucknow by the Uttar Pradesh Police from going to Agra, but was later allowed to proceed. The police allowed Priyanka Gandhi to go and she left for Agra in the evening, Congress spokesperson Anshu Awasthi said. The Lucknow Police allowed four people, including UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu and senior leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam, to accompany Priyanka Gandhi, Awasthi said. Priyanka Gandhi met family members of Arun, who was accused of stealing Rs 25 lakh from a police station in Agra and died in police custody after his health deteriorated during interrogation. AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh also met the family and said that under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's regime, the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh has deteriorated to “a new low”. Police said the Congress general secretary was stopped at the Lucknow-Agra expressway as the Agra district magistrate had requested not to allow any political personality to go there following the man's death. "She was neither taken into custody nor arrested. Because of the massive crowds, the traffic movement was being hampered and she was first asked to either go to the party office or her residence but when she did not agree, she was sent to the police lines," Lucknow Police Commissioner D K Thakur said. A Congress spokesperson had claimed that Priyanka Gandhi was taken into custody while she was going to Agra. To a query from reporters in Kushinagar on the Congress leader being stopped from going to Agra, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said, "Law and order is supreme and no one will be allowed to play with it." While being taken to the police lines, Priyanka Gandhi had told reporters that she will definitely go to Agra. A similar confrontation had occurred earlier this month when the Uttar Pradesh Police had prevented the Congress leader from visiting the families of the farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri. She was taken into preventive custody for over 48 hours before being allowed to visit the families along with Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders. When Priyanka Gandhi was shown the Agra district magistrate's message, she told police personnel: "Do I need someone's permission whenever I move out of Lucknow? Is there a problem? Why am I not being allowed to go to Agra? Is there a law-and-order issue?" Priyanka Gandhi asked the policemen who stopped her cavalcade." "Someone has died, how can it be a law-and-order issue? Ask the DM by calling him. It is too much that I cannot go out anywhere and should remain confined to a guesthouse in Lucknow," she told the police personnel. Congress workers who had reached the spot in large numbers raised slogans against the Uttar Pradesh government after Priyanka Gandhi was not allowed to proceed to Agra. In a tweet in Hindi, the Congress general secretary asked if beating anyone to death in police custody was any kind of justice. "The incident of Arun Valmiki's death in police custody in Agra is condemnable. On the day of Valmiki Jayanti, the Uttar Pradesh government has acted against his messages. A high-level investigation should be held and action taken against the policemen, and the victim's family should be compensated," she said. In another tweet after being stopped from going to Agra, the Congress leader said, "Arun Valmiki died in police custody. His family is seeking justice. I want to visit the family. What is the Uttar Pradesh government afraid of? Why am I being stopped? Today is Valmiki Jayanti, the prime minister spoke a lot about Buddha but is attacking his messages." Arun's incident comes close on the heels of Kanpur-based businessman Manish Gupta's death allegedly after being thrashed by police in a Gorakhpur hotel. The Uttar Pradesh police has already recommended a CBI probe into the incident. Senior Superintendent of Police (Agra) Muniraj G said the accused, Arun, suddenly fell sick on Tuesday night while a raid was being carried out at his house to recover the stolen money. He was taken to a hospital where doctors declared him dead, the officer said. Arun was accused of stealing the money on Saturday night from the "malkhana" (a storage house where items confiscated by police are kept)" of the Jagdishpura police station, where he worked as a cleaner. Following the theft, six police personnel, including the station house officer, were suspended by the additional director general (ADG) of police of the Agra zone. During the investigation, police rounded up several suspects. Arun was one of them as he had access to the "malkhana". He was arrested from the Taj Ganj locality in Agra on Tuesday. According to the police, Arun had shaved his head to hide his identity. "Police teams were questioning several suspects in connection with the theft. On Tuesday evening, a man named Arun, who is a resident of the Lohamandi area, was taken into police custody," the SSP said. "During interrogation, Arun admitted that he had committed the theft and informed us that the stolen money was kept at his home," he added. Police recovered Rs 15 lakh during the raid at his house before his health deteriorated and he died. The SSP said the body was sent for a post-mortem examination and suitable action will be taken after the report comes. A complaint has also been filed by Arun's family in connection with his death, he added. People from the Valmiki community gathered at Arun's house and demanded a fair probe into his death. Local leaders of the community said they would not observe "Maharishi Valmiki Jayanti" on Wednesday until a fair investigation is launched in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/priyanka-gandhi-meets-family-members-of-man-who-died-in-police-custody-in-agra/articleshow/87170117.cms||---

Four people who have suffered minor injuries in the fight are shifted to district hospital. As soon as the news broke, the Belagavi City Police Commissioner K Thiyagarajan, DCP (law and order) Vikram Amte and other police officials rushed to the spot. The security has been beefed up in the village to check further violence. The two injured are from a majority community and others are from minority. The police are registering the FIR. According to the police members of majority community were building a shrine near a mosque where villagers were offering pooja from several years. There was a small structure earlier in the same place. The construction of the temple began in the morning hours. At around 7 pm in the evening about 4-8 people led by a person identified as Inamdar arrived to the village from city. The police sources say that they were carrying lethal weapons. These men demolished the 5-foot walls built on four sides and later entered into argument with the temple committee. After a brief scuffle, both the sides began to attack each other. During the clash four are injured and are being treated at Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences (BIMS). A ACP level officer said "four people have suffered minor injuries and all are out of danger. This Inamdar claim that the land where the shrine is being built is owned by him." Dhanjaya Jadav, president of Belagavi BJP gram mandal talking to ToI said Inamdar had sold the land a few years ago. However some local people belonging minority community did not want a shrine beside a mosque. They informed Inamdar and asked them destroy, he alleged. The police said probe will be initiated and accused will face the tune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-communal-clash-breaks-out-over-temple-dispute-in-belagavi/articleshow/87170120.cms||Shreyas HS

Sen. Renan Calheiros presented the proposal to a committee of colleagues that has spent six months investigating the Brazilian government's management of the pandemic. The decision on whether to file most of the charges would be up to Brazil's prosecutor-general, a Bolsonaro appointee and ally. In a nearly 1,200-page report based on the committee's work, Calheiros called for Bolsonaro's indictment on charges ranging from charlatanism and inciting crime to misuse of public funds and crimes against humanity. The report can be modified before the 11-member senatorial committee considers endorsing it; a vote is set for Oct. 26. The committee "collected evidence that abundantly demonstrated that the federal government was silent and chose to act in a non-technical and reckless manner,'' the report states. Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the threat of the coronavirus and touted misinformation and unproven Covid-19 treatments while ignoring international health guidelines for curtailing the spread of the the disease. He steadfastly rejected restricting activity during the worst of Brazil's outbreak, claiming the poor would suffer worse hardship if the economy ground to a halt. The panel investigated allegations that Bolsonaro's management of the pandemic caused many of Brazil's more than 600,000 Covid-19 deaths. He has repeatedly described the Senate investigation as a political instrument aimed at sabotaging him, denying any wrongdoing in his government's handling of the pandemic. "We know we are not to blame for anything. We know we did the right thing from the very first moment,'' Bolsonaro said Wednesday from the northeastern state of Ceara. Analysts say it's unclear if Prosecutor-General Augusto Aras would charge Bolsonaro even if there are legal grounds to do so, and that the report was far more likely to hamper the president's push for reelection a year from now than make him a defendant in a courtroom. "The major impact of the investigation is political, because it generated tons of news that certainly will be used by campaign strategists next year,'' said Thiago de Aragao, director of strategy at political consulting firm Arko Advice. Calheiros, whom the committee designated to write the report, read a summary of the report to the Senate committee. In addition to Bolsonaro, the report recommends charges for current and former members of his administration, dozens of allies, the president's three sons who are politicians and two companies. The document has to be approved by the committee before going to the office of the prosecutor-general, who has the authority to carry the investigation forward and eventually pursue charges. In Brazil, members of congressional committees can investigate, but don't have the power to indict. Pierpaolo Bottini, a lawyer with the Brazilian Bar Association who has advised the committee members, told The Associated Press that other avenues for bringing charges are available to the Senate if the prosecutor-general doesn't ask the Supreme Court for authorization to investigate the president. But those would run through the speaker of Congress' Lower House, another Bolsonaro ally. Regardless of whether the report leads to charges, it is expected to fuel criticism of the divisive president, whose approval ratings have slumped ahead of his 2022 reelection campaign. The investigation itself has provided a drumbeat of damaging allegations for months. During six months of investigation, senators obtained thousands of documents and heard testimony from over 60 people. Scandals came to light, such as Bolsonaro allegedly turning a blind eye to possible corruption in a deal to purchase coronavirus vaccines. Prevent Senior, a Sao Paulo-based hospital chain, also faced accusations that it forced doctors to toe the line on prescribing unproven drugs touted by Bolsonaro. The company, whose executive director the Senate report recommends charging with four crimes, has denied wrongdoing. By adopting and insisting on so-called early treatment drugs like the anti-malarial medication hydroxychloroquine as "practically the only government policy to fight the pandemic,'' the report says, "Jair Bolsonaro strongly collaborated for Covid-19's spread in Brazilian territory and, as such, showed himself to be the main person responsible for the errors committed by the federal government during the pandemic.'' Bolsonaro continues to argue that the hydroxychloroquine is effective in treating Covid-19, though broad, major studies have found it to be ineffective and potentially dangerous. On Wednesday, referring to criticism around his push for chloroquine, he portrayed his advocacy as a historical event. "Back then, no one knew how to treat this disease and I had the courage, after listening to many people, especially doctors, to put forward a possible solution.'' More recently, the senators heard heart-rending tales from family members of Covid-19 victims. On Monday, Giovanna Gomes Mendes da Silva, 19, spoke tearfully of her parents deaths and assuming custody of her 10-year-old sister. Her testimony so affected the sign language interpreter for the Senate's broadcast channel that he struggled to contain his emotion and had to be replaced halfway through. "We lost the people we loved the most,'' da Silva told senators. "And I saw that I needed my sister, and that she needed me. I leaned on her, just like she leaned on me.'' An earlier draft of the Senate report had recommended the president be indicted for homicide and genocide, as well, though the two proposed charges were scrapped in the face of opposition from committee members and concern that bombastic claims could undermine the report's credibility. Still, the report concluded that the government "deliberately exposed the population to a concrete risk of mass infection,'' influenced by a group of unofficial advisers who advocated for pursuing herd immunity long after many experts said that wasn't a viable option.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/senate-report-calls-for-charging-brazil-leader-bolsonaro-over-covid-pandemic/articleshow/87170428.cms||---

The highway that connects Ghaziabad, Noida and Delhi will remain closed till November 10, police officials said. The maintenance work is being carried out by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) at the service road between the Tigri underpass and the Rahul Vihar underpass. “We will carry out the maintenance work of the Ganga jal pipeline at three spots — Tigri, Rahul Vihar and Dasna. We will first complete our work at Tigri and Rahul Vihar within 22 days and then move to Dasna,” said NHAI project director Mudit Garg. As a result, motorists coming from Noida and Greater Noida were not allowed to enter Ghaziabad via the Tigri roundabout. They had to take another route to enter the city. Similarly, vehicles heading for Delhi via Ghaziabad had to take the Vijay Nagar bypass and then the Delhi-Meerut Expressway for their journey. Heavy vehicles approaching the city were, however, diverted via Gaur Chowk. Though commuters faced snarls on stretches like GT Road, near Lal Kuan and Tigri throughout the day, the situation became worse during the evening peak hours. “I generally travel about 7km to Kavi Nagar from Noida Extension. On Wednesday, it took me about two hours to reach my destination and it was a nightmare in the evening when I was returning home,” said Sandeep Kumar, a Gaur City resident. Ramanand Kushwaha, SP (traffic), said that NHAI has already started work at the service road of Tigri and Rahul Vihar underpass “due to which we had to divert the traffic”. “However, all traffic police personnel as well as the police post in-charges were on the roads to manage traffic. At all important junctions, a police team was deployed to help the commuters. Anyone having an emergency can dial 9643322904,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/nh-9-diversions-for-ganga-water-pipeline-maintenance-choke-gzb/articleshow/87170813.cms||---
---||India||Army ‘well-poised to hold the line’ against China in Arunachal||TAWANG: The big guns are ready to boom if required in this high-altitude region. Ahead of the artillery and air defence gun positions, companies of acclimatised and well-armed soldiers guard the forbidding terrain along the frontier, where temperatures have already dipped to minus 3 to 5 degree Celsius. Tawang is one of the most heavily defended regions along the 3,488-km LAC with China, which claims it as ‘South Tibet’ and could well be its next target after eastern Ladakh if things go south along the border. Senior officers say the Army is “well-poised to hold the line” with “a very high density of troops”, a robust surveillance mechanism and high-volume firepower ranging from the old but reliable 105mm field guns and 155mm Bofors to the spanking new M-777 ultra-light howitzers. There is a lot of ‘jugaad’ as well. The first regiment of the upgraded version of L-70 air defence guns of the 1960s vintage, backed by Flycatcher radars, have been deployed in Tawang forward locations. “The legacy L-70 guns have been converted into potent weapons against low-level aerial threats like UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), combat UAVs and attack helicopters,” said Captain Sariya Abbasi of the Army Air Defence at a forward location. The range of the L-70 guns is restricted to just about 3.5-km but they could also be an effective counter against drone swarms in the future with their “predictive” firing. The long-range firepower comes from the Bofors (strike range of 24-30 km) and M-777 (30-35 km) howitzers. (Captain Sariya Abbasi briefs media personnel on the upgraded L-70 air defence guns deployed at forward location along the LAC in Tawang on Wednesday. The guns can take on drone swarms)“The Bofors, which proved their worth in the 1999 Kargil conflict, have very good utility in high-altitude areas. The new M-777s are a big shot in arm because they can be swiftly transported by Chinook helicopters from one valley to another in Arunachal,” said an artillery officer, at a gun position located at an altitude of 13,500 feet in the Tawang sector. As one gets closer to the LAC, the Army has established “integrated defended localities”, with a maze of fortified bunkers for infantry soldiers and artillery observation posts to direct fire on enemy tanks and other mechanised formations from the rear positions. At one such locality on Assam Hill, barely 2.5-km from the frontier, Tawang Brigade commander Brigadier Vijay Jagtap said, “This is where battles take place and access is denied to enemies.” An officer deployed there, Major Rufus Johnson, in turn, said, “Our defences are constructed in such a manner that from wherever the enemy attacks, it will be thwarted. This feature dominates access routes to the Tawang town, which is 35 km away by road. We will not allow anyone to progress ahead from here.” Tawang and Walong, incidentally, bore the brunt of the Chinese attack during the 1962 war in the eastern sector. As the rickety road reaches up to the Bum La at an altitude of 14,980 feet, the border meeting point on the Chinese side is clearly visible, with a well-constructed road leading right up to it. China’s highways and metal roads lead right up to its forward posts. Though India has made a lot of progress in developing border infrastructure, it still has some way to go to catch up. But the confidence is high. “Our aim is not to show aggression, handle situations in a mature manner, and maintain peace and tranquillity. Having said that, we are ensuring that our preparedness, our ability to react to any contingency remains very high,” said Eastern Army Command chief Lt-General Manoj Pande on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-well-poised-to-hold-the-line-against-china-in-arunachal/articleshow/87170716.cms||Rajat Pandit

---||India||Uttarakhand and Kerala may have failed to act on rainfall warnings||NEW DELHI: The Uttarakhand disaster this week and what Kerala had seen over the last weekend may put a question mark over the states' adaptation measures at a time when extreme weather events linked to climate change have almost become a routine. Records of both India Meteorological Department (IMD) and private weather forecast agency Skymet clearly show that the two states had prior impact-based warnings of extremely heavy rainfall. But the absence of disaster reaction mechanisms at local levels, advanced landslide prediction systems and some basic ground work of evacuation from the low-lying vulnerable areas resulted in loss of lives and properties. “Uttarakhand disaster was due to an interaction of easterlies with abundant moisture over Indo-Gangetic plains and a middle latitude westerly system… It was well predicted by IMD,” said Madhavan Rajeevan, former secretary, ministry of earth sciences (MoES). Rajeevan, a climate expert who retired as MoES secretary on July 31, admitted though that there is need to have “highly advanced landslide prediction systems” – a prerequisite for taking any quick measure to face the challenge of climate change. He said, “Both the regions (Uttarakhand and Kerala) are hilly and heavy rains are expected over hilly regions. It led to landslides which caused most deaths in Kerala and Uttarakhand.” Environmentalists, on the other hand, wonder why such ecologically fragile regions are opened for the kind of work which could lead to deforestation and encroachment of natural water bodies and flood plains. “Himalayan as well as Western and Eastern Ghats eco-regions in India must be looked at from a totally different lens than the rest of the country in terms of developmental strategies. Knowledge exists but the right political will is unfortunately absent,” said Manoj Mishra, conservationist and retired Indian Forest Service officer who heads Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan. The IMD had predicted extreme rainfall for Uttarakhand on October 14 with updating its warnings everyday since then. Similarly, the Skymet too had been predicting such weather for the last five days. “These events are seen in advance. We post a 15-day forecast almost every day. I really don’t know what more to do…Enough warning and technology are available for free,” said Jatin Singh, founder and director of Skymet. “How many more disasters would it take in Uttarakhand for decision makers to realise their follies and firstly understand that their developmental model of 'build at any cost' is most inappropriate to the fragile Himalayan environment ?” asked Mishra. He said, “This equally applies to what has been witnessed in Western Ghats and other hilly regions in the country. Secondly, the ill effects of climate change are already manifesting themselves and things on the climate front can only go from bad to worse. There is thus an urgent need to redefine the entire developmental paradigm and accept that small is beautiful, nature is sacred and outlandishly aspirational visions are manifestly counter productive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uttarakhand-and-kerala-may-have-failed-to-act-on-rainfall-warnings/articleshow/87170924.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The Chicago-based carrier had to ground the wide-body jets after a United flight to Honolulu suffered an engine failure and made an emergency landing in February in Denver.  The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered immediate inspections of Boeing 777 planes fitted with Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines after the incident.  On Wednesday, the regulator said it is still evaluating the manufacturers' proposed fixes and will not approve them until it is satisfied that they address its safety concerns.  "Any work performed on the airplanes prior to that time is subject to being affected by any new Airworthiness Directives," the FAA said in a statement.  Greg Hart, United's executive vice president, strategy and planning, said the company has not heard from the FAA, but it expects the aircraft to return to service in the first quarter of next year.  "We have been working tirelessly with Boeing, Pratt & Whitney and the FAA over the past six months," he said.  United is the only US operator of 777s with the PW4000 engine and has 52 such planes.  The anticipated return of the planes is a key element of the company's strategy to ramp up international capacity by 10% next year.  FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in May the agency was going to mandate strengthening a key engine part on Boeing 777-200 planes with the PW4000 engines.  Dickson told a U.S. House committee that the agency is "requiring the manufacturers to address strengthen(ing) the cowling" and will issue an airworthiness directive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/united-airlines-expects-boeing-777s-to-return-to-sky-in-q1-of-2022/articleshow/87171097.cms||---
---||India||Pilot seeks cabinet rejig, Gehlot skips event organised by Sachin loyalist||JAIPUR: Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Wednesday demanded the inclusion of Dalits in the state cabinet as well as in political appointments pending in Rajasthan for a long time. This is the first time Pilot has made this demand in public. Unveiling a statue of Bhimrao Ambedkar in Chaksu near Jaipur, Pilot said that unlike BJP, which worships icons for community-specific votes, Congress always worked for Dalit welfare. Addressing a public gathering, he recalled former cabinet minister late Bhanwar Lal Meghwal, who died of prolonged illness last November. “Bhanwar Lal Meghwal did a lot for the welfare of Dalits. After his death, the seat of a Dalit cabinet minister is vacant in Rajasthan. In such a situation, I hope the state government and the AICC will soon give chance to another Dalit minister in place of Meghwalji,” said Pilot. He added that Dalits and backwards should be considered for political appointments too. Despite an invitation, chief minister Ashok Gehlot and PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra’s absence was conspicuous in the program-me organised by local Congress MLA Ved Prakash Solanki, a Dalit leader and staunch Pilot loyalist. In his speech, Pilot said these leaders were invited but could not attend the event due to different reasons. “I know our party and government are engaged in the development and welfare of Dalits,” he said. Attacking the BJP government at the Centre, Pilot said it had ruined the country’s economy in the last seven years. Unemployment was at a historic peak and inflation had skyrocketed with petrol, diesel and LPG cylinders becoming expensive, he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pilot-seeks-cabinet-rejig-gehlot-skips-event-organised-by-sachin-loyalist/articleshow/87171248.cms||---

Raising serious questions about its “efficacy” to prosecute cases, the top court had decided to appraise its performance while hearing a case in which the agency had filed an appeal after an inordinate delay of 542 days. The court directed its director to file an affidavit on CBI’s efficiency by providing details of its success rate in prosecution and also give a record of pending cases. Jaiswal assured the court that remedial action was being taken to remove “bottlenecks” and improve performance. He said that delay in one case “is not reflective of the functioning of the petitioner as the premier investigating agency of the country”. “The harmonious and synergetic working of executive officers in tandem with law officers of the directorate of prosecution (has resulted in) CBI achieving a conviction rate of about 65-70% over a period of time,” his affidavit said. Read AlsoWithdrawal of general consent has hit work: CBINEW DELHI: Terming the decision of some states to withdraw general consent for CBI probe a major bottleneck hampering its functioning, CBI director Subodh Jaiswal informed the Supreme Court that West Bengal, Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram have withdrawnJaiswal also blamed the judiciary for delays and referred to an appeal filed by the agency in the alleged 2G scam in the Delhi high court. He also pointed out that delay in trial was also caused by stays granted by high courts and the Supreme Court and furnished details of 367 cases in which these courts had stayed proceedings. “For instance, in 2G scam cases, leave to appeal was filed by the CBI within the prescribed timeline in 2018, but the same has not been granted till date. (This adds to the difficulties faced in prosecution of such cases),” he said. The CBI director said the legal department of the agency was at present handling 13,291 appeals pending in sessions courts, HCs and the SC. He also gave details of pending trial cases in different courts across the country — 9,757 pending cases, out of which 500 relate to pending trials for more than 20 years and 921 cases pending for between 15-20 years. Jaiswal also said that he was committed to improving prosecution and a number of steps had been taken to ensure expeditious trials in pending cases, especially those which had been pending for more than 20 years. “It is further submitted that soon after taking charge as director, CBI, one of the main steps, inter alia, taken was to improve the directorate of prosecution by holding a meeting of all officers at the level of assistant public prosecutor and above along with senior executive officers, in October, 2021. It is the endeavour of CBI to bring the present conviction rate to 75% by August, 2022,” he said. The apex court in September had said that it was not enough for the agency just to lodge a case and conduct probe and but was bound to ensure that prosecution was successfully done. It had rejected CBI’s plea that in an adversarial litigation system like India, success rate (in litigation) should not be a factor in determining its efficiency. The bench had said that efficiency of a prosecuting agency was determined on the basis of cases it brought to a logical conclusion and time taken by the agency, and had directed the CBI director to file the data which would be analysed by the court. “World over, assessment is being done on the basis of success rate. If you cannot sustain the prosecution case then what is the need to lodge case and conduct the probe. The success rate is very important and has to be considered,” the court had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/got-convictions-in-65-70-of-cases-in-last-10-years-cbi-in-supreme-court/articleshow/87171341.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Defending its policy in granting reservation in promotion, the Centre filed an affidavit in the apex court saying this is in compliance with the court’s ruling. As directed by the court, the Centre also compiled voluminous data on representation of SCs/STs employees in its various departments and ministries. “It is submitted that annual performance appraisals are evaluated while considering cases of confirmation and promotion. It captures the assessment of work, output, personal attributes and competency of each officer. While considering the cases of promotion, the department promotion committee is required to determine the merit of the officers for promotion with reference to the prescribed benchmark and accordingly grade the officers as fit or unfit... Those who are unfit are not selected,” the government said. “It is submitted that there are around 90 ministries/departments under Union of India under which more that 30 lakh employees are working which include 13 lakh in Railways, 10 lakh in home affairs, 3.5 lakh in defence and 1.68 lakh in post offices. As per the information received from 44 ministries/departments there are around 3,800 cadres under them. Each cadre controlling authority is required to maintain cadre-wise reservation roster,” it said. Earlier, the government had told the SC that in the 19 ministries 18,898 employees are from SCs, 7,608 from STs and 21,656 from OBCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-st-promotion-quotas-wont-hit-administrations-efficiency-govt/articleshow/87171563.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

While everyone flying into the country will still require to undergo a Covid RT-PCR test, the quarantine requirements have been significantly relaxed. The Union health ministry has identified some countries as "at risk". European nations, the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand and Zimbabwe are among them. Passengers from these countries will need to follow additional measures on arrival in India, including post-arrival testing. "Travellers from (all not at risk) countries will be allowed to leave the airport and shall self-monitor their health for 14 days post-arrival," the rules, which come into effect from 12.01am on October 25, say. The health ministry has also prepared a list of countries (called category A) with which India has an agreement for mutual recognition of vaccination certificates for individuals inoculated with nationally/WHO recognised Covid-19 vaccine. These include the UK, France, Germany, Nepal, Belarus, Lebanon, Armenia, Ukraine, Belgium, Hungary and Serbia. For travellers coming from an at risk country with which India has reciprocal arrangements for mutual acceptance of WHO approved Covid-19 vaccines (Category A) like EU nations and UK, the requirement is: "If fully vaccinated (got required jabs at least 15 days before arrival) they shall be allowed to leave the airport and shall self-monitor their health for 14 days post-arrival."  If partially or not vaccinated, travellers need to submit sample for post-arrival Covid-19 test at the point of arrival after which they will be allowed to leave the airport. They must home quarantine for seven days. Re-test on the eighth day of arrival in India and, if negative, further self-monitor their health for next seven days. Those coming from high-risk countries not in category A, rules for unvaccinated arrivals will apply. "If a traveller is coming from a country excluding those covered under category A, they would be required to undergo the measures (for unvaccinated) irrespective of their Covid-19 vaccination status," the rules say. During the pandemic, entry rules across countries keep changing and passengers are required to check applicable rules closer to their date of actual travel. "Based on the risk assessment, this document shall be reviewed from time to time," the health ministry guidelines issued on Wednesday stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/norms-for-arrivals-from-non-risk-nations-eased/articleshow/87171769.cms||---

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued an order to stop any inbound shipments from Supermax Corporation Berhad and three subsidiaries. The CBP said its investigation of the company found 10 indications of forced labour, which typically include such things as intimidation, threats and withholding of wages, under international standards.  The agency identified the subsidiaries as Maxter Glove Manufacturing, Maxwell Glove Manufacturing and Supermax Glove Manufacturing.  "Until the manufacturers can prove their manufacturing processes are free of forced labour, their goods are not welcome here," AnnMarie Highsmith, executive assistant commissioner of the Office of Trade, said while announcing the order.  Malaysian rubber glove makers have come under scrutiny over abusive practices, and the US this year downgraded Malaysia to the worst level in an annual report on human trafficking. In response, Malaysia's government pledged to take steps to eliminate forced labour.  The US lifted a similar order against another Malaysian glove manufacturer, Top Glove Corporation, Berhad, after the company addressed indicators of forced labour at its manufacturing facilities.  Supermax Corporation, which says it sells its products in 165 countries, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-bars-disposable-gloves-from-malaysia-over-forced-labor/articleshow/87171807.cms||---

Union home minister Amit Shah is scheduled to reach the state capital of Dehradun on Wednesday night to take stock of the situation. He will be conducting an aerial survey of Kumaon which is the worst-hit, with 28 casualties reported from Nainital district alone. In Champawat district, 11 deaths have been reported in rain-related incidents in the past three days while Almora district has recorded six deaths. In Udham Singh Nagar district, two people lost their lives while Pithoragarh and Bageshwar have registered a death each. Three people have died in Pauri district as well. Among those whose bodies were found on Wednesday was a postman, Chanar Ram, in Bageshwar who was swept away by the waters of Bhadrapati river. It took four hours for police to recover the body. In another search operation, the body of a hotel worker was recovered in Nainital. Manoj Kumar (34) was on a motorcycle when he was washed away while returning from Nainital to his native village of Chopra on Tuesday. Search and rescue operations continued on Wednesday with the Army distributing food and essentials to those affected by the disaster in Kumaon. Ashok Kumar, director general of police (Uttarakhand), told TOI that 7,500 personnel are engaged in rescue efforts across the state. “In the last three days, rescue personnel have evacuated and rescued approximately 8,000 people,” he said. Three choppers of the Indian Air Force have been deployed for rescue operations. As skies cleared up in some areas of the state, the Char Dham yatra — which was halted on October 18 — was resumed in Kedarnath and Gangotri. The Badrinath highway, however, remained blocked from landslide debris. About 5,000 devotees reached Kedarnath on Wednesday as the pilgrimage picked up after a halt of two days. The yatra in Yamunotri was allowed on Tuesday and 2,500 pilgrims have turned up at the revered shrine since then. While Char Dham towns witnessed an influx of tourists, Nainital saw a mad rush of outgoing tourists who left the town in hordes after being stranded in their hotel rooms for days.

At least 46 railway rakes carrying 2 lakh tonnes of coal to power plants were stuck due to the agitation and blockade of rail tracks, official sources said. They added the quantity of coal that got stuck in transit is enough to produce 322 million units of electricity that equals two days of electricity needs of a state such as Punjab. Officials said this happened at a time when the country needs more coal to produce electricity with the economy picking up and huge fall in coal imports because of nearly 300% hike in its prices in the international market. The rail roko agitation had mostly impacted rail movement in Punjab and Rajasthan. Officials alleged “some middlemen” in the name of farmers squatted on railway tracks, causing hindrance in the movement of coal rakes which impacted supplies to power plants. Sources said this is a huge loss to the farmers especially at a time when they need more electricity for irrigation purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kisan-rail-roko-hit-2-lakh-tonne-of-coal-supplies-to-power-plants/articleshow/87172291.cms||---
---||India||EPFO adds 15L net subscribers in August, rise of 12.6% over July’s||NEW DELHI: The provisional payroll data of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) released on Wednesday showed that the retirement fund body added around 14.81 lakh net subscribers in August, reflecting a growing trend in net payroll for the first five months of this financial year. For the month of August, the net subscriber addition increased by 12.61% as compared to the previous month of July 2021. Of the total 14.81 lakh net subscribers, around 9.19 lakh members have come under the social security ambit of EPFO for the first time, the statement released by the labour ministry said. Around 5.62 lakh net subscribers exited but rejoined EPFO by changing jobs within the establishments covered under the purview of the EPF & MP Act, 1952. The subscribers opted to continue their membership with EPFO by transferring their funds from previous job to the current PF account instead of applying for final withdrawal. Age-wise comparison of payroll data shows that the age group of 22-25 years registered highest number of net enrolments with 4.03 lakh additions during August. This was followed by the 18-21 years group with around 3.25 lakh net enrolments. This indicates that many first-time job seekers are joining organised sector workforce in large numbers and have contributed around 49.18 per cent of total net subscriber additions in August, it stated. As per state-wise comparison of payroll figures, establishments covered in the states of Maharashtra, Haryana, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were in lead by adding approximately 8.95 lakh subscribers, or around 60.45% of the total net payroll addition across all age groups. Gender-wise analysis shows that the share of female enrolment was around 20 per cent of the total net subscriber addition during the month. The net addition of female subscribers has increased by roughly 10.18% during August, as compared to July 2021. This is largely due to lower female member exits during the month, it said. Industry-wise payroll data indicates that the ‘expert services’ category (consisting of manpower agencies, private security agencies, small contractors etc) constituted 39.91% of total subscriber addition during the month. Apart from this, growing trend in net payroll additions has been noted in industries like trading-commercial establishments, engineering products, building and construction, textiles, garment making, hospitals and financing establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/epfo-adds-15l-net-subscribers-in-august-rise-of-12-6-over-julys/articleshow/87172316.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Borivli couple vaccinated in US denied train pass in Mumbai||MUMBAI: An elderly couple from Borivali in Mumbai who were inoculated against Covid-19 in California early this year are unable to get themselves a local train pass as their immunisation status does not reflect on the Co-Win portal. The railways are yet to issue tickets, and the couple have been repeatedly denied a pass as currently there is no provision for the authorities to recognise a vaccine taken outside the country. TimesViewVaccination is a scientific process to create antibodies against a particular disease, which in this case is Covid-19. There are antibody tests as well as administrative checks (examine the US vaccination certificate) to determine if a person is vaccinated as he\she claims. Moreover, Mumbai is an international city, and its authorities should have anticipated that some residents would have got inoculated abroad with vaccine brands that are different from the one available here, while on a visit or when stranded during the lockdown. The BMC should have evolved a mechanism to validate such vaccinations instead of making an elderly couple run around.Angela Fernandes, 65, and her husband Cajetan, 71, were visiting their son in the US in February 2020. The pandemic stalled their return plans and when they finally decided to come back in March 2021 they thought it would be best to vaccinate themselves before starting the journey. “We got both the Moderna vaccine over 28 days with a CDC Vaccination Record card. The process was easy as we just needed to show our passports,” she said. On returning to India, when they first tried to get themselves a railway pass in September they were informed that under the present rules, an individual has to show a certificate indicating full vaccination which is issued through the Co-Win portal. Angela said they needed a railway pass to travel to hospital in Wadala regularly for medical treatment and taking an Uber/Ola was time-consuming as bladder control was becoming an issue. Former Shiv Sena corporator Abhishek Ghosalkar said he tried to help out the couple but could not succeed in getting them a rail pass. “A way has to be worked out of this. With international flights resuming, many who may have taken the vaccine abroad may come back and face such problems,” he said. Chief public relations officer of Western Railway Sumit Thakur said the railways would issue the pass if the municipal corporation approved it or if a universal e-pass was issued on the state portal. Thakur agreed that it was a genuine problem which the couple was facing. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said BMC has been coordinating with the Centre and State government authorities on such cases. “We had requested that either some kind of entry be allowed to be made on the Co-Win app or they be allowed to be certified by the local authority. A positive policy decision may be taken on this soon,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/why-this-fully-vaccinated-elderly-couple-cant-get-train-passes/articleshow/87172444.cms||Richa Pinto

His relatives have accused policemen of torturing him during interrogation. A case of murder has been registered against “unidentified police personnel”. Five cops, including the police chowki in charge and an inspector of the crime branch, were suspended on Wednesday. Earlier , after the theft was first reported, six cops had been suspended for “negligence”. Additional DG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna told TOI that Arun had “confessed” to his involvement in the crime. “He was taken to his house to recover the money and Rs 15 lakh was seized from there,” he said. “But all of a sudden, Arun felt unwell and died on the way to hospital.” Police said a magistrate inquiry is being conducted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dalit-held-for-theft-in-thana-dies-in-custody-five-cops-suspended/articleshow/87172484.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Sibal told Chief Justice N V Ramana that resuming full physical hearing on Wednesdays and Thursdays would entail a lot of difficulty when the pandemic continues to claim lives and suggested that physical presence of advocates must be made optional. “Physical hearing would mean getting briefed in long matters by five to six advocates which could cause a lot of complications and difficulties,” Sibal said. The CJI said the court was forced to resume physical hearing because of repeated requests from the SC bar association and other advocates’ bodies. “On Mondays and Fridays, the court would hear cases through video conferencing and on Tuesdays advocates can exercise the option of either physical or virtual hearing.” Sibal said several HCs have opted for hybrid mode of hearing. The CJI said the decision to resume physical hearing was taken by a five-judge committee. Sibal asked to appear before the panel and explain difficulties. SCBA president Singh opposed Sibal and said “senior advocates can take a break for six months or one year, or till the pandemic ends. But, youngsters at the bar are suffering in the absence of physical hearing .” Mehta told Singh, “This isn’t an election speech.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/top-advocates-spar-in-sc-over-resumption-of-physical-hearing/articleshow/87172517.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Fees earned by big investment banks and boutique advisory firms in India rose to $611 million (over Rs 4,500 crore) in the first nine months of 2021, making it the highest in a decade. Equity issuances raked in $237 million (about Rs 1,770 crore) as IPO fund-raising activity spiked, followed by $196 million (Rs 1,465 crore) fetched by M&A and $177 million (over Rs 1,300 crore) by debt deals. With two months left for the year to be completed, Ibanks anticipate record revenue on the back of bullish deal making momentum. In 2010, advisory fees were about $900 million and, in 2007, it had topped $1 billion. This calendar year till September 24, Bank of America earned the most ($55 million), vaulting three places from number four in 2020 to top the charts, according to data from Dealogic — a global tracker of investment banking business. Rival US banks JP Morgan and Citi retained their second and third positions, grossing $50 million and $35 million in revenues. I-banks receive the bulk of the advisory fees on completion of an M&A or IPO transaction. Significantly, their earning charts are closely tracked as they determine bonus payouts for dealmakers. Switzerland’s Credit Suisse with $33 million revenue climbed one spot to number four in the latest rankings, while local bank Axis rocketed to the fifth position from 13th last year with $32 million. “2021 has been the busiest year for us in the last several years,” said Bank of America MD (investment banking) Asit Bhatia. “The IPO pipeline is the strongest it has ever been. 2021 will end as a record year in terms of equity capital market (ECM) fund-raise,” he said. India Inc raised over $9.5 billion in the first nine months of this year through 72 IPOs. And with more companies intending to list on the stock exchanges in the coming months, 2021 will create anew record for IPO fundraise. Fees from ECM — which include IPOs, follow-on offerings and block deals — surpassed that of M&A for the first time in four years for Ibanks, according to Dealogic. Kotak Mahindra Bank and Avendus, in which private equity fund KKR owns a majority stake, broke into the top 10 list of dealmakers by fees earned in 2021 till September 24. Kotak Mahindra netted $31 million in revenue, while Avendus, riding on transactions like Prosus buying BillDesk for $4.7 billion in what was the largest M&A in India’s fintech space, earned $28 million. Avendus, which is mainly into M&A advisory, is looking to get into capital market advisory to cash in on the IPO deal activity as several tech-enabled companies, including unicorns, make public-listing moves, said one of its top executives. Firms are also looking to add freshers and seasoned investment bankers, said ICICI Securities head (investment banking and institutional equities) Ajay Saraf.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/ipo/i-banks-rake-in-decade-high-611mn-on-ipo-ma-wave/articleshow/87172583.cms||Reeba Zachariah

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Police focus on errant bikers as night curbs return today||KOLKATA: The police are making plans to rein in bikers after they emerged as the biggest violators of traffic rules during the 10-day Puja relaxation. During the festive break from night restrictions, 1,063 bikes were seized, with a quarter of the prosecutions happening after 11pm. Several of the those bikes did not have proper documents leading to seizures under Section 207 of the Motor Vehicles Act. In the past two years, around 100-plus bikes had been seized between Tritiya and Lakshmi Puja. So when nakas are set up from Thursday to enforce night restrictions, emphasis will be on preventing bikers from flouting the norms. “Additional guard rails will be set up in certain areas off EM Bypass, parts of Shakespeare Sarani, Ultadanga, Beliaghata and Garia so that bikers cannot speed past them. Policemen on duty have been asked to check all documents of the riders,” said a senior officer. Senior officers have been asked to seize bikes if riders are unable to produce documents justifying their presence on the roads during the restricted hours. “There will be no leeway for violators. Bikes seized under Section 207 of the MV Act — for not carrying necessary documents — will be released from the police station only after a clearance certificate is issued by the special cell of Kolkata traffic police. This cell will issue the clearance certificate after approval from DC traffic or DC traffic (south),” said DCP (traffic) Arijit Sinha. All bikes seized in the past 10 days under sections other than 207 are being released from Topsia, Karaya, Ultadanga and Narkeldanga police stations, which made the largest seizures, to free space for bikes that will be seized henceforth. Cops said bikers have also flouted basic traffic rules, leading to accidents. “They keep riding in a zig-zag way and have also been using the flyover beyond 10pm, when only cars are allowed,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-focus-on-errant-bikers-as-night-curbs-return-today/articleshow/87169404.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Goa||Stop single-use plastics in offices: Green department to Goa govt||PANAJI: The state environment department on Wednesday has issued an order asking all government offices to curb the use of single-use plastic. Director Dashrath Redkar has said in the directives that the initiative to reduce the use of single-use plastic should start with government offices. The departments have been told to stop using items like plastic folders, artificial flowers to decorate offices, as well as PVC flex boards for advertisements. “The government of Goa, taking into consideration the public and likely effect on the environment in the state, is of the view that strict reduction in use of avoidable plastics is necessary. And this initiative should begin from the various government departments,” Redkar said. Redkar has directed the joint secretary of the general administration department to issue orders to bring such curbs into force in all government departments, autonomous bodies and corporations. Govt offices must segregrate waste at source: Green deptAll government offices should also practice segregation of waste at source, the order states. “All government offices/subordinate offices and all other offices may curb the use of single-use plastic items/disposable items including: All types of plastic carry bags; plastic/thermocol (polystyrene) disposable cutlery including cups/glasses, bowls, forks, spoons, containers, straws, etc, used for serving eatables and drinks,” reads the order. Redkar has said that the use of products such as artificial flowers, banners, flags and pet water bottles should be discouraged and instead departments should opt for the eco-friendly alternatives of these products. “The Union ministry of environment, forests, and climate change has drawn the attention of all states to single-use or short-life PVC flex boards or posters being indiscriminately used in government institutions and offices for short-term advertisement and other purposes and its serious hazard to human health and environment,” the order reads. Such banners or posters contain vinyl chloride, which is a plastic polymer. When burnt, the material releases toxic fumes such as dioxins and furans, among others, Redkar said. Use of such non-biodegradable material increases the risk of the material entering the food chain and harming human and environmental health, he added. Public sector enterprises operating from Goa too should be encouraged to curb use of single-use products, Redkar has stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/green-dept-to-govt-stop-single-use-plastics-in-offices/articleshow/87170744.cms||---

The assembly byelection for Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan is scheduled on October 30. Sources said majority of the RJD MLAs are also expected to skip the event. They said Tejashwi has been given only 3 minutes to speak at the function and thane reason behind his skipping the event. When asked about the reason for skipping the event, Tejashwi said he had informed the assembly Speaker. “You all know that I am alone to campaign in the byelection. There is very little time left and I have to be amid people,” he told reporters. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan also said the schedule to hold a campaign at Kusheshwar Asthan had been prepared long back. “Tejashwi was present at the airport today to receive the President,” Gagan said. Tejashwi had rigorously campaigned for three days in Tarapur before returning to Patna on Tuesday. He was seen spending time in the agricultural field and fishing with the local boys in Tarapur. In fact, his fishing exercise invited comments from JD(U) national president Rajeev Ranjan alias Lallan, who took a jibe at Tejashwi and said it showed lack of confidence before the byeletion. Tejashwi hit back at Lallan and demanded his apology from the entire fishermen community for taking such a jibe.

A survey conducted by DRRAA says that 106 schools in Delhi, which are designated as ration distribution points for providing foodgrains to people without ration cards, were not distributing foodgrains as they had no stock of rations. Volunteers of the Abhiyan checked the status of distribution at 106 out of 282 schools functioning as designated distribution points on October 18 and 19. DRRAA said this was clear non-compliance with directions of the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court. In its letter to the CM, DRRAA said, “On receiving information from people residing in different areas regarding non-availability of ration under the non-PDS scheme, volunteers of DRRAA checked the status of distribution at 106 out of the 282 schools functioning as designated distribution points. During the survey, we found that none of the 106 schools checked was distributing rations as they had no stock of foodgrains. People in need of rations were forced to return empty handed.” DRRAA said non-provision of rations to those without ration cards was exacerbating the distress and hunger among the vulnerable population of Delhi. “The situation on the ground shows that no ration is being provided as the government is not providing adequate stock at the schools designated as distribution centres. We demand that the Delhi government immediately take steps to stock ration at the designated schools and provide ration on a monthly basis to people as per the decision of the cabinet as stated by the government in the affidavit to Delhi High Court,” said the letter. No response was received from the government in this matter till the filing of this report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ngo-writes-to-cm-over-no-ration-to-those-without-cards/articleshow/87170753.cms||---
---||Surat||Surat: 18 floodlights can’t control nuisance outside VNSGU||SURAT: A group of girl students of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University’s (VNSGU) girls hostel staged dharna at Umra police station demanding action against indecent acts by lovebirds and hooligans who have made the service road outside their hostel a place to hang out. The students alleged that despite multiple representations to the hostel and university authorities the problem was still awaiting a solution. Owing to its thick green coverage, the service road outside the VNSGU campus has become a favourite spot for couples who love to hang out there despite presence of street lights. A large portion of the Udhna Magdalla Road near VNSGU and its service road remains poorly lit owing to the thick green cover. To solve the problem, VNSGU installed 18 LED floodlights on its wall to thwart lovebirds and also anti-social elements from lurking at the spot. However, these many lights too proved insufficient to the rampant open display of love on the street, found TOI which visited the spot on Wednesday. As many as 20 such couples were found sitting behind motorcycle or inside cars in areas particularly where light didn’t reach due to trees. “We have installed 18 lights on the walls to light up the road as streetlights does not illuminate the entire stretch due to tree cover. We will now install 20 more lights to improve lighting on the road,” said K N Chavda, vice-chancellor, VNSGU. In the past too, top university officials ordered security personnel and teachers living on the campus to keep an eye on the road to thwart couples which ultimately led to many a fight with university officials as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/18-floodlights-cant-control-nuisance-outside-vnsgu/articleshow/87168842.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Ahmedabad||Industries in Ahmedabad to get treated wastewater||AHMEDABAD: The rapid depletion of groundwater reserves of Ahmedabad has made the state urban development department consider supplying treated recycled wastewater to industries. The AMC has suggested that industries buy treated water from it at the rate of Rs 43 per kilolitre for industrial purposes. The proposal is in line with the guidelines issued by the Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organisation, a technical wing of the Union ministry of urban development. The Surat Municipal Corporation has already implemented the measure at the same price. Currently, close to 4,000 industrial units in GIDC (Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation) clusters in Odhav, Naroda, Narol, and Vatva draw groundwater from their own borewells. They incur a cost of Rs 17 per kilolitre — Rs 8 for pumping and an additional Rs 9 for water treatment. Buying treated water from the AMC will mean a 153% rise in the water input costs for the GIDC-based units. Factories which lie within the AMC limits but outside the GIDC clusters pay Rs 30 per kilolitre, which covers power and treatment costs. These units will see a 43% rise in water costs. The nearby Sanand GIDC industrial cluster, falling outside the AMC limits, pays Rs 40 per kilolitre for treated groundwater. If the units here buy treated water from the AMC, they can expect a 5% rise in water expenses. “An increase of 40% in water costs will definitely impact industries as their cost of production will rise,” said Pathik Patwari, senior vice-president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI). “This is especially true for textile and chemical manufacturing units which require high volumes of water.” Right now the AMC spends Rs 24 to Rs 25 per kilolitre on the treatment of sewage water and an additional Rs 8 on operation, maintenance, and workforce. Moreover, Rs 9 per kilolitre is spent on overheads. “Our draft note mentions that right now GIDC clusters within the AMC limits as well as residential and commercial buildings draw groundwater from within their property compounds,” said a senior AMC official. “They do it as a matter of right as per Section 7(b) of the Easements Act of 1882.” The official added: “This right is in place till the government declares a particular stretch or area as groundwater-exploited ‘dark zone’.” If the whole of Ahmedabad city or a part of it is declared a dark zone, industrial and residential clusters that have access to AMC water supply will have to mandatorily stop drawing groundwater. Sanand Industrial Estate, on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, houses about 350 units. “The state irrigation department supplies Narmada water at Rs 36 per kilolitre to units in Sanand, which increases at the rate of 10% every year,” said Ajit Shah, president, Sanand Industries Association. “This means, with effect from April 1, 2022, industrial units may end up paying nearly Rs 40 per kilolitre for water. Water consumption in Sanand Industrial Estate is around 10 MLD (million litres per day).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-offers-rs43/kl-treated-wastewater-for-industries/articleshow/87169850.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

The value of gold imports stood at $23.95 billion as of September 2021. “The increase in the imports during July, August and September 2021 is due to the lifting of lockdowns, revival of the domestic and export demand and the start of the festive season which has resulted in sharp rise in demand of G&J products and along with the imports of gold,” said Colin Shah, chairman, GJEPC. Impacted by the severe blow post Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, the gold imports decreased by 75% to 121 tonne last year. On a monthly basis, gold imports picked up in August which recorded the second highest gold imports of 118 tonne, after hitting the highest mark of 133 tonne recorded in May, 2020. “Surging gold prices and rise in exchange rate have also led to the average imports of gold in this year to be relatively more than the previous years. However, there is no deviation in the gold imported in July, August and September from the average imports of gold (in quantity) during the same period in the previous three years,” Shah said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gold-imports-back-at-pre-covid-levels-in-h1/articleshow/87169392.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Vijayawada||Naidu hopes to meet Shah, apprise him of attack on TDP offices||Amaravati: TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu has sought the appointment of Union home minister Amit Shah to submit a representation to him on the attacks on TDP offices across the state. Naidu is expected to visit New Delhi on Saturday, and if Shah grants him an audience, it will be their first meeting in nearly four years after Naidu abruptly snapped ties with the BJP before the 2019 general and assembly elections. TDP leaders said Naidu called up Shah on Tuesday and apprised him about the attacks. Naidu had virtually declared war against the BJP leadership in the run-up to the 2019 elections and accused both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Shah of being ‘dictators’. He ran year-long protests against the BJP-led Union government and even went to New Delhi to join the protests against the NDA government. He also organised black balloon protests during public meetings addressed by Modi and Shah. He suspended the permission given to CBI to take up cases in the state. TDP contested the general elections without an alliance and faced heavy defeat, bagging only 23 seats in the assembly and three seats in the Lok Sabha. Subsequently, Naidu admitted that walking out of the NDA was a strategic blunder that led to the party’s defeat. Four of his close aides — Rajya Sabha members Y S Chowdary, C M Ramesh, Garikapati Mohan Rao and T G Venkatesh — switched sides to BJP soon after Naidu lost power in the state. Since then, he had been making attempts to warm up to the BJP leadership. Meanwhile, Naidu will sit on a 36-hour fast in protest against the attacks on TDP offices. He will launch the protest at the party office at 8 am on Thursday and conclude it at 8 pm on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/naidu-hopes-to-meet-shah-apprise-him-of-attack-on-tdp-offices/articleshow/87168772.cms||Samdani MN

A report by RazorpayX Payroll (the business platform of RazorPay), released on Wednesday, showed that the total salary spent between April and September of this year increased by 43% for consumer tech companies with some startups even increasing the median salary of employees by 7%. Employee headcount at surveyed startups increased by 30% in the six month period and 57% of the organisations saw an increase in hiring. Similarly, there’s also a 52% increase in organisations that disbursed bonuses and the amount paid out as bonuses increased by 23% during this year as opposed to pay cuts and deferred bonuses in 2020. In a sign of revival of daily operations, reimbursements (travel and others) doled out to employees increased by 50% in the last six months compared to the previous six months. RazorPay analysed the payroll data of over 25,000 employees across 360 startups in India who are users of the company. HR firms and entrepreneurs TOI spoke to said robust hiring and increased salary spends at digital-native companies are on the back of abundant funding and is helping define new standards of pay for talent, especially at entry level. The positive funding environment has brought in a good recovery post the second wave and the increase in pay scales will sustain, Shashank Kumar, CTO and Co-Founder, Razorpay said. "Businesses across industries are on the road to recovery and these insights reiterate this in many ways," he said. Sanjay Shetty, director of professional search, Randstad India, said there has been almost a 11-20% hike in salary packages at startups with companies budgeting higher for various perks and freebies to attract and retain talent. "At over 23%, attrition at startups is also higher than the levels at traditional companies," he said. Industry trackers also said that given the valuations of companies in the private markets, ESOP packages are often emerging as the deal closer for talent with many senior talent insisting on a larger proportion of stock options in the pay packages compared to the cash component. Majority of the expansion and hectic activity in the job market today is coming from the new-age digital companies, Anshul Lodha, head of Page Executive, India, said. "While 20% used to be an attractive hike for talent to move jobs, startups are offering salary jumps of 50-100% for some key roles today," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/salary-spends-hiring-up-at-digital-new-age-companies/articleshow/87169348.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Moorthy said infrastructure developments like outer ring road with industrial hubs near it would help reduce traffic in the city to a great extent. Madurai’s quality labour force could be utilised through industries established near this road. The drafting of the master plan for Madurai was ordered by chief minister M K Stalin saying it was long overdue, he said.Thrust would be given for sports development to encourage athletes like Revathy who had participated in the recent Olympics, and the granite industry. With 600 acres handed over to Airports Authority of India, steps would be taken to upgrade Madurai airport into an international hub. Palanivel Thiagarajan said other nations drew up master plans for a 50-year period and reviewed it every five years. Madurai district had seen many futuristic schemes like Mattuthavani bus stand and inner ring road being implemented from 1996 to 2001.As development of tourism was an important aspect of the city, he said allowing tourists to take photographs inside Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple, which had been banned after a fire ravaged the mandapam inside the temple in 2018, would be reviewed. The matter had been taken up with the CM and steps would be taken to file a review petition on the ban in court so as to allow tourists to take photographs from 1 pm to 4 pm when the temple is closed, he said. An alternative arrangement for parking vehicles around the temple, and restricting vehicle parking in some places would also be reviewed with the welfare of the public in mind, he said.Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Dr N Jegatheesan said land classification in Madurai which is followed till date is according to the master plan of 1995. This has caused a lot of problems. He urged the ministers to ensure that the master plan is implemented keeping in mind the economic development of the trade, industry and agricultural sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stakeholders-discuss-madurai-master-plan-after-25-yrs/articleshow/87170740.cms||---

Reeta Singh, senior scientist and head of the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Katihar, said, “The district has been experiencing heavy rainfall for the past more than 36 hours. As per the weather forecast, it will continue till October 22. This weather condition is harmful for paddy either in the maturity or the flowering stages. Heavy rainfall in the district either submerged paddy plants or left the crops in supine position. Therefore, production of seeds for the new paddy varieties like 'Sabour Sampan' and 'Sabour 3' will be badly affected.” Singh said the unseasonal rainfall has affected farmers engaged in production of kharif as well as sowing of rabi crops in a big way. “Heavy rainfall has affected the sowing of rabi crops and damaged kharif crops, which are either in the harvesting or production (processing) stages. Paddy crops fell on the ground while several of them are under water in several blocks of the district. The bad weather condition has also damaged vegetable crops like cauliflower, cabbage, beetroots, coriander leaves, eggplant and several others. Waterlogging affects production of vegetable crops,” she said. Sweety Kumari, a weather scientist at KVK, Katihar, said, “All the 16 blocks in the district are experiencing rainfall. Amdabad block received 115.8mm, Azamnagar 101.8mm, Balrampur 87.2mm, Barari 58.8mm, Barsoi 42.6mm, Dandkhora 50.4mm, Falka 47.6mm, Hasanganj 37.6mm, Kadwa 48.6mm, Katihar 47.8mm, Korha 46mm, Kursela 36.8m, Manihari 50.4mm, Mansahi 38.2mm, Pranpur 144.4mm and Sameli 46.6mm rainfall.” The rainfall even after the departure of the monsoon is because of the formation of low pressure over South Bihar, adjoining Jharkhand as well as eastern Uttar Pradesh. As per the IMD forecast, the possibility of rain is till October 22,” said Kumari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/incessant-rain-to-hit-paddy-production-in-katihar-dist/articleshow/87169459.cms||---

---||Patna||Legislature bldg an architectural grandeur||PATNA: President Ram Nath Kovind will grace the function organized on Thursday to mark the centenary celebration of the state’s main (old) legislature building that holds its own distinctive position, along with the equally distinguishing two other buildings of main secretariat and Patna high court, as they together not only symbolise their separate architectural grandeur, but also reflect the modern state system of Bihar that took shape during the second decade of the last century. The foundation stone for the legislature building was laid by the then viceroy-cum-governor general of the country, Charles Baron Hardinge, on December 1, 1913. He had also laid the foundation for the Raj Bhavan (then called Government House, being the first the seat of LG and then of governor), old secretariat building and also the Patna high court building. The four buildings together, along with the houses meant for the officials and staff, were envisioned to be the landmark sites of the New Capital Area of Patna. The viceroy selected Joseph Fearis Munnings as the architect for the four buildings. Munnings had also designed the architecture of the Government House, Dacca, in 1909. The Raj Bhavan and the Patna high court buildings were constructed in 1916, followed by that of the secretariat building the next year and of the legislature building in 1920. An inscription on the legislature building refers to eventful foundation stone laying function. It reads: “Council chamber, Patna. The foundation stone was laid by his excellency the right honourable Charles Baron Hardinge of Penhurst RC, CCA, CMSI, CCMC, CMIE, CCVO, ISO viceroy and Governor General of India, the first day of December 1913.” Architecturally, like three other buildings, the legislature building stands in the north-south direction. It helps in providing cool effect from westerly and easterly winds, which is enhanced by their sturdy walls and high ceilings. Broadly, the architecture of the legislature building is in the Neo-Renaissance style that originated in Italy. It has incorporated elevated Palladian foundation and plinth, sturdy walls, high ceilings, arches, Tuscan style columns (tall rounded pillars) standing alone or in pairs from classical Greece and Rome. The main porticos are in classical Greek and Roman styles and contain entablatures that stand on sturdy, tall and rounded columns. The architectural style, though on a minor scale, is in sync with the designs envisioned by architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker for the government buildings at New Delhi. Munnings, being associated with them in his early years at London, applied the essence of their style to construct the early government buildings at Patna. The Bihar legislature building has classical Spartan look, as it is devoid of decorations which mark the buildings constructed in the local Hindu or Islamic style buildings. Further, the central section of the state assembly has colonnade of Tuscan columns on the ground floor and also on the two balconies on the first floor. There are decorative designs both on the exterior and interior walls, but they are restrained and not jarring for the eyes. Its roof has projections at whose bottom corners lie the common motif of large two handled jars. There is also the amalaka design picked up from the top of the north Indian temple design. It is mixed up with the inverted lotus petals that are found on the rounded Ashokan pillar at Vaishali or Sarnath. There are other decorative designs of Indic forms – like the jaali in the supporting rectangular pillars of the portico and chhajja on the first floor. Finally, the motif used in the entablature of the portico shows two creeper plants with green leaves in motion (symbolic of life force), reaching onto two maces. Symbolically, the assembly chamber has been symbolically presented as the sanctum sanctorum of the secular institutions of the polity that comprises legislature, executive and judiciary. The exterior walls of the assembly hall have two rectangular motifs embossed and fixed to the wall. They lie on the two sides of the life size portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. As one crosses the main gate to enter the legislature building campus, one finds Amar Jyoti point, with its 24-hour burning of torch under a concrete and cement canopy. It is near the Martyr’s Memorial, where seven students were gunned down in the afternoon of August 11, 1942 when they tried to unfurl the national flag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/legislature-bldg-an-architectural-grandeur/articleshow/87169226.cms||Abhay Singh

In the title clash of the inter-district tournament, held at Rajkot, Baroda got the better of Gandhinagar. The champions won the finals 3-2 via penalty shootout and lifted the Reliance Cup in the state-level tournament that was organized for the first time in league-cum-knockout format. This is the 22nd time that Baroda has won this prestigious tournament wherein districts from entire Gujarat participate. “Out of the 39 editions of this tournament, Baroda has lifted the trophy for the 22nd time this year. It is a proud moment for us as our boys have been performing consistently for years. This time the tournament was tough as the boys played on trot for nine days,” said Hanif Ginwala, president of Baroda District Football Association (BDFA). The association recently felicitated the winning team at a function held in the city. When asked about the reasons behind Baroda’s complete domination in Gujarat’s football tourney, BDFA secretary, Sandip Desai said, “Ours is the oldest football association in the state and we have been producing talented players since the 1960s. Apart from cricket, Vadodara also has a football culture.” The city is home to 18 registered football clubs and it has more than 25 licensed coaches who nurture young players. “While the craze for football has again picked up over the last few years, the city always saw a sizeable audience for football tournaments even decades ago. In fact, clubs used to have dedicated fan following in the past,” Desai, himself a former national footballer, recalled. Ginwala said that the city has about 10 football grounds apart from the ones in schools and colleges. “We provide good infrastructure to the players and also organize football tourneys regularly every year. When the state team is selected for the national tourneys, at least three to four players from Baroda always make the cut,” he told TOI. Desai added that the inter-school soccer tournament organized by the Times of India over the last several years in Ahmedabad and Vadodara has also given a platform to aspiring players and produced many good footballers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/baroda-men-continue-their-dominance/articleshow/87168670.cms||Tushar Tere

A majority of the pedestrian pathways in the city are occupied by vendors and shops. While the main roads were designed with footpaths, encroachments on walkways are forcing citizens to walk along the sides of roads. As a result, road accidents involving pedestrians have become prevalent across the city. Many shops on MG Road and Eluru Road have been using the footpaths for parking their staff’s vehicles. “We are facing difficulty in walking on Eluru Road, on the stretch between Apsara Theatre and Kotha Vantena. Shop owners have occupied the footpath and placed items for sale. They are confronting pedestrians who walk on the footpaths,” said M Barghava, a private firm employee. “It is the right of the pedestrians to use footpaths. But huge bins are placed on footpath, besides transformers, at All India Rail Station at MG Road and Gunadala Centre,” said KL Aadiram, a rights activist. When contacted, the town planning wing of Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) said it has been conducting regular drives to clear encroachments on footpaths. Officials said stringent action will be taken against shops that turn footpaths into parking spaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/locals-walk-thin-line-as-shops-eat-up-space/articleshow/87168927.cms||Venu Lanka

Confirming the steady rise in cases of high fever, headache and drop in platelet counts, civil surgeon (CS) Dr Vibha Kumari said the reports collected from government hospitals by Monday evening confirmed 78 dengue cases so far. The figures will rise since the private hospitals have not sent their reports. She said all important private hospitals of the district have been directed to report to the health department about the status of dengue patients undergoing treatment. “We have also directed all the government hospitals, including primary health centres, to procure dengue kits from the fund of Rogi Kalyan Samiti and send the samples to PMCH for expeditious test,” the CS said. Two patients with dengue are admitted in the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital ( NMCH), said it’s assistant superintendent Dr Satish Kumar. Though five children suffering from dengue were earlier admitted to the paediatric ward, all of them were discharged after recovery. He, however, stated that on an average, 15 to 20 suspected cases of dengue reached the OPD and were referred for dengue test. “Even after confirmation of dengue, majority of the patients preferred to undergo treatment at home following the line of medication suggested by doctors. Only those having serious conditions were admitted to the hospital,” he said. All suspected patients were being advised to maintain cleanliness around their homes and keep away from mosquitoes which carry the dengue germ, he added. Ten dengue patients had been admitted to the medicine department of AIIMS-Patna in a week, said head of department Dr Ravi Kirti. One child diagnosed with dengue has been undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit of paediatrics department of AIIMS-Patna for about a week, said Dr Lokesh Tiwari, head of the department. Though there was no dengue patient admitted at PMCH, its superintendent, Dr I S Thakur, said a 12-bed dengue ward had already been set up weeks ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cs-seeks-report-from-pvt-hosps-as-dengue-cases-cross-90-in-city/articleshow/87169091.cms||VK Tripathi

---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: Nine years later, civil engineer’s disappearance still a mystery||VISAKHAPATNAM: In September 2012, Sadhana Pandey, a civil engineer and daughter of a retired naval officer, went missing from Vizag city. She was 22 at the time. The case remains unsolved, though more than nine years have passed since the registration of her missing case at Dwaraka police station in the city. Sadhana is the daughter of Harischandra Pandey, who was posted at Eastern Naval Command at the time. After completing her B.Tech in civil engineering, she had joined a private construction company in Vizag city. Her father moved to Mumbai post his retirement, but she chose to stay in a private hostel in Seethammadhara to further her career. On September 24, 2012, she informed her office that her father had met with an accident in Mumbai and she needed to leave for Mumbai immediately. She also informed the same to her hostel warden, that she was heading for Mumbai to visit her father. However, she never reached Mumbai nor returned to Vizag. The case continues to remain a mystery. In February 2013, Sadhana’s father approached Vizag city police, following which a missing case was registered at Dwaraka police station. Bola Srinivasa Rao (then sub-inspector of Dwaraka PS), who did the initial investigation, said the last tower location of Sadhana was in Vizag city. “We tried to trace her by analysing her social media accounts, and questioned her friends, colleagues, and the staff of the private hostel, but did not get any lead,” Rao, who is now an inspector with central crime station, told TOI. Sadhana’s father had named one Rambhir Singh Rawat as a suspect in the case. Rawat was an employee of ENC and a resident of Malkapuram. He allegedly made phone calls to Sadhana the day she went missing. Rawat was interroagted, but police could not make any breakthrough in connection with the case. He later sought relief from the court. The case was later investigated by the crime investigation department. “Despite our best efforts, it remains one of those rare case where we failed to make any breakthrough. Unidentified bodies found at various places were cross-checked but none of the bodies matched with the description of the missing woman,” said Krishna Rao, the then inspector of Dwaraka zone police station who was also among the investigating officers. Sadhana’s father, however, has still not lost hope. “I plan to visit Vizag soon and meet the police chief. I will make a fresh appeal to reopen the case. I am still hopeful that she will return,” Pandey told TOI. Police said the case remains among the ‘undetected’ files and they will reopen it if they get any concrete clues.

Under the fresh layer of coal tar and concrete is a heady blend of 12,314 liquor bottles crushed under police vigilance on Wednesday using a road roller which later levelled the newly repaired road. The Ognaj road which connects to the arterial SG Road might as well be an expensive shot as illicit liquor's worth was pegged at Rs 73 lakh. Cops say the potholes-riddled, under-repair road was chosen to avoid excessive public curiosity which generally follows mass-destruction of IMFL in the dry state. “We were on the lookout of a secluded place, away from residential societies, to avoid a public spectacle. We zeroed on this road which was under repair due to damage inflicted by heavy rains. A road roller was already present to spread the coal tar and concrete which was another plus,” said a senior police officer of the city. Away from public glare, the 12,314 liquor bottles were placed on the under-repair road and crushed using the road roller. Another layer of hot concrete-tar mix was levelled on top giving the track an alcoholic middle layer. In the past there have been instances of liquor bottles getting buried under soil only to be picked up by locals later. In another instance, destruction of liquor bottles under Indira Bridge in Bhat had led to alcohol seeping into river water. In a freak incident in 2015, a herd of 40 goats had got 'inebriated' after drinking water from a pond near which liquor bottles were destroyed by Mehsana police in Kheralu. Of the liquor disposed, highest 7,212 bottles worth Rs 49.34 lakh were seized by Sola police followed by Vadaj (3,154 bottles), Vastrapur (1,219), Ghatlodia (526) and Naranpura (203). The destruction of liquor was carried out under the monitoring of DCP Zone-1 Ravindra Patel. Mass destruction of liquor bottles was mandated to clear space in the respective police stations. Last time, liquor bottles were destroyed on a pukka road in Gota when around 21,282 bottles worth Rs 57 lakh on December 24, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/one-for-road-12k-bottles-crushed-on-rocks/articleshow/87169709.cms||Ashish Chauhan

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Cases dip to pre-second wave levels but keep masks on, remind experts||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Covid-19 second wave caused havoc in Andhra Pradesh in April-May, forcing the health system to stretch beyond its breaking point. Gasping for their breath, even the most severe cases had to wait for treatment outside the overwhelmed hospitals. The burial grounds ran out of space as a higher number of bodies were brought for the final rites than usual. The resurgence of the pandemic was exacerbated by the severe shortage of medical oxygen. Logistics proved to be the biggest bottleneck as the daily consumption of oxygen jumped to 650 metric tonnes compared to 200-240 MT during the first wave. Cut to this October, the daily case positivity rate, which is considered the key metric to gauge the spread of the infection in the community, has dropped below the 2% mark. It was over 20% for many days in May. As the active cases nosedived to 5,500-range from the peak of 2.1 lakh in May, nearly 95% of the total beds are vacant at the Covid-19 hospitals. Andhra Pradesh denotified nearly 400 hospitals from the Covid-19 services in the last four months with decreasing daily cases. The state has already achieved 99% recovery rate – back to pre-second wave levels in February. Of the 52,000 beds at Covid Care Centres, hardly 200 are occupied with no patients in the CCCs in nine districts. There are no active cases in nearly 12,833 village/ward secretariats out of a total 15,001 secretariats. There is only one active case in 1,499 secretariats. No secretariat in the state has more than 29 active cases. Despite the steady decline in the case numbers, Andhra Pradesh is bracing for the presumed third wave and preparing 708 hospitals. Dr K Rambabu, the state nodal officer for Covid-19, said that the decreasing daily cases or case positivity rate should not lead to any complacency in terms of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. “Masks and social distancing are still key to stop the spread of the infections, while vaccines would help prevent severe illness. The health department requests the public to follow all the Covid-19 guidelines to ensure no resurgence in case numbers,” said Dr Rambabu. The number of Covid-19 cases may have come down, but one should continue to follow the protocol to defeat the virus and prevent it from mutating into dangerous strains. All Covid guidelines should be adhered to till WHO declares the pandemic as over. Until then, precaution is the best medicine||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cases-dip-to-pre-second-wave-levels-but-keep-masks-on-remind-experts/articleshow/87168845.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Private junior college managements refuse to host inter first year exams||HYDERABAD: Claiming that the intermediate board is acting against the interest of institutes, the Telangana Private Junior Colleges Managements Association (TPJMA) on Wednesday said they would not host their colleges as exam centres for the inter first-year examinees. While there are 1,486 private inter colleges in the state, 1,078 have been identified as exam centres by the board. The managements said that at least 80% of these colleges are running from rented premises and most managements have not paid rent and other bills for at least last eight to nine months. “There is nothing we can do as owners of the building are not willing to give their premises for examinations,” said Satish G, president, TPJMA. “It is the state that has failed to release scholarship amounts. They have to pay Rs 315 crore to us. The pandemic only made our financial woes worse as hardly any student paid fees during this period,” he said. Satish said private college staff are unwilling to take up invigilator duties if their issues are not addressed. The managements questioned the reason behind placing hall tickets on the website and allowing students for examinations without the principal’s signature. “Who will be held responsible if a candidate’s photo, second language, or other details are wrong? What if this leads to impersonation or malpractice during examinations,” questioned S Sravan Kumar, owner of a private intermediate college in the city. Kumar said they are the ones admitting students, completing the syllabus despite hurdles. But, when it comes to hall tickets and marks memos, the board is directly allowing students to download them. The members of TPJMA, who submitted representations to the district intermediate education officers (DIEO) and nodal officers in the state, also pointed out that their staff did not turn up for coordination meeting and at least 60% refused to take examination material.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-junior-college-mgmts-refuse-to-host-inter-first-year-exams/articleshow/87171874.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Several decades later, Komarpant, who is now 52, could no longer see more and more land going fallow in his native village of Devbhag, Canacona. Now, his family of four not only tills their own land, but has begun cultivating fallow land belonging to others in Devbhag, too. After growing paddy over four hectares — or nearly 40,000sqm — of fallow community land with encouragement from the agriculture department, Komarpant is now motivating local youth to lend him a hand and return to farming. “We have a small plot of land in Devbhag, but the major portion of the land we have cultivated belongs to other farmers. Boosting our morale was zonal agriculture officer Kirtiraj Naikgaunkar, who spoke to the other landowners to hand over their fallow land to us for cultivation,” said Komarpant. He, wife Seema and their two sons set out from home early morning to toil in their field. They take turns to ensure that stray cattle do not trample on the crops. At night, they find themselves driving away wild animals, particularly wild boars. Naikgaunkar has assured Komarpant assistance under an agriculture department scheme to install solar fences to keep strays and wild animals at bay. The family has already received subsidies for ploughing, for mechanised farming machinery and for purchase of chemical fertilisers. “I have now spoken to many local youth to bring another 100 hectares of barren land under cultivation for the upcoming rabi season. I have received a positive response,” said Komarpant. As the paddy is nearly ready for harvest, Komarpant is looking forward to raising horticultural crops like ladies’ fingers, cluster beans, brinjals, chillies and watermelons during the rabi season. For the kharif season, he had cultivated Jyoti and Karzat varieties of rice. “This land we are tilling was originally being cultivated by the Gaonkar and Velip communities of Barcem, Gaondongorim, Cabo-de-Rama and Gulem. But they had to give up after landowners began demanding more rent, which they could not afford,” said Komarpant. He admits it is not an easy job being a farmer, as it took his family 90-95 days of sleepless nights protecting the paddy crop from wild animals as it got ready for harvest. “Until the solar fence comes, my sons and I have to stay alert through the night to protect the crop from wild boars,” Komarpant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-canaconas-devbhag-a-family-of-4-brings-40000-sqm-of-fallow-land-under-cultivation/articleshow/87170775.cms||Albert Fernandes

The state public works department (PWD), the nodal agency of the project, expects to start working on launching the steel girders of the bridge from November once it receives the permission from the Railways. PWD officials said work has been going on and the reconstructed bridge’s piers and viaduct have been set up. “The design and drawing of the steel girders have been completed and cleared as work is entering its last phase. This work is expected to start from November and an application has been submitted to the Railways for the permission,” said a senior PWD official. Officials said, at present, fabrication work of the bridge is going on and the bridge should be tentatively ready for opening around the Bengali new year. The authorities held a review meeting before Puja to take stock of work progress and site inspections have been going on at frequent intervals. “It depends on how soon the steel girder launching can start as this is one of the most crucial parts of reconstructing the bridge,” said a PWD official. Once the girders are fixed on the bridge’s viaduct, other minor work, like relaying the road below and painting the bridge’s retaining wall, and other technical work will be left before the bridge can finally be opened for traffic. The reconstructed Tallah bridge, which will connect Shyambazar with BT Road, will be be about 750m long and have a 200m-long deck slab stretching over the railway tracks. An estimated Rs 350 crore has been pegged as the cost to complete the bridge reconstruction project. In 2019, the state had decided to dismantle the previous 625m-long Tallah bridge after a structural assessment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-tallah-bridge-may-be-ready-by-bengali-new-year/articleshow/87169455.cms||Suman Chakraborti

A total of 28 banks, including 12 national and 16 private took part in the mela held at The American College. A total of 1,355 students submitted applications for taking educational loans. “I got an engineering seat at a reputed college through counselling by merit. However, they are asking for Rs 63,000 to be paid first. Instead of borrowing money from someone, getting educational loan is better,” said S Shyamala Devi, a student. Jeya Rani, a parent from Usilampatti said that she got to know of the mela through her daughter’s school. “Before this, I had little awareness about educational loan. My daughter is set to study nursing and I’m hoping the loan will help lessen the financial burden,” she said. G Rajee, another parent, said that she is hoping to get an educational loan to aid her daughter as she pursues engineering. Parents and students said that the mela was helpful in simplifying the process for availing loan and also useful for any guidance on getting educational loans. The mela was inaugurated by finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan, minister for commercial taxes and registration P Moorthy and Madurai MP Su Venkatesan in the presence of Madurai district collector S Aneesh Sekhar and corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan. Venkatesan said that banks must come forward to support students’ dreams. “ Banks have promised to co-operate and ensure that no application from students for educational loan is rejected arbitrarily,” he added.  Students can contact helpline number 93630 05523 for queries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/171-sanctioned-rs-11-81-crore-at-edu-loan-mela/articleshow/87170785.cms||---

Many are even questioning the need to conduct the exams for those students who were promoted last year. “Here in Telangana, Inter first-year exams are being conducted for second-year students’ l don’t know why the government is doing this. We are in the 12th class now, they told us that we are promoted and now they are keeping exams. We should prepare for competitive exams also (sic),” tweeted Aiswarya. Another Twitter user wrote: “Mam, please cancel inter exams in Telangana because we can’t manage both the years and also we have so many competitive exams in January (sic).” The Telangana Parents Association (TPA) too questioned the state’s move and demanded to know why it is hell-bent on conducting the examinations when majority of the students aren’t willing to appear for it. “About 95% are unwilling to appear for exams. Why is the board conducting exams for already promoted students? The intermediate board should immediately cancel these examinations,” said Nagati Narayana, president, TPA. As per the schedule released by the intermediate board, the first-year exams will begin on October 25.

---||Aurangabad||Poor response to gunthewari regularisation||Aurangabad: Civic activists have urged the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation to reduce charges to regularize properties, claiming that AMC has received proposals to regularise barely 10% of the properties. Civic activist Rajendra Datey-Patil on Thursday said different types of charges levied by the government on regularisation of gunthewari properties were a hurdle for many property owners. “We have raised objections to the existing ready reckoner rates being considered by authorities while processing regularisation proposals. Ideally, RR rate prevalent at the time of purchase should be considered. It will bring down the charges considerably,” he said. While development charges of Rs 1,140 per square metre are levied for regularisation of gunthewari property, the applicant also must pay compounding charges and scrutiny charges, among other fees, as a part of the regularisation. In a letter addressed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Datey-Patil has demanded official intervention to bring down these charges. When contacted, local civic officials declined to comment.  AMC received around 890 proposals for regularisation of gunthewari properties, of which 588 have been paid in full. AMC limits have around 118 Gunthewari areas, together house over four lakh people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/poor-response-to-gunthewari-regularisation/articleshow/87193796.cms||---
---||Goa||CAG report cautions govt against spending beyond its means||Panaji: The state government’s borrowings may be within limits, but the use of the borrowed funds has drawn the Comptroller and Auditor General of India’s (CAG) scrutiny and has evoked a word of caution. The CAG, in its report on state finances, has pointed out that a large chunk of Goa’s loans are used to meet day-to-day expenditure and not for longterm projects that will benefit the state. During 2019-20, the government’s revenue income decreased by Rs 141 crore (1.2%) over the previous year, but revenue expenditure increased by 4.9%, which was 87.4% of the government’s total in 2019-20. During the same year, capital expenditure decreased by 23%, which suggests that just 12.5% of the government’s total spending went towards infrastructure works or longterm projects that would benefit citizens. In simple words, though the state government took loans to the tune of Rs 2,700 crore through state development loans and other sources, just Rs 1,660 crore was spent on capital expenditure. Capital expenditure (capex) is primarily expenditure on creation of large infrastructure assets such as roads, buildings, bridges and technology parks that can bring or enhance future revenue for the state, while revenue expenditure refers to committed expenditure of the government such as interest payments, expenditure on salaries, daily wages and pensions. “The expenditure on salaries and wages during 2015-20 increased at an average annual growth rate of 11%. During 2019-20, expenditure on salaries and wages increased by 5% over 2018-19. As a percentage of revenue receipts, expenditure on salary and wages increased from 24.5% in 2018-19 to 26% in 2019-20,” the CAG report states. The report was tabled in the state legislative assembly on Tuesday minutes before the last session of the current term of the House. With an eye on the 2022 polls, CM Pramod Sawant announced a bonanza of 10,000 government jobs with the recruitment process projected to be completed by December 31. For an already bloated government, which has around 55,000 full-time and contract employees, the additional personnel will add further stress on the state’s overall fiscal imbalances. “An upward trend in committed expenditure leaves the government with lesser flexibility for the development sector,” said the CAG report. With the state’s committed expenses towards wages projected to go up, interest payments expected to go up and with revenue sources drying up, the government appears to be staring at an uphill task. The CAG report pointed out that the state’s own tax revenue decreased by Rs 171 crore, non-tax revenue decreased by Rs 137 crore and state’s share of Union taxes decreased by Rs 398 crore in 2019-20. The decline was offset by grants from the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cag-report-cautions-govt-against-spending-beyond-its-means/articleshow/87170798.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Mother smothers one day-old girl to death in Ekbalpore, arrested||KOLKATA: A 21-year-old woman was arrested for allegedly smothering her one-day-old girl at a private nursing home in the Ekbalpore area on Wednesday morning. The accused has been identified as Lovely Singh, a resident of the Docks’ Eastern Boundary Round in the Port division. She was put under arrest in the evening after confessing to the crime. She admitted she used a pillow to suffocate the newborn. Cops suspect that Singh was unhappy to have delivered a girl. “Information was received from a nursing home located on Ekbalpore Lane that a newborn — aged just a day — was found dead inside a dual-bed cabin on the third floor of the building. OC Ekbalpore went to ascertain the fact. It was found that the accused, Singh, wife of Ajay Singh, was admitted on October 18 for delivery at bed number 301 in the cabin under Chandrani Bhattacharya, a doctor. On Tuesday, Singh gave birth to a girl at 6.20am. However, after learning that she had a daughter, the accused was visibly upset and she let it be known to the doctors and nurses,” said DC (Port) Zafar Ajmal Kidwai. Police said the accused’s husband had stayed back in the cabin on Tuesday night. “However, he said he fell asleep after midnight and went out to get some tea early in the morning. He returned to find a caregiver and a nurse in the cabin and was told his baby was dead,” said Kidwai. “The attending caregiver, nurse, RMO, gynaecologist and paediatrician were preliminarily examined. It emerged that the baby had been healthy and was alive till 12.30am on Tuesday night. Between 5.30am to 6am, the caregiver, Anjuman Bibi, entered the cabin and found the newborn dead. She immediately informed the RMO, nurse and other administrators. The doctors found abrasions on the baby’s nose. Singh was repeatedly questioned and she finally confessed to killing the newborn with a pillow after 12.30am. The post-mortem has revealed that death was due to smothering. A complaint against the mother was submitted by the nursing home based on which a specific case of murder was lodged and the woman was put under arrest,” the DC (Port) said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mom-smothers-day-old-girl-to-death-arrested/articleshow/87169479.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

He had attended a party hosted by friends on Tuesday night. Prima facie, cops believe it to be a case of suicide, but no note has been found.Financial trouble and personal setbacks could be possible reasons behind Gupta ending his life, said sources. “He tried his hand at make-up to make it big in Tollwood and had recently shifted to choreography,” said an officer.The victim had been staying at this address for a year. He was close to an upcoming model here and had moved in with her as her guest. Gupta, the model and two friends attended a party and returned to the Regent Estate house around 5.30am. When Gupta did not open the door to his room till 1.30pm, his friends found it locked from inside. They alerted cops, who broke open the door and found him hanging from the ceiling fan. The lights were switched on, suggesting he had killed himself shortly after returning. “The body was taken to KPC Medical College & Hospital and a doctor declared him dead,” said DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/choreographer-found-hanging-in-s-kol-flat/articleshow/87169485.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Man moves HC to access account, locker||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday issued an urgent notice to Axis Bank over an appeal filed by a man, who was denied access to a joint account and locker since 2009, after his estranged wife, amid intense marital disputes, told the bank not to let her husband access the account and locker in her absence. The woman has emigrated to the US and told the courts that she did not intend to return to India. She left the country with her two sons, who she told the court were not fathered by her husband. The family court refused to grant the woman a divorce and, on the contrary, observed that cruelty was inflicted on the husband because of her adulterous life. Later in 2017, the high court granted the man a divorce on the ground that the wife had deserted him since 2009. Their marriage had taken place in Vadodara in 1995, but after a couple of years, disputes cropped up. The wife lodged a criminal complaint against her husband and in-laws, but they were later acquitted. They had a joint account and a locker in the Vejalpur branch of Axis Bank. The locker was also to be operated by both parties. In 2009, the woman wrote to the bank and requested freezing of the joint account and to not allow access to the locker in the absence of either party. After the high court granted the divorce in 2017, it was recorded in the order that the wife had told the court that she had no interest in the man’s property and had settled in the US. Citing the divorce decree, the man approached the bank and requested that they unfreeze the account and give him a duplicate key to the locker. In 2019, the bank rejected the man’s request on the grounds that it had not received consent form the joint holder of the account and locker. The bank also said that the man did not have any order from the court for execution of the divorce decree, in which the conditions were laid down. The man approached the high court and sought directions to the bank to unfreeze the account and give him a duplicate key and submitted that he would abide by the conditions imposed by the court. The single-judge bench asked him to approach the concerned civil court for execution of the divorce decree so that he can operate the bank account and locker. The man filed an appeal before the division bench, which has sought the bank’s reply by November 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-moves-hc-to-access-account-locker/articleshow/87169491.cms||---
---||Goa||Tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar’s ‘rich tourists’ quip at odds with Goa’s own policy||PANAJI: Tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar’s statement that Goa needs “rich tourists” is at odds with his own ministry’s tourism policy, that focuses on developing the state to attract all kinds. While the bottom line of the policy is that Goa should strive towards seeking the attention of “quality tourists”, it doesn’t state that the destination should focus on rich and high-end tourists alone. “We don’t want tourists who litter, those who come in vehicles (like buses or tempo travellers), and camp at the roadside. We want rich tourists and those who will respect our culture,” Ajgaonkar told reporters on Tuesday. Sometimes, low-end tourists are found cooking by the roadsideGoa attracts all kinds of tourists, and although industry stakeholders have spoken against budget Indian tourists who drive into the state in tempo travellers or coaches, camp at the roadside, cook, bathe, and leave litter around, they too accept that there are no facilities for this segment, as the state can’t shut its doors on backpackers or non-spending tourists. The state hasn’t kept its promise of setting up shelters for such travellers. In 2012, soon after BJP formed the government, an idea was floated by the tourism department to make cost-effective accommodation available to such tourists. The idea remains on paper. Nilesh Shah, president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), said that the state surely needs well-behaved tourists, but unlike in other destinations, Goa is yet to set up campsites for low-end tourists or have ready directives at entry points for them. “There are no campsites for these tourists, and neither are there any other facilities,” Shah said. Goa receives about 90 lakh domestic and about 8 lakh international tourists every year. The state attracted both budget tourists as well as an upmarket desi crowd — this segment helped sustain starred hotels during the pandemic, when foreign tourists couldn’t travel. “Certainly we want quality tourists, but at the same time, we cannot close our doors to those who are no match for the spending power of high-end tourists, especially since over all these years, we have promoted mass tourism,” a stakeholder said. Hotelier Ralph de Souza asked what was done by the state to target the high-end market over the past several years. “Merely saying we want rich tourists will not suffice,” he said. “You will have to work towards it by marketing and creating an ambience for them. What if rich tourists come with loads of money in their pockets but return without spending any, (as) we are not able to present shopping opportunities for their tastes?” However, he also said that Goa being a small state cannot sustain huge footfalls. It will have to rely on quality rather than quantity. “If we get quality tourists, hotels will get better tariffs and the government will increase its revenue,” he said. Some segments of the hospitality sector, after years of reliance on foreign charter tourists, diverted their attention to the domestic market. Over 2,200 smaller hotels, whose main source of sustenance was charter tourists, are yet to open. “Charter tourists are not big spenders either but they do help sustain some,” the tourism stakeholder said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ajgaonkars-rich-tourists-quip-at-odds-with-states-policy/articleshow/87170804.cms||---

Records compiled from October 8 to October 19 as part of a drive against traffic offences on the expressway reveal that of the 1,567 online memos issued to the erring motorists, 1,013 (65%) are related to “dangerous lane cutting”. “The month-long drive by Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad, Panvel and Pen RTO officers will continue till November 7. As many as 1,567 online memos have been issued to the erring motorists till Tuesday,” a department official told TOI. Three people were killed and six injured in an accident that led to a pile-up of six vehicles near Khopoli exit of the expressway on Monday. Three accidents occurred on the highway and nine suffered minor injuries on Tuesday. State transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne had on Tuesday said “lane-cutting” was now more frequent among those driving light motor vehicles than heavy ones. People frequently taking the eway have a different view. “The department should check the number of l trucks and buses plying on the second and third lanes on the ghat section. Car drivers are forced to make their way through the gaps,” said Haren Choksey, a regular commuter.

Harvard University had extended Gopinath’s leave of absence on an exceptional basis by one year, which allowed her to serve as chief economist at the IMF for three years. “Gita’s contribution to the Fund and our membership has been truly remarkable — quite simply, her impact on the IMF’s work has been tremendous,” Georgieva said. The search for a successor will begin shortly. Gopinath did her BA (Hons) in economics from Delhi’s Lady Shri Ram College and then MA from the Delhi School of Economics and the University of Washington. The IMF MD said Gopinath also worked tirelessly with other IMF departments to connect with policymakers, academics, and other stakeholders on a new analytical approach to help countries respond to international capital flows via the Integrated Policy Framework. She also helped set up a Climate Change team inside the IMF to analyse, among other things, optimal climate mitigation policies. A US national and overseas citizen of India, Gopinath’s research has been published in many top economics journals. Prior to her appointment as IMF chief economist, she was the John Zwaanstra Professor of International Studies and Economics, in the economics department of Harvard. She was a visiting scholar at both the IMF and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, member of the economic advisory panel of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, economic adviser to the chief minister of Kerala, and member of the eminent persons advisory Group on G-20 matters for India’s finance ministry. Before joining the faculty of Harvard University in 2005, she was an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/imfs-gita-gopinath-will-return-to-harvard/articleshow/87172672.cms||---

However, Gandhi was later allowed to visit and was permitted to take four people with her. Police said they stopped her because the district magistrate of Agra had requested not to allow any political personalities to visit because of law and order issues. It added that Section 144 had been imposed in Lucknow and Agra. Gandhi questioned the policeman who stopped her, saying: “Someone has died, how can it be a law and order issue? This is too much, I cannot go out anywhere and should remain confined in Lucknow’s guest house to praise you.” After she was stopped, she tweeted: “Arun Valmiki died in police custody. His family is seeking justice. I want to visit the family. What is the UP government so afraid of? Why am I being stopped? Today is Lord Valmiki Jayanti... Prime Minister Modi has been propagating Buddha’s philosophy but has been attacking the very essence of it”. Earlier in the day, Priyanka had tweeted: “Was it justice to beat a person to death? The death of Arun Valmiki in police custody is a condemnable incident. A high-level probe should be conducted, action should be taken against the cops and compensation should be given to the victim’s family.” Earlier this month, Priyanka was detained by the UP police while travelling to Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the families of farmers who were killed on October 3. However, she was later allowed to meet those families. Congress workers reached the spot and raised anti-government slogans. State Congress Committee president Ajay Lallu, who accompanied Priyanka Gandhi, was pushed back by the police when he tried to confront them. He later tweeted that the Congress party will not tolerate highhandedness and will never step back. Samajwadi party chief Akhilesh Yadav also tweeted, saying: “How can crime be stopped, if the police itself commits crime under the BJP regime?” He added that Rs 25 lakh was stolen in a conspiracy and the sanitation worker was killed in police custody to hide the truth. Strict action should be taken against the “murderer” cops, he said. Dalit leader and Bahujan Samajwadi Party chief Mayawati also tweeted, saying that the sanitation worker’s death in police custody is shameful. The party demanded strict action against the culprits and asked for the state government’s help to aid the victim’s family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/priyanka-gandhi-detained-by-cops-earlier-allowed-to-meet-kin-of-man-who-died-in-custody/articleshow/87168033.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Pune||Dead fish spotted in canal; irrigation dept steps up vigil||Pune: The state irrigation department on Wednesday intensified vigil along the Mutha canal after dead fish were spotted at the Swargate-Dias plot stretch. Irrigation officials have said that they have not found release of any chemical-mixed water in the canal during preliminary checks, but a team has been deployed to conduct inspections and boost vigil on the 20-km stretch. Officials also apprehend that the fish may have died because of a break in water release or due to the ongoing October heatwave. An irrigation department official said, “We came to know about the dead fish after local residents approached the police. The release of water into the canal has stopped since the last few days, so water level has depleted. Before the release was stopped, the presence of fish may have increased in the monsoon.” Popatrao Shelar, sub-divisional engineer at the irrigation department, said, “Vigil is not possible round the clock due to limited manpower. Moreover, the dumping of garbage into the waterbody has been rampant.” Officials from the irrigation department said that the entire canal stretch was cleaned last year, but there is a need for sustained effort from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to restrict garbage dumping. Officials said they would approach PMC with a proposal to install meshes at designated spots now. “We want PMC to install this mesh at least at the locations that are nearer to residential areas. Most bridges on the canal are covered with mesh to prevent throwing of waste. A similar step needs to be extended to other spots as well,” an irrigation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dead-fish-spotted-in-canal-irrigation-dept-steps-up-vigil/articleshow/87169494.cms||---

Mansa police in Gandhinagar district was not issuing the necessary certificate because the woman’s husband and in-laws objected to her request. After she filed a petition in the high court in August, the cops issued the police verification certificate. For the process of the clearance certificate, the high court impleaded the embassy in Toronto and sought a reply from it. This is because she filed her application with the embassy in Toronto. The case involves one Palak Patel from Mansa, who went to Canada in 2016 on a work visa. She did not return to India since and applied for permanent residence there. When the process was initiated and the immigration authorities sought a clearance certificate from local police, Patel’s husband and in-laws objected to the process and the cops did not issue a certificate. The inaction on the part of the police at the behest of Patel’s in-laws stalled the process. This brought her to the high court, said her advocate Nilay Patel. The high court inquired with the authorities about the police verification certificate not being issued, particularly when there was no offence registered against the woman and the cops immediately issued the certificate. The question of the clearance certificate was put before the passport authority and the court was informed that the passport authority can only function as a postman in this case, as it has no role to play with the person already residing in Canada and applying to the authorities in Toronto. The high court made the embassy a party respondent and posted a further hearing in this case for October 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-in-canada-moves-hc-for-police-clearance/articleshow/87169496.cms||---

Gehlot clearly indicated to officials that since possibility of the third wave of Covid-19 is still there, no seasonal disease should be allowed to turn into an epidemic or take shape of an outbreak. A massive campaign against dengue was kicked off on Wednesday as hundreds of teams across the state have started 15-day door-to-door campaign for preventing spread of dengue. The health teams are checking if any part of the state is witnessing an outbreak of dengue. Also, they are conducting anti-larval activities across the state from urban to rural areas. While reviewing seasonal diseases and covid vaccination through video conferencing on Wednesday, Gehlot said that it should be ensured that no carelessness at any level take place. He said that Covid-19 has emerged as a challenge ahead of the entire world and the possibility of the third wave of covid here is still looming large. In such a situation, no seasonal disease should take shape of an epidemic. He sought help of the people in fight against seasonal diseases. The government is now focusing not only on dengue but it is also alert on seasonal diseases such as malaria, scrub typhus, malaria, chikungunya and swine flu from urban to rural areas.

BJP Telangana stated in the representation that their party was being implicated for halting the scheme in the constituency. A team from BJP state unit, led by former chief Dr K Laxman, met with EC officials. “BJP appreciates the Dalit Bandhu scheme. In a previous complaint, our party asked the EC to ensure that those district officials who act in TRS’ favour are transferred. The TRS government has completed the procedures of the scheme, but has not delivered the money to eligible people intentionally,” they stated. Alleging that officials were abusing their authority in violation of the model code of conduct, they asked the central authority to send central forces immediately. BJP leaders said that their volunteers were being harassed in the constituency, while local police officers were threatening their party activists and preventing them from canvassing for the party. “Police are mute spectators, enabling TRS activists to organise dharnas and roadshows even at 10:00pm. They are indulging in sloganeering against BJP at Kamalapur and Jammikunta, which is completely contrary to the model of conduct. However, police did not take any action, but were guarding TRS activists,” the representation stated. TRS leaders, according to BJP leaders, were electronically sending funds to people which must be prevented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/send-central-forces-to-huzurabad/articleshow/87169584.cms||---
---||Jaipur||‘Ailment may hit multiple organs not just platelets’||JAIPUR: Associating severity of dengue only with fall in platelet count is wrong. In hospitals, dengue patients are in ICUs even though their platelet count has not fallen. Dengue is not only about falling platelet count, it can also cause damage to other parts of the body, even when the platelet count doesn’t go down drastically. SMS Hospital doctors are witnessing serious complication of dengue related to gallbladder, heart, brain and lungs, even when the platelet count does not fall. “Generally, people equate or relate dengue with falling platelet count. But most people are not aware that it may cause more serious complications to other body parts, even when the platelet count does not fall,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. “Thickening of gallbladder wall, myocarditis, encephalitis, ascites, water retention in lungs, reduced heartbeat and falling blood pressure are some of the complications of dengue, which are being reported here,” said Dr Bhandari. He said that if patient’s fever does not subside even after days of medication and he has other symptoms such as nausea and breathlessness, then he should remain under constant medication without any carelessness. The city-based doctors pointed out that decreasing platelet count is not a worry in dengue but if the patient’s condition deteriorates even when the platelets do not fall, then it is a cause of concern. “Dengue may affect platelets in two ways — qualitative and quantitative. If it affects platelets quantitatively, then his platelets fall, which is not a major concern as platelets can be transfused or now, the drug is available which can increase platelet count. If dengue affects platelet qualitatively, then it is a concern as in such cases, dengue affects quality of platelets which causes more complications,” said Dr CL Nawal, senior professor (medicine), SMS Medical College. Doctors pointed out that in case platelet count drops down below 10,000 or patient has haemorrhagic diathesis, then he may require platelet transfusion, otherwise patients recover with proper treatment and medication even after the platelets fall. Even private hospitals are witnessing increasing number of dengue patients with complications. “Almost 200% increase in dengue admissions in last 15-20 days have been reported. We are seeing around 15-20 patients daily in the OPD. We are getting more patients especially kids with neurological complications like encephalitis, seizures and altered sensorium. Also, many patients have severely deranged liver functions and kidney failure,” said Dr Pankaj Anand, senior consultant critical care and ICU at a private hospital in Jaipur. Meanwhile, health department officials are appealing to the people to prevent breeding of mosquitoes by cleaning the water every seven days and prevent stagnation of water in their surroundings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ailment-may-hit-multiple-organs-not-just-platelets/articleshow/87170879.cms||---

His relatives have accused cops of torturing him during interrogation. A case of murder has been registered against “unidentified police personnel”. Five cops, including the police chowki in-charge and an inspector of the crime branch, were suspended on Wednesday. Earlier, after the theft was first reported, six cops had been suspended for “negligence”. Additional director general (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna told TOI that Arun had "confessed" to his involvement in the crime during interrogation. “He was then taken to his house to recover the money and Rs 15 lakh was seized from there,” the ADG claimed. "But all of a sudden, Arun felt unwell and died on the way to the hospital. Legal action is being taken and a murder case under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered against the cops as per NHRC guidelines. Police will conduct an impartial probe." Agitated local residents protested after the news of Arun’s death spread in the area. The ADG said five cops, including an inspector from the crime branch, Anand Shahi, chowki in-charge Yogendra Kumar, and three constables have been suspended because they were part of the interrogation team. “Action will be taken against them if they are found guilty,” he said. “The post mortem was conducted by a panel of doctors and videography of the process was done. A magistrate inquiry is also being conducted,” said senior superintendent of police Muniraj G, adding that an inquiry committee, headed by the superintendent of police (east), has also been set up. Agitated local residents protested after the news of Arun’s death spread in the area. Arun’s mother, 70-year-old Kamla Devi, alleged that her son was beaten up and there were visible injury marks all over his body. She claimed that the police had "planted money" in their house and had later shown it as "recovery". She alleged that he was killed by the police personnel so he could not reveal the name of the cops involved in the theft. “My son was innocent. How could he steal money from the police station in the presence of cops,” she asked, adding that she wants justice for her son. Arun’s wife Sonam also accused police personnel of killing her husband. Arun is survived by his wife and three minor children, including two girls. His elder brother, Sonu Narwal, who lodged a police complaint, alleged that his brother, who had been working at the Jagdishpura police station as a sanitation worker for the past four years, died because of torture inflicted by the police during interrogation. Later, the administration announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the bereaved family and a job as a sanitation worker to a kin. The mortal remains of Arun were taken to his house in Lohamandi and later cremated amid tight police security. Kamal Singh Valmiki, a member of the State Commission for Safai Karamcharis, demanded action against those responsible for the death and said that they will not celebrate Valmiki Jayanti on Wednesday to mourn Arun’s death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/dalit-man-accused-of-theft-dies-in-up-police-custody-5-cops-suspended/articleshow/87168098.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Goa||Goa: After MGP and Congress, Dayanand Narvekar embraces AAP||PANAJI: Seven-time MLA Dayanand Narvekar, 71, who has held several positions including that of deputy chief minister, speaker and minister, joined Aam Admi Party (AAP) on Wednesday. Narvekar praised AAP for being “a well-structured party” and for its work during the pandemic. “If we talk just about the work in education, Kejriwal’s government schools are considered the best in the country even when compared to private schools where students are actually being able to participate and grow in careers and competitive exams. His healthcare model is internationally renowned. The Kejriwal model will work wonders in Goa,” he said, thanking the party for giving him a platform to work and be of service for the next five years. He said Kejriwal’s ‘Jobs for all Goans’ campaign resonates with his own vision of Goa. Surel Tilve, vice-president, AAP-Goa and Ponda assembly in-charge said it was a great privilege to have Narvekar, “who holds years of experience in governance. His experience will be a great asset to AAP”. Also present were Pratima Coutinho, party vice-president, Venzy Viegas, Benaulim in-charge and national executive member AAP and Valmiki Naik, spokesperson, AAP. First elected from Tivim constituency in 1977 on MGP ticket, Narvekar served as Speaker of the assembly from 1985 to 1989 and held various cabinet posts, including finance, law, labour and employment, housing board and urban development. The last assembly election he lost was in 2012 which saw an anti-Congress wave. Narvekar was defeated by a then novice in politics – BJP’s Glenn Ticlo who has since won twice from Aldona. Narvekar then floated a political outfit called ‘Goa Democratic Front’ before contesting the Lok Sabha elections from North Goa in 2014. He could secure only 4,128 votes and since then he was not very active in politics. Some months ago, he had met NCP senior leader Sharad Pawar in Mumbai. Narvekar was the main accused in the infamous 2001 ticketgate scam, in which more tickets were sold than there were seats for the India vs Australia match, and hundreds of genuine ticket-holders were denied entry in Fatorda stadium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-mgp-and-congress-narvekar-embraces-aap/articleshow/87170936.cms||---

Dhara Patel, in her FIR, said that she had cleaned her courtyard where she was supposed to worship Goddess Ambe during the Sharad Poonam festival. Patel said that when she was going to drop her son to school on Wednesday morning, she saw her neighbour Jitendra Vadajia, an advocate, spitting in her courtyard. She asked him not to do so. However, instead of accepting his mistake, he allegedly began abusing Patel. When she objected to this, he allegedly slapped and thrashed her badly. Patel’s husband rushed to her rescue but Vadajia reportedly thrashed him also. He also alleged pushed him against a tree and left him injured, she alleged in the FIR. Vadajia left when other residents of the society gathered around, but not before threatening Patel and her husband with dire consequences, states the FIR. Patel then approached Sector-7 police and filed a complaint against Vadajia for causing hurt and criminal intimidation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/neighbour-spits-in-womans-yard-hits-her/articleshow/87169635.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Parsi Punchayat crisis fixed, trustees agree for fresh polls||MUMBAI: After high drama, including a hunger protest by two of its trustees, the turmoil in the over 300-year-old Bombay Parsi Punchayat (BPP) was resolved on Wednesday evening. The BPP, the apex body representing Parsis and the city’s largest private landlord, has been wrecked due to continuous infighting among its trustees for over a decade. On Wednesday evening, after a series of meetings, all five trustees unanimously agreed to cut short their term and hold fresh elections on March 27, 2022. Solicitor Berjis Desai brokered the peace between the warring factions. “The term of office of the present five trustees will be deemed to have expired on the day upon which the seven new trustees assume office,” said a statement released by the five trustees. The consent terms, which includes reducing the current seven-year term of a trustee to five years, will be filed in the Bombay high court. Two trustees, Noshir Dadrawala and Kersi Randeria, undertook a hunger fast on Monday morning to protest the decision of their three colleagues—Viraf Mehta, Armaity Tirandaz and Xerxes Dastur—to postpone the elections till October 2022 for the two vacant seats. It was only on Wednesday evening that the duo broke their fast. “Yes, broke it with coconut water,” Dadrawala messaged TOI. “After three days, no hunger left, but exhausted with the rounds of discussion.” Another trustee from the rival camp, Viraf Mehta, too claimed he was on an ‘indefinite fast’. “It’s the least I can do for my colleague whether he’s right or wrong,” he said. The high drama at the BPP office at D N Road in south Mumbai led to a lot of mirth within the miniscule community. “Any reference to spring rolls and chicken is purely coincidental,” said one of the many messages forwarded on social media in reply to a fasting trustee who said he’s not a “spring chicken”. Another quipped, “If all the five trustees stand for re-election, that would be the most miserable outcome from all these farcical negotiations.” The rivalry between some of the BPP trustees over the years turned ugly at times with a slew of legal battles, allegations of rowdyism and even fisticuffs. Community newspapers and newsletters controlled by rival factions would hurl abuses and level wild charges against each other every week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-parsi-punchayat-crisis-fixed-trustees-agree-for-fresh-polls/articleshow/87171993.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand rains: Death toll 52, 7000 relief personnel deployed||DEHRADUN/NAINITAL: The death toll in rain-ravaged Uttarakhand touched 52 on Wednesday while at least five people are still missing, the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC) has said. Union home minister Amit Shah is scheduled to reach the state capital of Dehradun on Wednesday night to take stock of the situation. He will be conducting an aerial survey of Kumaon which is the worst-hit, with 28 casualties reported from Nainital district alone. In Champawat district, 11 deaths have been reported in rain-related incidents in the past three days while Almora district has recorded six deaths. In US Nagar district, two people lost their lives while Pithoragarh and Bageshwar have registered a death each. Three people have died in Pauri district as well. Among those whose bodies were found on Wednesday was a postman, Chanar Ram, in Bageshwar who was swept away by the waters of Bhadrapati river. It took four hours for police to recover the body. In another search operation, the body of a hotel worker was recovered in Nainital. Manoj Kumar (34) was on a motorcycle when he was washed away while returning from Nainital to his native village of Chopra on Tuesday. Search and rescue operations continued on Wednesday with the Army distributing food and essentials to those affected by the disaster in Kumaon. Ashok Kumar, director general of police (Uttarakhand), told TOI that 7,500 personnel are engaged in rescue efforts across the state. “In the last three days, rescue personnel have evacuated and rescued approximately 8,000 people,” he said. Three choppers of the Indian Air Force have been deployed for rescue operations. As skies cleared up in some areas of the state, the Char Dham yatra — which was halted on October 18 — was resumed in Kedarnath and Gangotri. The Badrinath highway, however, remained blocked from landslide debris.  About 5,000 devotees reached Kedarnath on Wednesday as the pilgrimage picked up after a halt of two days. The yatra in Yamunotri was allowed on Tuesday and 2,500 pilgrims have turned up at the revered shrine since then. While Char Dham towns witnessed an influx of tourists, Nainital saw a mad rush of outgoing tourists who left the town in hordes after being stranded in their hotel rooms for days. The town had been cut off from the rest of the state as all three routes to it were blocked by landslides. Two roads were cleared of debris and opened for traffic on Wednesday, said sub-divisional magistrate Prateek Jain. Around 100 families from Dhobi Ghat area were also shifted to a government college. “We have airlifted 25 people from Sunderkhal and they are being brought to safer locations. In Lalkuan, nearly 100 families were shifted to local gurdwara and camps have been set up across the district,” said Nainital district magistrate Dheeraj Garbyal. Since Tuesday, 700 tourists stuck at Khairna and Kainchi Dham have been evacuated, officials said. “We are providing meals and medical help to locals who are housed in school buildings. Efforts are on to clear the Khairna-Kaichi Dham stretch in collaboration with the local administration,” said an Army officer engaged in rescue efforts. In Haridwar, Ganga flowing near the danger mark sparked concerns among local residents. Its strong currents also damaged an embankment. The district disaster management office said that the Chanderpuri embankment in Khanpur block was damaged, but water did not enter villages. The administration, however, asked villagers living in low-lying areas to shift to safer places. By evening, the water level in the river had receded, said officials. “Everything is under control and repair work of the embankment is on,” said Haridwar DM Vinay Shankar Pandey.

And therefore the anti-defection law came into being,” Sardinha said. “However, tickets should be given to good candidates, and people should vote for candidates by judging their character.” “People who left Congress to join BJP did so out of greed. People should take them to task,” the Congress MP said at a press conference at the Congress’ South Goa district office in Margao when he was asked to comment on the statement of party observer P Chidambaram that the defection of 10 Congress MLAs to BJP was a sordid chapter and that it won’t be repeated. Sardinha said that the government should not haphazardly label privately-owned lands as private forests. “Increasing green cover is essential, but do so by acquiring private forests adjoining forest land without affecting people who earn their living on the trees grown by them on their lands,” he said. The MP asked agriculture minister Chandrakant Kavlekar to ensure that the payment of subsidies to farmers under various schemes is done in time “as farmers of Goa come from weaker sections of the society”. He asked the government to provide 100% subsidy to farmers for repair and maintenance of the protective bunds in their fields.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cant-stop-defections-elect-candidates-with-character/articleshow/87170947.cms||---

On the other hand, Congress has come out with a new slogan: “just one vote from every house for Congress”. People gave their mandate to TRS in Huzurnagar and Nagarjunasagar bypoll and to BJP in Dubbak by-election, but not much has changed in these constituencies despite the two ruling parties, TRS in the state and BJP at the Centre, promising big-ticket development. “Give an opportunity to Congress this time,” Congress leaders are urging the voters in Huzurabad constituency.

Teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were immediately pressed into service for rescue work, but soon the administration had to call the Army as the NDRF motorboats were unable to carry out rescue operations due to the swift water current. A total of 24 people were rescued and the body of one person was fished out. Till evening, there was no trace of the remaining eight people. NDRF also rescued 29 people marooned in Samarda Badal village without food and shelter for over 12 hours. Earlier in the morning, 26 people stranded in various flooded locations for over 16 hours in neighbouring Pilibhit district were rescued by an Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter. The terai area has been inundated by the swollen Sharda, Ghaghra and Mohana rivers. The floods destroyed paddy crop on thousands of hectares, causing huge losses to farmers. The gushing flood waters also washed away the railway tracks at several locations near Palia town. Many residential areas in the town have been inundated, forcing people to leave their houses and take shelter in higher places. Water entered shops causing heavy losses to shopkeepers. The first incident of boat capsize in Kheri was reported around 11 am from Mirzapur village in Isanagar. The people managed to reach an island and were waiting to be rescued. An IAF helicopter rescued 15 people in three trips. One Sundar Prasad (60), who was with his son, died before he could be rescued. District magistrate (DM) Arvind Kumar Chaurasiya and superintendent of police (SP) Vijay Dhull also supervised the relief and rescue operations. In the evening, another boat carrying 17 people capsized near Kheri-Bahraich border in the Ghaghra. Seventeen residents of inundated Devmania hamlet in Parori gram panchayat were trying to reach a safe place when their boat turned over. Rescue teams managed to save five people while four others were found taking shelter on higher ground. DM Chaurasiya said, “Rescue teams are searching for the eight missing people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/2-boats-capsize-in-swollen-ghaghra-1-dead-8-missing-26-airlifted-by-iaf-chopper-in-pilibhit/articleshow/87168191.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

TMC, which is keen to gain a toe-hold in the 2022 state assembly elections, has demanded that the government must immediately allocate a new area for the vendors to put up stalls. TMC functionaries, Swati Kerkar and Priya Rathod, who led the protest, said that the BJP government demolished the shops and stalls under the garb of building better road infrastructure, but left the vendors without a livelihood. The vendors claim that 76 kiosks were bulldozed overnight without any warning and despite assurances from the government that the stalls would not be demolished. “This government is extremely insensitive despite being aware of the plight of these vendors. The CM should provide rehabilitation for the poor shopkeepers,” said Kerkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/allocate-new-area-for-gmc-kiosks-tmc/articleshow/87170979.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC rules against sacking of talati who has disability||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday rejected the state government’s appeal against the reinstatement of a person with disabilities to the post of talati in Bhavnagar district. He was dismissed from service on the ground that he had obtained a bogus medical certificate to show himself as having more than 40% disability to qualify for the quota for disabled people. The division bench upheld the decision of a single-judge bench, which had in 2019 quashed the termination order. The single judge accepted the contention by the petitioner, Bhadreshkumar Ramana, that his disability had reduced due to his regular physiotherapy sessions. A medical certificate of 2003 showed him as having over 40% disability, whereas the medical examination by a board after 2015 stated that he was 25% disabled. The state government submitted that Ramana has residual polio myelitis-left limb, which cannot be treated with physiotherapy. The government said the contention before the single-judge bench that his condition improved because of physiotherapy was wrong. Ramana was appointed talati in the Talaja block of Bhavnagar in 2010 in the reserved category for people with disabilities. In 2015, the government got an anonymous complaint that Ramana did not have 40% disability. The authorities subjected him to an examination by a medical board, which found him 25% disabled, thus making him ineligible to get reservation. The district collector terminated his services in January 2018. The high court ordered his reinstatement. In holding that the termination order was wrong, the bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Mauna Bhatt observed that the government did not institute any inquiry before taking action against Ramana. The high court said that a government employee cannot be dismissed without an inquiry because it amounts to stigmatization.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-rules-against-sacking-of-talati-who-has-disability/articleshow/87169658.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Delhi-Lucknow highway NH-24 submerged after incessant rainfall in Uttarakhand||BAREILLY: The National Highway-24 connecting Delhi and Lucknow was partly submerged following incessant rains in Uttarakhand over the past few days, resulting in gridlocks with scores of buses and trucks stranded in parts of western Uttar Pradesh for hours on Wednesday. Heavy police force was deployed on the highway near Moradabad which ensured the restoration of traffic movement in the evening. Water from the Kosi and Ramganga rivers, which are in spate, flooded the highway, police said. The water levels of Kosi, about 500m away from the waterlogging stretch, and the Ramganga in Moradabad, also touched their maximum capacity and started overflowing. This caused a few stretches of the NH-24 to go under water. A long queue of vehicles including roadways buses, private tourist buses and goods trucks among others, were stuck in jams, causing a lot of inconvenience to commuters. “We were returning from our workplace in Moradabad when we found that a part of the NH-24 has been completely submerged,” said Mohit Kumar, a truck driver. Shakir Ali, a commuter stuck in a bus, added, “We had been waiting for several hours since morning for water levels to recede.” Local police on duty said the water had started reaching the highway on Tuesday night itself. “The movement of light vehicles was stopped due to severe waterlogging in certain stretches of the highway. Only heavy vehicles were allowed to pass through,” said a police personnel stationed at a checkpost on NH-24. Moradabad district magistrate (DM) Shailendra Kumar Singh meanwhile claimed that the situation was brought completely under control by the evening. Residents of Rampur district, too, had a tough time on Wednesday as they had to wade through waterlogged streets. Roads in the suburban areas and upscale localities, including Gandhi Samadhi and its adjacent places, were most affected. The Rampur district administration has been put on high alert while a NDRF team has been deputed in the district for rescue operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/delhi-lucknow-highway-nh-24-submerged-after-incessant-rainfall-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/87168280.cms||Maria Khan

Three of them — Justices Rajan Gupta, Ananta Manohar Badar and Pavankumar Bhimappa Bajanthri — have been transferred from different high courts while lawyers Sandeep Kumar, Purnendu Singh, Satyavrat Verma and Rajesh Kumar Verma were recommended by the SC collegium for elevation as Patna HC judges. The seven judges would start conducting hearings from Thursday when the high court reopens after the Dussehra vacation. Altogether 16 benches, including the new judges, have been formed for hearing criminal matters and five for civil matters as per Thursday’s cause list. With the new appointments and transfers, the working strength of judges at the Patna HC has increased to 26. Still, 27 posts are lying vacant. The total sanctioned strength of judges in the Patna HC is 53. The Bar Council of India chairman, Manan Kumar Mishra, Bihar State Bar Council chairman Ramakant Sharma, coordination committee chairman Yogesh Chandra Verma, Rajeev Kumar Singh and other selected lawyers attended the ceremony. Advocate General Lalit Kishore was also present during the swearing-in ceremony. Both Mishra and Sharma congratulated the new judges. Sharma later told TOI that they are optimistic of appointments of more judges soon, keeping in view of the vacancies. Verma also congratulated the new judges and said extraordinary measures are required to reduce pendency of cases at HC, as the number has climbed up due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Courts may start functioning even on Saturdays. Bar and bench both need to come prepared for quick hearing and disposal of cases,” he said. He said around one lakh criminal and bail matters are pending in the HC and more benches are required to dispose them. “Five benches for civil matters are not going to meet the requirements for long,” he added. Counsel Abhinav Srivastava hoped the hearing of civil matters would also be given priority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/7-take-oath-as-patna-hc-judges/articleshow/87169713.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Pune||Pune: Airline returns bags with articles ‘missing’||Pune: The Yerawada police are investigating a 45-year-old woman’s complaint of costly gifts, chocolates, perfumes, clothes and other valuables, collectively worth Rs 1.4lakh, missing from her two travel bags, which were initially ‘misplaced’ by a global airline while she was travelling from San Francisco, the US, to Mumbai, between September 29 afternoon and early hours of October 1, and then returned to her. The woman had raised the issue of missing bags with the airline, which managed to trace and return the same to her around 3.30pm on October 3. However, on opening the bags, she found the gifts and other articles missing. The police have invoked a charge of criminal breach of trust in the case. When contacted, the woman told TOI, “I have lodged a complaint with the police, who are investigating the case. I have nothing more to comment on the issue for now.” Sub-inspector Bhagwan Gurav of the Yerawada police station said, “The woman went to the US on August 29 for her daughter’s admission to a degree course in a university.” On September 29, she boarded her return flight to India from San Francisco around 3.30pm. She had to change to another flight of the same airline at Paris for her onward journey to Mumbai and since her two travel bags had more than the prescribed weight, she had to check-in her luggage again. “However, on landing at the Mumbai airport around 00.30am on October 1, she realised that her two bags were missing and took up the matter with the airline authorities. She filled in a form reporting the missing bags and left for home at Yerawada in Pune. Later, on the afternoon of October 3, a representative of the airline delivered the two bags at her residence. On opening the two bags, she realised that many articles were missing,” the sub-inspector said. “Following this, the woman passenger sent an email to the airline, which asked her to report the incident to the police. The airline officials on October 16 asked her to email them a copy of the police complaint and details of the articles and valuables missing from the bags,” Gurav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/airline-returns-bags-with-articles-missing/articleshow/87169694.cms||---

He will directly interact with seven Goans involved in the implementation and who have benefited from the Atmanirbhar Bharat, Swayampurna Goem programme. Screens will be installed at all major public bus stands to watch Modi’s address, chief minister Pramod Sawant said. Sawant said it will be the first time the PM interacts with people from any state over the success in implementation of programmes under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative. The CM said that due to Swayampurna Goem programme, benefits of 86 different state and central schemes could reach a large section of Goans, which has resulted in 40% increase in horticulture produce, 10% increase in dairy produce and six per cent increase in floriculture produce in Goa since the pandemic. “The Prime Minister has earlier virtually interacted with Goans to congratulate them for completing 100% coverage of first dose of the vaccine. Similarly, he has agreed to address Goans over the state’s performance under Atmanirbhar Bharat, Swayampurna Goem,” said Sawant. He said it is Swayampurna Mitras appointed in 191 panchayats and 14 municipalities each who have helped the schemes reach potential beneficiaries. “The Prime Minister will directly interact with seven persons, including one sarpanch, chairperson of one municipality, one Swayampurna Mitra and four beneficiaries under the programme. The PM will take a review of the programme’s implementation in Goa and also congratulate Goans,” said Sawant. The virtual interaction will be screened at all gram panchayat and municipality buildings, the different Ravindra Bhavans, and at the office of the directorate of women and child. “It will be telecast on Doordarshan,” said Sawant. Since the launch of the Swayampurna Goem programme, Rs 20 crore loan has been sanctioned to 15% of dairy farmers in Goa so far, with a benefit of Rs 1.60 lakh per farmer, said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pm-to-address-goans-on-swayampurna-goem-programme-success-says-sawant/articleshow/87171019.cms||---

Congress protesters claimed that the hordes of people visiting the casinos, who have been permitted to operate at 50% capacity, will lead to the third Covid-19 wave in the state. Congress also demanded that the state government halt the ongoing five-day world poker championship being conducted by one of the off-shore casino operators. They said that if the tournament is not stopped, Congress workers would enter the casino vessels and disrupt the tournament. A huge posse of police personnel threw a massive cordon around the casinos to prevent protesters from reaching the reception area of the off-shore casinos on D B Road. Congress claimed that no SOPs are being followed by off-shore casinos. “It appears as if the casinos have given the contract to Goa Police to protect them. Police have hit women. Nobody has any right today to protest in Goa because Goa Police has been asked to beat up everyone,” said Youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar. Mardolkar along with Amarnath Panjikar, Sankalp Amonkar, Janardhan Bhandari, Curtorim MLA Alexio Reginaldo Lourenco, Naushad Chaudhari and many others led the protest. Despite clear evidence that police personnel swung the lathi on the protesters, including women and youth, senior police officers later claimed that no lathicharge took place. “Congress demands that the DGP should tell who ordered the lathicharge? Why were peaceful protesters attacked? Why are police acting like BJP’s personal force? Why were even lady protesters chased and lathicharged,” said state Congress president Girish Chodankar. “We need to condemn the behaviour of this government and of Goa Police. The government has said that the casinos can operate at 50% capacity but there is no check on this, nobody is checking their vaccination status or if they are wearing masks. This will lead to the third wave,” said Congress vice-president Sankalp Amonkar. The mamlatdar said that the rally had blocked the public road and that there was no permission to block the road. However, Congress workers said that the police had blocked the road as part of the protective cordon. “See the crowds that are outside the casinos. Nobody is wearing masks. What is the intention behind inviting people from the whole world to play in the casinos?” said Mardolkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-takes-out-protest-march-against-casino-ops-police-lathicharge-them/articleshow/87171000.cms||---

It is likely to enter the “very poor” category on Thursday. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), a body under Union ministry of earth sciences, said the contribution of farm fires in Delhi’s PM2.5 was 12%. Experts said as stubble burning was on the rise in the neighbouring states, they were likely to impact Delhi’s air as northwesterly winds were favourable for transportation of pollutants to the city. According to Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily report on air quality status of Delhi-NCR, 698 and 55 farm fires were recorded in Punjab and Haryana, respectively, on Tuesday. Stubble burning was more on the same day last year with Punjab and Haryana reporting 698 and 135 fire counts, respectively. From September 21 to October 19 this year, 2,942 farm fires were reported in Punjab and 1,082 in Haryana. CPCB’s report said, “The air quality is likely to deteriorate and reach the very poor category on Thursday. The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from north/northwest direction with a speed of 8-20 kmph. There will be mainly clear sky and mist in the morning. The ventilation index is likely to be 17,500 m2/s.” Anand Vihar, NSIT Dwarka, Bawana, Sonia Vihar and Mundka were identified as pollution hotspots due to high AQI. Of these, Anand Vihar and NSIT Dwarka touched the “very poor” category on Wednesday. SAFAR said, “Delhi’s AQI is in the poor category. Fire count is 746 and its share in PM2.5 is 12%. The stubble burning share is likely to increase in the next two days if there is no rain. The overall AQI is likely to degrade to the higher end of the poor category for the next three days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-reverts-to-type-as-it-slips-into-poor-zone/articleshow/87169732.cms||---

The directive is not mandatory, the government notification said, while asking schools and colleges, including faculty and non-faculty members, to participate in large numbers in this initiative that is being seen as an effort towards promoting a self-reliant India. Born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, M K Gandhi was at the forefront of the freedom struggle movement against colonial British rule. He adopted the non-violence resistance that won him accolades across the world. He promoted the use of khadi, a coarse homespun cotton cloth. Ahead of Gandhi Jayanti, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 81st episode of radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’ that was aired in September urged the nation to buy more khadi products. PM Modi said, “Let us buy khadi products and mark Bapu’s Jayanti with great fervour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/school-college-staffers-urged-to-wear-khadi-on-october-25/articleshow/87169717.cms||---

Turns out, 36.35 lakh eligible vaccine beneficiaries have also overshot the interval between their two doses in the state, officials said, while pleading with people to get immunised immediately. “Since there is a chance of new variants, people should get vaccinated at the earliest and wear masks every time they leave their house. People are avoiding taking the vaccine and in the last 10 days alone, the number of people who have missed their second dose went up from 25 lakh to 36.35 lakh,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, Telangana. “Also, people have stopped wearing mask and currently only about 30 per cent people cover their faces. We urge people to get vaccinated and and also wear mask,” he added. An internal analysis of the state health department showed that out of 100 Covid-19 patients who get admitted in hospitals, 60 did not take the vaccine at all and 30 took only a single dose. “Only 10 per cent of the patients are found to be fully vaccinated. Two doses of the vaccine give very good protection from the virus. Moreover, we should also be thinking of booster doses like many other countries,” said Rao. The state has a stock of 50 lakh vaccines and authorities want to complete 3 crore vaccine doses over the next few weeks. So far, 2.06 crore first dose and 8.1 lakh second dose vaccines have been administered. Officials are also working on a plan to streamline the vaccination process so that the token system is done away with and it could be a walk-in vaccination process to improve the count. Health authorities will also begin the Covid-19 vaccination for children (above 12 years of age) in the next 2-3 weeks, Rao said. “Zydus vaccine is under commission and Bharat Biotech vaccine may get emergency use approval in the next 2-3 weeks. After that, we will start vaccination for children. Parents are requested not to go to private and corporate hospitals for children’s vaccination,” added Srinivas Rao. The health department is also releasing teaser audio-visuals to generate discussion on the importance of wearing a mask.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/65l-yet-to-take-even-one-dose-of-covid-vax-in-t/articleshow/87171991.cms||Amrita Didyala

The accident took place at Muvani early on Wednesday when they were returning from Haridwar. Dev Nath Goswami, station house officer, Thal, told TOI, “Retired Brigadier Vinod Kumar Chand was planning to organise a religious function at his native Bunga village in Pithoragarh. Prior to the function, he had gone to Haridwar with a priest and five others for some arrangements. On their way back, Chand lost control of the vehicle and it fell into a deep gorge.” The officer added that Chand had to take the Seraghat-Pithoragarh route as the Pithoragarh-Tanakpur and the Pithoragarh-Almora roads were closed for vehicular movements following rain-triggered landslides. “The injured — Diwan Chand from Pithoragarh and Dal Bahadur Bisht from Nepal — are undergoing treatment at Pithoragarh district hospital,” said SHO Goswami. Three of the deceased were from Pithoragarh, apart from the two Nepal nationals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/five-dead-two-injured-after-vehicle-falls-into-gorge-in-pithoragarh/articleshow/87168284.cms||Prem Punetha

Tech companies are paying handsome packages to HR professionals so that they can bring in the right talent to meet business requirements. Estimates by GESIA IT Association suggest that most IT companies in the state have doubled their talent acquisition teams over the past year and half. “Tech firms are battling a high rate of attrition. In the current scenario, against some 100 offers rolled out by a given IT company, barely 65% candidates tend to join. At the same time, companies grapple with retaining existing workforce. Due to this, there is more requirement for a larger workforce for recruiters, human resource managers and professionals. In big companies, the team sizes have typically doubled,” said Tejinder Oberoi, chairman, GESIA IT Association. Industry estimates suggest that one HR person is usually employed for every 100 people in the workforce. In fact, the demand for recruiters in tech companies has increased to an extent that companies are rolling out handsome salaries and perks even for HR professionals. “The demand is typically high for HR persons with an experience of four years or above, in mid to large sized companies. At our company, we too have expanded our HR team and may look for more people depending on workforce size. “The requirement is not just to hire new people and manage the existing ones. Rather, in a remote working environment, engaging the workforce is a huge challenge,” said Jaimin Shah, managing director, Dev IT Limited. Industry players said that pay packages as high as Rs 20 lakh per annum in addition to perks and timely incentives and joining bonuses are extended by tech firms to get human resource talent. “Even recruiters and HR personnel get joining bonuses in tech firms in addition to salary and other perks because the pressure on HR teams is tremendous. IT companies need recruiters who have experience in the IT sector and many are also hired from recruitment consultancy firms,” said Umesh Rateja, an HR consultant. Besides in-house teams, services of recruitment agencies are also widely sought for by tech companies. This is an increasing trend seen among mid-sized companies. “Mid-sized IT firms are gradually realising the importance of putting an HR strategy and policy framework in place to be able to structure operations. “With this, companies who cannot afford a larger in-house team are seeking out services of talent hunters as well as HR consultancy firms. Large IT companies in fact have increased their investments into HR teams and HR management,” said Samir Parikh, founder, NamanHR – a Vadodara-based recruitment consultancy firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hr-specialists-talent-hunters-in-demand-in-tech/articleshow/87169753.cms||Niyati Parikh

On Wednesday, the state government deployed a helicopter and a team of the State Disaster Response Force for search and rescue operations, said Devendra Patwal, district disaster management officer of Uttarkashi. The trekkers, most of them in their thirties, had left for the trek from Harsil in Uttarkashi district on October 11. They were supposed to reach Chitkul by October 18, but only six — all of them porters — managed to reach the destination. The authorities in Himachal were informed about the missing climbers and they alerted Uttarakhand. “There was heavy snowfall in Uttarkashi on October 17. It is possible the trekkers got lost in bad weather,” said a district official. Among the trekkers was Anita Rawat (38) from New Delhi. The others from West Bengal were identified as Mithun Dari (31), Tanmay Tiwari (30), Vikas Makal (33), Saurav Ghosh (34), Saviyan Das (28), Richard Mandal (30) and Suken Manjhi (43). Three trekkers — Devendra (37), Upendra (32), Gyan Chand (33) — were residents of Uttarakhand. “Further information on the trekkers is not available at the moment,” said the district disaster management officer. In another part of the district, bodies of three porters who had gone on long range patrolling (LRP) with Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP) near the India-China border in Nelong Valley region were recovered on Wednesday. They were found 2 km from the Neela Pani checkpost of ITBP buried in snow, said Manikant Mishra, superintendent of police (Uttarkashi). The porters were separated from the team after heavy snowfall on October 17. Joint teams of ITBP and Indian Air Force had started rescue operations after the weather cleared up on Tuesday. The deceased were identified as Sanjay Singh, Rajendra Singh and Dinesh Chauhan, all residents of Bhatwari block. The Gangotri National Park authority, meanwhile, has also halted all tourist activities in the park region after the Gangotri-Gaumukh trek was damaged due to landslides following heavy rain. R N Pandey, deputy director of GNP said restoration work is ongoing. “All tourists on Gaumukh trek were safely evacuated and tourist activity has been paused in the region,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/11-trekkers-including-one-from-delhi-7-from-bengal-go-missing-in-uttarkashi/articleshow/87166891.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala

While the CPM has given a call to its cadre to work towards defeating the BJP, the CPI has decided to stay away from the polls alleging that both BJP and TRS are setting a bad trend of spending huge money to buy votes. CPM state secretary Tammineni Veerabhadram told TOI that local leaders and cadre will take a call on supporting a political party which has more prospects of defeating the BJP. “A decision to this effect was taken as part of CPM’s national-level policy to try and defeat the BJP to save the country and democracy,” he said. The party accused the BJP of spreading religious hatred. While the local cadre of the CPM are reportedly leaning towards extending their support to the ruling TRS, CPI state secretary Chada Venkat Reddy said both TRS and BJP have polluted the election atmosphere. “Earlier, only money and liquor used to be distributed during elections. Now, even ganja has been seized by the election authorities in Huzurabad. While the CPI is against the BJP’s communal politics and privatisation policy, we, however, have decided to stay away from the bypoll,” he said. Both the CPM and CPI have a minimal presence in the poll-bound constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cpi-to-stay-away-cpm-firm-on-bjps-defeat/articleshow/87169738.cms||Roushan Ali

In a digital press briefing on Wednesday, Kejriwal said that an order had already been issued for the payment of the compensation to the farmers. “All sub-divisional magistrates and district magistrates have started surveying and inspecting the areas where the crops are reported to have been ruined,” Kejriwal said. The CM added, “I hope that the survey will be completed within the next two weeks so that we can give the compensation within one month or a month and a half after that.” He assured farmers that the compensation will reach their accounts as soon as possible. Kejriwal said he had met a delegation of farmers a few days ago and it apprised him of how the losses they had suffered due to unseasonal rains. “I want to tell all the farmers of Delhi that they need not worry about the situation,” he said, adding that Delhi Government would look after them. The AAP leader claimed to have always stood by the farmers and supported them at all junctures. “Our party has been in power for the past 6-7 years now and whenever there have been instances of farmers suffering for various reasons, we have come forward to help them,” Kejriwal said. He added that ever since AAP assumed power in Delhi, farmers had been provided a compensation of Rs 50,000 per hectare whenever their crops had been ruined. “This is the highest amount of compensation provided by any state government in such cases,” asserted the CM. “Most states pay Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 per hectare. We don’t just make announcements and forget them like hollow political promises. We make sure that farmers receive their dues within two months.” The CM said he wanted to reinforce the farmers’ trust in AAP and Delhi government and reassure them that their “son”, meaning himself, would ever be by their side. "We understand the distress of farmers who sow the crops after investing their hard-earned money and put their blood, sweat and tears into taking care of the crops only to see them ruined before their eyes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-50k-per-hectare-for-crop-damage-by-rain/articleshow/87169779.cms||---

He is also the key campaigner for the party in Uttarakhand besides being the Congress campaign committee in-charge for the Himalayan state. “Punjab is my karmbhoomi and Uttarakhand is my janmbhoomi. I would like to thank the people and party members of Punjab for their support and focus on Uttarakhand for the next few months,” the former CM said. Elaborating further on why he wanted to be relieved of his Punjab charge, Rawat said, ‘I feel that I am not being able to give proper time to both states. The torrential rains in the past few days for instance brought havoc to Uttarakhand but I was unable to go to many places to console people and offer my assistance.” On the issue of ex-Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh announcing a new party, Rawat said, “If he wants to eat crow and help the BJP, he can. However, the move has definitely raised a question mark over his secular credentials.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/need-to-focus-completely-on-ukhand-want-to-be-relieved-of-punjab-duties-harish-rawat/articleshow/87166905.cms||Kautilya Singh

ED has asked banks to freeze 1,815 accounts spread all over the country of various individuals and entities that conducted some unexplained transactions with the six accused firms. These accounts are with 67 different banks. Though the ED probe team has identified three individuals — Deepak Nayyar, Pankaj Yadav and Amit Giri — responsible for floating non-existent firms to justify the huge foreign outward remittances through the nine bank accounts, it could not trace their whereabouts till now. Summons sent to their registered addresses have proved to be futile. Even the addresses given turned out to be bogus. The money they sent to meet the alleged expenses for paying cloud storage rent, was also part of their layered and suspicious transactions that concealed the real purpose.ED’s Hyderabad office has been investigating the irregularities being perpetrated in the name of online gaming through certain digital apps. Its focus has been on the role played by two companies — Linkyun Technology Private Ltd and Dokypay Technology Private Ltd — in shifting Rs 1,100 crore extracted from gullible people from India through online gambling. It tracked the trail of the money through an extensive exercise. It also found out that the accused persons and entities used Paytm gateway to shift the money to China through a circuitous mode. The investigators found that six companies played an instrumental role in this money laundering exercise. Great Trans International, Asia Pacific Cargo, Radiant Spark Technology, Achiever Biz International, Connecting Worldwide and Genex Shipping Private Ltd are the six companies, which were raided by the ED. ED also raided the office of their common chartered accountant firm, HAR and Associates. In the searches, the ED officials found that a huge amount of money was sent to Hong Kong-based accounts from these companies. Their CA certificates were also found out to be procured by paying money. ED could trace nine bank accounts belonging to these six companies and check the inward and outward journey of money in these accounts. It concluded that a large network of entry operator-type accounts was being operated to launder money. “None of the monetary transactions found in these accounts conveys any economic rationale. The money was sent abroad through some select branches of SBI and SBM in Mumbai. The beneficial owners of the nine bank accounts have been using bogus addresses and the business they projected was also found out to be bogus,” an ED official said. The agency has urged the 67 banks to freeze the bank accounts. “We are verifying the real purpose of the transactions carried out. Till then, the banks have been asked to freeze the accounts as there is a danger of draining out all the remaining money by the swindlers,” the ED said in its communication to the banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/six-online-gaming-companies-sent-rs-1100cr-to-china-hk-ed/articleshow/87172004.cms||---

---||Delhi||Under flak, DDA says eco-tourism hub won’t be at odds with nature||NEW DELHI: With its plans to develop Sanjay Van in south Delhi as an eco-tourism destination facing flak from local nature lovers, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) clarified on Wednesday that it had only planned to introduce nature-based eco-tourism at spots that were already open to public, and that, too, with minimal or no intervention in the existing habitats. A part of the South-Central Ridge of Delhi, Sanjay Van is spread over 784 acres and is close to Qutub Minar and Mehrauli on one side and Vasant Kunj on the other. DDA “carved out” this area and maintains it as a city forest, and has floated an expression of interest (EOI) for design, development, operations and maintenance of nature-based tourism under the public-private partnership model. The plan, however, is being opposed by many local residents as they feel that it will disturb the habitat of birds and snakes, and degrade the green lungs of the city. In a statement on Wednesday, DDA said Sanjay Van attracted “tonnes of visitors” for daily leisure activities and its proposal of introducing activities related to nature-based eco-tourism aimed at creating environmental awareness and recreation amid a natural setting in an eco-friendly manner using locally available resources. “The activities proposed like rock climbing, forest leisure cycling, camping, star gazing, guided nature tour have been included keeping in mind nature of application and natural context,” DDA said. The aim is to encourage community participation to sensitise public towards environmental awareness through nature walks, educational tours etc, it added. The authority claimed that the objective was not limited to development and operations of the facility by a private entity for long term, but to also ensure that development, operations, maintenance and usage of the facility was planned and implemented through a sustainable business model. According to the statement, the components of the project can include identifying scenic zones for nature-based tourism and activities like rock climbing, paragliding, zip line, valley crossing, rope course-high and low, and Burma bridge crossing. “The idea is to allow more and more users from different age groups to visit and appreciate this gem in the heart of the city. After a careful site analysis, designated zones for each of the activity will be earmarked in areas already open to public with minimal or no intervention in the existing habitats,” it said. DDA reiterated that its intention was not to create a tourist spot in a natural forest, but to give people an opportunity to feel connected with such natural heritage available in Delhi. “The aim is to release the ever-increasing stress on the psyches of our future generation by allowing them to indulge in nature-based activities,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/under-flak-dda-says-eco-tourism-hub-wont-be-at-odds-with-nature/articleshow/87169797.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad digs in to guzzle groundwater||AHMEDABAD: Each day the AMC supplies 1,369 million litres of drinking water to roughly 72 lakh citizens. But daily, the municipal corporation receives 1,739 million litres of sewage at its sewage treatment plants! The difference indicates that Amdavadis draw 370 million litres of extra water from the ground every day. There is no state-level groundwater regulation in place. So neither the Central Ground Water Board nor the AMC nor indeed the state water resources department has comprehensive data on the number of borewells dug in residential, commercial, and industrial areas in the city. Almost 92% of the 15.55 lakh housing units have access to a groundwater source. “The state government has had a groundwater governance code since 2005. It was provided by the Centre,” said a senior official of the Narmada, water resources and water supply department. The official said: “But the government is yet to implement it as a state law.” More disturbing, according to the data available with the Rajya Sabha, Ahmedabad city was found to have groundwater at 67 metres (220 feet) in the confined aquifer. Ahmedabad had the third deepest groundwater aquifer after Jaipur (84.7 metres) and Dehradun (79.2 metres). To put the figure in perspective, the deepest level in Delhi is 64 metres. In Chandigarh, it is 53.6 metres, and in Lucknow it is 45.8 metres. Other Gujarat cities fared better with the deepest level at 12.3 metres in Vadodara, 5.5 metres in Rajkot, and 4.6 metres in Surat. The data was collected from four wells in Ahmedabad and Vadodara each, and one well in Rajkot and Surat each. A senior AMC official said, “While studying water consumption patterns, most state agencies overlook the 7 lakh floating population that travels to the city from the neighbouring talukas, towns, and cities for work or business.” The official added: “They drink water and use toilets. No one accounts for that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-digs-in-to-guzzle-groundwater/articleshow/87171200.cms||Paul John

Patel was arrested at Mehsana railway station in Gujarat. In August, businessman Bimal Agarwal had registered an FIR against Sumit Singh alias Chintu, Sachin Waze, Param Bir Singh and gangster Chhota Shakeel aide Riyaz Bhatti. Police had arrested Sumit Singh while Waze was already in the NIA custody in connection with planting of gelatines and Mansukh Hiran’s murder case and Param Bir Singh, Vinay Singh alias Bablu and Riyaz Bhatti have been shown as wanted as they never turned up despite notices sent to them to appear before the police. Agarwal, who was a partner at Boho restaurant in Goregaon, had alleged the accused extorted collectively Rs 9 lakh and two high-end mobile phones from him in several tranches for not conducting raids on two bars and restaurants in January 2020 and March 2021. Police said they want to interrogate Patel as he had collected Rs 36 lakh from cricket bookie Mittal Kushal alias Malad and Rs 35 lakh on behalf of Waze. Police said they want to interrogate him to find out how much money he had collected on behalf of Singh and how much commission he had got for it. As Singh became CP and Waze in-charge of the crime intelligence unit, Agrawal decided to help in collections from hotels fearing for his business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hawala-operator-nabbed-in-guj-in-param-bir-waze-case/articleshow/87172030.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Delhi||Delhi: How a rainy October kept winter on the sidelines||NEW DELHI: So far, the minimum temperature in October has mostly remained above normal. IMD’s forecast says the night temperature is likely to remain above normal in the remaining days of the month. Experts said delayed withdrawal of monsoon and rain recorded on Sunday and Monday did not let the night temperature fall. A met official said the temperature was likely to dip from the first week of November. Last year, Delhi saw the coldest October in 58 years after it recorded the lowest mean minimum temperature at 17.2 degrees Celsius. Last October also recorded the coldest night in 26 years when the minimum temperature dropped to 12.5 degree Celsius, three notches below normal. IMD data showed the minimum temperature remained above normal between October 1 and 13 this year. On some days, the temperature was around three degrees above normal. On October 14, Safdarjung weather station recorded night temperature at 19 degrees Celsius (near-normal). A day later, it witnessed the season’s lowest minimum temperature at 18.6 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal. It was the only time of the month when night temperature was below the normal mark. An expert said the temperature dipped on October 14 and 15 due to northwesterly winds as the upper reaches of J&K and Himachal Pradesh received snowfall under the influence of a western disturbance. On October 16, the minimum temperature rose to 20 degrees Celsius (near-normal). The minimum temperature has remained two degrees above normal since October 17. RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD, said, “A delayed withdrawal of monsoon, cloudiness and rain on October 17 and 18 had the capacity to not allow the night temperature to fall. High moisture content and cloud cover lead to warmer nights.” The maximum temperature has also remained on the higher side on most days. However, it drastically dropped to 23.9 degrees Celsius, nine degrees below normal, on October 18 after the city recorded heavy rainfall. IMD has predicted very light rain on October 23 night and light showers on October 24. Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, said, “The minimum temperature is likely to remain slightly above normal or near-normal through the month. However, if a strong western disturbance impacts the hilly regions leading to good snowfall, the cold northwesterly winds may cause a dip in temperature.” Abinash Mohanty, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “October witnessed the impacts of a stronger El Nino, coupled with slow monsoon withdrawal resulting in warmer temperatures. Micro-climate changes triggered by unsustainable landscape planning intensified the El Nino effect, which increased the land temperature in October.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-a-rainy-october-kept-winter-on-the-sidelines/articleshow/87169846.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Seeing his colleague, Mohan Lal Yadav, 59, struggling to save the mammal, Gayoor Khan, a forest department gardener, too, jumped in to help the former and after a short while, they were able to rescue the deer. Watch: A forester risking his life to save a swamp deer stuck in the Ganga barrage near Haiderpur wetland in UP https://t.co/YzOz7VBgP7— TOI Lucknow News (@TOILucknow) 1634804703000Officials say the strong currents might have swept away the deer, which will be released into Hastinapur sanctuary. Speaking to TOI, Muzaffarnagar divisional forest officer, Suraj Kumar said, "When our forester spotted the deer, he climbed down while Gayoor tried to pull the mammal out with a rope. It was risky as the water level of the Ganga is above normal but our staff members, not caring much about their own lives, rescued the deer.” Speaking about the incident, Yadav said, “I couldn't leave the deer to die in the raging Ganga. Initially, it seemed difficult as it was too scared but we somehow managed to rescue the mammal.” Last year, too, a deer was rescued by forest staff led by Yadav. According to forest officials, these swamp deer generally concentrate in Jhilmil region of Uttarakhand but move towards UP wetlands during the monsoon. Sometimes, they are washed away by fast currents of the river. Bijnor’s Balawali region is a corridor between Rajaji National Park and Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. Some deer are spotted at Haiderpur wetland located on the Ganga barrage. The 30-km stretch between Ganga barrage and Balawali, known as Khadar region, is a marshy land suitable for swamp deer, listed as “vulnerable” in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/video-of-forester-risking-life-to-save-deer-draws-accolades/articleshow/87168414.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Dacoits enter house, rob family members and rape two women||AURANGABAD: A gang of seven to ten dacoits assaulted and robbed a family of farm labourers before allegedly raping two women from the house at a place in the rural parts of Aurangabad around Tuesday midnight. The gang targeted at least two more nearby houses thereafter, police said. Police sources said this is the fourth recent dacoity in rural Aurangabad. In one of the earlier incidents, a woman was also allegedly raped by dacoits. However, she refused to lodge a complaint for fear of social stigma, they said. Police suspect the involvement of hardened criminals, who have been released on emergency parole during the Covid pandemic, in the dacoities. In the latest incident, the Bidkin police on Wednesday afternoon registered a case of armed dacoity and gangrape against the suspects. Police said the dacoits barged into the house, assaulted three male members of the family and robbed them of their cash and valuables worth Rs 20,000 and three mobile phones. They tied up the family members while three or four of them raped the two women aged 23 and 30. The dacoits then targeted an elderly couple residing in a nearby farm and robbing them of their valuables. They later stole a two-wheeler from another hamlet. Senior police officers including superintendent of police Nimeet Goyal and range IGP Mallikarjun Prasanna rushed to the spot. Multiple teams from the local crime branch and the Bidkin police station were formed to search for the dacoits. Goyal told TOI, “The incident took place around 11.30pm on Tuesday night. The dacoits first pelted stones at the house where the farm labourers lived before barging in.” Bidkin police station’s assistant inspector Santosh Mane said the rape victims are being treated in hospital. “We have collected some evidence with the help of forensic experts,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/dacoits-enter-house-rob-family-members-rape-two-women/articleshow/87167159.cms||Mohammed Akhef

This will enable direct export and import of courier which had to be routed via Delhi or Mumbai till now and required an addition two days in transit. The 1,120 sqm facility is located next to the existing cargo terminal. It has started operation in phases with dedicated Customs officers handling courier operations. The terminal has dedicated XBIS, CCTVs, ETD, handheld scanner and dedicated staff for fast and reliable processing of over 6,000 tonnes of courier cargo annually and will be managed by a software Express Cargo Clearance System (ECCS) – that enables faceless, contactless and efficient mechanism for customs clearances of courier. “International courier cargo operation was rerouted mostly via Delhi which used to delay the shipment and at the same time hampered business. With the start of this facility, which will cater to the complete eastern and north eastern India, it is going to cut short the transit time from airport to warehouses,” said Kolkata airport deputy general manager (cargo head) Rahul Nandy. “Earlier courier clearance was done only at Mumbai or Delhi which meant we were losing almost a day in the clearance itself. The courier had to be offloaded at domestic terminal, then sent to international, where it had to be cleared before being put on an international cargo carrier. At times there are queries and that meant someone had to fly from Kolkata to Delhi,” said Jetex Ocean Air Pvt Ltd managing director Jaideep Raha. The facility was inaugurated last week by M Ajit Kumar, chairman Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs (CBIC) in presence of Keku Bomi Gazder, CEO of AAI Cargo Logistics and Allied Services Co Ltd (AAICLAS), airport director C Pattabhi along with customs, CISF and other AAI officials. Kolkata airport currently has a cargo terminal spread over nearly 2.5 lakh sqft. With 13 truck docks and two aircraft parking bays, it is the largest cargo terminal in the east and northeast. “The launch of operations at ICT Kolkata will enable stakeholders to decrease their logistics cost and shorten time taken for provision of services,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-airport-opens-terminal-for-intl-courier-clearance/articleshow/87169855.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

During his sixth annual brainstorming session with a galaxy of chief executives of global energy majors and experts, Modi underlined the policy measures taken by his government during the last seven years in this direction, including steps to expand exploration and production of oil and gas. According to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office, Modi told the CEOs, “India is a land of openness, optimism and opportunities; and brimming with new ideas, perspectives and innovation.” The CEOs who attended the interaction through video-conferencing included Igor Sechin of Rosneft, Amin Nasser of Saudi Aramco, Bernard Looney of BP and Olivier Le Peuch of Schlumberger. Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries and Anil Agarwal of Vedanta were among the domestic participants. Modi told the CEOs the focus in the oil and gas sector has shifted from “revenue” to “production” maximization. He also spoke about the need to enhance storage facilities for crude al reforms in the last seven years, Modi assured that such reforms would continue with the goal to make India self-reliant. The rapidly growing natural gas demand in the country offered huge investment potential for developing gas infrastructure, he said. On their part, the CEOs noted that India is adapting fast to newer forms of clean energy technology and can play a significant role in shaping global energy supply chains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/modi-to-oil-majors-back-india-with-investments/articleshow/87172780.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: 70 sq ft barricade installed for month-old 70 sq inch pit||AHMEDABAD: A 7 x 10 inch ‘cave-in’ on Rajpath Road has been barricaded for over 15 days now by the Ahmedabad municipal corporation (AMC) for repairs. What is visible to the passersby is the king-size (in relative terms) 10 ft x 7 ft or about 70 square feet barricaded to prevent commuters from venturing close to the depression. The condition has remained that way for close to a month now. Initially, the cave-in was a small hole and someone had put a stick in in to warn off people. However, without repairs, the earth near the small cave began sinking raising the possibility of a major cave-in. AMC officials said that repairs could not be undertaken as the ground staff are yet to report the situation in detail. A regular commuter, Hiren Patel, a resident of Bopal, said the cave-in is right at the turning point and many a time one could find rickshaws standing standing there making it difficult to move. Patel said that if you are going towards SG Highway from SP Ring Road late in the day, the barricading is not visible and he had had to apply sudden brakes at the point on several occasions. A shopkeeper in the nearby complex said that the AMC workers laying the barricade had said repairs would be carried out immediately, but nothing much has been done so far. He said that the two-lane road has been reduced to a single lane due to the barricade. Further delay would increase the cost of repairs, and AMC should have repaired the hole in a timely fashion, rather than waiting until it becomes a major issue, said locals. Just ahead of the cave-in, there are two damaged manhole covers where locals have been forced to place wooden planks, as AMC is ignoring repairs. The damaged manhole covers are also near the turning and in the middle of the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/70-sq-ft-barricade-installed-for-month-old-70-sq-inch-pit/articleshow/87171235.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Police said the fraud amount was likely to go up. The couple had floated the chit fund scheme in 2018 exclusively for women, promising attractive returns. The fraud came to light after an investor, homemaker Ratna Appane, lodged a complaint. The suspects and the investors are from Andhra Pradesh (AP), currently residing in Ghorpadi here. Ratna’s husband, Venkateshwara Rao, told TOI, “The couple held a series of meetings with new investors and lured them to invest for a period of 12-15 months. My wife invested Rs 7 lakh for a year. We were supposed to get back double the amount on maturity in March 2020. But that did not happen. They kept seeking time to repay us and delayed it further after the Covid-19 lockdown was enforced.” According to Rao, after the lockdown was relaxed, the couple allegedly threatened the investors with dire consequences. “The duo refused to entertain us, saying there was no written agreement relating to investing money in the scheme. We realised that we had been tricked after the suspects filed a complaint with the Mundhwa police, accusing us of threatening them and stealing their gold ornaments,” he said. Police even conducted a preliminary inquiry, but found no merit in the complaint. Senior police inspector (SPI) Bramhanand Naikawadi of the Mundhwa police said, “We took serious note of the complaints after they alleged that the suspects invested their hard-earned money in purchasing immoveable properties. We conducted a preliminary inquiry to understand the modus operandi and registered an FIR. after 13 women approached. We have arrested the woman and detained her husband after he was found outside the district and sessions court. The suspects will be questioned to recover the investors’ money and to find out if they have purchased moveable/immoveable properties or invested money in some other business.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/13-women-accuse-couple-of-rs-60-lakh-chit-fund-fraud/articleshow/87169887.cms||Asseem Shaikh

The minister was booked for forgery under IPC section 420 among others, following the court’s order. The court has also summoned the minister to appear before it in person in the next hearing on November 10. The order was issued by ADJ Ram Pratap Singh of the special MP-MLA court on October 16, a copy of which was made available on Wednesday. It stated that the victim has produced original documents of the land in the court and prima facie, it seems the ‘other party’- which is Anil Sharma - has forged the land documents to illegally encroach upon the same. The court ordered the police to book the minister under sections 420, 468 and 471 of the IPC. The case was filed by the director of a Bulandshahr-based private firm. According to the complainant, the minister made fake papers of land worth crores of rupees belonging to him. The complainant also alleged that Sharma ensured that the mapping of the plot is not done by the district administration so that he could continue encroaching upon the plot. He further alleged that he had given over a dozen applications for correction in documents and mapping of the area, but the matter was never taken up by the authorities. The complainant’s lawyer told the court that when he tried to lodge an FIR against those who had forged the land documents, the police initially booked 10 people, but later the complainant was booked under section 420 of the IPC as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-forest-minister-booked-for-forgery-after-bshahr-court-finds-him-guilty-of-land-fraud/articleshow/87168474.cms||Ishita Mishra

However, due to the growing uncertainty back home, students want the Indian government to grant work permits and refugee status once they complete their education. A notification for Afghan students under ICCR’s Afghan Scholarship Scheme states the ICCR scholarship will continue as before for students enrolled under the scholarship scheme for the previous academic year and 2021-22. Afghan students already present in India have been advised to apply for an extension of visas on the online e-FRRO platform. Further, for ICCR scholarship students present in India who are shortly completing or have completed their courses, the ICCR has stated that such students are eligible to apply for admissions to Indian universities/ institutions (those listed in the A2A portal only) for different course/ higher studies. ICCR scholarships, based on the availability of slots, can then be considered upon confirmation of admission by an eligible university/ institute. (This option is also available for hitherto self-financed Afghanistan students). A PhD student representing the Afghan students’ community in Mangaluru, welcoming the ICCR’s decision, told TOI: “Mangalore University authorities have asked outgoing Afghan students to apply for higher studies, including post-doctoral. Nearly 12 students who are likely to complete their course this year, are expected to continue with their higher studies. The conditions back home are also not favourable. It has been nearly two months since the Taliban took control and the uncertainty is only growing. The students whose families are staying in prominent provinces have been able to stay in touch, but those staying in rural provinces are finding it difficult to get in touch with their loved ones. We are not sure when we will be able to go back home. As many as 58 students are studying in the city and of them, nearly three PhD students who had returned with their families for vacations are stranded in Kabul. We are not sure if they will be able to return to complete their course. Further, once we complete our education course, we hope the Indian government will grant those willing to stay back work permits and refugee status,” the student representative said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/afghan-students-hope-for-refugee-status-after-completion-of-studies/articleshow/87168545.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

An alert was sounded in these villages and locals shifted to safer areas on Wednesday. Among the villages at risk were Daibalgarh, Gauspur, Kauharpur, Simali, Fatehpur Sabhachand, Ravali and Brahampuri where crops had been completely destroyed. In Ravali and Brahampuri villages, water from Malan and Ganga had entered schools. Speaking to TOI, junior engineer of Ganga Barrage, Piyush Baliyan, said, "Ganga is flowing close to the danger mark with over 3 lakh cusec discharge. But, it will gradually recede if there are no further rains." Meanwhile, seven west UP districts - Bijnor, Amroha, Moradabad, Rampur, Bareilly, Shahjahanpur and Farrukhabad - from where the Ramganga river passes have been put on high alert. "Around 10,000 cusecs of water was released into Ramganga by Kalagarh dam," executive engineer at Ramganga dam, Narendra Kumar said on Wednesday. “It led to flooding of at least 10 interior villages in the Bhootpuri and Haravali areas,” he added.

---||Delhi||Burari deaths: Delhi Police closure report mentions no foul play||NEW DELHI: It was one of the most intriguing police cases in the capital, a proper whodunit that perplexed many for a long time and gave rise to many conspiracy theories and dark tales. Delhi Police’s Crime Branch finally brought a closure to the case involving the deaths of 11 members of the Chundawat family in north Delhi’s Burari by declaring in its closure report that no sign of foul play was detected and the deaths appeared the result of a family suicide pact. The cops had registered a case of murder, but a detailed, three-year investigation concluded that this was a case of a suicide pact. Police submitted the closure report to the court on June 11. The court will take up the matter at the next hearing in November. The bodies of the 11 family members were discovered on the morning of July 1, 2018. While the body of Narayan Devi was found on the floor, the others were all discovered hanging from an iron grille, blindfolded and the hands and feet tied. Besides Devi, the other dead were her sons Bhavnesh and Lalit, daughter Pratibha, Bhavnesh’s wife Savita and their children Nitu, Monu and Dhruv, Lalit’s wife Teena and son Shivam and Pratibha’s daughter Priyanka. Police had recovered a diary from inside the house that appeared to describe the manner in which the family members were to hang themselves. The information matched the circumstances in which the bodies were discovered. In August 2019, a handwriting analysis confirmed that the entries in the diary were made by the occupants of the house. Mobile forensics also established the use of the mobile phones by the different members of the Chundawat family. Several pieces of evidence hinted strongly at the death being the result of a suicide pact. A source said, “The family members put their mobile phones on silent mode and stowed them collectively in the bag in the mandir in the house. The diary entries and the manner of their hanging also suggested they were involved in some sort of a ritual. The handwriting analysis determined that most of the diary entries were made by Priyanka and Lalit. CCTV footage also showed no other person entering the house on the day of the incident besides the occupants.” While the psychological autopsy revealed that the 11 might not have intended to die but expected to return to normal life after a certain ritual, the viscera reports ruled out ingestion of poison. The diary entries indicated that Lalit firmly believed his father, Bhopal Singh who died in 2007, was communicating with him and asking him to perform certain rituals that would benefit the entire family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/burari-deaths-police-closure-report-mentions-no-foul-play/articleshow/87169901.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Kochi||Kerala: Idukki dam to hold water level 2ft below rule curve||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/IDUKKI: Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) has decided to keep the water level in Idukki dam 2ft below the revised rule curve level of 2,399.31ft till October 31. A high-level meeting of KSEB held on Tuesday night to assess the flood situation and dam management has decided to increase the spilling of water from dam up to 500cumecs in case of very heavy rains and increased inflows to the dam. Similarly, water level in Idamalayar dam would be maintained at 165.3m. The discharge of water from Kakki dam would continue to be 150 cumecs, until the water level in the dam goes down to 979.45 metres. Water level in Pampa and Banasurasagar dams would be regulated based on the intensity of rainfall in the dam catchment areas. After rising continuously for the past few days the water level in Idukki dam had begun to decline on Wednesday with the authorities deciding to open three shutters of Cheruthoni dam on Tuesday morning. The shutters of the dam were raised 0.34 metres when the water level was at 2,398.08ft which dropped to 2,398.04ft on Wednesday 3pm but after 10pm it has slowly risen to 2,398.10ft. KSEB sources said 27 hours after the shutters were opened the water level declined just about by .04ft. A KSEB official said 60 lakh litres of water is being discharged from the reservoir in a minute which is capable of generating 1.6 crore units of power. The opening of the reservoir did not affect normal life in Cheruthoni and the water is now flowing at nearly half the height of the bridge. The live storage of the dam was recorded at 94.28% on Wednesday whereas it was at 89.61% the same day last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/idukki-dam-to-hold-water-level-2ft-below-rule-curve/articleshow/87169897.cms||---

It gives details of misappropriation of funds to the tune of Rs 500 crore in the smart city project run by Pimpri Chinchwad Corporation ruled by BJP. Hope he will use his influence on ED to start the investigation,” he tweeted. Raut said that over the years, Somaiya had created a reputation for himself as someone who exposes corruption everywhere. “In the year 2018-2019, many tenders worth several hundred crores were floated for various projects in the smart city project. However, these tenders, their terms and conditions were prepared keeping in view interests of a few select companies, namely — Crystal Integrated Services and Arcus. Both these companies were awarded tenders worth more than Rs 500 crore ... .

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Stone-pelting over social media post leaves 7 cops injured||AURANGABAD: An allegedly objectionable social media post led to tension and stone-pelting in Vijay Chowk area of the Osmanabad district — around 245km from here — late on Tuesday. Authorities, however, maintained the situation was currently under control. An officer privy to the probe said that angered over police team returning without the suspect, who had posted the objectionable comments on a social media site, a group of people got violent and started targeting the police van. As police tried to disperse the mob, some miscreants took to stone-pelting, leaving seven policemen, including a police sub-inspector, injured. Taking cognizance of the incident, an offence for attempt to murder, voluntarily causing hurt to deter a government employee from performing his duty, assault or using criminal force to deter government employee from performing and sections of Prevention of damage to public property Act have been slapped on around 150 suspects at Osmanabad city police station. Police have clarified that so far no complaint of hurting religious sentiments has been filed. “Ifa complaint is lodged, an offence will be registered,” said a senior officer. Despite repeated attempts, superintendent of police Neeva Jain could not be reached for her comments on the issue. Police officers maintained that of all the policemen injured, one had sustained a serious injury, while others have been discharged from hospital. When contacted, inspector Suresh Budhwant said, “Angered over an objectionable comment on a socila media site, aimed at hurting sentiments of a community, a group of people reached the police station demanding action against the suspect.” While the police agreed to register an offence, some people present there demanded that the suspect should be immediately detained. Considering the gravity of the situation, a police team was rushed to find and bring the suspect to the police station. “The suspect was not found at his home and so our police team returned empty handed. Some overzealous members of the crowd, on spotting the police van, rushed towards it. When the noticed that the suspect was not in the van, they started smashing on the doors, windows and body of the vehicle,” Budhwant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/stone-pelting-over-social-media-post-leaves-7-cops-injured/articleshow/87167106.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Ground handling staff board passengers, load and unload bags, clean planes and get them ready for departure — all within an hour. The contract of the firm handling ground operations ended last December and authorities urged Air India’s agency to step in. Airlines are worried that entrusting work to a single firm that has to handle the all cargo flights, international flights and two domestic airlines may prove problematic when flights resume in a full-fledged manner. At present, staff work with a reduced load as only 20% to 30% of pre-Covid flights operate from the international terminal, which would earlier handle close to 20,000 passengers and more than 100 flights a day. “The turnaround time of flights from international destinations is just one hour during which the aircraft and passengers have to be handled swiftly,” said an official, further highlighting the need for more manpower and specialised equipment. Airlines Operators Committee (AOC) of Chennai airport has requested Airport Authority of India (AAI) to rope in another ground agency to handle international flight operations. AAI called for tenders twice but failed to identify a firm due to procedural issues and legal tangles. The airport was banking on AAI’s cargo arm, but that did not work out either. Sources said ground handling requires trained personnel especially at a time when people have not handled flights for a long time. “Around 9% of the day or two hours would be devoted to training personnel,” said an airport official. A major metro airport like Chennai should have at least two to three ground handling firms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/intl-flights-may-be-hit-as-city-airport-has-just-1-firm-handling-ground-ops/articleshow/87169938.cms||V Ayyappan

The compensation of Rs 50,000 per hectare announced by Kejriwal should be increased to Rs 50,000 per acre, which comes to more than Rs 1.2 lakh per hectare. Bidhuri has also given time till Diwali to the AAP government to fulfill other demands of the farmers. He added that if farmers' demands are not accepted, then after Diwali, Delhi Pradesh BJP will launch an agitation in their support. The BJP functionary also demanded that subsidies for the purchase of diesel, electricity, and agricultural machinery should be provided to the farmers of Delhi. He claimed that the CM announced compensation for damaged crops of farmers under pressure from the BJP. Bidhuri also claimed that the process of mutation and girdawari in the villages is stalled due to which the names of the legal heirs are not being recorded in the revenue records and they are not getting the ownership rights on the death of a farmer.

---||Delhi||Cops nab 3 within 24 hours of 23-year-old’s stabbing in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The stabbing to death of a 23-year-old woman early on Tuesday in west Delhi’s Bindapur led to the arrest of three men on Wednesday. Police identified the arrested youths as Ankit Gaba, Himanshu, and Manish Sharma, all residents of Uttam Nagar. While Gaba is a supplier of cosmetics, Himanshu is a school drop-out. Dolly BabberAccording to police, around 2.15am on Tuesday, an emergency response vehicle patrolling the Bindapur area was informed by a food delivery executive that he had seen a woman being stabbed near a gurudwara in Uttam Nagar. "The police team reached the spot and took the victim to Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital where she was declared brought-dead,” said Shankar Choudhary, DCP (Dwarka). “Local enquiries helped establish the identity of the victim as Dolly Babber. A case of murder was registered and a probe initiated.” Further investigations revealed that at around 11.30pm on Monday, Babber had left home to attend her friend’s party along with the three youths. "The woman was known to all these men. They were partying together on the terrace of an under-construction building, near the residence of the deceased woman,” said Choudhary. “During the party, an altercation broke out over some personal issues and an alleged relationship. It turned into a fight and culminated in Dolly being stabbed by Ankit in the presence of his friends.” Apparently, Babber and Gaba, 24, were friends from a long time. At the party, Gaba was angered by the woman making some remarks about him when conversing with her friends. This led to the fight in which Gaba drew a knife and stabbed her. A video clip, widely shared on social media on Tuesday, shows the woman trying to save herself as a man repeatedly attacks her with a knife. After checking the CCTV footage from the area, police created the possible escape route of the trio. “We established that the men ran away towards Vikas Nagar in Uttam Nagar and then took an auto to Anand Vihar. There, not finding any bus for Chandigarh, they took another auto to the ISBT, from where they caught a bus to Chandigarh,” revealed the DCP. “From there, they left for Patiala. Police teams were sent in pursuit to Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. We then received inputs that the suspects are hiding near Dwarka Mor on Wednesday. Himanshu and Sharma were arrested, and on information given by them, Ankit from Sector 23, Dwarka. The weapon of offence, a knife, has also been recovered.” The officer said that Gaba fractured both his legs when trying to flee the police, while the other two did not put up any resistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-nab-3-within-24-hrs-of-23-year-olds-stabbing/articleshow/87169935.cms||---

---||Pune||Airport closure for fortnight affects frequent business flyers||PUNE: The closure of the city airport for a fortnight for runway resurfacing work has affected the frequent business flyers, as they are now compelled to pay additional expenses towards road trips for availing flights from Mumbai. The flyers, who had rerouted their tickets from Mumbai, are equally frustrated because road travel from the city to the state capital during odd hours is quite a hassle. “I fly to Delhi eight-nine times a month for business. During the last two trips from Mumbai after the Pune airport was closed, I had to spend almost Rs12,000 for going to the Mumbai airport and then returning to the city. This expense was over and above the total flight fare of Rs13,000 on both occasions. The additional expenses are taking a toll on us. The closure of the airport was announced too suddenly,” businessman Rajan Jaffrey told TOI. The Pune airport is shut for 14 days from October 16 to October 29 for runway re-carpeting and flights will resume from 8am on October 30. Airfares are surging with the festive season on and Diwali approaching. “A one-way flight ticket to Delhi now costs around Rs6,000, up from around Rs4,500. The additional and increased road transportation costs due to the soaring fuel prices are adding to our financial burden,” Jaffrey said. Pune resident Saheb Bagchi said, “I had gone to Mumbai earlier by cabs and the fare would be around Rs2,000 to Rs2,500. This time, I had to pay a private cab Rs3,500 due to the high diesel prices. My flight ticket from Mumbai to Kolkata on October 18 cost Rs8,000. The return fares are all above Rs7,800. Once I reach Mumbai, I have to again book a cab. This will cost me extra again. It is extremely hard on one’s pockets.” A travel agent said many people travelling for Diwali had booked return tickets via Mumbai. “There are some clients returning to Pune in the first week of November but have booked travel via Mumbai. We told them that the Pune airport would reopen by then. But they are not convinced. This has happened mainly due to the sudden announcement of the airport closure,” representative of a travel agency said. IT professional Aarti Kailash and her mother have rerouted their Pune-Delhi flight from Mumbai for October 26 are a worried lot. “The airline has booked us in an 8:45pm flight to Delhi. Since only two of us are travelling, we have decided to reach the airport by 3pm,as there are safety concerns on road travel during late evening. The trip is turning out to be a hassle, but we have no choice,” he said. Demand for chopper to Mum up: Company official The demand for chopper services between Pune and Mumbai has surged since the Lohegan airport was closed for the runway re-carpeting, a spokesperson of the private company running the facility said. “The rise in the demand for the services is particularly from the people of Pune. Currently, there are two flights in a day. The first flight takes off from Pune at 9.30am and returns from Mumbai at 4.30pm. The other flight leaves Mumbai at 10.30am and returns from Pune at 3.30pm. The fare per person for one-way travel from Pune to Mumbai is Rs15,500 plus taxes. The fare for the return journey from Mumbai to Pune is Rs29,500, besides taxes,” the company spokesperson told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/airport-closure-for-fortnight-affects-frequent-biz-flyers/articleshow/87169942.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Mumbai||MMR vax disparity: Bhiwandi (49%), Navi Mumbai (100%)||MUMBAI: Nine months after mass Covid-19 vaccination began, there is still wide variation in coverage across civic corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region – for the first dose, it ranges from 100% in Navi Mumbai to 49% in Bhiwandi. Mumbai (97%) and Panvel (90.5%) are the others with high coverage as compared to Mira-Bhayander (70%), Thane (62%), Kalyan-Dombivli (62%), Ulhasnagar (55%) and Vasai-Virar (50%). TOI spoke to civic officials across municipalities who said the gap in smaller areas is probably because their residents visited BMC's (or NMMC’s) centres for their first shot. So, Mumbai may have to vaccinate more than 100% of its target population before resting easy. “Up to 20% of shots given in Mumbai were possibly to people from other areas,” said a BMC official. As Mumbai derives its workforce from satellite cities, “we have thus ensured that Mumbai and its surrounding areas are safer,” said the official. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said she is not aware about the numbers from adjoining cities who got vaccinated in Mumbai. As per Covid vaccination rules, people can get vaccinated anywhere in the country; the two doses could be taken in different cities. Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation medical health officer Dr Bhakti Chaudhari admitted that her free vaccination centres have a slim turnout. “We assume it is because a good number of our adult population travelled to Mumbai and other places for their doses,” she added. It is the same story in Thane and Kalyan-Dombivli. A KDMC health official said he believes 10-15% more of their adult population are vaccinated than indicated by numbers. Dr Anita Sakpale of Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation said the UMC is collecting ward-wise data to assess how many are vaccinated. In Bhiwandi, barely half the 5.11 lakh target population has got the first dose. “We are working with local leaders to change their mindset,” said an official who didn’t want to be named. In Mumbai, additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said the corporation’s deadline for ensuring 100% first-dose coverage is October 31. NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said the 101 vaccine centres are now focused on covering the remaining beneficiaries with the second dose. In Panvel, commissioner Ganesh Deshmukh said every resource – from setting up mobile booths to using teachers and maulvis – is being used to spread the word.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Sachin Pilot rakes up cabinet rejig demand, wants Dalit minister||JAIPUR: Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Wednesday demanded the inclusion of Dalits in the state cabinet as well as in political appointments pending in the state. Even though the demands have been pending for long, this was probably the first time that Pilot has publicly spoken about the need to meet them fast. Unveiling an octo-alloy statue of Bhimrao Ambedkar in Chaksu near Jaipur, Pilot said that unlike BJP, which worships icons for community votes, the Congress has always worked for Dalit welfare. tnn Addressing a public gathering in Chaksu, the Congress leader recalled former cabinet minister, the late Bhanwar Lal Meghwal, who died from prolonged illness in November last year. “Master Bhanwar Lal Meghwal did a lot for the welfare of Dalits. After his death, the seat of a Dalit cabinet minister is vacant in Rajasthan. In such a situation, I hope the state government and the AICC will soon give chance to another Dalit minister in place of Meghwal ji,” said Pilot. He added that the Dalit and backward cpommunity leaders would be considered for political appointments too. Despite invitation, the absence of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasras was conspicuous at the programme organised by local Congress MLA Ved Prakash Solanki, a Dalit leader and staunch Pilot loyalist. In his speech, Pilot said these leaders were invited but they could not attend the event due to different reasons. “I know our party and government are engaged in the development and welfare of Dalits,” he said. AICC secretary Tarun Kumar, Congress MLAs Murari Lal Meena, GR Khatana, Indraj Gurjar, Indra Meena, Prashant Bairwa and Amar Singh Jatav were present. The Congress leader used the occasion to attack BJP also. Pilot said that in the last seven years, the BJP-led central government had ruined the country’s economy, with unemployment reaching a historic peak and inflation skyrocketing as petrol, diesel and LPG cylinders became expensive. “Those who never looked at Ambedkar and Sardar Patel, have started worshiping them because of your votes. They are impressionists who can worship anyone for votes,” said Pilot, urging people to stay away from those who give lofty speeches, deceive people and encourage violence. Pilot said Dalits and tribal people were being exploited and criticised even in the 21st century. “If we try to take the country forward by dividing people, it is not possible. A country progresses only when the whole community progresses. We need to move forward by binding the entire community,” he said. “Many agitations took place, many parties were formed and many posts were occupied in the name of Ambedkar, but nothing happened by merely winning elections and occupying offices. We need to take decisions too for the welfare of Dalits,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pilot-rakes-up-cabinet-rejig-demand-wants-dalit-minister/articleshow/87171332.cms||---

In Panvel, commissioner Ganesh Deshmukh said every resource – from setting up mobile booths to using teachers and maulvis – is being used to spread the word.

---||Goa||Change in Asian Cup qualifying format not good for India: Igor Stimac||Panaji: Igor Stimac has no doubt that India will start as favourites to qualify from their group for Asian Cup 2023 but will need thorough preparations. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has converted the final round of qualifiers from the conventional home and away format to a single round robin ties to be played in centralised venues. Rather than start on February 1, as earlier planned, the tournament will now be played in June next year, with just three matches in hand for teams to realise their qualification dream. “Obviously less matches are helpful to the weaker teams (in the group) to sneak something out,” Stimac told TOI on Thursday. “We should be favourites in the group which will be nominated, but it won’t be an easy task. We need to prepare for the camp which we plan to have through (the months of) April and May to make sure that the team is ready.” India, ranked 107, are expected to be in Pot 1 when the groupings are made and will face opponents who are lower-ranked than them. The concern for Stimac is not who India will face but how they will prepare for the three matches that will decide who qualifies for AFC’s flagship men's tournament. “A longer camp is a must to make sure the team is well-prepared. Once the ISL is over, we need to have the camp at a safe place. We also need enough friendlies to start the qualifiers in a proper way,” said Stimac. The Indian Super League, India’s top-tier league, starts on November 19 and seven of the 11 teams will end their campaign before March. The Croatian coach has often complained that the lengthy gap of eight months between two ISL editions is unhealthy for players and the national team. “I am not worried about the next few months because the ISL will start and players will have 20 games. These will be competitive months. But once the ISL concludes, we need to keep going. We need to have friendlies and training sessions. The players shouldn’t be let off,” said Stimac. The AFC said that the final round will be held on June 8, June 11 and June 14 next year. AFC decided to change the format of Asian Cup qualifiers and play at centralised venues “after taking into consideration the existing challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, while prioritising the safety and wellbeing of all stakeholders.” Twenty-four teams will be divided into six groups with the winners and five best runners-up qualifying for the Asian Cup to be held in China from June 16 to July 16 in 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/change-in-asian-cup-qualifying-format-not-good-for-india-igor-stimac/articleshow/87193200.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The civic body will also hold camps in each ward, possibly by the end of next week, for collecting pending licensing fees at reduced rates, said standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain. He added that there was some confusion over the approvals required for the implementation of this proposal but everything has now been sorted out. “We made the announcement in August and later got the proposal approved in the standing committee meeting. But still there was no development. To get clarity on the issue, I spoke to the additional commissioner, North DMC. We have sorted out everything and the proposal will be brought in the House meeting. We have no intention to create difficulty for traders and the very purpose of this proposal to roll back the fees was to give relief to the traders who have suffered major losses in the pandemic,” he said. Earlier, despite making an announcement at a joint meeting by the deliberative wing, the civic body failed to enforce the rollback rates leading to protests from traders. Some of them even complained that the staff were pressuring them to pay the fees at the hiked rates to avoid a penalty as the rollback will take time in implementation. “I request traders to wait for a week and things will be streamlined soon,” said Jain. As soon as the increased rates were imposed early this year, traders had expressed resentment and demanded immediate roll back. “It is really surprising that despite making the announcement, decisions were not enforced on ground,” said Nitin Gupta, president of Kamla Nagar Traders’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corporation-set-to-roll-back-its-licensing-fee-hike-plan/articleshow/87169960.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Kochi||Kerala: Resumption of rains revive flood threat in Thrissur||THRISSUR: Resumption of heavy rainfall has revived the flood threat in Thrissur on Wednesday evening. Red alerts have been issued for Peringalkuthu and Peechi dams. Since the flow from Parambikulam has been raised to 10,000 cusecs, there is a possibility of raising the second sluice gate of Peringalkuthu. The shutters of Sholayar and Aliyar dams were closed on Wednesday morning after water levels in the reservoirs reduced below the danger mark. While the spillway gate of the Kerala Sholayar dam, which was opened two days ago, was closed around 8am, the shutters of the Aliyar dam, managed by Tamil Nadu, were closed around 10am. However, the shutters of Aliyar dam were opened by 0.3 feet at 6pm following heavy rains. The meteorology department officials had scaled down the weather alert from orange to yellow for the next two days. Even though flood threat in Chalakudy river eased in the morning, eco activists’ groups suggested that the authorities should have waited for some more time before closing the dam shutters, considering the heavy rain forecasts. Several parts of the district including Chalakudy, Athirappilly, Vazhachal and Chapa areas started experiencing thunderstorms by Wednesday afternoon. Meteorology department officials have warned that the hill ranges of the district were likely to receive thunderstorms. The leaders of the Chalakudy river protection forum pointed out that the authorities decided to close the spillway gate of Kerala Sholayar dam when the water level is only one foot below the danger level. Kerala requested Tamil Nadu to close the shutters of Parambikulam dam only when the water level is two feet below the danger level. Athirapally and Vazhachal waterfalls were reopened for tourists in the morning. In the evening following heavy rains, the tourist spots were shut. The water level in Peechi, Vazhani and Chimony dams had reduced in the morning. But the situation reversed by evening following heavy rains. District collector Haritha V Kumar has issued an alert in Chalakudy area as Athirappilly and Vettilappara areas started receiving heavy rains in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/resumption-of-rains-revive-flood-threat-in-thrissur/articleshow/87169974.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Thane||MMR vax disparity: Bhiwandi (49%), Navi Mumbai (100%)||MUMBAI: Nine months after mass Covid-19 vaccination began, there is still wide variation in coverage across civic corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region – for the first dose, it ranges from 100% in Navi Mumbai to 49% in Bhiwandi. Mumbai (97%) and Panvel (90.5%) are the others with high coverage as compared to Mira-Bhayander (70%), Thane (62%), Kalyan-Dombivli (62%), Ulhasnagar (55%) and Vasai-Virar (50%). TOI spoke to civic officials across municipalities who said the gap in smaller areas is probably because their residents visited BMC's (or NMMC’s) centres for their first shot. So, Mumbai may have to vaccinate more than 100% of its target population before resting easy. “Up to 20% of shots given in Mumbai were possibly to people from other areas,” said a BMC official. As Mumbai derives its workforce from satellite cities, “we have thus ensured that Mumbai and its surrounding areas are safer,” said the official. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said she is not aware about the numbers from adjoining cities who got vaccinated in Mumbai. As per Covid vaccination rules, people can get vaccinated anywhere in the country; the two doses could be taken in different cities. Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation medical health officer Dr Bhakti Chaudhari admitted that her free vaccination centres have a slim turnout. “We assume it is because a good number of our adult population travelled to Mumbai and other places for their doses,” she added. It is the same story in Thane and Kalyan-Dombivli. A KDMC health official said he believes 10-15% more of their adult population are vaccinated than indicated by numbers. Dr Anita Sakpale of Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation said the UMC is collecting ward-wise data to assess how many are vaccinated. In Bhiwandi, barely half the 5.11 lakh target population has got the first dose. “We are working with local leaders to change their mindset,” said an official who didn’t want to be named. In Mumbai, additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said the corporation’s deadline for ensuring 100% first-dose coverage is October 31. NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said the 101 vaccine centres are now focused on covering the remaining beneficiaries with the second dose. In Panvel, commissioner Ganesh Deshmukh said every resource – from setting up mobile booths to using teachers and maulvis – is being used to spread the word.

The dealer, Mohammed Sagir (28) of Vasoli Phata Khed, lodged a complaint with the Mhalunge police chowkey on Tuesday. Suresh Yamgar, assistant inspector, Mhalunge police chowkey, told TOI that around 12.30pm on Monday, the four men approached Sagir and told him that they wanted to sell a large quantity of scrap and requested him to come along to check it out. “Sabir took his assistant Mukhtar Khan and went along with them in their car,” Yamgar said. After driving for some distance, the four men thrashed Sagir and Khan inside the vehicle. “They snatched Rs50,000 from Sabir,” Yamgar said. He said the suspects drove the car through various villages in Khed taluka. “They forced Sagir to transfer Rs25,000 twice to a money transfer firm. The suspects then collected the amount from the money transfer firm’s office,” Yamgar said, adding that the suspects then forced him to transfer Rs50,000 online before extorting Rs50,000 from him again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/four-abduct-extort-rs-1-5l-from-scrap-dealer/articleshow/87169954.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BNHS made to halt wetland bird study, greens cry foul||NAVI MUMBAI: Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) has been forced to stop its survey of the flying pattern of birds at the 300-hectare Panje wetland as part of a Cidco assignment to study its impact on flights at the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. Over 1.5 lakh migratory and local birds visit the wetland annually and changes in their flight pattern, due to the drying up of the wetland, could pose bird-hit threats to flights at the airport, BNHS and environmentalists have warned. In an e-mail to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, NatConnect Foundation said that BNHS scientific teams, mediapersons, nature photographers and local fishermen were recently stopped from entering the wetland by security personnel of Navi Mumbai special economic zone (NMSEZ) and “some local vested interests”. BNHS director Dr Bivash Pandav was also asked to leave Panje wetland when he went to study the place, he himself said at an online discussion hosted by NatConnect Foundation. The security personnel and local interests even filed “false” non-cognizable offence cases against the BNHS team. NatConnect director BN Kumar said this is a “very serious issue” and has appealed to CM Uddhav Thackeray to check the menace and help conserve Panje wetland. NMSEZ security cabins at Panje are also illegal and the state environment director had asked the project CEO and Cidco to raze them in November 2020. Yet, the cabins are intact and so is the security, Kumar said. The cabins have come up despite environment minister Aditya Thackeray’s order against construction at the wetland. There also has been intermittent landfill at the place. A spokesperson of Cidco, which has 26% stake in NMSEZ, said: “Cidco can comment on this issue by tomorrow (Thursday).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bnhs-made-to-halt-wetland-bird-study-greens-cry-foul/articleshow/87172066.cms||Vijay Singh

More flights, connecting various other destinations, will also take this route in the near future as the government plans to set up 17 new airports in the state in near future. Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of Kushinagar International Airport, he said that direct flights for Mumbai from Kushinaagr will start from December 18 while a flight for Kolkata will also start from this ‘land of Tathagat’. “Kushinagar will be directly connected with the country’s political and economic capitals,” he added. While praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts in this direction, he said that ‘Modi hain to mumkin hai’ (With Modi, it is possible). “During the past 79 years, it was not possible to make Kushinagar airport but the leadership of PM Modi made it possible. In 1942 during the second world war, an airstrip had been constructed but it remained neglected for years. However, the airport became ready in mere two years with Rs 260 crore,” he said. The minister said that 17 new airports will be constructed in the state. He said, “During 70 years only 74 airports were constructed. But, only in the last seven years, 54 new airports were constructed and now there are 128 airports in the country.” Mentioning Gautam Buddha, the minister said, “The Kushinagar international airport will connect eight important places related to Lord Buddha to the rest of the world. It will prove to be a medium to fulfill the spiritual goal of followers of Lord Buddha. India has always followed the path of Lord Buddha.” He also greeted the people on Abhidhamma Day and Valmiki anniversary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/delhi-kushinagar-flight-will-start-from-nov-26-scindia/articleshow/87169964.cms||Arjumand Bano

---||Chennai||El Nino’s kid brother may affect northeast monsoon’s performance||CHENNAI: The northeast monsoon, which ushers in the maximum rain for Tamil Nadu and Chennai, may be delayed as IMD on Wednesday said favourable northeasterly winds may set in over Bay of Bengal from October 26 only after which the season may commence. The onset is usually around October 20. Weather watchers pegged the onset of the NE monsoon between October 27 and 29, but climate trackers are keeping a close watch on Atlantic Nino — considered El Nino’s brother — which is warming the east Atlantic Ocean and could lead to a poor monsoon for Tamil Nadu. But IMD’s long range forecast says a normal monsoon is likely for Tamil Nadu and south India. “Conditions are favourable for the setting in of northeasterly winds in the lower tropospheric levels over Bay of Bengal and extreme south peninsular India from October 26. Hence, southwest monsoon may withdraw from the entire country and northeast monsoon may arrive around October 26,” said S Balachandran, deputy director general of meteorology, Regional Meteorological Centre, IMD, Chennai. Global climate phenomena may have had a hand in the delays. Experts said the development of recurring climate pattern La Nina — wherein the Pacific surface waters cool — led to a prolonged SW monsoon, which normally ceases mid-October. La Nina led the eastward moving ‘pulse’ of cloud and rainfall — a phenomenon called Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) — to stay put in the maritime continent or west Pacific for a very long time. Usually, MJO moves or returns to the starting point every 30 to 60 days. This kept the SW monsoon active as storms from the maritime continent or south China sea moving to Bay of Bengal pull winds from Arabian Sea and don’t allow easterlies to strengthen. Earlier, IMD said La Nina, normally considered unfavourable for NE monsoon, may remerge in the second half of November. It was active in 2020 yet there were back-to-back cyclones and excess rain that monsoon. This year, climate experts are tracking Atlantic Nino, which is moderately strong compared to 2020. “An active Atlantic Nino is not good for NE monsoon because it governs how MJO moves. It will stall MJO over Indian Ocean, preventing storms from south China sea from emerging into Bay of Bengal and strengthening into a cyclone. If MJO spends more time over the Indian Ocean, then Kerala may receive good rain. If it moves over the maritime continent, Tamil Nadu may receive good rain. So, NE monsoon in November is going to be key and Atlantic Nino the driving factor,” said prof Sridhar Balasubramanian, a climate expert from IIT Bombay. “NE monsoon is volatile in nature. Its onset and performance are not related. Sometimes, even one week of rain can turn deficit into excess rainfall. As of now, the onset is going to be modest and very intense in terms of rainfall,” said former IMD official Y E A Raj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/el-ninos-kid-brother-may-affect-ne-monsoons-performance/articleshow/87170008.cms||U Tejonmayam
---||Delhi||HC tells arts body to take a stand on LBZ exclusions||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Thursday took a dim view of the failure of Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC) to answer several queries posed by the Centre on the issue of excluding certain areas, including Jor Bagh, Golf Links and Sundar Nagar, from Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone (LBZ). It directed DUAC to take a call in the next two weeks and file an affidavit on the decision taken in this regard. The court was informed by DUAC that two meetings were held on October 7 and 9 to consider the issue after the Centre had sent the matter back to the commission for a relook, but more discussions are needed and another meeting will be held. The Centre earlier informed the court that it had rejected the recommendation made by DUAC on remapping LBZ and posed 13 queries for clarifications. Justice Rekha Palli had then made it clear that DUAC must “expeditiously” examine the queries while sending the file back and clarify those aspects that had not been dealt with. Several plot owners and residents of Sundar Nagar, Golf Links, Bengali Market and Panchsheel Marg, who wish to reconstruct or alter existing buildings, have approached the court seeking a direction to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry to implement the recommendations made by DUAC in 2019. The petitioners criticised the Centre’s refusal to accept DUAC’s recommendations and contended that its move was mala fide and clearly showed non-application of mind. The petitioners stated that one of the recommendations, which were made in terms of the statutory duty under Delhi Urban Art Commission Act 1973, was that certain areas in the city, including Jor Bagh, Golf Links, Sunder Nagar, Bengali Market, Ashoka Road, Mandir Marg, Panchsheel Marg, Sardar Patel Marg and Chanakyapuri, ought to be excluded from LBZ. In the petition concerning the Bengali Market area, the petitioner pointed out that the locality comprised of small residential plots measuring 212.5 to 500 sq yards and these properties could not be considered as “bungalows”, as was commonly understood, to be included within the strict rules governing LBZ. In August, the court directed the ministry to decide on DUAC’s recommendations within three weeks while keeping in mind that the peculiar bungalow style features of the zone and the fact that the recommendations did not seek to interfere with the LBZ guidelines but only suggested the exclusion of some areas having modern constructions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-tells-arts-body-to-take-a-stand-on-lbz-exclusions/articleshow/87193249.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Lucknow||RML docs conduct blood mismatch kidney transplant||Lucknow: Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) has successfully performed its first ABO-incompatible (mismatched blood group) kidney transplant, becoming the second medical education institute in the city after SGPGIMS to perform such a procedure. The transplant was done recently but the information was shard on Wednesday after the donor and recipient recovered fully. Prof Abhilash Chandra of the nephrology department said that the kidney transplant of a 26-year-old youth from Lakhimpur Kheri, who had B positive blood group, was done through the organ received from his 48-year-old mother with AB positive group. Usually, he said, the recipient’s immune system rejects the transplanted organ if her/his blood group does not match with that of the donor. However, in ABO-incompatible transplant, the antibodies in the immune system that can reject the transplanted organ are removed through a special procedure before the surgery. “In this case, the patient was put on immunosuppressants and his antibodies were removed through five plasmapheresis sessions before the transplant. The kidney of the donor was taken out through the laparoscopic method to avoid blood loss,” said Dr Ishwar Dayal, head, urology department, also part of the team. Another team member, nephrologist Dr Namrata Rao, said that in comparison to the conventional method, the ABO-incompatible transplant requires extra time for preparation and the cost is double because of the long hospital stay and drugs. But, the ABO-incompatible kidney is lifesaver for those patients who require urgent transplant but are not getting matching donors, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rml-docs-conduct-blood-mismatch-kidney-transplant/articleshow/87171330.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Today, UP has direct air connectivity with 75 locations and the number is only increasing by the day,” Yogi said while speaking at the inaugural ceremony of Kushinagar International Airport. “Earlier, the state was connected by air with only 15-16 cities, and now the 9th airport in Kushinagar has become functional. Uttar Pradesh has direct flights for 75 major cities of the country. Work is underway for 11 new airports and work at the international airport in Ayodhya and NOIDA is continuing at a war-footing,” the CM said. “This international airport will be of great importance not only for Kushinagar and East UP, but also for West Bihar and neighbouring country Nepal. This will strengthen the opportunities of tourism, employment and investment,” the CM said in Kushinagar. While welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion, the CM said that the state is fortunate to have the maximum number of places related to Lord Buddha, including his capital Kapilvastu; Sarnath, the place of the first sermon; Shravasti, where he spent four months; Kaushambi, where Lord Buddha stayed and preached in the sixth and ninth year of his attaining enlightenment and Kushinagar, where he took mahaparinirvan (renounced worldly body). “PM Modi connected all the places in the Bouddha Circuit. These places are of great value and faith for followers of Lord Buddha,” Yogi said, adding, “In the United Nations, PM Modi said that other countries gave war to the world and India gave Buddha.” Though east UP remained neglected after independence, now with the new flight of development in Kushinagar, the five crore people of the area will experience positive change, he added. During his address at Mahaparinirvan temple in Kushinagar on the occasion of Abhidhamma Day, Yogi said, “Kushinagar has been giving the message of compassion and friendship at international level. PM Modi has taken forward the new resolution to re-establish Buddha’s message at global level with the first international flight from Sri Lanka.” The CM conveyed thanks of the people of Uttar Pradesh to PM Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/up-now-has-air-connectivitywith-75-destinations-says-cm/articleshow/87169975.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Delhi||Delhi: House help kidnaps 7-year-old, seeks Rs 1.1 crore ransom; arrested||NEW DELHI: A seven-year-old boy was kidnapped from the house of a businessman in Shahdara district on Tuesday. Police rescued the child from Gokulpuri metro station and arrested the accused, the house help, who had demanded a ransom of Rs 1.1 crore for the release of the boy. Sagar Preet Hooda, joint commissioner (eastern range), said on Wednesday that police received a phone call around 5.39pm on Tuesday about a boy missing from Subhash Mohalla in Gandhi Nagar. The child's mother also disclosed to police that the suspect, Monu, had been recently re-hired after he had earlier left their employment because the boy had grown fond of him and was crying for him. DCP (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said that around 4pm on Tuesday, Monu took the boy to play, duly informing the mother. “But when they didn’t return home after one hour, the mother called Monu only to find his phone switched off,” revealed Sathiyasundaram. When Monu later made a ransom call to the family, police formed teams from four police stations, including even personnel from the special staff and auto theft division among them, under the overall supervision of Jitendra Kumar Meena, additional DCP-1 (Shahdara). The men were deployed in civil clothes near railway stations, metro stations, bus terminals and check posts. “The teams also scoured parks, isolated, abandoned buildings and parking lots,” an officer said. Monu called again and was told by the boy’s father that they could only pay Rs 10 lakh. “Monu told them that he wanted Rs 1 crore. He warned that he would switch off his phone in the next one hour," the officer revealed. Around 8.30pm, one of the teams spotted the boy and the accused near Gokulpuri metro station, around 5km from the kidnap site. “The suspect was waiting there hoping that the family would arrange the ransom money and meet him,” the officer said. Monu was apprehended and the child rescued safely within three hours of the kidnapping. Police said Monu, a native of UP, came to Delhi a few years ago and, on the recommendation of a woman named Ruby, began working at the complainant’s house around a month ago. “He was under the impression that the boy’s father earned a lot of money running a mineral water plant and other businesses," the police officer said. To make a quick buck, he decided the misadventure that has cost him his freedom. “The accused confessed that he was planning to buy a flat in Mumbai with the ransom money. He had worked as a decorator in Mumbai a few years ago," said the officer. After taking the child outside, Monu had bundled him into a rickshaw, then an auto and later an e-rickshaw to reach the Gokulpuri metro station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/house-help-kidnaps-7-year-old-seeks-rs-1-1-crore-ransom-arrested/articleshow/87169978.cms||---

The Mundhwa police later arrested the biker and his relative. They are searching for the other attacker. They have been booked under IPC Section 326 (causing grievous injury with a dangerous weapon).  “I had offloaded some material at a mall and was proceeding ahead when I turned left. The biker, who was behind me, raced forward, intercepted me and started an argument, accusing me of not using the indicator while turning left,” Sasane told TOI on Wednesday. Sasane said the biker lost his cool and assaulted him. “He hit me on my face, chest and back. He called his relatives and I too called my brother, cousin, and uncle to the spot,” Sasane said. Sasane said he tried to convince the biker and his relatives that be was driving safely, to no avail. “They were in no mood to listen. The biker and two others first hit me on my head and then attacked me with a stick and belt. My relatives tried to intervene and urged them not to cause a ruckus on the road, but they wouldn’t listen,” Sasane said. Sasane claimed the biker and his relatives then took out their ire on his relatives. “They fled on different vehicles towards Jadhav Vasti in Ghorpadi,” Sasane said. “I escaped with minor injuries. My brother Shubhan fractured his right hand and underwent surgery on Wednesday. My cousin Vijay got stitches to his head, while my uncle Ajay’s back was injured,” said Sasane. Senior inspector Bramhanand Naikawadi of the Mundhwa police said Sasane and the suspects didn’t know each other. “They are all residents of Ghorpadi area. Acting on descriptions of the suspects and the motorcycle, we traced and arrested the biker and his brother,” he said. Naikawadi said they have established the identity of the third suspect. “Our teams have fanned out to arrest him as soon as possible,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/spat-over-not-signalling-turns-violent-4-injured/articleshow/87169986.cms||Asseem Shaikh

---||Delhi||Delhi: North corporation okays plan to renovate 246 closed dhalaos||NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has shut down 246 dhalaos in its six zones and targets closing of another 100 by December-end. These dhalaos will either be revamped by the civic body or given to RWAs, market associations or NGOs for developing public facilities, such as temporary shelters for sanitation staff, recreational halls, libraries or public toilets. The proposal has been approved in the standing committee meeting. The sites will be transferred for a period of five years to the selected organisations, which will bear the entire development and maintenance cost, said a corporation official. “Most of the closed dhalaos were situated on the right of way of the roads, corner of parks, or municipal buildings. These closed dhalaos are in dilapidated condition and causing hindrance to smooth flow of the traffic. Further, it has been observed that people often throw garbage in open in front of these closed secondary receptacles/storage depots, which not only creates unhygienic conditions but also attracts stray animals,” stated the proposal. Standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said: “Since their closure, there has been demand from residents that these sites should be better utilised with the help of NGOs, RWAs or organisations under CSR activity to avoid inconvenience to people. We have decided to implement the proposal on priority.” After receiving permissions, these sites can be demolished and redeveloped by the selected RWA/organisation. “In case the services are not found up to the mark, the contract can be terminated by the civic body. The organisation shall also show clearance of electricity and water bills after every six months. No activity for profit making will be allowed to be carried at these locations,” the proposal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corpn-okays-plan-to-renovate-246-closed-dhalaos/articleshow/87169983.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Colleges reopen to thin attendance, minister promises special vax drive||MUMBAI: Degree colleges restarted physical classes on Wednesday to a lukewarm response from students. With most undergraduates busy with semester-end exams online and poor attendance by postgraduates, campuses continued to wear a deserted look. Principals pointed out that many students are still partially vaccinated and are not eligible to attend physical classes. Minister of higher education Uday Samant said special vaccination drives will be held for college students. He was speaking at an event at VJTI to welcome students. He also interacted with them on social media and asked them to strictly follow Covid protocols. Colleges, which are still collating data, plan to re-open campuses on Thursday and increase classes by Monday. They are hoping for better attendance after the Diwali break. Diya Joshi, a first-year student of Bandra’s St Andrew’s College, said she is keen to return to college but is still awaiting her second vaccine dose. Of her class of 37 students, only seven are fully vaccinated. “Juggling between online and offline lectures could be difficult for teachers. Even today, some teachers were not called as they were proctoring the online exams,” said principal Marie Fernandes. “I met my classmates for the first time since enrolling in the masters’ programme last year,” said Tejaswini Pandey, a biotechnology student from Ramnarain Ruia College in Matunga. “Though teachers have shown us experiments on video, hands-on training was required. It was fun to help each other in lab.” Only 5-6 students from her class of 25 came on the first day. At St Xavier’s College, very few PG students reported to college on Day One. Prerana Deshpande, a final-year student from Thadomal Shahani Engineering College in Bandra, said she was excited to meet her friends on campus after one and a half years. “We chatted and the teachers too asked us about our experiences in giving online exams,” said Deshpande, adding that only about 25% of the class was present today. At Nagindas Khandwala College in Malad, the attendance was around 5-10% in PG classes, said principal Ancy Jose. She said in a college survey, around 50% had said they are fully vaccinated, but many did not give consent. The poor attendance did not surprise anyone. “Many students are not in Mumbai. They will have to return and make arrangements for stay. Hostels are yet to open,” said one principal. Another principal pointed out that the minister had said colleges would re-open after Diwali, but then abruptly started it just 10 days before the vacation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-colleges-reopen-to-thin-attendance-minister-promises-special-vax-drive/articleshow/87169998.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Goa||Players free to use Indoor Stadium as officials find alternative venue for EVM check||Panaji: The office of the collector and district election officer has finalised the gymkhana hall of Government Polytechnic in Altinho as the venue for first-level checking of EVMs and VVPATs. The authorities had initially reserved the Indoor Stadium at Campal for election-related activities. Regulars at the stadium were told by Sports Authority of Goa (SAG) that the multipurpose stadium won’t be available for training from Friday. After several protests, the venue has now been changed. “First level checking of EVMs and VVPATs is scheduled from October 26 at gymkhana hall of Government Polytechnic, Altinho,” Mamu Hege, additional collector (north), said on Thursday. The new directives were issued following intervention from Chief Electoral Officer, Kunal. Responding to a TOI report on Thursday that highlighted the pleas of state associations to spare Campal from election duty, Kunal tweeted that the “District Election Officer/Collector North Goa has been asked to look into the matter.” Within an hour of Kunal’s tweet on Thursday morning, a new venue was finalised. Sports facilities, including those recently built for the oft-postponed National Games, have been constantly used for election activities, thus disrupting regular training of sportspersons. Following pleas made by associations and athletes, the then chief minister Manohar Parrikar had assured sportspersons that sports stadiums will henceforth not be utilised for election purposes. At least two state associations – badminton and table tennis – were vocal about their disappointment that sports stadiums here in Goa were being time and again sought for election purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/players-free-to-use-indoor-stadium-as-officials-find-alternative-venue-for-evm-check/articleshow/87193262.cms||---
---||Delhi||Forecast turns on its head, min temp at 16C||New Delhi: Contrary to IMD’s forecast on Wednesday, Delhi recorded the season’s lowest night temperature at 16 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal, on Thursday at Safdarjung, the city’s base weather station. The minimum temperature at Aya Nagar was 15 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal. However, with a western disturbance approaching, the temperature is expected to rise marginally. The Met department has predicted very light rain on Saturday night and light to moderate showers on Sunday. IMD’s forecast on Tuesday said the minimum temperature was likely to touch 19 degrees Celsius, but the night temperature dipped to 16 degrees. An official said, “As the upper reaches of Himachal Pradesh and J&K have received snowfall, the cold northwesterly winds led to a drop in minimum temperature.” Before this, the season’s lowest temperature was reported at 18.6 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal, on October 15. The maximum temperature was recorded at 32.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday. The Met department has predicted that minimum temperature is likely to rise slightly on Friday and touch 17 degrees Celsius. According to IMD’s forecast, the minimum temperature is expected to rise to 18 degrees Celsius on October 24. Light to moderate rain is predicted on Sunday, which will be accompanied with gusty winds at a speed of 30-40 kmph. Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, said, “Northwesterly winds are usually dry and cold during winter. When a western disturbance impacts the region, the wind direction changes to southwesterly or southeasterly and cold winds from the northwest are obstructed, leading to a rise in temperature.” “However, after hilly areas receive snowfall under the influence of a strong western disturbance, the minimum temperature tends to fall again due to the cold northwesterly winds from snowcapped mountains,” he added. Last year, Delhi saw the coldest October in 58 years with the lowest mean minimum temperature being 17.2 degrees Celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/forecast-turns-on-its-head-min-temp-at-16c/articleshow/87193266.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lack of fogging and spraying spurs dengue rise in hotspots||LUCKNOW: Stagnant water in potholes and vacant plots as well as choked drains are providing safe havens for mosquito breeding in dengue hotspots from where the bulk of cases have been reported in the past two weeks, revealed a reality check by TOI across the city on Wednesday. Over 600 cases have been reported in the city since September 1. Of these, about 25% have been reported from 15 hotspot areas, including Faizullaganj, Takrohi in Indiranagar, Jankipuram Extension, Rajajipuram, Jankipuram, and Turiyaganj. Health and civic officers had claimed that regular anti-mosquito and sanitation drives are being conducted in these areas. However, TOI found water accumulation on main roads as well as on inner streets and plots following recent rainfall. Residents of some localities complained about lack of fogging, anti-larvae spraying and sanitation. People also said that since LMC’s helpline numbers for on-demand fogging are defunct, they had to go to the corporation’s zonal offices to personally lodge complaints, but despite that nothing substantial has been done. Kaushal Kishore Pandey, a resident of Indiranagar, whose daughter contracted dengue on October 5, claimed that burgeoning mosquito population has made life hell for residents of the locality, but only anti-larvae spray has been done once in the area and no fogging at all. “Mosquito population can only be controlled when fogging is done soon after anti-larvae spray. Besides, regular sanitization drives are required to clear mosquito breeding grounds,” he said. Similarly, Rajajipuram resident Sanjeev Pandey said, “Water accumulation can be seen in garbage piles after rains but civic agency workers leave it unattended for days.” Narendra Kumar Kashyap from Turiyaganj said, “We submitted an application for anti-larvae spray and fogging on October 10, but so far no one has come to our housing society.” Chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrawal said that in 90% of localties with high dengue case load, anti-larvae spray is done within 24 hours. But, fogging and sanitization are LMC’s responsibility, he added. The municipal commissioner was not available for comment but a senior LMC officer pleading anonymity said that zonal officers tasked with regular fogging are not meeting targets. “We have sent reminders again to ensure extensive fogging in high caseload areas,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lack-of-fogging-and-spraying-spurs-dengue-rise-in-hotspots/articleshow/87171382.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

---||Ahmedabad||8% growth in exports from SEZs||AHMEDABAD: After registering a decline in August, the cumulative exports — merchandise and services — from the operational special economic zones (SEZs) across Gujarat increased 8% sequentially in September. The exports showed a sharp increase of 60% when compared with exports in September last year due to low base effect. The total exports from the 20 functional SEZs in the state rose by Rs 1,292 crore to 17,790 crore in September from Rs 16,498 crore in August 2021. The spurt was largely attributed to the surge petroleum products and services exports, said people privy to the information. On the month-on-month basis, the exports from Reliance SEZ in Jamnagar went up to Rs 13,026 crore in September from Rs 11,629 crore in August 2021. After remaining muted for some time, services exports from GIFT SEZ at GIFT City in Gandhinagar saw a rebound with its exports moving up to Rs 350 crore in September from Rs 161 crore in August. Most other SEZs too registered higher exports in September. However, the exports from Surat SEZ and Dahej SEZ eased sequentially in September. The SEZ exports from the state had declined sequentially in August this year by 11% to Rs16,498 crore in August as against Rs 18,446 crore in July 2021, said sources citing the government data. On year-on-year basis, the cumulative exports in September were up by a significant 60% over the figures registered in the same month last year, which recorded exports worth Rs 11,095 crore. The exports showed a surge due to the low base of the previous year, when SEZ exports were down in the wake of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, added sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/8-growth-in-exports-from-sezs/articleshow/87170003.cms||Kalpesh Damor

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Underground water tanks at Hindmata to be augmented||MUMBAI: The BMC has decided to extend the underground water storage tanks at Pramod Mahajan Udyan in Dadar and St Xavier’s ground in Parel, that were built at a cost of Rs 130 crore, to prevent flooding at the saucer-shaped and low-lying Hindmata area. This augmentation will cost the BMC an additional Rs 67 crore. The BMC on Tuesday floated tenders to extend the underground tanks for Rs 33 crore and Rs 34 crore at Dadar and Parel, respectively. TimesViewFlooding in Hindmata should be tackled, but definitely not by way of sacrificing prime green spaces. There is a major dearth of open spaces in the city, and parks and playgrounds are extremely important. The BMC has already spent Rs 130 crore on the underground water tanks and despite this, there was flooding at Hindmata this year as well.Activists, however, fear that the two open spaces could be lost forever by further digging. “If the purpose is to make holding tanks, these can be built below/on the side of the flood-prone road itself. To dig up natural ground, which allows rainwater to drain away, and replace it with cement is self-defeating,” said activist Zoru Bathena. BMC officials said the tanks have a capacity to store rainwater for four hours during heavy rain—about 300mm. The tank at Pramod Mahajan Udyan can store 60,000 cubic meters of water and that on St Xavier’s ground tank 40,000 cubic meter. But, officials said, 30,000 cubic metre holding capacity is yet to be ready. This means, the existing tanks can hold rainwater for an hour and a half during a spell of heavy rain of 70-80mm. The BJP had previously alleged a scam in the underground water storage tank plan as the BMC had awarded the work to contractors without tenders as part of a variation in the existing stormwater drain works. “The BMC should have planned the project better and followed a detailed tender process before awarding such a new and highly technical work. The only reason for awarding this work is to allow siphoning of money under the guise of flood mitigation. Now, the BMC has come out with tenders and a big cartel of contractors has been formed,” alleged BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. “The BMC had made tall claims that there would be no flooding at Hindmata, but all their claims were washed away. Hindmata got flooded this year and will flood next year too.” BMC’s additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu did not respond to a query from TOI on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-underground-water-tanks-at-hindmata-to-be-augmented/articleshow/87172074.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) declared the result on Wednesday. Among the nine divisions, Aurangabad has secured the third position by registering a passing percentage of 39.82%. With the Secondary School Certificate result for the supplementary exam also being declared on the same day, Aurangabad and Latur divisions have recorded a passing percentage of 31.64% and 37.69%, respectively, which is higher than the average success rate of 29.14% for Maharashtra. For supplementary examination of HSC (new syllabus), which had fewer takers as compared to the old syllabus, Latur (36.49%) and Aurangabad (36%) divisions secured the top spots among nine divisions. Sugatha Punne, the MSBSHSE chairperson of Aurangabad division, said the supplementary exam was important for the state board also in addition to students. “Unlike main board exams that judged students based on internal evaluation, the supplementary exams were held in a traditional manner amid the pandemic. The successful conduct of examination by ensuring the safety of students has boosted the confidence of every stakeholder,” she said. Punne said the upcoming board examinations of HSC and SSC could also take place in a traditional manner, which means giving the exam while being physically present in an exam centre, if the Covid situation improves further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/marathwada-shines-in-supplementary-board-exams/articleshow/87167274.cms||---
---||Delhi||Why low platelet count isn’t lone benchmark for dengue severity||NEW DELHI: The spurt in dengue cases in Delhi and neighbouring areas over the past few weeks has led to a heavy rush in hospitals. It has also led to a rise in the demand for platelets, one of the cellular components along with white and red blood cells that play an important role in clotting and bleeding. The normal platelet count ranges between 1.5 and 4 lakh per microlitre. In dengue fever, doctors say, there is increased destruction of platelets and reduction in the formation of new ones, which leads to low platelet count. While transfusion in patients with very low platelet count and internal bleeding or rashes was important, preventive transfusion should be avoided, said doctors. “One of the main reasons for people seeking admission to hospitals in dengue cases is low platelet count. They insist on it, even when there are no other warning signs,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonary and critical care at Apollo Hospital. A report published by AIIMS in Open Forum Infectious Diseases in 2016 found 10% of patients had bleeding manifestation, which was deadly, even when their platelet counts were normal. In contrast, 15 patients had no bleeding even with less than 10,000/mm3 platelet count, which was considered very low. The study was based on an analysis of clinical and laboratory characteristics of 369 dengue patients admitted to AIIMS between August and November 2015. “Transfusion runs the risk of transmitted infections,” said Dr Jyoti Kotwal, chairperson, department of haematology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. “Platelet transfusion should not be overprescribed. In our hospital, we conduct immature platelet fraction tests before deciding whether a patient needs transfusion or not. It measures young platelet count instead of absolute count, which is a more reliable indicator of severity,” she added. According to Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine at Max Saket, pain in the abdomen, less than 20,000 platelet count, respiratory distress and internal bleeding or rashes were true warning signs that necessitated urgent medical attention and intervention. “A majority of patients will recover with supportive therapy. Maintaining hydration is the most crucial factor. Also, patients should not delay getting the test done. We see patients who keep waiting at home with high fever for 5-6 days and rush to hospital with severe symptoms. One should get the dengue test done if fever and other symptoms persist for two days or more for timely diagnosis and treatment,” added Tickoo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-low-platelet-count-isnt-lone-benchmark-for-dengue-severity/articleshow/87170009.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Six patients, including a three-year-old boy, had to be hospitalised as their blood platelet count dropped below 30,000 per microlitre of blood, far less than the normal range of 1.5 lakh to 4.5 lakh. Other patients are recuperating at home. Most of the cases were reported from the hotspot areas of Alambagh, Kaiserbagh, Aliganj, NK Road, Turiyaganj and City Station. Chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrawal said “The condition of all the patients in hospitals is stable. Doctors have been given instructions to transfuse platelets as and when required.” The health department teams found the larvae of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the dengue virus at 35 houses in Indiranagar, Shardanagar, Kharika and Rajajipuram during the checking drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dengue-surges-unabated-with-record-28-cases-in-a-single-day/articleshow/87171418.cms||---
---||Business||India rejects WTO’s fisheries pact proposal||NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday made it clear that it is not going to be pressured into signing new agreements at the WTO, such as those on fisheries, until its concerns are addressed and insisted that some of the “wrongs” from the earlier rounds, such as allowing developed countries to subsidise their farmers disproportionately, needed to be fixed. Government officials highlighted data to argue that developing countries were allowed to provide domestic subsidies which were a fraction of what some of the developed countries were permitted. “We are allowed to provide around $400 per capita support, while it goes up to nearly $40,000 in some of the developed countries. What we are asking for is a level-playing field and protecting the interests of small farmers and fishermen,” an official said. The comments came as WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala touched down in Delhi ahead of next month’s ministerial meeting, where the developed countries are seeking an agreement on fisheries, arguing that it will crack down on illegal fishing. She met commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday evening India is, however, of the view that its proposals need to be included before negotiations. Officials said that instead of merely asking developing countries to cap their support to fishermen, developed countries need to fish only in their waters for 25 years. “It is not a sustainability based negotiations but is meant to ensure that countries with large fishing business continue to have market access, while stopping others from growing,” an officer said, describing the current proposals for an agreement as “imbalanced”, which will benefit some European and Pacific countries apart from China. The official added all subsidies by developing countries were not bad. They pointed to payments for fishermen to avoid fishing during the breeding season as a case in point. Trashing the argument that an agreement on fisheries subsidy was crucial to ensure WTO’s credibility, a government source said that ensuring a permanent solution to public stockholding limits was equally crucial since the trade body’s members had given the mandate on multiple occasions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-rejects-wtos-fisheries-pact-proposal/articleshow/87172796.cms||---

The agency has also issued warnings about strong winds in the state till October 24. The Kerala state disaster management authority has asked the public to be beware of dangers caused by strong winds which could uproot trees. People have been advised not to stand under trees to avoid rainfall or even park vehicles under trees. It has asked local bodies to ensure that any branches or trees slanting dangerously be cut down to avoid any untoward incidents. With likely setting in of north-easterly winds in the lower tropospheric levels over Bay of Bengal and extreme south peninsular India, the southwest monsoon is likely to withdraw from the entire country around October 26. Simultaneously, the northeast monsoon is also likely to commence in the state around the same time. The southwest monsoon, which has been very active in this month, was generally weak on Wednesday with Mannarkkad and Kanjirapuzha receiving 3cm each while Kayamkulam, Munnar and Poonjar received 1cm rainfall each. Maximum temperatures rose markedly in Thrissur, Kannur, Malappuram, Kozhikode and Palakkad districts. Kottayam, Kozhikode and Vellanikkara recorded the highest maximum temperature of 33 degrees Celsius and Punalur recorded the lowest minimum temperature of 23 degree Celsius. Skymet Weather said an anticyclonic circulation over the Andaman Sea is expected to shift eastward, facilitating establishment of easterly winds, a prerequisite for onset of northeast monsoon. Prior to this change over, another weather feature is appearing in the equatorial region, in the proximity of Sri Lanka and Southwest Bay of Bengal. A cyclonic circulation over Sri Lanka and Comorin region, coupled with an easterly wave will move across Tamil Nadu and Kerala. With the rainfall in the state in excess of 123% this month from October 1-20, all districts have received more than 50% excess rainfall this month. Five districts, including Kozhikode (195%), Kannur (178%), Pathanamthitta (173%), Kasaragod (165%) and Palakkad (160%) have crossed 160%, which is a record of sorts for the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/three-districts-on-orange-alert-today/articleshow/87170042.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Village heads, primary teachers to help Admin beat vaccine hesitancy||Prayagraj: Finding Covid-19 vaccination exercise unsatisfactory in rural areas as targeted rural recipients are still hesitating to get vaccinated, district authorities have roped in gram pradhans, primary teachers, ASHAs and Aganwadi workers to encourage the eligible rural folks to get them vaccinated in trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna rural pockets of the district. For this purpose, a control room has also been set up at the collectorate to coordinate with gram pradhans with an aim to speed up vaccination in villages and blocks. After reviewing the vaccination drive, officials of the district administration and health department found that there was a need to speed up vaccination in rural areas to achieve the target. Later, joint teams of district authorities and health department chalked out a micro plan and engaged gram pradhans and primary teachers to encourage vaccination among rural folks, said a health department official. While the health teams are holding vaccination camps in villages to help rural folks overcome vaccine hesitancy, gram pradhans have also been roped in to dispel misinformation about the vaccine among people. District magistrate (Prayargaj) Sanjay Kumar Khatri on Wednesday told TOI: “We have engaged gram pradhans, primary teachers and ground health workers to boost vaccination in rural areas. Officials are coordinating with gram pradhans and measures are being taken to encourage villagers for vaccination.” “Enthusiasm among eligible recipients is more in urban areas compared to rural pockets. Therefore, we are making sincere efforts to boost vaccination among rural folks with an objective to cover the targeted beneficiaries at the earliest,” he added. The DM also said that “we are also focussing on second dose vaccination among recipients, including government employees, on scheduled time”. District immunization officer and additional chief medical officer Dr Teerath Lal told TOI, “Health teams are working overtime to overcome vaccine hesitancy in villages. Now, many departments have been mobilised to accelerate the vaccination campaign, particularly in trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna villages. Primary teachers have been assigned duties to register eligible beneficiaries in villages.” The health department has also planned to set up special camps in villages to cover the maximum number of targeted recipients. A health department official said that it is encouraging to note that in the past two months, villagers who took their first jab met others and persuaded them as well as their neighbours and friends to get vaccinated. “Vaccinated people are going door-to-door sharing their experiences post vaccination,” he added. Till now, over 33 lakh jabs have been given to recipients of all age groups while the health authorities have set a target to cover 45.16 lakh recipients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/village-heads-primary-teachers-to-help-admin-beat-vaccine-hesitancy/articleshow/87170018.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Real estate the major driver of Telangana’s gross value added growth since 2014||HYDERABAD: Telangana’s gross value added (GVA) through service sector grew at a rate of 1.5 to 2 times between 2014-15 and 2020-21 with real estate a major contributor to this growth. Real estate, dwellings and professional services were the main drivers of the services sector, accounting for nearly 35 per cent of its GVA in 2020-21 — the state GVA’s single-largest sub-sector. The GVA of real estate sector is expected to reach Rs 1.85 lakh crore in 2020-21, up from Rs 96,912 crore in 2014-15. Since then, the value of GVA increased by roughly Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 crore year-on-year. “Lockdowns and slowing down of activities had no effect on service sector growth; Hyderabad plays a significant part in this,” a top official said. The GVA of trade, repair, hotels and restaurants rose by a factor of two between 2014-15 and 2020-21. This, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. The GVA of this sub-sector is also expected to reach Rs 1.36 lakh crore this year. According to experts, the state’s robust GVA in any area — particularly the services sector — represents a healthy trend. “The state’s GST receipts are indicative of the trend but we should also look at the number of dwellings sold, not only income receipts,” said A Nakula Reddy, director of Andhra Mahila Sabha College for Women and former professor at Osmania University’s department of economics. Between 2015-16 and 2020-21, Gross State Value Added (GSVA) — which reflects the supply or production side of the economy — grew at an annual average rate of 11.6 per cent in Telangana, compared to national average of 7.8 per cent at current prices. Telangana’s overall GSVA increased by 2.9 per cent in 2020-21 (PE), outpacing India’s GVA growth of 5.9 per cent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/real-estate-the-major-driver-of-ts-gva-growth-since-2014/articleshow/87172109.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Pune||Relief for single-dose recipients with ‘safe’ tag on Aarogya Setu app on govt radar: Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte||PUNE: Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Wednesday told TOI that allowing single dose beneficiaries of Covid vaccines in all activities in the opened-up sectors, including industries and colleges, with safe status on the Aarogya Setu app was under consideration of the state government. “It is a work in progress. We are weighing the pros and cons. After deliberations, we shall take a decision on including this condition in the opening-up guidelines,” he said. On if the condition, if introduced, would apply to only Covishield beneficiaries or also to those taking the other two vaccines, Kunte said the issue was being deliberated by experts. State health minister Rajesh Tope had told TOI on Saturday that the safe status on the Aarogya Setu app might be considered as the permit for individuals with single dose of Covid vaccine to participate in activities in the opened-up sectors post-Diwali. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi, however, told TOI that there was no need to bring any changes in the unlocking process as of now. “We need to remain careful when the Covid cases are down. We should not introduce any changes to safe practices. Currently, double vaccination is the way forward. The stress on full vaccination is aimed at saving every life and minimise the severity of the disease so that there is less stress on the health sector,” the task force member said, adding that it should just be a matter of some months before the entire population was fully vaccinated. Joshi also insisted on double masking and proper ventilation. He said, “While apps are beneficial, the Aarogya Setu app is not geo-tagged. It may not exactly be of much help. Ahead of festivities, we should avoid any reckless behaviours. Covid-19 is now endemic in many parts of the country, but one should not forget that the virus is still in circulation and we do not want any new variants.” Another health expert said the option of single dose vaccine and the app status should be considered as a temporary measure only if cases were down. A technical expert of the state information technology department said, ““For the Aarogya Set app to be effective, it must be installed on as many phones as possible. The users have to update their health status regularly so that the community interactions can be mapped. With the density of use of such phones being skewed in urban areas as compared to rural areas, it may not be of much benefit in villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cs-relief-for-single-dose-recipients-with-safe-tag-on-app-on-govt-radar/articleshow/87170023.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The facility will cater to the needs of central as well as south Gujarat. The increase in capacity of the rescue centre was being felt for quite some time now as the existing facilities used to get packed frequently. Leopards had to be transferred to Junagadh from time to time. There are two centres at Dhobikuva and Jambughoda that keep rescued leopards. The capacity of the Dhobikuva centre is that of 10 leopards while the one at Jambughoda has a capacity of just three leopards. Deputy conservator of forests M L Meena said that the new facility at Jambughoda will have a capacity of around 40 leopards. “The exact details are still being worked out. It will also be able to accomodate leopards from south Gujarat as well,” he said. Meena said that the detailed project report (DPR) for the new rescue centre is being prepared. The centre will come up near the existing centre in Jambughoda in Sadra forests. According to official sources, the work is expected to end in the current financial year itself. The centre will have facilities for treatment of leopards and even care of pregnant leopards and cubs. A similar new facility is coming up in Amreli too. According to the last census, the population of leopards in Gujarat is around 1,400 and their numbers are steadily rising. The number of attacks on humans by leopards has also seen an upward trend, mostly in Saurashtra, with majority of the victims being migrant farm labourers sleeping in the open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mega-centre-for-rescued-leopards-will-come-up-soon-in-jambughoda/articleshow/87168791.cms||---

The local military authority (LMA) has put up warning signboards near military installations notifying them as ‘No Drone Zones’ in the Secunderabad Cantonment by following guidelines of the ministry of civil aviation (MCA), which approved the new drone policy. Signboards have cropped on the stretch between Bison Wheelers (Bison Regiment) and RK Puram, Bolarum Check Post (near 1 EME Centre) and Kowkoor Family Quarters and EME Gurudwara towards Bolarum-Lal Bazar stretch. As per the new policy, flying of aerial objects, including remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) of all varieties, within three kilometres of military installation, have been restricted. “Any aerial objects found violating this prohibition will be destroyed/confiscated without any liability and action under relevant section of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) will be taken,” the warning on the board stated. According to defence records, over 150 to 180 military installations, including regiments, training stations and residential quarters, were located in the cantonment. “I have noticed one or two signboards in front of military installations at Bolarum, but am totally unaware why they were designated as no drone zones,” M V Bhaskar, a resident of Kowkoor, told TOI. “A few days ago, we found some graffiti on walls informing about the ‘no drone zone’. The LMA has to issue a notification through the media to spread awareness about the new norms,” a few residents of Bolarum told TOI.

---||Lucknow||New airport linked to various centres through UDAN scheme||Kushinagar: The eastern UP town of Kushinagar -- the place of Buddha’s mahaparinirvana -- will soon be a direct flight away for pilgrims from many places in India and abroad. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday inaugurated the Kushinagar International Airport, taking the number of airports handling scheduled passenger flights in UP to nine — up from four in 2017. The Rs 260-crore Kushinagar International Airport will facilitate pilgrimage to Lord Buddha’s mahaparinirvana sthal, thereby boosting the economy of the region. Under regional connectivity scheme UDAN, SpiceJet and Truejet have been awarded flights to connect Kushinagar with Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Gaya, Bareilly, Saharanpur and Hindon in Ghaziabad. In 2017, the four airports in UP handling scheduled flights were — Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Agra. In addition to them, Prayagraj, Kanpur, Hindon and Bareilly also see regular flights. The upcoming Noida Airport and Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram Airport in Ayodhya will be international airports, taking the number of airports in UP getting flights from abroad to five — up from the current three that include Lucknow, Varanasi and Kushinagar. A senior UP government official said work is on at airports in 10 more cities — Aligarh, Azamgarh, Moradabad, Shravasti, Chitrakoot, Sonbhadra, Agra, Saharanpur, Noida and Ayodhya. “Of these, 95% work has been completed at Aligarh, Azamgarh, Moradabad, Shravasti and Chitrakoot,” he said. The state is developing an airstrip in Lalitpur, Bundelkhand, as an airport now. The Kushinagar airport was conceived in 2008 and the UP government acquired 590 acres of land for this greenfield project. In 2019, the state government and Airports Authority of India (AAI) entered into an agreement to develop and operationalise this airport. It was declared an international airport last June. AAI has built a new terminal that can handle 300 passengers per hour and a 3.2-km-long runway along with other associated infrastructure like taxiways and apron. AAI is awaiting 35 acres of land for setting up instrument landing system infra at Kushinagar Airport. The UP government is working on acquiring the same. Two other issues are yet to be resolved — completing the approach road to connect the terminal with NH 28, with AAI sending a reminder this August. And drainage work outside the airport is yet to be completed. The delegation on the inaugural flight to Kushinagar on Wednesday comprised of anunayakas (deputy heads) of all four nikatas (orders) of Buddhism in Sri Lanka — Asgiriya, Amarapura, Ramanya and Malwatta — apart from five Sri Lankan ministers led by cabinet minister Namal Rajapakshe. A 12-member “Holy Relic entourage” brought Buddha relics for exposition. After inaugurating the airport, Modi participated in an event marking abhidhamma day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/new-airport-linked-to-various-centres-through-udan-scheme/articleshow/87171446.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Investigating officials said that they have made separate teams to track down the accused. “We have got CCTV footage of the road where the incident occurred. We have got images of the accused but their faces aren’t visible. Also, the CCTVs couldn’t capture the registration numbers of the motorbikes. We are trying our best to locate them from other CCTVs,” said S A Karmur, Fatehgunj police inspector. Cops said that the accused disappeared into lanes after escaping from Nizampura main road which is making it difficult to trace them. The investigators are also scanning criminal records of gangs involved in such robberies in the past. Soni, who runs a jewellery shop in Chhani, was cornered by two robbers outside his home in Nizampura area on October 17 night. When they tried to snatch his bag containing cash, Soni fought back following which, one of the accused opened fire at him from his country-made pistol. Two other accused too came in to help and the four fled from the spot. Soni told the cops that the accused were aged between 25 and 30 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/48-hours-on-cops-still-clueless-about-gang-that-shot-jeweller/articleshow/87168747.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt announces Rs 546 crore package for rain-hit farmers||GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government on Wednesday announced a Rs 546 crore relief package for farmers of four districts of Saurashtra, who suffered crop losses because of heavy rainfall. Compensation of Rs 13,000 per hectare would be paid to each of them for a maximum of two hectares. The government is also in the process of surveying other crop loss-affected areas of the state. Addressing the media, education minister Jitu Vaghani said, “The Gujarat government has come up with a zero percent interest loan from the revolving fund for the farmers who have been affected by crop loss in the heavy rains during the recent monsoon. The government has announced a Rs 546 crore package for them. This package will benefit around 2.82 lakh farmers of 662 villages in 22 talukas of Jamnagar, Rajkot, Porbandar and Junagadh districts in Gujarat.” The minister said that a survey will also be carried out in other areas of the state to assess crop loss due to the heavy rain. “Right now the survey is in progress in Ahmedabad, Botad, Amreli,Bhavnagar, Surendranagar and Chhota Udepur districts for the crop loss. Besides these, there are also reports of crop damage in the Panchmahals and Bharuch districts. We will be conducting a survey there also. After all these surveys,the affected farmers will benefit from the relief package,” added Vaghani. “The farmers will have to apply online to avail the benefits of this package. The Rs 15 application fee for this scheme will also be borne by the government, so that the farmers won’t have to pay anything while applying,” said Vaghani. The state government had ordered a survey to assess the damage following reports of crop loss due to heavy showers in Saurashtra in September. Each eligible farmer would get a compensation of Rs 13,000 per hectare with a limit of two hectares if the crop loss was equal or above 33% according to the Government Resolution (GR) that was issued on Tuesday. The compensation under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) is limited to only Rs 6,800 per hectare, so the difference of Rs 6,200 per hectare will be paid from the state budget, said the GR. The resolution also says that if the landholding is less than one hectare, the minimum compensation will be Rs 5,000. Eligible farmers will have to submit an online application before October 25 to get the compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-govt-announces-rs-546cr-package-for-rain-hit-farmers/articleshow/87170024.cms||---

They threatened to shoot me if I raised the alarm.”“The two took out money from the cash box and jewellery from the locker. They even took the money from my pockets. After collecting the loot in a bag, they went outside where their accomplice was waiting on a motorcycle. They soon sped away. The robbery was executed within five minutes,” he added.As Verma, a resident of Badi Haibowal, raised the alarm, neighbours gathered at the spot and informed the police. PAU police station SHO sub-inspector Jaskanwal Singh said, “We are procuring the footage of CCTV cameras. The accused will be identified and arrested soon.” Police said the shop didn’t have CCTV cameras.Verma said, “I have suffered a loss of Rs 8 lakh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/three-rob-hambran-road-jewellery-shop-at-gunpoint/articleshow/87168715.cms||---

This government enterprise will encourage making containers in India and dedicated exclusively for the Indian merchandise exim cargo. Earlier, efforts have been made to make containers in Bhavnagar and Kutch, but the projects are saddled with technical problems and certification issues. Nimish Phadke, managing director, FOKIA said, “This crisis has come as a double whammy as it has occurred at a time when the global Covid-19 pandemic has already triggered a slowdown in economic activities across the world. We have suggested that the ministries of shipping and commerce regulate the sea freight as per geographical sector on a port-to-port basis. The freight should be decided on the formulas like maximum retail price or standard selling price as prevailing in the retail domestic markets.” The apex trade body of Kutch said the majority of the industries affected by this crisis fall under small and medium scale industries categories. The representation was made to union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal and minister for ports, shipping and waterways Sarbananda Sonowal who was recently on a visit to Deendayal Port Trust. “Due to container shortage for export, the industry lost the orders worth millions of dollars. All these sectors fall under the small and medium scale industry category. This also resulted in monetary loss of tax and other statutory levy of state and central government,” the representation stated. While the pandemic has caused the acute shortage of manpower, delay in custom clearance,cargo handling, driver shortages, and other allied activities, exporters who have signed long-term CIF contracts are losing heavily as customers are not willing to revise contracts rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/kutch-trade-body-urges-centre-to-set-up-national-shipping-line-carrier/articleshow/87168735.cms||---
---||Delhi||Slow lane for vehicles with FASTag on Yamuna Expressway||NEW DELHI: It’s a slow lane now for vehicles with FASTags on Yamuna Expressway and Agra-Lucknow Expressway in Uttar Pradesh, more so on weekends. This is because unlike the toll plazas on national highways where all lanes are equipped to process FASTags, on these expressways only two lanes on each side at the plazas have the equipment to read smart tags. This causes congestion on FASTag lanes while the traffic flow is smooth on cash lanes. The FASTag system was introduced by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and this is the default mode of payment of user fees on all NHs. The installation of such tags in all four-wheelers and above categories has been made mandatory. Sameer Luthra, a resident of east Delhi, recalled how he had to wait in long queues at toll plazas while returning from Lucknow with his family last Sunday. “We had to wait on Yamuna Expressway despite having FASTag. The toll operators did nothing to stop vehicles from jumping the queue in the FASTtag lanes as well,” he said. NHAI officials admitted that they had been receiving complaints from users from different parts of the country that they had to wait in queues at toll plazas on roads falling under the state government agencies and private players such as Yamuna Expressway despite having FAStags with adequate balance. “Since the focus has been to bring states and other agencies to come on board for implementation of the FASTag system, the mandatory provision was made that each of their toll plaza has at least two exclusive FASTag lanes. Now that the FASTag penetration has increased and all tolled stretches across states are connecting the NHs, we have been asking the agencies concerned to increase the lanes for FASTags. But there is little success so far,” said an NHAI official. Sources said some operators want IHMCL, an entity of NHAI implementing the FASTag system, to provide funds for equipping all toll lanes to process the smart tags for automatic deduction of user fee. One of them said the operator of Yamuna Expressway has even requested IHMCL to invest in infrastructure to make all lanes for FATags and it would pay back. “It’s a tricky situation for us since it’s a private player and the company has gone into insolvency proceedings,” said an official. So far, IHMCL has signed MoU with state agencies and private players for implementation of FASTag based toll collection at 273 plazas and currently this is being implemented at 194 toll plazas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/slow-lane-for-vehicles-with-fastag-on-yamuna-e-way/articleshow/87170020.cms||Dipak K Dash

In the Brahmavar incident, Shreyas, 18, and Anas, 16, allegedly drowned after they were probably caught in the rip currents at Madisalu stream near Uggelbettu railway bridge in Uppoor village. When Shreyas had not returned home even at 9pm on Tuesday, his father panicked and searched for him. Preliminary investigation suggests that Shreyas, Anas and another friend had gone for a swim in the stream. While Shreyas and Anas were probably caught in a current and when their other friend allegedly could not save them, he returned home. Based on the clothes and mobile phone, found near the bank, their identity was confirmed, and a search was launched and police were able to recover the bodies on Wednesday. In the second incident, expert swimmers, personnel from the Fire and Emergency Department and local police recovered the body of Martin Pinto, 15, a class 10 student at Mount Carmel School from river Phalguni on Wednesday. The deceased, son of Melwyn Pinto and Helen Pinto from Pinto Nagar, Kashipatna village, reportedly drowned in the river located close to their house. While the exact reason for the death is yet to be ascertained, it is suspected that he probably went for a swim or bath. According to a complaint filed, the victim’s mother left home at 2.30pm and when she returned at 4.30pm on Tuesday, she noticed that Martin was not at home. She searched for her son everywhere. Her son’s shirt, towel and chappals were found near the Moranthakaadu old bridge and slightly away, his shorts were also found. Also, a nylon rope used to dry clothes was found tied to a plant in the water at one end and the other end was found near the bridge. Following this, a search operation was launched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/three-teenagers-drown-in-separate-incidents/articleshow/87168010.cms||---

While such cases came in focus 2-3 years ago, the numbers are on the rise now, say doctors. ‘Precocious Puberty’ in girls is defined as pubertal changes appearing before the age of eight and comes with a variety of issues including increased risk of depressive disorders, hormonal imbalances and stunted growth. While the exact reason for these changes is not known, endocrine disruptor chemicals in pesticides, BPA in plastic materials, phthalates and parabens in personal care products, perfluorochemicals in Teflon cookware and nonstick wrappers, certain chemicals used in household cleaning liquids, certain chemicals used in building materials, phytoestrogens in soya and many other chemicals reaching the human body through food, water, air, skin care products and paints are contributing to a large extent towards this problem. “Many girls are attaining puberty (development of breast changes followed by hair in underarms and genital area, growth spurt and menstruation/periods) much earlier than the actual norms. It is becoming common these days,” said Dr Sivaranjani Santosh, chief paediatrician, Magna Centres. Dr Shanta Kumari, president of Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI), stressing on the need to study the causes, said: “Environmental and genetic factors, lack of exercise, obesity and junk food can be contributors. The number of these cases reaching gynaecologists are only a small fraction of the actual numbers. Usually mothers get worried and bring the child if she is below 8 years. In cases of bleeding disorders such as heavy flow, pain, anaemia or giddiness, the child is brought to a doctor.” The psychological impact of early puberty can also be disruptive. “These girls can face psychological issues because of discordance between physical and psychological maturity. Growth slows down and then ceases after girls attain menarche (onset of menstruation/periods). So, the height of the child too will be affected because of precocious puberty. Sometimes, serious medical/surgical conditions of the brain and other glands too can cause precocious puberty,” added Dr Sivaranjani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/early-puberty-in-girls-becoming-a-concern-chemicals-to-blame/articleshow/87172130.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Pune||Pune: Civic administration asks companies to shift to underground cables by February||PUNE: The civic administration has given companies four months to convert overhead wiring to underground cables, following which it will begin imposing fines from February. Internet service providers, telecoms and television cable companies will have to lay underground cables as per the Pune Municipal Corporation’s new directions. According to PMC officials, the policy for fines has been tabled before the general body and approval is expected soon. The proposal was tabled before the general body, but could not be approved on Wednesday as the meeting was adjourned. “We have urged these companies to convert overhead cables into underground wiring. It has to be completed within four months. The service charges for conversion have been finalised, which these companies will have to pay for road digging and restoration work,” said V G Kulkarni, head of PMC’s road department. He said a survey of overhead cables in the city is going on, after which the PMC will have an estimate of the quantum of such wires. According to civic officials, the rates for overhead cable conversion will be equal to the current rates of road digging and laying of cables. The civic body will charge an additional 10% as a fine from companies which do not follow the norms. According to the PMC’s data, it charges Rs 12,000 per running metre from private firms for laying cables, pipes and restoring roads. A 50% discount is offered to government agencies, which pay Rs 6,000 per running metre. “Overhead cables are defacing the city. Most of them have been installed without any permission. They are not only an eyesore, but also causing a revenue loss to the civic administration,” said Hemant Rasane, chairman of the PMC’s standing committee. Rasane said the PMC plans to explore this untapped income source. Civic data shows that on an average nearly 200km roads are dug up every year for various services. Along with private companies, government or semi government agencies such as the electricity department and pipe gas suppliers, dig up roads for utility services. Some PMC departments also dig up roads to lay water and drainage pipes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cos-told-to-shift-to-underground-cables-by-feb/articleshow/87170088.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

Earlier, on October 18, the Bar Council of UP had expressed its concern over the killing of Bhupendra Singh, a lawyer in the district court premises of Shahjahanpur. The Bar Council had also expressed its deep anguish over the recent killings of the lawyers in the state. In this backdrop of the situation, the Bar Council had decided to ask the state government to implement Advocates’ Protection Act in order to protect the lawyers across the state. Further, the Bar Council had also demanded a compensation of Rs 50 lakhs to the dependants of the deceased lawyer and also government job to one of the family members of the deceased. The Bar Council had also urged the state government to develop a mechanism across the state to restrain the entry of any person with firearm in the court premises, so that such criminal activity be checked in future; and the lawyers, who are the officers of the court, find a fear free atmosphere, where they could take part in the judicial proceedings confidently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/lawyers-abstain-from-judicial-work/articleshow/87170045.cms||---

In a presser held at Udaipur Bhagel called Gehlot as ‘Ghosna (announcement) Gehlot’ for making announcements all the time, but never fulfilling them. BJP had promised to waive off farmers loans and have fulfilled our promise while Congress has yet to move an inch, he said. He travelled to Vallabhnagar constituency for the polls and addressed a gathering of the BJP workers in Kharasan village. In a humiliating remark, Baghel said that Gehlot would have been born on the fate of one thousand liars. Referring to the REET exams paper leak, Baghel said that by leaking the paper the Gehlot government has killed the aspirations of the unemployed. Reacting to the statements, transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas challenged BJP leaders to prove Congress fail in its claim that they have fulfilled 64% of the poll promises made by them in 2018. “Bhagel claims are a bunch of lies intended to gain cheap publicity in the state. I want him to debate with me on how many promises Modi government has fulfilled and Gehlot government has,” said Khachariyawas. He hit out PM Modi government over the cooperative federalism by stating that the privatization spree by the union government is going to hit the centre and state relations. “They have indiscriminately privatized airports in the states without clearing what rights state are remaining with,” said the transport minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/congress-refutes-bjps-charge-of-not-fulfilling-promises/articleshow/87170102.cms||---

On Wednesday, the committee cleared the new policy without any significant changes, which could have helped ease the parking woes that the city is struggling with. The proposed traffic policy empowered the civic body to collect higher parking charges in premium areas. There was a proposal to collect parking charges for the vehicles parked outside housing societies and commercial complexes and give power to the RMC to tow away vehicles. However, the ruling party turned down all these proposals of the administrative wing. The new policy approved by the standing committee has made provision to collect parking charges in certain pay-and-park sites at a common rate in the entire city. The committee expressed the view that parking fee is not meant to earn revenue for RMC. The committee also opined that all over the world, the local body does traffic management in coordination with traffic police. The committee felt that the new proposals would result in administrative ambiguity and police will manage traffic and towing of vehicles parked in non-designated areas. RMC will not take any direct action or collect fines for the same. The civic body will earmark separate parking areas for autorickshaws, taxis and four wheelers in coordination with police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rmc-standing-committee-junks-higher-parking-charges-proposal/articleshow/87168787.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Buddha’s message of peace inspired our Constitution: PM Narendra Modi||KUSHINAGAR: Invoking Buddha from the Maha Parinirvana temple in Kushinagar on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, his message of non-violence and compassion has inspired India’s constitution. “The values of mercy and compassion are still ingrained in the heart of India. That’s why Buddha has inspired our Constitution. Buddha’s Dhamma-Chakra on the tricolour provides momentum and Parliament House has his engraved mantra — ‘Dharma Chakra Pravartanaya,” said Modi, who earlier inaugurated Kushinagar international airport and met foreign delegates, including Lankan minister Namal Rajapaksa. Ambassadors to India from Buddhist nations, including Myanmar, Vietnam, Kampuchea, Thailand, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Bhutan, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Mongolia, Japan, Singapore, Nepal and Buddhist monks were also present. “India has adopted Buddha’s teachings and incorporated them in the development journey. We don’t believe in concealing knowledge, messages or thoughts of great souls. Whatever was ours, we have dedicated it to humanity. We all know Buddha’s message was first carried to Sri Lanka from India by emperor Ashoka’s son Mahendra and daughter Sanghamitra. It is believed on this day, the great monk, Arhat Mahinda, returned home to tell his father how Lanka had embraced Buddhism. This boosted the belief that Buddha’s ‘Dhamma’ is for the whole world. This day also gives us new energy to cement our age-old cultural ties with all countries,” he said. “It was believed Buddhism grew in India, mainly in the east. If we look closely at history, we find Buddha has influenced the East as much as the West and North,” said the PM who donated a ‘chiver’ to monks. “Today the Lord Buddha returned to earth from Tushita and that’s why by ‘ashwin purnima’ monks complete their three-month ‘varshavas’. Buddha’s message of non-violence and call to witness the divine even in plants is still alive. Compassion seekers stay home in these three months, so that no sprouting seed is crushed and there’s no obstruction to nature. This rain habitat also gives an opportunity to evolve the nature within us,” he said. “Wherever Buddha’s ideas have been assimilated, there have been ways of progress even in most difficult times. He’s universal because Buddha teaches us to start from within. Buddhahood is an essence of responsibility,” PM Modi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/buddhas-message-of-peace-inspired-our-constitution-modi/articleshow/87171551.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Aurangabad||Don’t ask for affidavits on stamp papers, Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court tells govt offices||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court has said the government departments should not insist for affidavits on Rs100 or Rs500 stamp papers and need to implement a revenue and forest department’s notification of July 1, 2004 that provides for remittance of such stamp duty. The HC bench of justices S V Gangpurwala and RN Laddha ruled: “It is the duty of the authorities to implement the notification in its true letter and spirit so that unnecessary burden on the citizens would be avoided. Needless to state that the exercise shall be done by the state government throughout the state of bringing it to the notice of all the government departments and the authorities accepting affidavits and declarations not to insist upon the stamp duty.” The HC even asked the state to hold workshops for officers and authorities concerned so that they shall not insist on affidavits on stamp paper. While citing that the state election commission’s order dated January 8, 2015 is also being flouted, the HC observed: “The state election commission had issued an order that the affidavit and declaration shall not be insisted on the stamp paper, but still the same is accepted on stamp paper during the process of elections.” The HC directed that all government authorities have to take effective steps to implement the notification and to make the authorities and the public aware. The HC also expressed its apprehension that despite a government notification “affidavit on stamp papers are insisted upon by the government departments and also on the documents to be used before the court”. The observations came during the disposal of a PIL filed by one Ishwar Mahajan, a contractor with the Public Works Department. Mahajan through advocate Pradnya Talekar moved high court after PWD insisted him to file an affidavit on stamp paper of Rs 500 while filing a tender. Through the PIL, she contested that in spite of state government issuing a notification on April 1, 2004 under Section 9 of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958 and remitting the stamp duty for the purpose of affidavit, the departments of the state government are insisting for affidavits either on Rs 100 stamp paper or on Rs 500 stamp paper consistently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/dont-ask-for-affidavits-on-stamp-papers-hc-tells-govt-offices/articleshow/87167358.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Mumbai||Viral load in second wave Covid patients higher than in first: Study||MUMBAI: A city study has found a 100-fold increase in the amount of SAR-CoV-2 virus being expelled by Covid-19 patients during the second wave as compared to the first wave. The study, jointly done by the BMC and the Foundation of Medical Research, underlined that the Delta variant of the Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 was highly infectious. “We studied 75 Covid patients, some of whom were vaccinated, and found that compared to 2020 (the first wave), there was a two-fold increase in the proportion of people expelling virus in their breath and a 100-fold increase in the amount of virus per patient,’’ said Dr Nerges Mistry of FMR. The study was a part of the paper presentations made at the ongoing 52nd Union World Conference on Lung Health. The authors found that only 42% of the patients during the first wave could expel the virus (on to a face mask) while the corresponding number during the second wave was 91%. All the patients studied during the second wave were affected by the Delta variant. Samples were collected from patients within 36 hours of their diagnosis. Each participant was given a modified N95 mask that was attached with a gelatin membrane on the inner surface of the mask for 30 minutes. The participants were asked to carry on with their activities for the first 20 minutes and then asked to do vocal tasks (such as reading, coughing) in the last 10 minutes. The gelatin film was removed and studied. “We found the viral load among the patients was double of the load among first wave patients,’’ said chest physician Dr Vikas Oswal, who was associated with the study. He said the second wave was less lethal in terms of deaths, but each patient had high low-CT value and high viral load. Dr Mistry said some of the vaccinated patients expelled a lesser volume of virus. “However, there was only a marginal reduction in the risk of transmission from vaccinated individuals,” said the poster. The researchers said the study underlined the need for masking in the foreseeable future. “Such studies are important for scientists and vaccine manufacturers. The future generation Covid vaccines could focus on ways to prevent expulsion of viruses into the mask or arrest the mode of transmission,” she added. A press note released by FMR quoted BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare as saying, “Surveillance of Covid-19 is on top priority for MCGM now. Such studies help identify factors affecting the spread of the virus and thereby inform the action plan for its control.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/study-viral-load-in-second-wave-covid-patients-higher-than-in-first/articleshow/87170119.cms||---
---||Pune||Doctors: Dry weather will check viral cases||PUNE: The prevailing moderate temperature and dry weather conditions are likely to help bring down viral infection cases in the city, which have been on the higher side since September — the period marked by frequent rainfall and fluctuating temperatures. Family physician Avinash Bhondwe told TOI confirmed of rise in the number of viral fever patients coming to clinics since one-and-a-half-month. “Since September, rainfall was a daily phenomenon, accompanied by fluctuating weather conditions, such as sunny noons or cloudy days and cold night hours, making for unusual weather conditions. The period witnessed a rise in all types of viral infections, including respiratory and gastrointestinal. With monsoon gone now, minimum temperatures staying moderate and dry weather setting in, the incidence of viral infections could come down.” Bhondwe said absolute cold conditions with minimum temperature around 10C or less could cause a spurt in viral infections. “Respiratory viruses are believed to thrive in colder temperatures. The weather currently seems to be getting healthier. Dengue cases have also dropped over the last few days with the monsoon receding,” he said. General practitioner Santosh Gosavi said viral fever cases were still high, but the incidence of dengue and chikanguniya has reduced during the last 15 days. “Once the current weather stabilizes and people get acclimated to it, we expect viral infections to fall. Monsoon has recently withdrawn and persistent healthy weather conditions could help such infections to reduce after a week or so,” he said. Subhal Dixit, director, critical care, Sanjeevan Hospital and MJM Hospital, told TOI, “We are going to enter a healthy season with moderate temperature ranges when incidence of viral infections is generally low. Having said that, other factors also play a role . Citizens should take due precautions, such as adequate sanitization, staying in clean environs, preventing stagnation of water, maintaining hydration, daily exercising daily for good immunity. All these practices also play a major role in keeping viral infections at bay.” A senior pathologist at a private hospital said, “Viral infections increased during the monsoon, but now, with post-monsoon season setting in, we gradually expect such infections to come down.” Pulak Guhathakurta, head of the climate research division at IMD, Pune, said, “IMD’s latest health bulletin, a forecast on weekly transmission window for dengue, also showed that there is no alert for dengue in Maharashtra till October 28 so far.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/doctors-dry-weather-will-check-viral-cases/articleshow/87170129.cms||Neha Madaan

Seema Savale, former standing committee chairman and BJP corporator, said, “There has been a huge corruption in the ‘Smart City’ road digging work. The actual work was to be done for around 500km while tenders were floated for 750km of work. The quality of the road digging has not been proper and neither have tender norms being adhered to.” According to Savale, the road digging contract was sub-contracted by the main agency to another one, which was then sub-contracted by the contractor to a third agency. Savale asked PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil to take action against bureaucrats are involved in the irregularities, and also any corporators who are found involved. NCP’s Yogesh Bahal, who was the former Pimpri Chinchwad mayor, said that after finding irregularities, he stopped the road digging work for two days. BJP’s Sujata Palande said women’s safety in the twin towns needs to be improved and asked the commissioner to initiate appropriate steps. PCMC commissioner Patil said CCTV cameras will be installed across the twin towns but opposition members are not satisfied with this. NCP’s Vaishali Ghodekar said security across the public gardens and swimming pools should be improved and there should be a background check of all the security personnel involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/talks-on-safety-of-women-road-work-graft-at-pcmc-meet/articleshow/87170121.cms||---
---||Lucknow||PM Narendra Modi sends out political message to Purvanchal||LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday turned the spotlight on the politically crucial east UP region, saying with Kushinagar airport taking wings, he has “fulfilled a commitment to the Purvanchal region”, which he represents. Modi is an MP from Varanasi, the nerve centre of east UP. Modi’s statement can be read as a robust indicator to BJP’s focus on firming up its position in the politically imperative Purvanchal, even as the saffron party faces a raging challenge in west UP in the aftermath of farmers’ protests against new farm laws. On October 25, the PM is also scheduled to visit Siddharthnagar, where he will inaugurate seven medical colleges, including Siddharthanagar Medical College named after Jan Sangh founder leader Madhav Prasad Tripathi (Madhav Babu). The other six being in Deoria, Etah, Hardoi, Ghazipur, Mirzapur and Pratapgarh. The PM is also expected to reach Varanasi to inaugurate developmental projects, besides addressing a public rally on the same day. Modi’s reiteration that Kushinagar airport will lend the much-needed thrust to Buddhist tourism circuit was also interpreted as an outreach to Dalits, many of whom embraced Buddhism in east UP. In fact, the ambitious Maitreya project entailing world’s tallest Buddha statue (approximately 500-foot high) was initially conceptualised for Kushinagar, which hugs the border with Nepal — the birthplace of Buddha. The project now entails construction of relatively modest statues in Kushinagar and Bodh Gaya (Bihar). The development, experts said, could potentially help BJP to send out a loud message from Kushinagar to neighbouring Gorakhpur, the political backyard of CM Yogi Adityanath. Sources said, the PM may visit Gorakhpur in the middle of November to inaugurate the fertilizer factory and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Significantly, Kushinagar itself had been a tough political ground for BJP until 2017, when it won four of five assembly seats in the district — Khadda (Jata Shankar Tripathi), Padrauna (Swami Prasad Maurya), Kushinagar (Rajnikant Tripathi) and Hata (Pawan Kumar). The reserved Ramkola seat was bagged by then BJP ally and SBSP candidate Ramanand Baudhh. This was not the case in 2012, when BJP could not win a single seat in the district. Samajwadi Party had then won three seats — Kushinagar (Brahma Shankar Tripathi), Hata (Radhey Shyam) and Ramkola (Purnamasi Dehati). BSP had won Padrauna (Swami Prasad Maurya) while Khadda was won by Congress candidate Vijay Dubey. Tamkuhi Raj and Fazil Nagar assembly seats, represented by Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and BJP lawmaker Ganga, respectively, also straddle Kushinagar. They are, otherwise, part of Deoria parliamentary seat comprising Deoria, Pathardeva and Rampur Karkhana assembly seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/modi-sends-out-political-message-to-purvanchal/articleshow/87171567.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court reserves its order on Kangana Ranaut plea to transfer case||MUMBAI: An additional chief metropolitan magistrate on Wednesday heard and reserved for orders, a plea made by actor Kangana Ranaut for transfer of veteran lyricist Javed Akhtar’s defamation complaint against her to another magistrate. In his arguments for the transfer, her advocate Rizwan Siddiquee submitted that the Andheri magistrate had all the powers to decide on applications which were before him for adjudication, however he allegedly summoned her and chose to say he may issue an arrest warrant without giving any sufficient cause and reasons in writing.  He said it was a simple case of a non-cognizable, bailable and compoundable offence and the plea of the accused can be recorded in her absence too.The Andheri magistrate whose say was sought submitted his report. Akhtar’s advocate Jay Bharadwaj seeking dismissal of her plea said it is not maintainable and lacking in any legal basis. He said she was not present on several occasions and therefore her plea could not be recorded after cognizance was taken by the Magistrate. Bharadwaj said Akhtar, the complainant being a senior citizen, has been diligently present on each and every date of hearing. The additional CMM S T Dande who is holding the additional charge as chief metropolitan magistrate reserved the transfer plea for orders to be passed on October 21.She, meanwhile also filed another transfer application and also a private complaint against Javed Akhtar, which was to go before the same Andheri magistrate. Her fresh application is expected to be heard on Thursday. She is seeking that both the matters be heard by a different magistrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-reserves-its-order-on-kangana-plea-to-transfer-case/articleshow/87172107.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Have no fear, raze illegal constructions: Maharashtra CM to BMC||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray wants the BMC to rid the city of all illegal constructions and has asked it to work without fear and without succumbing to any pressure. Thackeray held a meeting with BMC officials on Wednesday where he directed the administration to take up the issue on a war footing. “We will stand firmly by you. Do not succumb to any pressure. Illegal constructions in the city will not be tolerated,” said Thackeray. In recent months, several senior Shiv Sena leaders, including Thackeray’s personal assistant Milind Narvekar, have been accused of carrying out illegal constructions. Narvekar even demolished his bungalow that was coming up on the Dapoli coast in Ratnagiri district after there were accusations of it being illegal. State transport minister Anil Parab was accused of constructing an illegal office on a Mhada layout open space in Bandra (East) but disowned it. Mhada later issued an apology to Parab. BJP leader Kirit Somaiya, who has brought up the alleged illegal constructions by Sena leaders, said the chief minister’s statements were nothing but a stunt. “Before the Lokayukta the government accepted that Parab’s alleged office at Bandra (East) is illegal. Today, when the demolition was scheduled by Mhada as ordered by the Lokayukta, I was informed that some person has gone to the city civil court and obtained a stay against the demolition,” he said. Somaiya said in case of Parab’s Dapoli resort in Ratnagiri district, the government has accepted before the Lokayukta that it is illegal but has done nothing to demolish it. Thackeray pointed to the rampant illegal dumping of debris in the eastern and western suburbs and called for appointing squads to prevent it. While lauding the administration for its exemplary work during the Covid pandemic and for being trailblazers in creating the Mumbai model, Thackeray said the focus now should be on improving civic amenities in the city. “The objective is to make our city beautiful with high quality facilities and for this, roads, pavements, dividers, parks and gardens must be made proper and beautiful,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cm-to-bmc-have-no-fear-raze-illegal-constructions-in-mumbai/articleshow/87172114.cms||Clara Lewis

The court of A H Dhamani, additional district and sessions judge, convicted and sentenced Naitik Gamit to 14 years in jail. Accused had started raping the minor when she was 13-years-old and the crime was unearthed by the survivor’s parents only after she became pregnant. The minor delivered a baby boy who turned a year old now and is living with the survivor. The court ordered Rs 1.5 lakh compensation to the minor on Wednesday even as it had earlier order compensation of Rs 1 lakh during the hearing. Accused was booked on September 5, 2019 in Mandvi police station for rape and other charges. The crime came into light when her parents got her medical examination conducted. She told her parents that the accused blackmailed her for rape. “The convict often visited the survivor’s home as their families knew each other. He first raped her when she was in class VIII and continued raping her later until she became pregnant,” said Rajesh Dobariya, public prosecutor.

---||Pune||Pune: Colleges and varsities start, small number of vaccinated students attend||PUNE: The mandatory double dose vaccination kept almost all students out of colleges and universities that started after the state government’s order on Wednesday . Savitribai Phule Pune University and many affiliated colleges saw almost zero students turning up on day 1 in many departments. Fergusson College was abuzz with activity but here too, only 8-10 students were attending per lecture. It is compulsory for colleges to ensure that Covid-19 precautions are followed, But, in many places across campuses students were seen either without masks, crowding and chatting with lowered masks. Two friends Anshita Gaur and Mahek Guidani, third-year students of BA psychology in Fergusson College, said this was their second first day. “We had come even when the college reopened for a day last week. We had lectures all day today and we could really concentrate on them unlike at home during online classes. There are too many distractions at home,” Anshita said. Mahek said since they are studying a humanities subject, there is a lot to be gained by just discussing a topic, or asking questions and counter questions which are not possible during the online classes to the extent possible offline. While students could be seen on many campuses, most were students belonging to junior colleges. Even in SPPU, most of the students visible were PhD students with hardly any graduation or postgraduation students around. A group of first-year students were listening attentively to a senior describing a college festival that she was a part of organising as well as participating in. The senior, Akshinta Das, an MA second-year student at FC says that she missed college fests during the online classes. “When they announced colleges were reopening, I had to come. I was so tired of sitting at home and not meeting people. But after seeing my friends and being in the college feels so nice,” said Das, who had eight students who attended her classes. Anushka Chalke, Anirudh Deshpande and Atharv Kutal, three first-year students of BVoc in Media and Communication were meeting their classmates for the first time, though only nine turned up on day 1. They said that there were introductions followed by full-day lectures which they enjoyed as it was much easier for them to listen to their teachers speak in the class than via online platforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/colleges-varsities-start-small-no-of-vaccinated-students-attend/articleshow/87170131.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Woman held with Rs 22 crore heroin; Rs 16 lakh MD seized from 2||MUMBAI: In two separate operations, the anti-narcotics cell (ANC) of Mumbai Police on Tuesday seized 7kg of heroin worth Rs 22 crore from a woman at Wadala Truck Terminal and 160gm of mephedrone worth Rs 16 lakh from a history-sheeter and his aide at Versova. In the last eight months, the ANC has seized about Rs 16kg of heroin worth Rs 44 crore. This year, so far, police have recovered contraband, including charas, cocaine and heroin, totalling more than Rs 100 crore. Deputy commissioner of police (ANC) Datta Nalawade said the Ghatkopar ANC unit had received information that a gang from Rajasthan was supplying drugs in Mumbai in huge quantities. Based on the tipoff, senior police inspector of the Ghatkopar unit Lata Sutar and her team laid a trap near a transit camp at Wadala Truck Terminal and detained Amina Shaikh (53), a resident of Lallubhai Compound in Mankhurd. “Her search resulted in recovery of 7.2kg of heroin valued at Rs 21.6 crore,” said Nalawade. “During interrogation, Shaikh said that a gang from Pratapgarh in Rajasthan would supply her drugs and she would sell it to peddlers in the city.” A team has already left for Rajasthan to nab the suppliers, added Nalawade. On October 4, police had arrested two men and seized 5kg of heroin worth Rs 15 crore that had also been sourced from Rajasthan. Police said Shaikh started selling drugs in 2010 when she would procure ganja for her husband. She was arrested in 2015 and 2018 and got in touch with big-time suppliers during her stint in jail, they said. In the second case, the Bandra ANC unit arrested Altaf Abdul Rahman Shaikh (44) and his accomplice Abdullah Iqbal Shaikh (29) with 160gm of mephedrone from Versova. Police said Altaf has offences of rape, assault, molestation and robbery registered against him at various police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-woman-held-with-rs-22cr-heroin-rs-16l-md-seized-from-2/articleshow/87170134.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Aryan Khan was aware of drug carried by Arbaaz Merchant, says court||MUMBAI: The NCB had claimed to have recovered 6 gms of charas from Arbaaz Merchant’s shoes. The NDPS court said Aryan Khan “was having knowledge and thus it can be said that it was in ‘conscious possession’ of both the accused.” The court said record shows Khan and Merchant admitted to being friends for long, travelled together to the party and were apprehended together. It added, “In their voluntary statements, both disclosed they were possessing said substance for their consumption and for enjoyment. Moreover, WhatsApp chats prima facie reveal (Khan) is dealing in illicit drug activities of narcotic substances on a regular basis.” The court noted it hence cannot be said he is not likely to commit a similar offence while on bail. Judge V V Patil’s court, in its 21-page order rejecting the bail plea of the trio, said, “Prima facie involvement of the three accused in commission of grave and serious offences. This is not a fit case for granting bail.” The court pronounced its verdict at 3pm. The three accused were not in court. Khan and Merchant are in Arthur Road jail, while Dhameja is at Byculla women’s jail, where they will remain now pending a hearing and decision by HC. The court noted ASG Anil Singh, for NCB, had shown it WhatsApp chats of Khan with foreign national and unknown persons dealing in drugs, and their perusal revealed “references of bulk quantity and hard drugs”. The court said it formed prima facie material to show he was in contact with drug dealers. The court noted that “during interrogation (Khan) did not disclose details of the persons which” are in his exclusive knowledge and as argued by Singh, NCB said it is tracing the criminal antecedents of such persons and if Khan is released, “there are every chances of tampering with evidence.” “ The court found NCB produced evidence to show prima facie that “accused are part of larger network”. It rejected Merchant’s lawyer Taraq Sayed questioning the reliance on WhatsApp chats when NCB produced no phone seizure reports. The court said NCB papers show Khan and Merchant “voluntarily surrendered their mobiles.” It said “it is not possible to record satisfaction at this stage that applicants have not committed any offence under NDPS Act” and added, “Considering evidence on record it cannot be said that there are reasonable grounds” to believe that the trio is not guilty.” Interestingly, while Khan’s lawyer cited the HC order granting bail to Rhea Chakraborty to establish that charges of criminal conspiracy are not applicable in this case, the prosecution cited the HC order in her brother Showik’s case to support its case of conspiracy. In Showik’s case, HC had said he appeared to be an important link in the chain of drug dealers. He had monetary transactions with dealers , HC had said, and observed it was not desirable to release him on bail at that stage. The HC, while granting Rhea bail, had said when there are reasonable grounds to believe the accused is not guilty of such offence, s/he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. The sessions court said there is a chance of Khan tampering with evidence. It also accepted Singh’s contention that rigours of the anti-bail Section 37 (used usually when commercial quantities are seized) of NDPS Act would apply since commercial quantity was recovered from another co-accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-aryan-was-aware-of-drug-carried-by-arbaaz-says-court/articleshow/87170223.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Class 12 student’s app to help sanitise govt offices for free||HYDERABAD: A class 12 student has developed an app called ‘Covid Warriors’ that would help sanitise and disinfect government workplaces and public organisations, free of cost. Student of Delhi Public School (DPS), Nacharam, Aryan Singh Saluja said he was inspired to help disinfect government workplaces such as police and fire stations and GHMC offices which are frequented by many every day. “During the pandemic, I have seen many people go out of their way to help others. Among them were the frontline public organisation workers. That is when I decided that I wanted to extend help to them by coming up with an app that would facilitate free sanitisation of their premises,” said Saluja. The app can be downloaded from the playstore after which a user can register an account, select the organisation and then place a request for sanitisation of the premises. “A trained personnel will be assigned to fulfil the request in 24 to 48 hours. A one-week gap is required for concerned government office or building to place a request for disinfection of the premises once again,” said Saluja. Saluja has tied up with B-Safe Brand of Water Tech Engineers to implement this initiative. Karkhana police station was sanitised using the app developed by Saluja in September. “As there is a need to serve the public in Covid-19 pandemic, the social service taken up by him is highly appreciable,” said B Ravinder, station house officer of Karkhana police station in a letter issued to the student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/class-12-students-app-to-helpsanitise-govt-offices-for-free/articleshow/87172117.cms||---
---||Delhi||Docs remove 13.8kg tumour from man’s chest||New Delhi: Doctors at a private hospital claimed to have removed the world’s largest tumour, weighing 13.85kg, from the chest of a 25-year-old man on Thursday. According to the available medical literature and published papers, the largest chest tumour removed till date prior to this case was in Gujarat in 2015 weighing 9.5kg, they claimed. Speaking about the surgery, Dr Udgeath Dhir, director and head, CTVS, Fortis Hospital, Gurgaon, said, “The tumour, owing to its vast size, couldn’t be removed through minimal invasive surgery. We had to open both sides of the chest and cut the chest bone in between to take it out, which took us nearly four hours.” Throughout the procedure, maintaining adequate blood flow was critical, he added. “This was a high-risk surgery due to the bulk of the tumour, which had occupied the entire chest, making it difficult to operate on multiple vessels as the neck of the tumour couldn’t be controlled and its capsule cannot be breached,” Dr Dhir said. The patient, Devesh Sharma, stayed in the ICU for 39 days after the surgery. At present, he is doing well and on bare minimal oxygen support, the doctor said. When Sharma was rushed to the hospital, he was critical. He was experiencing breathlessness and uneasiness in the chest, and was not able to sleep straight due to breathing trouble for the past two-three months. The doctors said the presence of a massive tumour was confirmed during evaluation at another city hospital after he was referred to them. In addition to the criticality of the surgery, the patient had a rare blood group, AB negative, the doctors said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/docs-remove-13-8kg-tumour-from-mans-chest/articleshow/87193375.cms||---

Party MP Sanjay Singh said that a Dalit youth was killed by the police in Agra but he was certain that the Yogi Adityanath government would do nothing against the culprits. “Permission has been cancelled to hold our yatra but there is permission for carrying out all kinds of crime in the state, from rape to loot to murders. We demand a high level enquiry in this matter and strict punishment for the culprits but also know that the Yogi Adityanath government is shielding the accused, as it has been doing with the accused in all the scams that AAP has highlighted over the past few months,” he said. The AAP UP in-charge said that in the past few months, several incidents were reported in which police personnel were directly involved and no action was taken in any of the matters since the policemen investigating the cases were not willing to act against them. “AAP demands that the government provides Rs 1 crore financial assistance to the family of the Dalit who has been killed, a government job for one member of his family and action against all the accused police personnel under section 302 of the IPC. The party is in touch with the family and I will be going with a delegation to meet them as well,” Singh said. Singh added that the inaction by the government in all such cases of crime where the police were involved was similar to its inaction in cases of corruption which had been highlighted by AAP recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-is-scared-so-scrapped-aap-yatra-in-kashi-sanjay/articleshow/87171585.cms||Neha Lalchandani

As part of the state’s plans to transform the state into a hub of religious and spiritual tourism, the government is working towards the construction of new religious sites and also revamping prominent pilgrim spots including Chitrakoot and Vindhyachal, he said. “Pushing for the integrated development of the entire state, the Yogi Adityanath government has worked to equip famous religious sites including Lord Ram’s ‘Taposthali’ in Chitrakoot, Naimisharanya as well as the Shakti Peetha at Vindhyachal with advanced facilities for the convenience of the devotees,” the spokesperson said. He added that the premises of temples have been renovated and redeveloped with proper roads, parking and sanitation facilities. In addition to the ropeway services at Chitrakoot Dham, Vindhyachal, the construction work of a ropeway is also taking place in Barsana, Mathura. Facilities for tourists are also being upgraded and developed in Agra and Fatehpur Sikri under Jain and Sufi circuits. The state government has also constituted the Naimisharanya Teerth Kshetra Vikas Parishad, Chitrakoot Teerth Kshetra Vikas Parishad and Devipatan Teerth Vikas Parishad to improve tourism potential of these sites. “The government’s exercise to classify tourism based on various circuits including the Ramayana circuit, Braj circuit, Mahabharata circuit, Shaktipeeth circuit, Adhyatmik circuit, Jain circuit and Buddhist circuit, is yielding excellent results as it is automatically attracting domestic as well as foreign tourists,” the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kushinagar-airport-a-step-to-promote-religious-tourism/articleshow/87171604.cms||---

---||Pune||MahaRERA extension likely for 10 per cent of ‘lapsed’ projects||PUNE: Around 10% of the 3,371 projects termed “expired” by MahaRERA may get extension two weeks after the real estate regulatory authority issued orders for regulating the “lapsed projects”. The developers have been told to submit necessary documents for seeking extension that will allow them to carry on with the projects. The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) had put out a list of projects that expired with the promoters not applying for extension and also not uploading Form 4 from the architects on completion of the projects on the website. A new circular issued last month, laying out conditions to regulate these expired projects, has seen developers of 99 projects submitting the documents. On the other hand, 286 projects have been directed to seek an extension. “As many as 99 projects will be deleted in the next two days from the earlier list of 3,371. Others have been told to apply for extension till their date of Occupancy Certificate (OC). The names of the projects will be deleted from the ‘expired’ list only if the builders seek extension,” MahaRERA secretary Vasant Prabhu said. If these developers seek extension, nearly 385 projects will be deleted. This will take the tally of “expired” projects to 2,986. Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association chairperson Ramesh Prabhu told TOI, “This is a good sign because if MahaRERA had not flagged such projects as ‘lapsed’, the promoters would not have taken any initiatives to revive them. This will also help the flat purchasers come together and take a collective effort in completing the project through the promoters. Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai) state president Sunil Furde said, “This is a good move by MahaRERA. Credai-Maharashtra had also requested for the same arrangements.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharera-extension-likely-for-10-of-lapsed-projects/articleshow/87170158.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The red-faced Thane administration made the announcement in the general body on Wednesday, even as it failed to give a conclusive justification for the action. The civic engineers were suspended last month, a day after guardian minister Eknath Shinde had sought action against those responsible for bad roads. The issue was raised by NCP corporator Hanmant Jagdale, who sought justification from the administration following which the netas came out in support of the engineers saying it was unfair to target junior staff while seniors were spared. Additional municipal commissioner-1 Sandeep Malvi told the House that the suspension order was based on a report from the public works department. One of the city engineer, however, refuted the claims and said the affected road stretches weren’t even maintained by the corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/red-faced-tmc-to-reinstate-four-suspended-civic-engineers-in-mumbai/articleshow/87172151.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Lucknow||UP: Samajwadi Party, Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party all set to seal poll alliance||LUCKNOW: Hours after a surprise meeting with Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav, estranged ally of the BJP and president of the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) Om Prakash Rajbhar on Wednesday announced that his outfit was set to enter into an alliance with the SP. Rajbhar did not rule out the possibility of Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) joining the alliance as well. He said a formal announcement on the alliance would be made at a mahapanchayat, a mega rally of smaller parties fighting for the rights of the poor and the deprived, which will be held in Mau on October 27. The announcement came at a hurriedly convened press conference barely a couple of hours after an hour-long meeting between Akhilesh Yadav and Rajbhar. Underlining his commitment towards the alliance, Rajbhar announced that there was no question of going with the BJP. Responding to a media query about his plans if the efforts to finalise the seat-sharing formula with the SP fail, Rajbhar said: “We will stay with the Samajwadi Party even if we don’t get a single seat.” Attacking the BJP, Rajbhar said it was involved in politics of hate and added that traders and youths were suffering due to the government’s policies. He said the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha (BSM), which has Rajbhar’s SBSP and Owaisi’s AIMIM as main constituents, had also approached the BSP and Congress for an alliance. “Our demands include caste-based census, dedicated policies for empowerment of the poor and deprived from all religions and castes, and free power supply for domestic use. Samajwadi Party national president came forward and accepted our demands as legitimate,” Rajbhar, who is also the convenor of the Morcha, said. Asked about the other constituents of BSM, like AIMIM, which are not ready to be a part of the alliance with the SP, Rajbhar said the picture would be clear in the next few days. He said a meeting of the Morcha would be held within a couple of days to set the ball rolling for the Mau Mahapanchayat. On a specific query on the possibility of Owaisi joining him to side with SP, Rajbhar said: “One aspect of the alliance has been finalised. The second part will be chalked out soon.” Senior SP leaders believe that the alliance with SBSP would help it in Purvanchal region. “Voters in east UP had helped BJP perform well in the 2017 assembly polls. They are now feeling betrayed and cheated by the BJP in view of price rise, increasing joblessness and pathetic law and order situation. This time they are waiting to teach the BJP a lesson,” said a senior SP leader. The development has put a question mark on the future of the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha that Rajbhar had formed after joining hands with AIMIM and smaller regional outfits to contest the 2022 assembly elections in UP. Other smaller parties in the Morcha include Bhagidari Party(P), led by Premchandra Prajapati, Bharatiya Vanchit Samaj Party, Bharatiya Manav Samaj Party, Janata Kranti Party (R) and Rashtra Uday Party, among others. Recently Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Ravan had also agreed to join the Morcha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-sbsp-all-set-to-seal-poll-alliance/articleshow/87171630.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Delhi||N corpn finally rolls back hike in licensing fees amid ruckus||New Delhi: North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s House meeting had to be adjourned abruptly on Thursday after the AAP-led opposition demanded clarification from the mayor for not implementing their announcement for giving property tax rebate to properties up to 50 sq metres. AAP councillor Vikas Goel said that they wanted clarity about the civic body’s announcements regarding property tax relief to small houses and rollback of licensing fees hike. “They made the announcements in August to implement them, but nothing changed on the ground. Since both the issues are related to the general public and traders, we sought clarity as soon as the meeting started. Their apathetic attitude forced us to raise voices also. After that, the commissioner, Sanjay Goel, gave clarification about anticipatory approval from the mayor given for the licensing fee hike rollback, but didn’t talk about property tax issue,” he said. Congress councillors also slammed the north corporation for lacking clarity on the issues. On Thursday evening, an order was issued by the additional deputy commissioner, north corporation clarifying that the general trade and factory licence fees hike has been rolled back. The last date for payment of fees has been extended till December 31 and all penalties have been waived. However, for special trade and storage licences, the increased fees will remain effective. Over the property tax rebate, standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said that the decision would be implemented soon. “Some matters related to property tax are pending in the high court. After they are resolved, we will implement the decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-finally-rolls-back-hike-in-licensing-fees-amid-ruckus/articleshow/87193405.cms||Vibha Sharma

Walse-Patil reviewed these proposals at a meeting with home department officials as well as Pimpri Chinchwad police chief Krishna Prakash and other senior police officers in Mumbai. The Pimpri Chinchwad police commissionerate came into existence on August 15, 2018. Several proposals are pending with the government for strengthening the commissionerate. Some police chowkies, attached to various police stations, are functioning as police stations. These chowkies need immediate upgradation as police stations. Similarly, some areas under the police commissionerate have developed recently and these areas need police stations for better crime control and maintenance of law and order. According to police, these police stations would need constables and police officers. Walse-Patil then asked DGP Sanjay Pandey and other officers to table proposals in this regard as soon as possible before the state home ministry. The police need manpower to establish new units of anti-narcotic cell, wireless operations, dog squad and other specialised police units. The home minister has asked the Pimpri Chinchwad police to place detailed proposals in this regard, too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-home-minister-reviews-pending-proposals-of-pimpri-chinchwad-police/articleshow/87170214.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Fresh Covid cases rise to 244 in Kolkata, doctors call for more testing||KOLKATA: Fresh Covid cases in Kolkata rose to 244 and two deaths were reported from the city on Wednesday. The last 10 days, ever since night restrictions were eased, Kolkata have witnessed 1,665 Covid cases and 22 deaths. Health experts pointed out that the number of fresh cases in Kolkata and overall Bengal was bound to rise, given the surge in crowd that took place during the Durga Puja . Hospitals are already seeing a slight rise in the number of patients being admitted to their Covid wards.  “Cases are bound to go up after the festival. Hopefully, it would not be as ferocious as what we witnessed during the second wave. But to gauge the real trend, we need to step up testing. The number of cases will rise if more people go for tests but that should be no deterrent in hiking up test numbers,” said senior physician Sukumar Mukherjee, member at Bengal’s Global advisory board on Covid management. Bengal on Wednesday reported 867 Covid cases and nine deaths. At 129, North 24-Parganas, apart from Kolkata, reported three-digit cases. N 24-Parganas and Kolkata together contributed to over 43% Covid cases of Bengal on Wednesday. Bengal’s positivity rate was 2.4%, with 35,673 samples being tested. IPGMER sugery professor Diptendra Sarkar said how the festival would impact the Covid situation was still uncertain but if people continued to be careless till Diwali, there could be serious consequences. “On one hand, we could be entering the third wave, which would not be as bad as the second wave. On the other, we could be seeing less hospital admission and lesser mortality due to vaccination. The disease may come and go as mild cases,” said Sarkar. Testing had taken a drastic drop during the Puja, when daily cases went down to as low as 443 on October 16, when only 19,018 samples were tested. But three days earlier on October 13, Kolkata Covid cases crossed the 200 mark for the first time since June 19. “Along with increased testing, we also need to accelerate our vaccination drive so that we can cover more people in a short time ahead of future festivals and celebrations,” added Mukherjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fresh-cov-cases-rise-to-244-in-kol-docs-call-for-more-testing/articleshow/87170208.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

He worked there till September and quit the job to stay in his village. During his work, he noticed movement of the cashier and management of cash in the office. He was aware where the keys of the locker were kept. “He told police that he needed money to pay the debt of Rs five lakh that his father had taken for college fees of his sisters. However, we are yet to confirm if he is telling the truth,” said a police officer. Mandloi did not work anywhere sincerely and used to spend whatever he earned.  Mandloi left his village with his brother Nepal on October 10 early hours by bus and reached the city in the evening. After arriving, he went to the spot of crime with a covered face.

This decision was taken in the recent heritage committee meeting held under the chairmanship of G S Sandhu, advisor to the state government. The plan will be prepared on the basis of the guidelines given by UNESCO. The plan will be prepared to bring the heritage form and property back to its original shape. There will be other planning including road width, land use, park, drainage system, sewerage system. Apart from this, a separate detailed plan will be prepared for the development of chaukris. An official said, “A total of 1,500 havelis are marked heritage inside the Walled City. Out of this, the detailed report of about 600 is prepared, but the work of the rest is pending. The deadline for this is also being fixed.” Moreover, separate building bylaws will be prepared for the Walled City and process will be expedited to notify the guidelines. An official said, the world heritage committee outlines six points including, constitution of heritage committee to monitor activities, heritage assessment before every project, preparation of detailed list of heritage structures and buildings, safeguard city from developmental pressures, declaration of area as ‘no construction’ and to prepare Special Area Heritage Plan by 2021. The Walled City was listed as a Unesco site in 2019 with the commitment to preserve its cultural and architectural heritage. However, heritage city continues to crumble despite getting the coveted tag. A senior official at town planning wing said, “We have devised the policies considering all points mentioned by the committee. But implementing agencies are in deep slumber. The Unesco team review was scheduled in December; however, it was postponed due to the pandemic. If encroachment continues, there would be a threat to the Unesco tag, in a similar way like Ahmedabad is facing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/devpt-plan-of-walled-city-to-be-prepared-in-1-mth/articleshow/87170216.cms||---

The companies, Croda India in Navi Mumbai, Deepak Nitrate in Taloja and Pacific Organics in Ambernath, have offered to afforest 25 acres, 125 acres and 12.5 acres, respectively. On Monday, the state revenue and forest department issued individual government resolutions for the three companies granting permission for the afforestation project. This is being done as a corporate social responsibility activity. The scheme was introduced in 2011 but did not get much traction. In 2015, the then forest minister Sudhir Mungatiwar pushed for the scheme which saw a good response. It is now once again being revived. “The most significant aspect of afforestation is installing barbed wire fencing around the land after the saplings are planted so they are not destroyed by grazing cattle. After the seventh year the plants have grown tall enough to be out of the reach of the cattle,” said Sunil Limaye, principal chief conservator, forests. Only native trees are strictly allowed to be planted. Exotic trees are prohibited, he said. The companies will sign a tripartite agreement with the forest department to plant saplings and take care of them for seven years. All expenses will be borne by the firms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-companies-get-okay-to-afforest-163-acres-in-mmr/articleshow/87170229.cms||Clara Lewis

The five-day camp is the largest gathering of RSS workers and top functionaries in Ayodhya since the mobilisation of thousands of Sangh cadre in the peak of Ram temple movement in early 90s. The coming together of RSS veterans in Ayodhya after 30 years assumes significance in the backdrop of Ram temple construction, which has picked up pace to meet the December 2023 deadline for opening the sanctum sanctorum to pilgrims. On the second day of the training camp, top RSS leaders, including Bhagwat, Hosabale, Krishna Gopal, Bhaiyyaji Joshi, physical training chief Sunil Kulkarni, deputy chief Jagdish Prasad, Anil Ok, Ram Laal and Suresh Chandra participated in the session in traditional Sangh attire. After the fitness grind, RSS workers performed a parade. In the second session, Bhagwat and Hosabale exhorted RSS workers to dedicate their lives to the organisation to become a complete swayam sewak. Cadres were told that Sangh training was not limited to physical exercise, but was a combination of ideology, knowledge, karma and bhakti. They took a pledge — I belong to the Sangh and the Sangh is mine. Talking to TOI, an RSS functionary from Bihar said, the training camps provide an action plan, which help recruits become full-fledged swayam sevaks. RSS workers from different provinces of the country are residing at Karsevakpuram, where a grand arrangement for food and lodging has been made. Bhagwat is likely to visit Ramjanmabhoomi and Hanumangarhi on Thursday and hold a meeting with Ram Temple Trust members and the temple construction committee president Nripendra Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bhagwat-steers-rss-biggest-meet-in-ayodhya-in-30-years/articleshow/87171648.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The district collector has also cleared that state government’s decision about easing out restrictions would be implemented as it is. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has already started cleaning its two auditoriums in the city and ensuring the sound system is in place. While theatres with multiple-screens have already geared up for the reopening from Friday, the single screening theatres have decided not to start operations and wait for a few weeks as their association is fighting with the state and Centre to meet their demands. “We have already cleaned our multiplexes and we are set to begin from Friday. We have already recruited staff and all of then have completed their vaccination with a second dose,” said an official from the multiplex having 10 screens at three locations in the city. “We will follow the guidelines set by the government and will reopen our multiplexes with 50% seating capacity. There have been releases of many new films next week and we have already started booking movies. It will be a treat for many during Diwali,” he added. Vinay Chumbhle, president of single screen theatres owners’ association, said they have decided not to start theatres right now. “We already have some issues that are being pursued with the state and central governments. We will wait for a few weeks and then take a call on reopening our theatres,” said Chumbhle. “There is no exit policy and the land is reserved for the theatre only. Hence, we want the government to introduce an exit policy for theatre owners so that we can decide whether to continue with the theatre or build a mall or shopping complex there,” he added. NMC officials said they have three auditoriums in the city — Kalidas Kala Mandir, Dadasaheb Gaikwad and Paluskar — out of which we are in the process of renovating Paluskar auditorium. “We are now set to reopen Kalidas and Gaikwad auditoriums from Friday. We are following all the government guidelines related to reopening,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/multiplexes-theatres-to-open-doors-from-tomorrow/articleshow/87167520.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Kolkata||Twin weather systems causing rain moving away from Kolkata: Met||KOLKATA: After the sky remaining overcast for the past couple of days and the city being lashed by continuous rain—sometimes, heavy spells—the weather might improve in Kolkata and other parts of south Bengal from Thursday, the Met office predicted on Wednesday. The twin weather systems that brought in the showers were gradually moving away, weathermen said. “There will be improvement in weather from Thursday. Though the residual moisture could trigger some sporadic showers, we will no longer get the kind of widespread rain the city and other parts of south Bengal have been witnessing,” said deputy director-general of meteorology (DDGM) Sanjib Bandyopadhyay at Regional Meteorological Centre Kolkata. Two weather systems—a low pressure area that originated from the Bay of Bengal and a cyclonic circulation—had caused multiple spells of rain over the past few days. The showers this time did not lead to any waterlogging or widespread inconvenience in the city but residents were taken aback with the heavy showers and overcast sky so late in October. The leftover moisture continued to cause rain in parts of Kolkata as well as neighbouring South and North 24 Parganas on Wednesday. Met office said the sky might remain partly cloudy on Thursday, but the city would mostly remain dry. The low pressure area has already moved over Bihar and now lies as a cyclonic circulation. “The low-pressure area over Bihar has become less marked. But the associated cyclonic circulation is still there. It is causing heavy rain in north Bengal. We can expect the intensity of rain to come down even in that region from Thursday,” said Bandyopadhyay. While heavy to very heavy rain lashed parts of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Alipuduar and other parts of north Bengal on Wednesday, Met office has issued a heavy rain warning only for one or two places in Alipurduar on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/twin-weather-systems-causing-rain-moving-away-from-city-met/articleshow/87170227.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Lucknow||Priyanka Gandhi Vadra halted briefly from going to Agra||LUCKNOW: Taking on the state government once again, Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra staged a protest in the state capital on Wednesday on being stopped by police from going to Agra. Priyanka, UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu and others were going to meet the family of Arun Valmiki, who had reportedly died in police custody on Tuesday. Reacting to the incident, chief minister Yogi Adityanath told reporters in Kushinagar: “No one will be allowed to play with the law and order in the state.” Valmiki, 30, posted as sweeper at a police station in Agra, was accused of stealing Rs 25 lakh from the maalkhana. Agra police said he fell ill during a raid at his house on Tuesday night and was taken to hospital where doctors declared him ‘brought dead’. Rs 15 lakh in cash were recovered from his house. His family and local leaders blamed police for his death following which Priyanka cancelled all her meetings in Lucknow on Wednesday, which happened to be Valmiki Jayanti, and was proceeding to Agra to meet the grieving family. Video footage of Priyanka’s argument with police officials were posted on social media by party workers. “The moment I try to go somewhere, all this tamasha starts. This is becoming ridiculous,” she said, adding it was her constitutional right to move freely in the country.She asserted she would visit the family come what may and would go the moment she is released. The cops told Priyanka that she had been stopped on the orders of Agra district magistrate urging Lucknow Police to stop political leaders from visiting because of a law and order threat. “Wherever I go... I have to seek permission,” she told the officer who replied, “It is a law and order issue.” “Someone has died. What is the law and order problem here?” she countered. Around 3.45pm, Priyanka, Lallu and Pramod Krishnam were taken to Lucknow Police Lines in Mahanagar. Lucknow police commissioner DK Thakur denied her detention and said, “Priyanka Gandhi was neither detained nor arrested. She was stopped as her cavalcade was obstructing traffic on Lucknow-Agra expressway.” Congress workers gathered at police lines demanding release of Priyanka, who was later given permission to go to Agra with four persons. Priyanka also tweeted demanding a high-level probe in Valmiki’s death. “What is the UP government afraid of? Why am I being stopped?” she wrote, adding PM Narendra Modi may be singing paeans for Mahatma Buddha and on Valmiki Jayanti but ignores their teachings in real life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/priyanka-halted-briefly-from-going-to-agra/articleshow/87171665.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Mayor Satish Kulkarni turned down the proposal after all the corporators across the party line strongly opposed the ban. Kulkarni said the city has been passing through a pandemic phase for the past two years, making people disappointed. “The Covid scenario has improved and Covid-related restrictions have been relaxed in the past two months. Trade and business have already incurred heavy losses because of the pandemic. Hence, the proposal to ban firecrackers during Diwali has been rejected,” he said. The NMC is conducting an auction of firecracker stalls across six divisions from Thursday. Hence, the auction will be held as per the schedule. All party corporators had strongly protested the proposal after it was put for discussion during the GB meeting on Wednesday. The campaign ‘Mazi Vasundhara’ is being implemented by the civic bodies in the state. People burst firecrackers at large during Diwali and it causes air pollution thus affecting the air quality. This year, for Mazi Vasundhara, 100 marks have been given for the civic bodies taking initiatives to ban firecrackers. Divisional commissioner Radhakrishna Game had also sent a letter to the civic body, asking it to pass a resolution for banning firecrackers at the GB meeting. Accordingly, municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav had tabled a proposal in this connection at the GB meeting on Wednesday for its approval. But the proposal was turned down after strong protests||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/gb-rejects-proposal-to-ban-firecrackers/articleshow/87167528.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Dehradun||Will bridge funding gap to strengthen forest department: Uttarakhand HC||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday expanded the scope of a public interest litigation (PIL) dealing with forest fires, saying it will use judicial orders to fill the gap between what the department needs and the wherewithal it gets from the government. The HC was hearing a suo motu PIL dating back to 2018, in which it had earlier passed several orders on dealing with forest fires in Uttarakhand. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma had in its last hearing directed the head of forest force (HOFF), Rajiv Bhartari, to inform the court about the vacancies in the department, its responsibilities and the financial help that the government provides it to carry out these responsibilities. The court, however, was not satisfied with the response as the department’s affidavit contained details only about vacant posts. During the course of the hearing, CJ Chauhan remarked that the department had focused on only one part of its job -- which is to tackle forest fires -- but now the court’s endeavour “through this PIL is to strengthen the department so it can carry out all its responsibilities”. The bench asked Bhartari, through video-conferencing, to give a detailed report about the department’s primary responsibilities, its ancillary responsibilities as well as the budget it ideally requires and the fund allocated by the centre and state to carry out these responsibilities. The bench said that it will try, through its judicial orders, to bridge the gap between the funds it requires and the funds it gets. “You know very well that once the judicial order is passed, both centre and state are bound by that order unless they challenge it before the honourable Supreme Court, which is aware of the ecology and environment. Most of our forests and rivers are being saved because of the landmark judgments of the top court.

The Adarsh Nagar stretch near Oshiwara was the only missing link on this corridor where work had stalled for almost four years because of encroachments. On October 5, the I-girder was launched at Adarsh Nagar junction, ensuring that the missing link has been bridged. The 42-ton, 24m-long girder was erected in 30 minutes. MMRDA will now be able to lay tracks on this stretch. Metropolitan commissioner SVR Srinivas said, “We completed the rehabilitation process of over 40 families in four months and it took 10 days to launch this girder.” The Metro 2A is divided into Phase I and II. MMRDA is plans to open Phase I between Dahanurkarwadi-Dahisar to Aarey Metro station of Metro 7 by January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-track-laying-to-start-on-metro-2a-corridor/articleshow/87170255.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Lucknow||With Covid in check, Uttar Pradesh lifts night curfew||LUCKNOW: Ahead of Diwali, the Yogi Adityanath government on Wednesday lifted the night curfew in the state after over six months. The curfew was imposed in April this year when the second Covid wave was at the peak. Issuing the order, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi, directed district magistrates, divisional commissioners and senior police officials to ensure that even as the night curfew has been lifted in all districts, with the exception of containment zones, Covid-19 protocols must be followed. “According to directions of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, it has been decided to end the night curfew which was in effect from 11pm to 6am,” the order states. A graded night curfew was implemented in various districts in April, depending on the number of active Covid-19 cases there. The night curfew was subsequently converted into an extended continuous curfew across the state which was finally lifted only after second wave started waning. On Wednesday, UP recorded 11 new cases and 17 recoveries which brought the number of active cases down to 112. With this, there are 41 districts where there are no active cases presently while there are 32 districts where active cases are in single digits. “The number of Covid-19 cases has been coming down consistently and it was felt that there was no need for a night curfew at this point. The decision is also significant in light of the approaching festival season. However, it has been decided that in case there is any increase in the number of cases during or immediately after the festival season, suitable curbs will be brought back,” said a senior government official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/with-covid-in-check-up-lifts-night-curfew/articleshow/87171681.cms||---

The NMC administration had proposed increasing the annual licences fees for smaller shops by over six times. The NMC was planning to recover fees in the range of Rs 500 to Rs 2,000, instead of the current rate of Rs 30 to Rs 150. Corporators from all parties criticised the civic administration for proposing such a hike. Mayor Satish Kulkarni turned down the proposal. Moreover, the general body also adjourned the proposal of the civic administration to levy a penalty on those residential properties, which are being used without getting building completion certificates (BCCs) from the civic body. Shiv Sena corporator Sudhakar Badgujar alleged the town planning department was responsible for not giving BCCs to many properties even after the completion of the construction. C B Aher, executive engineer of the town planning department, said there is no problem to give BCCs to buildings built as per the Development Control (DC) rules, but it matters if the construction does not comply. Ajay Boraste, the leader of the opposition, demanded a detailed survey about the buildings without BCCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/gb-rejects-move-to-hike-licence-fees-for-small-biz/articleshow/87167540.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man acquitted as Home Guard not public servant||MUMBAI: Holding that there was no evidence to show that a Home Guard comes under the purview of being a public servant, a sessions court acquitted a 32-year-old man who was arrested for assaulting a Home Guard personnel following an altercation over reprimanding a boy for urinating at Ghatkopar station in 2019. The accused was booked for assaulting or using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty. The court said that after careful perusal of the definition of public servant, it nowhere reveals that the Home Guard is assigned duties by the government of Maharashtra, who work as public servants. “He (alleged victim) is not a public servant as it was duty of the prosecution to prove that a Home Guard is a public servant. No such notification or order of his appointment by the government is filed on record to prove that he is a public servant while discharging his duty,” the court said. The court said that while it was the duty of the investigating officer to file the duty list on record to show that the alleged victim, Swapnil Waghmare, was discharging his duty as a public servant, no pains were taken by police to procure it. “Hence, prosecution has failed to prove that Waghmare was discharging duties as a public servant,” the court said. Out on bail, Chetan Acharekar was accused of intervening when the boy was being reprimanded at 11.45pm on May 29, 2019. Waghmare had said that a woman had complained about the boy urinating. He said that when he caught the boy, the accused asked him why he was doing so. The victim alleged that following an altercation the accused caught hold of his collar and hit him on the chest. He said that the accused caught his neck and dragged him towards the platform. The victim said he shouted loudly and was rescued with the help of colleagues. The court said the prosecution had not examined any other independent witnesses who were present on the platform. It said the prosecution had examined three witnesses, out of which two were police witnesses. The court pointed out that neither was the boy who was caught publicly urinating nor another officer accompanying Waghmare brought forward as witnesses. The court said the version of an alleged eyewitness was untrustworthy. “If there was assault on his (Waghmare) chest, it is bounden duty to file medical certificate, it is not filed in this case. Thus, in this case, the evidence of three witnesses does not cogent, reliable and trustworthy,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-acquitted-as-home-guard-not-public-servant/articleshow/87172159.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 82-year-old made to sleep on dead son’s mat by his widow to get Rs 55,000 payout||MUMBAI: An 82-year-old Mahim woman who was repeatedly taunted by her daughter-in-law for outliving her two sons, given stale food and made to sleep on the unwashed mat on which her son’s body had been kept before his funeral, has been awarded a compensation of Rs 55,000. A magistrate court directed the 43-year-old daughter-in-law to pay the compensation and not subject the octogenarian to mental or physical violence. She was also ordered to not force the senior citizen to vacate the flat. The senior citizen had filed a domestic violence complaint against her daughter-in-law seeking relief in 2019. The senior citizen told the court she was the owner of the Mahim flat and lived there with her son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter. She further said after her son, a fire officer, died, the fire department gave a job to her daughter-in-law on compassionate grounds on the condition that she would look after her daughter and mother-in-law. The daughter-in-law began to harass her though. The senior citizen said the woman would get angry when her daughters visited her. She also alleged her daughter-in-law would ask her why she was not dying despite being old. The woman said she was forced to use a very small space in the flat, was not allowed to use the utensils and given an unwashed bedsheet. She also alleged when she was ill and returning from the hospital, her daughter-in-law left her in the middle of the road due to which she fell and suffered a head injury. The woman said she was not allowed to leave the house and was locked up. She complained to the police in 2018 and subsequently moved to her daughters’ homes at Lower Parel and Bandra. Ruling in the octogenarian’s favour, the court said she deposed as per her application and she filed on record some photographs, medical papers, bank passbook copy and order of the Maharashtra State Commission for Women. Before the commission, the daughter-in-law gave in writing that she would take care of her mother-in-law. “The respondent (daughter-in-law) has a chance to cross-examine the applicant (mother-in-law) but the respondent failed to do it and therefore adverse inference is drawn against her. It means that the respondent is admitting to the contention of the applicant,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-82-yr-old-made-to-sleep-on-dead-sons-mat-by-his-widow-to-get-rs-55k-payout/articleshow/87170274.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The MSEDCL officials from Nashik and Jalgaon zones attended the meeting that was chaired by Vijay Singhal, the MSEDCL chairman and managing director, in Nashik on Tuesday. Singhal stressed on the need to recover the arrears and dues from all the consumers and carry out disconnection drives against non-complying consumers. “The company has to buy power from sources by paying money upfront. If the dues and arrears are not recovered, it would be impossible for the company to pay for the power purchase, which would lead to a shortage of power and affect supply,” Singhal said. Singhal noted that the arrears worth Rs 60,000 crore are due and the company has also taken a loan of Rs 50,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/recovery-of-dues-must-msedcl-cmd/articleshow/87167551.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Four booked on charge of attacking shop owner||PUNE: The Pimpri Chinchwad police on Tuesday launched a search for four youths, who had created ruckus at a liquor shop in Pimpri and attacked its owner with a broken bottle a few days ago. They had also allegedly tried to rob cash from the counter of the store, and further went on to damage three two-wheelers parked nearby. An officer from the Pimpri police told TOI that the liquor store is located under their jurisdiction. On the night of October 15, the four men arrived at the shop to buy liquor. When the manager told them to follow the queue, the suspects abused him. “They had purchased two bottles of liquor and paid Rs 700. However, they started demanding more liquor for free,” the police officer said. The shop owner came out when they started creating ruckus. The officer added, “The manager had told them that he would not give them liquor without payment. Following this, one of them took out a bottle they had purchased and hit the owner it. He also assaulted him again with the broken bottle.” The other suspects picked up the barricades around them and started attacking the owner and employees of the shop. “They even tried to rob cash from the counter. While running away from the spot, the suspects also damaged some parked two-wheelers,” said the police officer. The shop owner, who sustained injuries in the attack, came to the police station on Tuesday after discharge from hospital and filed the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-booked-on-charge-of-attacking-shop-owner/articleshow/87170271.cms||---
---||Pune||Post-vaccination adverse events just 0.007% in Maharashtra, shows data||PUNE: For the 8.52 crore Covid jabs administered in Maharashtra till October 6, adverse events following immunization (AEFI) has been as low as 0.007%, state public health department data reveals. The data shows that 6,656 AEFIs have been reported since the start of the Covid-19 vaccination drive till October 6. Nearly 98% (6,497) of the AEFIs were minor, about 1% (87) were serious and another 1% (72) severe. Deaths, hospitalizations or events causing disability or concern following any vaccination are categorised as serious and severe cases and are first investigated at the district-level. Causality assessments, which help to understand if the event was caused due to the vaccine, are then conducted at the state- and national-level. A senior state health department official told TOI that of the nearly nine crore jabs administered in the state so far, the percentage of AEFIs reported was just 0.008%, which was minuscule. “Districts first compile the AEFI data after which it is vetted by the state and the Centre. Most cases reported from the state have been minor and include post-vaccination side-effects like giddiness, fever, local pain and swelling. Such beneficiaries are usually allowed to go after half-an-hour of observation. A record is maintained, which later helps in tracking the beneficiary in case more side-effects are reported later.” The official said severe and serious AEFIs were those that required hospitalization, where beneficiaries were kept under observation till the resolution of symptoms. “Such reactions are one in a lakh or two lakh vaccinated beneficiaries and, therefore, rare,” the official said. “Every vaccine tends to give a reaction after administration. Hence, all AEFIs are being monitored at various levels,” the official said, adding that many of the AEFIs were psychological, springing out of stress about vaccination. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that serious and severe AEFIs have been less than 1% in Pune so far. “Anxiety-related reactions are resolved immediately, after the beneficiary is reassured. There is no systemic problem in such cases, with the beneficiary’s vital signs such as pulse and blood pressure being normal,” he said. Deshmukh said some type of AEFIs could be vaccine product-related reaction caused by one or more of the inherent properties of its product, such as the adjuvant, preservative or stabilizer. “This can be mild, moderate, severe or serious. Serious reactions such as anaphylaxis can be life threatening, while severe reactions could include paraplegia and limb disorder. Moderate reactions are resolved within a few days,” he said. “AEFI kits have been provided to all vaccination centres. In case of a beneficiary going into anaphylactic shock, adrenaline is administered intramuscularly to counter anaphylaxis,” he said. Dr Om Srivastav, infectious diseases expert and member of the state’s Covid task force, said, “It would take more than a couple of hundred multi-centre studies with robust AEFI data to accurately estimate the more serious side-effects of the vaccines currently in use. If, indeed, these side-effects can be attributed to vaccines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/post-vax-adverse-events-just-0-007-in-state-shows-data/articleshow/87170278.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Kolkata||Hospitals in Kolkata look for ways to dispense Covaxin stock before November expiry||KOLKATA: As demand for vaccines at private hospitals in Kolkata go down, the authorities are concerned about the remaining stock of vials, especially those of Covaxin, as the Bharat Biotech-manufactured vaccine has a shelf life of six months. With Covaxin vials at most hospitals set to expire by November, hospitals have started scouting for ways to dispense them. Covishield has a shelf life of one year. AMRI Hospital, for example, is looking for tie-ups in the districts so that its stock of about 4,500 doses does not go waste. The hospital, along with charitable organisations, had tried to hold special camps in Kolkata but they hardly found any taker. “We have about 4,500 Covaxin doses and we are ready to administer them free of cost so that all the vials are used before expiry. We are looking for tie-ups in the districts and hold free camps after taking government approval,” said AMRI Hospitals group CEO Rupak Barua. Many hospitals said since they were getting fewer than 10 Covaxin recipients a day, half-used vials were being wasted, as each ampoule catered to 10. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences will hold two camps on October 27 and 28, where around 700 Covaxin doses left will be used. “We hope to administer 65 vials at the two camps and will set aside five vials for second doses till November-end,” said R Ventakesh, regional director, Narayana Health. MD and CEO of Woodlands Hospital Rupali Basu said the hospital was left with 9,000 Covaxin doses. “We are administering Covaxin from 1pm to 3pm every day, including on holidays, at our centre on Alipore Road. We are trying to hold drives outside hospital as well. The stock will expire in November-end,” she said. “Given WHO’s stand on Covaxin still pending, its demand is low. We have about 700 Covaxin doses that we need to consume by November-end but we are getting only five-six recipients a day,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. The likes of Medica, which has between 300-400 Covaxin doses, hope to use them before expiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosps-look-for-ways-to-dispense-covaxin-stock-before-nov-expiry/articleshow/87170277.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Nashik||Colleges reopen, but attendance low; online lectures continue||NASHIK/KOLHAPUR: Many colleges resumed the offline classes on Wednesday, though the online lectures are continuing for those who cannot come to the campuses. As it is mandatory for students returning to the campuses to have taken both doses of the vaccine, the attendance was on the lower side. Moreover, many students want to return to offline classes only after Diwali. In Nashik, some of the colleges have set up vaccination facilities for the students who are yet to be inoculated, while others are coordinating with the local civic bodies and health agencies for vaccine camps. “We have made all arrangements, including getting thermal guns; ensuring that only fully vaccinated students are allowed in; and setting up a health centre,” said VN Suryawanshi, the principal of HPT and BYK college. There was some confusion among students who are yet to turn 18, as the colleges — as per government instructions — are not to allow students who have not got both the vaccine doses. “I and two of my friends were restricted from entering the college because we are still not eligible for the vaccines as we are not 18 years old yet. Some of our friends who had taken one dose too were not allowed,” said Rahi (name changed), a student of a college in Nashik city. Prof VB Gaikwad, member management council, Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), who is also the principal of KTHM college, however, stated that the children under 18 have no restrictions. We have directed our staff to ensure no such student is stopped.” Gaikwad added that a vaccination centre has been set up on the campus, and eligible students can approach the administration to get the jab. Some students, were more eager to spend time with friends. “I will spend time with my friends now. We will start attending the classes after Diwali,” said Ramesh (name changed), a student. Rajesh Deore from Satana, said: “It would be waste of money to rent a room in the city for few days. It is better to return after the Diwali vacation for offline classes.” In the Kolhapur district, the colleges resumed for the final-year students, but attendance was low. The final-year students who did turn up were seen taking selfies and catching up with their friends. Chaitanya Salokhe, an engineering student, said, “It was good to be back in the classroom and meet friends. Although we had been in touch digitally, the feeling of sitting in the classroom together is something else.” Manjusha Patil, a student of Shivaji University, said, “Vaccine for the 18-30 age group had started late and many students have not got both the doses. The administration should allow entry to students who have taken at least one dose.” T K Sargar, vice-principal of the New College , said, “The college has reopened. As the count of fully vaccinated students is low, attendance was low too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/colleges-reopen-but-attendance-low-online-lectures-continue/articleshow/87167571.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Kolkata||Mosquito breeding ground at Tangra complex sparks malaria, dengue scare||Kolkata: A civic team’s inspection of a condominium in Tangra on Tuesday led to widespread concerns in the belt after larvae of Aedes aegypti and and anopheles, the mosquitoes that cause dengue and malaria respectively, were found on the premises. The complex houses 700 apartments. The KMC’s vector control team had intensified its drive since August after a sharp rise in malaria and dengue cases, said a civic health official. In September, over 400 dengue cases were reported from five boroughs. By early October, malaria cases crossed 2,000. According to a KMC health official, the reason the civic team zeroed in on the Tangra complex on DC Dey Road was its location. “A number of dengue and malaria cases were being reported from Entally, Tangra, Beliaghata and Park Circus. As Tangra always report a high number of dengue and malaria cases, we decided to check possible mosquito breeding sites in the complex,” he said. After the civic vector control team found mosquito breeding sites on the premises, the complex’s facility manager was told to keep a constant vigil so that water did not accumulate and to spray larvicide. “Had we not conducted the drive, an outbreak was inevitable in the belt,” said a health official. Baishali Sinha, a teacher who lives in the complex, said residents paid a high maintenance charge of Rs 3.4 per sqft, but the project was poorly looked after. Ravi Saraf, who bought an apartment there due to its location, is apparently regretting his decision. “Poor maintenance has become a headache. If there is an outbreak, it will be a disaster,” he said. Kaustav Das, in charge of maintenance at the complex, acknowledged there had been water accumulation due to rain during Puja and over the past few days. “Wherever there is water accumulation, we are cleaning the area. Also, larvicide is being sprayed from Wednesday to ensure mosquitoes don’t breed here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mosquito-breeding-ground-at-tangra-complex-sparks-malaria-dengue-scare/articleshow/87170296.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Officials said that the new policy will allow food trucks around 50 locations. Once the policy is out, the BMC will invite tenders and pick bidders to run the food trucks. Some of the food trucks will be given by the BMC to women self-help groups, but most of them will be allotted to the highest bidders. While the BMC will continue its stay on the distribution of food trucks by corporators, the BMC is yet to take a call on taking back the food trucks already distributed by Sena corporators in Byculla. “A detailed food truck policy will be rolled out. It will be selling cooked food and not vegetables and fruits,” a civic official said, adding that all food trucks will require an NOC from the traffic police and the transport department. With the Shiv Sena miffed at the BMC’s circular to stop the distribution of food trucks, Chahal had called for a meeting to discuss and formulate a food truck policy. Last week, in a setback for many Shiv Sena corporators, the BMC had stayed the distribution of food trucks as freebies by corporators ahead of next year’s BMC election. The BJP has asked Chahal to seize the food trucks already distributed by the BMC. In a letter to Chahal, BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said 30 trucks were already running in Byculla and were distributed by Sena corporators. Sena corporator Yashwant Jadhav said: “While opposing Shiv Sena, BJP leaders are hurting people’s lives. Ten families of self-help group women live off a food truck.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-civic-chief-discusses-policy-for-food-trucks-amid-freebie-row/articleshow/87170313.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The victim filed a complaint with the ACB unit in Ajmer. The ACB team verified that fact. They discovered that there was a state government scheme that provided Rs 3 lakh aid and free treatment to silicosis patients. The victim wanted a certificate from a government hospital to avail the scheme. The complainant alleged that Dungar Singh alias Kushal Singh, owner of an e-mitra kiosk at Dewata Chouraha of Jawaja, demanded Rs 1.3 lakh for preparing the certificate and providing the aid of Rs 3 lakh. On Wednesday, the complainant went to pay Rs 15,000 to Singh at his e-mitra kiosk, wherein private broker Chunni Singh, resident of Suradiya village was also present. The ACB arrested both the accused for accepting bribe from the complainant. The ACB is now looking for the network that managed to prepare health certificates from government hospitals and released the funds. Police seized all records of the kiosk and began investigating. An official said the Beawar region had a lot of silicosis patients because of the silica dust in mining areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/e-mitra-kiosk-owner-caught-taking-bribe-for-silicosis-certificate/articleshow/87170284.cms||---

Municipal commissioner Bhalchandra Gosavi said, “We conducted meetings with the local community leaders and elected representatives and sought their help in the vaccination programme. They have supported it very well.” “We even administered the vaccine to some people in the public as a result of which citizens are now looking forward for getting vaccinated. The numbers of the doses are thus on the rise,” he said. The local corporators are also batting for the vaccination programme. “Since Saudi Arabia government has permitted for the conduct of Hajj and Umrah for fully-vaccinated people only, those wishing to go on pilgrimage will definitely get vaccinated. Seeing them, others will also follow,” said Mustaqeem Dignity, one of the corporators. He added that vaccination was picking up in the eastern parts of Malegaon after the leaders made appeals. Malegaon East has 1.63 lakh people eligible for vaccination and so far, only 40,000 have been vaccinated. “Majority of the daily doses in the past were from Malegaon West region.

---||Lucknow||Bid to make network of 200 airports operational: PM Narendra Modi||KUSHINAGAR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday inaugurated UP’s ninth airport, which is the state’s third international airport, in Kushinagar. The airport will soon start direct flight service to New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. Speaking on the occasion, the PM said that his government was trying to build a network of over 200 airports, heliports and waterports for seaplanes over the next three-four years. Built at the cost of Rs 260 crore with the state's longest runway of 3,200 meters, the Kushinagar airport received its first flight from Sri Lanka with over 100 delegation, including Buddhist monks and pilgrims. Speaking on the occasion, the PM said, “India has been the spiritual and inspiration center for followers of Buddhism. The facility of Kushinagar international airport is a way of showing respect for their devotion. This land of Gautam Buddha is now directly connected to the world and landing of a Sri Lankan airline at the airport is like greeting it.” “Fortunately, today is Maharishi Valmiki Jayanti as well and by his inspiration, with the efforts of all, the country is working for the welfare of all. This international airport is the result of decades of expectations and wishes. As a curious spiritual person and representative of Purvanchal, there is a satisfaction within me for fulfilling the commitment,” said Modi. Sri Lankan sports minister Namal Rajapaksa, who led the Sri Lankan delegation, said: "It is a great gesture of PM Modi to especially invite Sri Lankan airlines to be the first international carrier to land at Kushinagar International Airport." The PM said that special attention was being given to develop the Buddhist circuit. "Development of Kushinagar is among the priorities of the state and Central government. Places related to Buddha like Sarnath, Shravasti, Bodh Gaya, Lumbini, Vaishali, Rajgir and Sankisa are a few hours away from Kushinagar. Therefore, apart from Indian followers of Buddhsim, this area is going to be important for people of Sri Lanka, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia and other countries for spirituality and tourism,” he said while addressing from airport premises. “The Kushinagar airport will help develop a business-oriented eco system. Tourism, travel business such as taxi, hotels and others will benefit and will further create job opportunities for youth. Soon, the airport will be directly connected with New Delhi,” Modi said. “With Kushinagar, now the state has nine airports, including three internationals while work on Jewar international airport is under way. Apart from these, airports are also being developed in Ayodhya, Aligarh, Azamgarh, Chitrakoot, Moradabad and Shravasti. This will strengthen the state's air connectivity,” said the PM. "In the past few years, the country has emphasized on air connectivity in those distant remote locations, where no one had even imagined. In the last four-years under the Udan Yojana, 900 new routes have been approved out of which 350 routes are operational. More than 50 defunct airports have been made operational. In the next four years, we will try to develop over 200 airports, heliport and seaplane water networks in the country," Modi said. Emphasizing on civil use of defence-run airports, PM Modi said, "At five airports eight new pilot training academies are going to be set up. Rules for training at airports have been made easy. Further, an ecosystem is being developed for drone manufacturing, operating in the country for purposes like agriculture, health, disaster management and defence.” Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said that direct flights between Delhi and Kushinagar will be operational by November 26, while from December 18 direct flights will also operate for Mumbai and Kolkata. “In all, 17 airports will be operational in the newly emerging Uttar Pradesh,” he added. "Since independence, there were 64 airports in the country, but in the past seven years of the Modi regime, the country has added 54 new airports, taking the total to 118," Scindia said. Reiterating the same, CM Yogi Adityanath said, “In UP, 11 more airports are being developed including two international airports are being developed including at Ayodhya and Jewar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/efforts-on-to-make-network-of-200-airports-operational-pm/articleshow/87171724.cms||Arvind Chauhan

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Two thieves tunnel their way into 5-star hotel for statue of Roman warrior||MUMBAI: Two young men who dug a tunnel under the wall of a five-star hotel in Aarey Colony and stole a brass statue were tracked down and arrested by the police recently. The 300-kg statue of a Roman warrior is worth Rs 7 lakh and was made in Europe. The duo had dragged it into a forest where they cut it into smaller portions. Police have recovered pieces of the statue from the accused. The theft was reported early on October 12, at the Imperial Palace, a five-star hotel inside the 240 acres Royal Palms Estate at Aarey Colony. The hotel is currently not functional and isn’t well lit at night, police said. Security staffer Sanjay Shetty informed the police that he was on night rounds with his colleagues late on October 11, when he last spotted the statue around 2.30am. The statue is about seven to eight feet tall. An Aarey police team reached the hotel and started probe. But there was no CCTV footage at the location where the statue stood. Police then made inquiries in slum colonies of Aarey and Powai. They also quizzed scrap dealers. A team headed by senior inspector Jyoti Desai and detection officer Ulhas Kolam found some marks of a heavy object being dragged outside the hotel wall. They soon found a small tunnel that had been dug under the hotel wall and leading into the jungle at the other end. The investigators believe the thieves had dragged the heavy statue into the forest and used saws and other tools to cut it into over a dozen parts. Based on a tip-off from informants, police picked up Ismail Shaikh, 20, and Jalil Shaikh, 19, on Sunday. Ismail told officers that he worked as a make-up artist. A search at their homes revealed a stolen air-conditioner and fridge. The duo had stolen these consumer appliances from a villa at Royal Palms Estate. They had hidden pieces of the brass statue in the forest and were planning to sell it off for about Rs 2 lakh in scrap. Police suspect the duo could be linked to a gang from Powai. The tunnel has been sealed off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-thieves-tunnel-their-way-into-5-star-hotel-for-statue-of-roman-warrior/articleshow/87172194.cms||---
---||Lucknow||In Uttar Pradesh, mafia begging for mercy, ‘mafiawadis’ are pained: PM Narendra Modi||KUSHINAGAR: With assembly elections just a few months away, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a scathing on the previous Samajwadi Party government saying “’maafiawadi’ are pained over the steps taken by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath against mafia, who are now seeking mercy”. “The previous government associated itself with scams and crimes. People of UP know that their (previous regime) identity is not of ‘samajwadi’ (socialist) but of ‘parivarwadi’ (dynasts. These people only did the welfare of their own family and forgot about UP and the masses,” he said. “In Yogi’s regime, the mafia is now begging for mercy. Earlier, they enjoyed patronage for ‘khuli chhoot, khuli loot’ (free hand for open loot). But Yogi’s firm steps have pained ‘maafiawadis’ the most. They are in fear,” said the PM, adding that when rule of law prevails, the benefits of government schemes easily reach the poor. Addressing a large crowd of farmers at Barwa ground in Kushinagar on Wednesday, the PM also quoted the SP’s idealogue Ram Manohar Lohia to take a jibe at the earlier regime. “Ram Manohar Lohia used to say ‘connect karma with compassion’, but those who were running the government earlier did not care about the pain of the poor.” After alighting from an Indian Airforce MI-17 helicopter at Barwa, Modi attempted to connect with local Bhojpuri speaking farmers in their dialect and laid the foundation stone of state-run medical college of Kushinagar. He also inaugurated 12 development projects worth Rs 180 crore and laid the foundation stones of several others. “With the medical college in Kushinagar, local youth aspiring to become doctors can fulfill their dreams here only. The college would provide quality medical infrastructure as well. Under national education policy, the possibility of getting technical education in one’s own language is becoming a reality.” He said, “The double engine government of center and state is setting new records in procurement from farmers. So far, about Rs 80,000 crore has reached the bank accounts of the farmers of UP for the purchase of the produce. More than Rs 37,000 crore has been deposited in the bank accounts of UP farmers from PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, while the Yogi government has paid Rs 1.5 lakh crore to sugarcane farmers.” The PM said that the central government had started the PM Swamitva scheme which is going to open new doors of prosperity in the rural areas of UP in future. Under PM Swamitva Yojana, the work of giving the ownership documents of the houses of the village that is the ownership of the houses has been started. Emphasizing on basic amenities for the poor, Modi said, “The courage to dream big and the spirit to fulfil the dreams are born when basic amenities are provided to the poor. The confidence of the poor increases when they get a pucca house, when there is a toilet in the house, electricity connection, gas connection, water comes from the tap. Toilets and gas stoves create a sense of safety of dignity among women.” PM Modi said, “ Uttar Pradesh is the state which has given the maximum number of Prime Ministers to the country. This is the specialty of UP, however, the identity of state cannot be limited only to this. UP cannot be confined to six-seven decades. This is a land whose history is timeless, whose contribution is timeless. Lord Rama, Lord Krishna were born in this land; out of 24 Jain Tirthankaras 18 came from Uttar Pradesh. Tulsidas, Kabirdas and Sant Ravidas were also born on this soil.” “The Sikh Guru tradition also has a deep connection with Uttar Pradesh. The ‘Guru Ka Taal’ Gurdwara in Agra is still a witness to the glory of Guru Tegh Bahadur ji, his bravery where he challenged Aurangzeb,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-yogi-regime-mafia-begging-for-mercy-mafiawadis-are-pained-modi/articleshow/87171738.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt seeks to redevelop slums on Juhu airport||MUMBAI: The state government wants to redevelop the slums on Juhu airport. “We want to propose to the union aviation minister that in return for giving us 50% of the airport land which is not required for aeronautical operations, we will give the Airports Authority of India (AAI) the other 50% of the land free of slums,” said housing minister Jitendra Awhad on Wednesday. The proposal comes even as the state government in 2018 cancelled the reservation for an affordable housing scheme and restored the reservation for airport in the city’s Development Plan 2034. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday held a review of slum rehabilitation schemes in the city. The issue of rehabilitating slums on 8,334 acres of central government land in the city was also discussed. In May 2016, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) had sought permission to carry out biometric survey on airport land. In two separate letters to the chief executive officer, SRA, the AAI consented for “doing a feasibility study on ex-situ rehabilitation of existing slum dwellers at Juhu airport.” The AAI has been opposed to in-situ rehabilitation as “habitation in the vicinity of airport operation area impacts safety and security.” It has always maintained that ex-situ rehabilitation is the only way to overcome these important operation concerns pointing out that obstruction free land in and around the airport is an absolute necessity for safe and secure aircraft and helicopter operations which cannot be compromised. Awhad said he would be meeting the aviation minister with regard to slum rehabilitation as the ministry had already granted in-principle approval for the rehabilitation of slums on the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International airport land. The housing minister said the Cuffe Parade slum will now be jointly redeveloped by MHADA and SRA. “M/s Shapoorji and Pallonji who were to carry out the redevelopment have been served a termination notice,” said Awhad. The government will also soon announce an amnesty scheme to restart 256 stalled schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-seeks-to-redevelop-slums-on-juhu-airport/articleshow/87170361.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Team of experts monitors Jal Jeevan Mission in Barmer||JAISALMER: A 10-member team of experts on National Jal Jeevan Mission visited villages and hamlets in Gadra Road block and Ramsar area in Barmer district on Wednesday. The team of late is on a visit to six districts of Rajasthan, namely Baran, Dausa, Jodhpur, Barmer, Bhilwara and Jaipur. The team plans to visit villages in these districts between October 18 and 21, to discuss various points of implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission with the locals, gram panchayats, water committee members and district officers. The members, for the last three days, took stock of the situation in many villages and hamlets in Barmer district.

The civic standing committee on Wednesday cleared a proposal to give cash compensation based on market rates to not just the tenants on BMC land who are hit by projects but also affected slum dwellers. A senior civic official said as part of the cash compensation scheme, project-affected persons (PAPs) living in structures built before 1964, known as tolerated structures, will be given compensation based on market rates. “This will be 1.2 times the ready reckoner rates of the area. For slums, it will be 0.75 times the ready reckoner rates or Rs 50 lakh, whichever is higher. But this scheme will only be applicable if the projects are categorised as extremely essential,” the official said. The BMC does not have enough tenements to house PAPs and has decided to pay them instead. It will need to house around 50,000 PAPs over the next two years. SP MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh said this will incentivise construction of illegal slums. — Chaitanya Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-clears-cash-payout-for-its-project-hit-tenants-even-slums/articleshow/87170373.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Delhi||Why BA programme is in demand at Delhi University||NEW DELHI: Various combinations of BA programme offered by Delhi University (DU) colleges saw a huge demand among applicants seeking admissions this year. While some of the combinations closed at several colleges after the first cutoff list itself, some seats became available at a few others in the subsequent lists. Lady Shri Ram College for Women, which had pegged the cutoff for BA programme with computer applications and economics at 97.25% in the first list, didn’t have any general-category seat left for this combination under the second list. The third cutoff list declared by the college showed all seats across the categories had been taken. Similarly, at Aryabhatta College, the most number of admissions under the third list took place for the history and political science combination of BA programme. According to admissions convener R K Dwivedi, 74 admissions were completed till Wednesday. Principals of several colleges said the reason behind the rush for the programme could be attributed to multiple factors, including soaring cutoffs for mainstream subjects. Promila Kumar, principal of Gargi College, said, “In the first list, the cutoffs for many subjects were very high. So students who wanted to ensure a seat ended up taking admissions for various BA programme combinations. In our college, the English-German combination closed after the first list. However, it opened again in the third list as students started shifting to other courses once the cutoffs dipped a bit.” Further, Kumar explained, “The disadvantage of these courses is that there is no in-depth knowledge in a particular subject. But the advantage is that students will be eligible to apply for masters in either of the subjects. For example, a student pursuing the history-political science combination can apply for both courses for their postgraduation. Often students find it better to keep multiple options open.” Many others also attributed BA programme’s rising popularity to the civil services examinations. “Many students find the integrated programmes interesting as they do not have to stick to one subject. It is also getting a lot of importance because of the UPSC examinationss,” Bijaylaxmi Nanda, acting principal of Miranda House, said. “At Miranda House, most of the UPSC aspirants are those pursuing BA programme. In the recent past, several students from the department have also cleared the civil services successfully,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-ba-programme-is-in-demand-at-du/articleshow/87170378.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

NCP activists staged a protest demanding status report on complaints filed against four BJP leaders—Union minister Narayan Rane, former home minister for state Kripa Shankar Singh, and former state ministers Vijaykumar Gavit and Babanrao Pachpute. Rane and Singh were earlier in Congress, while Gavit and Pachpute were in the NCP. The local police took the NCP protesters in custody and released them after recording the details.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: OTS plan rolls out for power defaulters||LUCKNOW: Months ahead of assembly elections, the UP government on Wednesday announced a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme for power defaulters, entailing up to 100% waiver on surcharge and a window to pay arrears in easy instalments. The scheme will be applicable between October 21 (Thursday) and November 30. State power minister Srikant Sharma said, the scheme would help farmers and small consumers with an electricity load of up to 2 KW. Consumers will be given a chance to pay pending arrears in six instalments and those with power load between 2KW and 5 KW will be given a 50% waiver on surcharge. The scheme will also be applicable to consumers whose power supply has been permanently snapped or those embroiled in legal disputes. The sop, sources said, is ostensibly aimed to provide relief to small commercial establishments, who were financially affected after economic activity slumped in the aftermath of the pandemic-triggered lockdown. The move comes days after chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed authorities not to snap power supply to farmers defaulting on payment of electricity bills. During a recent review meeting, Yogi is learnt to have been apprised by some BJP MPs and MLAs on problems faced by farmers and rural consumers in wake of power outages, mainly because of poor distribution network. The sop attains significance, especially in agriculturally rich and politically restive west UP, which has been witnessing farmers’ stir against the new farm laws. The move is also seen as a counter to Samajwadi Party and Aam Aadmi Party promise of providing cheap or even free electricity if voted to power. As per UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL), a consumer can avail benefits of the scheme online at the office of respective executive engineers or sub-divisional officers. In rural areas, consumers will receive the service at Common Service Centres (CSC), established by ministry of electronics and IT. The facility will also be available at UP energy website, www.upenergy.in. UPPCL chairman M Devraj said, officials of all distribution companies have been instructed to launch special campaigns, drives and hold camps to ensure maximum number of consumers receive benefits of the scheme. He said discoms will review the progress on a daily basis. Plea to scrap duty for year for non-defaulters Praising chief minister Yogi Adityanath and energy minister Srikant Sharma for implementing OTS scheme, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhogta Parishad reiterated its demand for waiving one-year electricity duty for consumers, who pay bills on time. The cess is 5 to 7.5% of the bill, depending on category of consumers and is charged by the state government. Parishad chairman, AK Verma said, the measure will send a "good message and boost the morale" of consumers who have never defaulted on payment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-announces-ots-scheme-for-power-defaulters-with-100-surcharge-waiver/articleshow/87171742.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Mumbai||Mumbai airport handles 92,000 passengers on Super Sunday||MUMBAI: Mumbai airport handled close to 92,000 passengers in a day last Sunday, making it a pandemic record of sorts. Country-wide too, it was a Super Sunday, with domestic airlines flying a record 3. 27 lakh passengers, the highest volume of flyers flown in a day since lockdown last year. “After nearly one-and-a-half years, since commencement of the pandemic in 2020, Mumbai airport witnessed a record 91,904 passengers on October 17, which is the highest movement since March 23, 2020,’’ said a Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) spokesperson. Mumbai airport terminal 2 handled 75,944 passengers on 494 flights, including 415 domestic ones; while terminal-1 in Vile Parle handled 15,960 passengers on 114 domestic flights. Data shared by ministry of civil aviation shows that domestic flights are fast growing and so are passenger loads on these flights, especially on Sundays. Passenger volumes had peaked on previous Sundays of this month as well, not merely in Mumbai but across India as well. For instance, on October 10, a Sunday, 3.09 lakh domestic passengers boarded flights across India, while only 3.04 lakh flew the previous day, a Saturday, and only 2.65 lakh flew on October 11, a Monday. Similarly, passenger traffic peaked on Sunday, October 3 as well as compared to other days of that week and weekend. “We expect heavy passenger volumes on weekends right up to the year-end as leisure travel has picked up,’’ said an official with a low-cost carrier. Another pandemic milestone came this week in the form of air traffic volume. On Monday, October 18, airlines operated 2,400 domestic flights, the most to be operated in 24 hours, post-May 2020. With this, domestic air traffic is now on par with that of March this year, when airlines had handled close to 2,400 flights per day, only to find demand for air travel drop thereafter due to the Covid second wave. “In the coming weeks, numbers will take off, especially during the Diwali weekend, as restrictions on capacity deployment have been removed. Airlines can now operate to their fully capacity and touch pre-Covid numbers,’’ said the airline official. Airfares for Diwali weekend too have started climbing, with the cheapest return fare starting at Rs10,000 for travel from Mumbai to places like Delhi and Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-airport-handles-92k-passengers-on-super-sunday/articleshow/87170391.cms||Manju V

Appearing before a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar, Senior Advocate Aparajita Singh pleaded that the court should order a medical examination of Shivpriya but the bench said it was not a case of medical emergency. The bench, however, asked the trial court to decide his regular bail plea within a month. “We decline to interfere in this special leave petition as it is not a case of medical emergency as such. For, the prayer for bail on medical ground has been pursued unsuccessfully since September, 2020.....In the circumstances, while dismissing this special leave petition, we direct the special judge, PMLA, sessions judge, Lucknow to decide the regular bail application filed by the petitioner which is still pending, expeditiously, and not later than one month from the date of receipt of the copy of this order,” the bench said. Shivpriya moved the top court challenging the Allahabad High Court order dismissing his bail plea on August 4. He was arrested along with Amrapali Group CMD Anil Kumar Sharma on the direction of the apex court which took over the group in 2019 for duping thousands of homebuyers by siphoning off their money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-denies-bail-to-ex-director-of-amrapali-on-health-grounds/articleshow/87170430.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Diesel prices fuel strike plan in coal PSUs||Nagpur: Just out of the coal shortage crisis, Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) and other mining PSUs under Coal India Limited (CIL) have been now threatened by contractors of going on an indefinite strike. The contractors are engaged in overburden excavation, which means clearing of earth till coal is struck. They claim that the steep hike in diesel prices make it no longer viable to continue work under the old terms and conditions of the tenders. A likely strike is expected to take major toll on coal production. The Association of Hiring of Equipment Contractors has served a notice at the WCL chairman-cum-managing director’s office intimating the plan to go on strike from November 1, if its demands are not met. Sources in the association said similar notices have also been sent to other CIL subsidiaries. According to the tender conditions, the escalation clause covers up to 30% hike in diesel prices during the contact tenure, say contractors. However, the diesel rates have gone up by over 70% in a year now, eating into their margins. The problem is worse in WCL due to high stripping ratio as compared to other CIL arms. In other words, more earth has to be dug for reaching coal deposits in the mines in Central India. Explaining the arithmetic, a source said now as the diesel rates have crossed Rs100 a litre, contractors are burning fuel worth Rs50 to remove one cubic metre of earth. As against this, they are getting only Rs28.68. According to the calculations put up by the association, contractors are losing as much as Rs2.13 crore in a day due to the diesel price hikes. A meeting of contractors has been planned on October 25, during which further planning of the strike would be discussed. A meeting with the WCL management has also been planned on the same day. “If there is no respite, we would certainly go ahead with the strike,” said a contractor. Contractors said as much as 80% of overburden removing is done by private parties, whose equipment is hired by the coal PSUs. This is the basic process in mining coal. Due to the geological conditions in Vidarbha, the stripping ratio is rather high. As much as 10 cubic metres of earth has to be removed to get a single cubic metre of coal, they pointed out. “The payment terms are too tough. Half of the dues are cleared when the entire quantity of overburden is removed, finally touching the coal seam. In WCL, the process takes longer due to the high stripping ratio,” explained a contractor. A senior official in WCL confirmed that a notice was received from the contractors’ association and the management will have to discuss the matter with them. Their demands cannot be totally wrong considering the current situation, said the source. Transporters get 19% freight hike after stir The transporters’ strike against cement companies for similar reasons has finally worked. The truckers had stopped lifting the material from cement plant located in Chandrapur as they demanded a hike in freight. “Finally on Wednesday, the industry agreed and a 19% hike was allowed,” said Kukku Marwah, president of Nagpur Truckers’ Unity, an association of transporters. “It would not have been possible for us to operate if the freight was not hiked,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/diesel-prices-fuel-strike-plan-in-coal-psus/articleshow/87169164.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||IIM-Ahmedabad alumnus arrested for sale of fake cancer injection||MUMBAI: Investigators, probing the fake cancer drug case, recently arrested a 38-year-old Hyderabad resident for supplying the fake injections to Pooja Rana, who was arrested earlier in this case. The accused, Raghvendra Reddy, an MBA from IIM Ahmedabad, during interrogation told police that he had imported the cancer drug from Turkey. Reddy, who did his B Tech from an IIT, had supplied the fake cancer medicines to Rana. She ran Prime Pharma from Kalyan. Police said he earlier worked in a London bank for couple of years and later returned to India to start his own business. A police team supervised by Niket Kaushik, economic offences wing head, comprising inspector Nitin Patil, APIs Anil Jaykar, Rohit Sawant, PSIs Rupesh Darekar, Eknath Desai and staff Ganesh Doiphode and Mahesh Naik, had last month arrested Pooja Rana (30) from Kalyan for selling spurious cancer injection and tablets. “During investigation we leant that Reddy had supplied these injections to Rana. We arrested Reddy. He has earlier visited Turkey as well. To start his own business, he came to India from London. Initially, he had formed a pharma firm. As of today, he has three pharma companies. He does not have an export import licence,” said Patil. Patil added that during investigation they learnt that Reddy was in touch with some people from Turkey, Russia, China and Egypt in connection with the pharma business. “He had illegally bought the cancer drugs and sold them in India,” added Patil. Reddy has allegedly destroyed his phone. The cops said they will invoke a section of destruction of evidence under the IPC against Reddy, said the police. At the time of Rana’s arrest, the police had seized seven Adcetris injections, originally valued at Rs 40.6 lakh, and two Iclusig tablets worth Rs 27 lakh. Police found Rana had sold around 30 spurious injections during the past year. The 30 original Adcetris injections, manufactured by a Japanese firm, would cost about Rs 1.7 crore at the rate of Rs 5.8 lakh each. Rana was selling them for Rs 1.1 lakh each. A representative of the Japanese firm in Mumbai lodged an FIR under IPC and Copyright act. Police also seized 24 vials of Tocilizumab injections from Prime Pharma. The drug was running in short supply at one point as it was found to be helping in managing Covid. The food and drug administration has been provided samples for investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iim-a-alumnus-arrested-for-sale-of-fake-cancer-injection/articleshow/87170422.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||Jaipur||Jodhpur: Support pour in for suspended cop||JODHPUR: Support has started pouring in for suspended police officer Leelaram and three others with demands of unconditional withdrawal of their suspension orders. The cops were suspended following pressure from family, relatives and community members of history-sheeter Lovely Kandara who had been killed in a face-off with police last Wednesday. Batchmates of Leelaram, who was a student of Navodaya Vidhyalaya in Jaisalmer, termed his suspension as demoralising for police. Kailash Ujjwal, a former student, said instead of rewarding him for his valorous act of not letting a criminal slip away, he was punished with suspension under the pressure of the supporters of criminals and politicians. Demanding his immediate reappointment, the students said if the government could not reward him, it had has no right to punish him. On the other hand, Meghwal community members have also raised their voice against his suspension terming the decision contrary to the moto of the state police, which says ‘Fear in Criminal, Trust in Common man’. They submitted a memorandum to the district collector in Jaislamer addressed to the chief minister stating that Leelaram discharged his duty risking his life and such a dutiful officer was rewarded by the government with suspension. “This decision would not only demoralise police officers, but would also send a wrong message to the public,” they said in the memorandum. The role of RLP MP Hanuman Beniwal in building pressure on the government to suspend the policemen and supporting the demonstrators has led to a crack in his party. Terming the stand of Beniwal unceremonious, the party’s vice-president, Udaram Meghwal, resigned from his post and also surrendered his party membership. For his support of Leelaram, Meghwal was served a showcause notice by the RLP for going against the party line. It may be noted that a similar campaign has been running on social media with people from different quarters including from the police department terming the suspension as injustice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/support-pour-in-for-suspended-cop/articleshow/87170432.cms||---

Senior advocate Darius Khambata, representing the state government, said to a division bench of Justice Nitin Jamdar and Justice Sarang Kotwal: “In view of subsequent developments, we are not willing to give a statement in this matter.” Khambatta said that according to reports, the former police chief of the city was untraceable. However, senior counsel Jethmalani, who also represents Singh, said that the state has not declared Singh an absconder yet and should continue the statement till further hearing.

If the Ramayana had not been written, who would have known Lord Rama,” he said. “The Ramayana is a legendary tale of dharma and adharma. Just like how it has been told that a ruler’s dharma is to uphold the pride and prestige of his people and to take whatever steps needed to keep them happy, the Ramayana tells us about the dharma of every being,” he said. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia also visited the temple and offered prayers. The Delhi government, the CM said, will celebrate the Pragat Diwas on a grand scale at Thyagaraj Stadium on October 23, where all Delhiites are invited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lets-follow-valmikis-ideals-for-a-better-life-says-kejriwal/articleshow/87170446.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||DU list of eligible candidates under ECA quota released||New Delhi: Delhi University (DU) has released the list of eligible candidates for admissions under the extra-curricular activities (ECA) category. Aspirants seeking admissions to various merit-based undergraduate programmes in the varsity were eligible to apply under the ECA quota. Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the university this year had permitted applicants to submit certificates from the last four years, instead of the usual three years. The list released by DU is based on the evaluation of merit or participation ECA certificates under the various categories and sub-categories, as uploaded by candidates. The university is following a centralised process and no trials will be held this year due to the ongoing pandemic. Based on the certificates uploaded, candidates have been assessed and evaluated out of a maximum of 100 marks, according to officials. “The allotment of programme and college to the candidate on the basis of ECA will be done in a centralised manner by the university through a centralised ECA merit list and based on the preferences of colleges and programmes indicated by the applicant. The allotment will be based on the rank of the applicant in the order of centralised ECA merit list, programme-specific eligibility criteria, the availability of programme and ECA quota or sub-quota in the particular college,” a senior DU official explained. Candidates scoring 20 marks and above only will be eligible for the final merit list of admission under the ECA category, the official added. Admissions under the ECA category will be done across 14 categories, including creative writing, dance, debate, digital media, fine arts, music and theatre. Each category also comprises sub-categories and admissions to the latter will be dependent on the number of seats available in the respective college. Aspirants have time till October 21 to register their grievances, if any, following which the final centralised ECA merit list will be released.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-list-of-eligible-candidates-under-eca-quota-released/articleshow/87170470.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: People, businesses upbeat in run up to Diwali||JAIPUR: After an almost blackout of celebrations last year, a lot of excitement is building up in the run up to Diwali this year. People who could not even clean their houses in 2020 have started buying new things such as furniture and home furnishing products like rugs, bedsheets, cushion covers, etc. Dhirendra Raghav, president of Federation of Trade and Industry said, “For Diwali this year, the consumer sentiment has improved vastly. This Diwali is going to be better than the one in 2019, just before pandemic broke out.” Raghav said, “The city markets are already crowded and the influx of large number of tourists is adding to the festive mood.” Festive buying is also picking up in the real estate segment. Rajendra Singh Pachar, secretary of Credai-Rajasthan said, “The number of enquires have increased. This shows lot of buyers are coming to the market. We expect surge in deals across all categories of properties.” Pachar said there is lot of pent up demand which will give a boost to the real estate industry. Replacements of old household white goods did not happen last year. The traders and dealers of various brands expect a substantial increase in sales. In November, there are a number of wedding dates. Jewellers expect, along with festival demand, wedding-related purchase will push the gold and jewellery sales. With new Covid cases remaining negligible, increased socialization will induce people to buy more clothes and other fashion related items. Traders and showroom owners said the Diwali season is critical to the survival of many businesses. Hope there are no surprises on Covid front.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/people-businesses-upbeat-in-run-up-to-diwali/articleshow/87170481.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Two kids swept away, bridges damaged, landslides batter West Bengal||SILIGURI/KALIMPONG/JALPAIGURI: Heavy rain pounded north Bengal on Wednesday after a low pressure over Bihar intensified into a cyclonic circulation, triggering multiple landslides and a sudden rise in river water level. At least a couple of bridges were damaged and several roads caved in across north Bengal. Two children were swept away by the raging water of the Torsha and hundreds of tourists were left stranded. The Met office has issued a red alert, warning that extremely heavy rainfall will continue in Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Alipurduar even on Thursday. At Jaigaon in Alipurduar, two girls — aged 10 and eight — from the same family were swept away on Wednesday. Cops could not trace their bodies till late on Wednesday. According to Nabanna sources, five deaths have been reported since Monday. Heavy rain has led to damage of multiple bridges. The reinforcement pillars of the Rangpo bridge connecting Bengal with Sikkim were washed away early on Wednesday. The authorities limited movement of heavy vehicles but lighter vehicles were allowed to take the bridge. The Balason Bridge along National Highway 31 at Matigara on the outskirts of Siliguri was damaged as well, leading to cops suspending movement of cars and heavier vehicles on the bridge. Several parts of Kalimpong remained cut off for a major part of the day due to multiple landslides along National Highway-10 between Teesta and Setijhora. Kalimpong DM R Vimala said around 46 landslides took place between Monday and Wednesday as Kalimpong received 335mm of rainfall during this period. The stretch of NH-10 between Algara and Lava was the most affected. Small vehicles were diverted through the Darjeeling district and goods vehicles remained stranded on the National Highway since Tuesday evening. Cops reached out to some 100 odd vehicles carrying tourists from Kolkata and elsewhere trapped on Algarah-Lava Road and provided tea, snacks and water to them while deploying hundreds to repair the damaged roads. The roads from Chitrey to Gelekhola were partly cleared by 2pm on Wednesday. The roads from Gelekhola to Setijhora along NH-10 were cleared by evening. Bikash Das, a tourist from Kolkata who was trapped because of the landslide, said: "We were stuck at 9th Mile for 18 hours. We couldn’t communicate as there was no mobile network. Apart from us, we could notice about 25 vehicles stuck there.” Payal Mukherjee, another tourist from Kolkata, added that the locals helped them with tea, biscuits and water while they were stranded in the middle of the forest through the night. Between Tuesday and Wednesday, North Sikkim received 84.8mm of rainfall, the east district received 141.2mm of rain, the west 97.1mm and the south district received 91.5mm of rain on average. “Rongli in east district has received 158.4mm rain while Magitar in east Sikkim has received 308mm rain in the last 48 hours”, said IMD director (Gangtok) GN Raha. he added that there were no rainfall warning for the next five days in the state. However, the same couldn’t be predicted for North Bengal where the Met department warned heavy to very heavy rainfall over Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar, which could lead to more landslides. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railways (DHR) has suspended its full-fledged services from New Jalpaiguri to Darjeeling from Wednesday following landslides. However, its joy rides and the jungle tea safari services are still operational.

The reason: everyone is getting ready for blockbuster box office collections anticipated in Diwali week with new releases.Manohar Wadhawani, a national level movie distributor who keeps a close watch on films in the pipeline, said, “All eyes are on a big banner action-packed Hindi movie which is ready for exhibition. So, the real magic in the box office will happen from November 5 onwards as all big producers had held back their releases due to the pandemic.”For moviegoers, there will be quite a few things which will be new for them once they head to back to watch films on the big screen. As reported by TOI earlier, no snacks will be allowed inside the movie halls.Another big change will be that you cannot sit next to your loved ones or friends anymore due to the new seating plan. Sanjay Surana, who owns movie theatres across Maharashtra and also exhibits them through contract, said, “The seating plan is like a chess board. So, you have to leave the next seat vacant. This is mandatory and is included in the guidelines issued by the government.” So, even if moviegoers are from the same family and have travelled together, they can’t sit together in the cinema hall.Pradeep Bajaj, a movie theatre owner from Wardha, said people will also need to get used to a cashless environment. “The government has advised us to use less cash for food and beverage sales, so we will be using more of QR bar codes. I will avoid card swiping machine because that takes more time and the queue gets held up, so it’s advisable if people have some sort of payment app on their phones,” said Bajaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cinema-halls-get-ready-for-friday-reopening/articleshow/87167828.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||NMC plans property tax, city survey, stamps registrar works in all zones||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) proposes to integrate its data and services of property tax department with those of city survey office, and also stamps and registration department. If the plan materializes, people will get services of all three departments conveniently at one place, and no properties will escape the property tax net, ensuring rise in revenue for the cash-strapped civic body.Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and superintendent of land records GB Deberao have planned a pilot project of integration of data and services of NMC’s property tax department and city survey office at Dhantoli Zone.NMC deputy commissioner Milind Meshram told TOI, “It will be a win-win situation for common man, NMC, and city survey department. We have started the process of integrating properties falling under Dhantoli zone. The same will be done in remaining nine zones if pilot project is successful.”Meshram said, “NMC’s data of property tax is online. Anyone can click on any property and can get detailed information. Similarly, the data of city survey office is also online. NMC gives services from its 10 zones situated across the city. Three offices of city survey office are situated in Civil Lines, causing rush at the offices and also inconvenience for the people.”After integration of data, NMC will issue copies of akhiv patrika from its zone offices. Staff of city survey office will sit in NMC’s zones, accept applications for mutation, and do the needful. This will help citizens get copy of akhiv patrika or complete mutation in city survey records in an easy manner.Meshram also said, “NMC will come to know about mutation in city survey records automatically and will undertake mutation in property tax records without demanding applications. Charges of mutation will be levied in next demand note of property tax. We will have up to date information of new owner of the property, so demand note will reach the exact person.”Meshram added the plan will increase NMC’s revenue to a great extent. “Data of stamps and registration department is also online. We are also planning to integrate data of NMC’s property tax with this department. We do not have any data of over 50,000 open plots. This plan will ensure details of owners of open plots enter our records whenever sale deed is done or mutation happens in city survey records,” he said.Also, currently NMC does not come to know if any flat scheme or individual house comes up on open plot unless the owner comes to NMC for mutation in property tax records. With integration of data, NMC will automatically come to know about such changes and generate demand note after inspection. It will also ensure timely collection of revenue.Already, NMC’s property tax department has managed to bring 1.92 lakh properties under the property tax net through revaluation and assessment drive. Number of properties under property tax net has increased from 4.5 lakh to 6.42 lakh.BOXIN A NUTSHELL* NMC’s property tax data is online* City survey office, and stamps and registration department too are online* NMC plans integration of data of all 3 offices* This will give all three services from NMC’s ten zones* NMC will automatically come to know about mutations, especially about open plots* Also, conversion of open plot to flat scheme or individual house will be recorded* This will raise NMC’s revenue and timely collection of tax* Pilot project to integrate data of NMC and city survey office started at Dhantoli Zone||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-plans-property-tax-city-survey-stamps-registrar-works-in-all-zones/articleshow/87167815.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Nagpur||Confusion over colleges reopening as NU issues notification late||Nagpur: Utter confusion prevailed among colleges over reopening on Wednesday after Nagpur University failed to issue the notification in this regard even after conducting a meeting with principals on Tuesday. The order was issued only on Wednesday evening by registrar Raju Hiwase, after which colleges came to know about guidelines regarding the reopening. Even collector R Vimala released a notification on colleges reopening on Wednesday, due to which many managements couldn’t open their doors for students and preferred to wait for detailed orders. Both notifications permitted NU affiliated, conducted and autonomous colleges to restart physical classes from Wednesday itself.Some principals told TOI that they did not commence classes as they were waiting for NU’s notification. They said even the collector’s notification was received late in the evening. Till filing of this report, many principals were yet to receive both notifications in this regard. In the absence of any clear guidelines from NU and the collector, they were forced to wait, even as they were receiving several queries from anxious students and parents. “As we did not receive any specific directives from NU, we have not resumed physical classes. An indication in this regard was given by the NU administration during our Tuesday meeting. We would be allowing only fully vaccinated students, that too with 50% capacity. We, however, are facing problems with first-year students who are usually below 18 years and are yet to be inoculated with even a single jab,” Dhanwate National College (DNC) principal Surendra Jichkar said.A section of principals also opposed NU’s move to restart colleges just 10 days before the Diwali vacation commences, during their meeting on Tuesday with vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari. They also said they would incur unnecessary expenditure in sanitization and other processes to follow strict Covid-19 protocol. However, NU administration rejected their grievances and told them to commence classes from Wednesday.“We had already discussed this aspect with higher education minister Uday Samant during a meeting of all VCs. He told us to at least commence classes for eight days so students and colleges get accustomed to the new arrangement and then start full-fledged classes after the vacations. It was also decided not to take consent of parents for students who are above 18 years,” Chaudhari told TOI.He added that the minister had assured to discuss vacating hostels in the next meeting, as many universities had handed them to the local administration for running Covid Care Centres. “It was decided to invite only local students initially, while following all protocols like double vaccination.”Similar confusion was witnessed in Wardha district, as the collector also issued reopening notification on Wednesday. “As the notification was received on Wednesday afternoon, we have decided to restart classes from Thursday. We’ve already inoculated a majority of our students with two jabs at all our colleges and are trying to complete vaccination of remaining soon,” said Sanjay Bhargava, chairman of Shiksha Mandal, which runs Bajaj Group’s colleges like JB Science, and Bajaj Institute of Technology.Some colleges, however, did not wait for the government or NU notification, and resumed physical classes on the basis of Maharashtra government resolution (GR). “We witnessed about 30% attendance today, as students were keen to attend lectures. Many students approached us with a single dose or without it, but we politely told them to follow the Covid-19 protocol. Currently, we would be conducting classes in online as well as offline mode. After Diwali, we would emphasize on full-fledged physical classes as our courses are fully dependent on practicals,” Mohota Science principal Jeevan Dontulwar said. BOXCOLLECTOR’S INSTRUCTIONS* All non-agricultural, deemed to be, private, and self-financed universities to resume classes from Oct 20* They should consult with local authorities to exceed attendance beyond 50%* Only students having completed both Covid-19 vaccinations to be allowed entry* Universities working in prohibited areas should consult with local authorities * Authorities to issue detailed guidelines/standard operating procedure (SOP) for colleges* Online facility should be made available to students unable to attend classes* Varsities to follow all instructions of higher & tech education directors on restarting hostels||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/confusion-over-colleges-reopening-as-nu-issues-notification-late/articleshow/87167833.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Such false promises created widespread confusion and expectations among students that NEET would not be conducted this year. However, in July, the government asked students to prepare for NEET, causing shock and consequently stress to students. Some of them even resorted to extreme steps.The petitioner said it is high time the government stopped giving false hopes to medical aspirants till a conclusive and viable solution is arrived at. Such promises would hamper the preparation of students for the test next year too. The petitioner demanded that the state government and DMK pay Rs 1crore each as compensation to the families of students who died by suicide and Rs 5lakh each to students suffering from depression, stress and mental health issues created by the irresponsible and non-implementable assurance regarding NEET. A division bench of Justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar while seeking response from the state government and DMK adjourned the case to November 22. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-in-hc-to-stop-making-false-promises-on-neet/articleshow/87170520.cms||---
---||Nagpur||CBSE allows students to change exam city||Nagpur: Just two days after releasing datesheet for Term-1, which is part of the final board exam, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has now allowed students to change the city from which they will appear for the exams.Till now, it had been assumed that students would appear in the exam from their own schools, but the board has realized that many are now living in different cities. While some students are back to their home town, some have shifted to their grandparents’ home since the start of the second wave of the pandemic and not come back yet. Even though schools have reopened for physical classes, it is not mandatory for students to attend. CBSE’s controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said an online portal will be started where applications for change in city will be accepted. “At an appropriate time, the CBSE will inform students to make request to their respective schools to change city of their examination centre. Schools will follow instructions given by the CBSE to forward the request in the online system,” said Bhardwaj. He added that all students and schools must now daily check CBSE’s website for the next update. “As soon as students are informed in this regard, they can make their request to their school within the schedule,” said Bhardwaj.CBSE has reiterated that the time-frame for making such changes “will be of a very short duration.” Bhardwaj has also stated that under no circumstances will any request be entertained after the online window closes.Schools had a mixed reaction regarding CBSE’s decision. A principal said, “I feel, many parents and students are taking advantage of this and not coming back to school. Some say they are staying with their grandparents outside Nagpur, hence cannot join school in physical mode. But, we don’t know what’s true because I doubt if teenagers can stay in semi-rural area for such a long time.” She added that now for Term-1 exam, which is to be given in physical mode only, it will be necessary for the students to return to classrooms.Another principal said it is high time students come back to school. “We are talking about students in Std X and XII.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Markets to be lit up with LED bulbs in Diwali||JAIPUR: Impact of coal shortage can be seen on the Diwali decoration of the Walled City markets this year. Almost all of the markets will have LED lighting and will try to use small size lights so that there won’t be any burden on electricity. Preparations for Diwali celebrations have begun for decorating the markets. Every year, markets in Walled City celebrate the festival of lights by decorating the markets in various theme. This year they will follow similar pattern but with minimum electricity consumption. Chandpol Vyapaar Mandal president Subhash Goyal said that marking the 75 years of Independence, association has decided to decorate the market in tri-colour theme. “We will only use LED lights for minimum consumption. We will put three colour lights in the market to celebrate the Independence year and digital butterflies will be shown to be flying in the market. Moreover, a welcome gate will be constructed at the Chandpol gate as well,” said Goyal. In Kishanpol market, with LED lighting, the Singapore style two gates will be made. On Choti Chaupar, Hawa Mahal will be constructed with pink colour LED lights on the windows. Taking the Pink theme, entire market will be decorated with pink colour LED lights to save electricity consumption. In Hawa Mahal market, that is dependent on tourists is still bearing the burn of pandemic. Prakash Singh, market association president said that they will put small LED lights to save electricity, but no theme will be given this year. “Our business is not going well due to pandemic. Many shops are still shut down so, we will do minimum lightening without theme,” said Singh. Many markets are yet to finalize their theme and will take final decision in a few days. Johari market will declare their theme in a few days. Bapu Bazaar, market association said that they will decide the theme in a few days after conducting a meeting. For lights, market association has decided to use generators instead of taking connection from the government due to shortage. The work for market decoration will begin after October 15. Traders have met the chief secretary of the state as well demanding some concession in electricity rates they usually get. Government is yet to make any announcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/markets-to-be-lit-up-with-led-bulbs-in-diwali/articleshow/87170517.cms||---

Fuel prices in the country have been hovering at record levels since April this year. While diesel used to sell at Rs 77.41 at the start of the year and had a Rs 6 rise in the first four months, it has shot up by close to Rs 15 per litre in six months and is set to climb further according to fuel station operators in the city. “The way the fuel price is increasing, it is most likely to cross the Rs 100 mark by the end of this month itself,” said Sushil Chowdhury, manager at a fuel pump in north Kolkata. State-run oil refiners such as Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum revise the fuel rates on a daily basis based on crude oil prices in international markets and the rupee-dollar exchange rates. Any changes in petrol and diesel prices are implemented with effect from 6am every day. Globally, oil prices have climbed near multi-year highs as an energy supply crunch persists across the globe. Benchmark Brent crude is now selling at $85.08 a barrel. At the start of the year, it was $51.80 per barrel. Source at an oil PSU suggested the price of crude oil can rise further up to $90 per barrel by December, which will certainly lead to further increase in fuel prices in Kolkata as well as the rest of the country. “I have started thinking of giving up driving my taxi and look for some other job as driving a taxi is no longer profitable, thanks to the rising fuel prices. With the government not allowing us to increase the fares, how can we pay for this ever-increasing price of fuel?” rued Bharat Kumar Yadav, a taxi driver. Md Shabbir Ali, another taxi driver, said he had long stopped taking passengers on metered rides. “I only pre-book passengers for a set fare depending on the time and kilometre. I know it is illegal but I can’t help as I have a family to run and a car to maintain. If I don’t tweak my ways, it will be impossible to survive paying Rs 100 for a litre of diesel,” said Ali. Fearing the soaring fuel prices will lead to hike in prices of essential and non-essential goods across several categories, petrol pump owners’ association demanded the Centre and the state to reduce taxes – which constitute to more than 50% of the total price we pay for a litre of fuel. “Oil consumption by motorists has fallen considerably. The Centre and the state should seriously consider reducing the tax components to let us and the motorists survive,” said Snehasish Bhowmik, vice-president of the West Bengal Petroleum Dealers’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/diesel-price-inches-closer-to-the-century-mark/articleshow/87169241.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

If it is not removed at once, it might create health hazards. Garbage bins are overflowing and blocking half of roads. It might lead to accidents if waste is not cleared immediately,” he said.Mounds of garbage are found at Urumandampalayam, Gnanambiga Mill Junction, Ragavendran Colony, Ponvizha Nagar, Urumandampalayam Road, Bharathi Park, bBurial ground at Adappu Thottam, Gandhi Nagar, water tank at Vellakinar, railway gate at Vellakinar and Vanniya Nagar Road.“The corporation is not collecting waste from doorsteps. As waste collection is taking place only once in three days, we are forced to dump on the road,” Devendran added.Two-wheeler users dumping waste on the road is a common sight, said K Muthalagu, a resident. “They would not do it if waste is collected at doorsteps. If people resort to open dumping despite door-to-door collection, they should be punished appropriately,” she said.T Andiappan, a resident of Ilango Nagar in Avaramapalayam, said that waste is piling up on Ilango Nagar Main Road for the last one week. “Stray dogs throng the place in search of food, posing threat to residents.”But health officials of the corporation blamed the residents for not segregating waste at source level. “Waste processing at Vellalore yard is delayed due to the huge volume of garbage generated during the puja. Had the residents segregated waste into degradable and non-degradable, it would have made our work easy,” an official said. “It would take a few more days for us to remove waste generated during the festival.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/puja-festival-litter-chokes-city-streets-raises-a-stink/articleshow/87170518.cms||---

Installation of street lights is among the primary demands of more than 60 councillors who went to meet BJP higher officials. Mayor Sheel Dhabai who also went to BJP office on Wednesday to celebrate Valmiki Jayanti, while talking to TOI said that she has got evidence of all the development work that is happening in the city and will give proof of the same. “No one is against me as public and BJP has proof of the work going on in the city. If any councillor went to meet the party official, that must be for personal reasons. Party is also looking at the work we are doing at present. I have every proof of the work going on in the city. “ Around four months ago, it was promised to install 100 new LED street lights in every ward of JMC-Greater. The promise was yet to be fulfilled as one of the companies responsible for installation refused to work due to non-clearance of bills. An officer at JMC-Greater said, “The work is yet to be completed. Dhabai has sought details of the work progress in areas of all the councillors who went to meet BJP higher officials on Tuesday. The mayor is expected to consult councillors regarding the installation of lights personally, but it is difficult to presume when the work will begin.” There are two companies who have been given contracts for street light installation and maintenance. The company working in Murlipura, Jhotwara, Vidhyadhar Nagar and Mansarover has refused to complete the work due to the non-clearance of dues. Around Rs 80 crore is pending with JMC-Greater. However, the company working in Sanganer, Malviya Nagar and Jagatpura has started work and will complete the installation of street lights before Diwali. Officials in JMC-Greater are trying to cajole the company to resume work as Diwali is around the corner and with anger of councilors against the mayor, it has become important to tackle this situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mayor-reviews-street-light-installation/articleshow/87170544.cms||---

It is a time-consuming process, though. We are working on another 347 missing mobile phone complaints. People can either approach the nearest police station or the cyber cell functioning in the rural police office with the phone missing cases.”While appealing people not to keep mobile phones in places where they could be easily stolen by thieves, Selvanagarathinam cautioned the used phone sellers against purchasing mobile phones from regular sellers, as they could be selling stolen phones.“The used phone sellers should only buy phones from genuine owners. Those buying second-hand phones should check Digicop application developed by the state police and ensure that the phone is not a stolen one. One can enter the IMEI number of the phone to get the information,” the SP said.In April, the rural police had handed over 125 lost mobile phones to their owners.V Senthil, who got his phone, which he had lost last year, back on the day, said he had lodged a complaint only for his safety, as he was afraid of someone using the same for illegal purposes. “I never thought I will get it back. I was very happy when I received a call from police recently informing that they had recovered the phone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rural-police-recover-141-lost-cell-phones-return-to-owners/articleshow/87170546.cms||---

From this year, 50% weightage will be given for both internal and external assessment. Autonomous colleges and university department will also follow the pattern from this year.While all the three-internal assessment tests have become mandatory with the new norm, the final test will be a model test covering all the five chapters, making it a prelude to the external semester exam.A minimum pass mark in the internal assessment has also been introduced, unlike the past when aggregate of internal and external tests was considered for calculated pass marks. “However, there are provisions for improvement exams. Teachers have been given more liberty to assess students based on their performance,” said controller of examinations in-charge R Vijayaraghavan.Under the new system, teachers can critically evaluate students, said BU vice-chancellor P Kaliraj. “The move will make students take internal assessment seriously and gain a better understanding of the subject right from the beginning of the semester. Teachers can also assess students by various means, like quiz programmes, comprehensive tests and MOOC courses,” he said.The VC said that a robust system will be put in place where students will be given opportunity to represent in case of any wrongdoing. “While BU will be the first state-run arts and science university to introduce it, the system is already in place in many overseas universities and even in many autonomous arts and science colleges,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/teachers-slam-bus-decision-to-change-evaluation-pattern/articleshow/87170554.cms||---

---||Patna||One dies, 31 children fall ill due to food poisoning||PATNA: One child died and 31 others fell ill allegedly due to food poisoning at village Rupauli under Saraiyya police station area in Muzaffarpur district late Tuesday night. They had consumed food at a shraddh held in the village on Sunday. The deceased, Nishant Kumar, was 10 years’ old. The other children were still undergoing treatment at separate hospitals in Muzaffarpur. A medical team was rushed to the village after the incident came to light late Tuesday night. Surprisingly, none of the elders, who had eaten the shraddh meal, fell ill. Police suspect that the children might have caught contaminated fish from the floodwaters near the village and consumed it after improperly roasting on fire, resulting in the food poisoning. Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Dr Vinay Kumar Sharma told TOI over the phone on Wednesday that the children had severe vomiting and diarrhoea. “This is food poisoning. However, it is yet not clear why elders didn’t fall ill after eating the same food items,” he said. Sharma said he has directed the food inspector to collect samples from the house where the shraddh had taken place. Sharma said no vomiting or diarrhoea samples of the children were collected for pathological test. He said a medical team of a doctor and at least three supporting staff is camping at the village. “The child died on way to the hospital as the family wasted time on his treatment at home,” he said. Sharma said all the children undergoing treatment were stable and safe. Saraiyya SDPO Rajesh Kumar Sharma said no written complaint has been received yet. Police would take necessary action as per any complaint or direction from senior authority, he added. Saraiyya police station SHO Ravindra Kumar said no postmortem was conducted and the body of the deceased children was cremated by his family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/one-dies-31-children-fall-ill-due-to-food-poisoning/articleshow/87169252.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NU to grant autonomy to all its 43 depts at one go||Nagpur: Nagpur University has decided to grant autonomy to all its 43 departments at one go from the ongoing academic session 2021-22. The move would enable the departments to frame their own syllabus as per the latest industry needs and also conduct exams and declare results without the university’s help.“We have taken this giant step after getting grade ‘A’ status from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) last month. It has been on our agenda for a long time. It will provide the much-needed boost to academic and research activities in all our departments,” an elated vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari told TOI.The National Higher Education Policy 2020 (NEP) has already proposed the concept of autonomy for better management of a large numbers of colleges by the traditional universities like Nagpur, Mumbai and Pune.“Autonomy would enable departments to design and continuously update their syllabus without depending on NU. The university’s syllabus is designed by members of the Board of Studies (BOS) comprising teachers from affiliated colleges. Now, all our departments would have their independent BOS. They will also have flexibility in designing their own papers and conducting exams,” the VC said.Hailing the decision, head of the travel and tourism department Priyadarshini Khobragade said the move would be beneficial for all students. “NU has granted us academic autonomy as of now. It would take a couple of years for a complete transformation. We can start courses in hotel management and catering technology in the future. We can also have added facilities like laboratories and linkages with industries. We can design the syllabus as per the requirement of the tourism sector in the region.”A senior professor said though the VC has made the announcement about the autonomy in their meeting last month, NU is yet to issue a formal notification. “However, it is certainly a much-needed initiative by NU that would benefit students in a big way. Until now, the syllabus couldn’t be changed for a couple of years after it was framed, but with autonomy, we can update it every year and incorporate the latest changes in our industry. The job market is also changing rapidly and we need to prepare students accordingly to make them ready. We can also implement a continuous evaluation system rather than depending on the semester exams to judge students’ performance. We would be able to introduce more practical-oriented subjects and include mandatory internships with the industries for the students,” he said.FEW AUTONOMOUS COLLEGES UNDER NU* GH Raisoni College of Engineering* Yashwantrao Chavan College of Engineering* Ramdeobaba College of Engineering & Mgmt* Jankidevi Bajaj Science College* GS College of Commerce & Economics* St Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-to-grant-autonomy-to-all-its-43-depts-at-one-go/articleshow/87167843.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Both CBSE and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) announced two board exams for classes X and XII this academic year. CISCE had in September decided to hold first-semester exams online in mid-November. It will cover 50% of the syllabus. After re-opening of schools across the country, CBSE on Monday announced holding its first-semester exams in the physical mode in November-December. CISCE was flooded with similar requests from its affiliated schools. Several schools communicated to CISCE about the technical difficulties in holding the ongoing online practice exams, despite having high speed internet connectivity. The exams were slated from November 16 to December 6 for ICSE, and November 15 to December 16 for ISC. While schools have got down with their practical exams, principals said the possibility of a pen-and-paper exam cannot be ruled out. “Conducting an offline written examination will be the best solution in the backdrop of declining Covid cases,” said Rohit Bhat, chairperson, Children Academy Group of Schools. Both CBSE and CISCE are conducting multiple choice questions (MCQ)-based exams of 90 minutes for the first semester. Though CISCE students had the option of appearing for the online exams from their schools, principals said very few students had responded positively. “We had to make arrangements for students wanting to take online exams from the school. It is better to bring all students to the classrooms and take pen-and-paper exams,” said a principal. Teachers who had conducted preparatory tests for students had complained of unfair means in online examinations. “It will be unfair to have online test for CISCE students when their CBSE counterparts will be writing physical papers.” Students taking the board exams were divided into groups of 20 to 30 (each school). Each group was to be allotted a proctor to supervise. Principals said schools were finding it difficult to get adequate invigilators. Training of the proctors has now been put on hold. “There is a huge digital divide and holding online exam on such a large scale will be tough,” said Neelu Lamba, principal, Hiranandani School, Thane. CISCE is studying the CBSE model of conducting offline exams. CBSE has doubled its exam centres, allowing students to write papers from their respective schools. CBSE schools have begun the dry run of their printers (question papers will have to be printed 30 minutes before the exam commences). CBSE first-semester exams will begin from Nov 30/Dec 1 for classes 10 and 12. Minor and optional papers will be conducted from November 16 and 17 for classes XII and X.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-online-exams-postponed-icse-isc-schools-hope-to-go-offline-like-cbse/articleshow/87172259.cms||Sandhya Nair

SMC workers had, however, dug up the road by then, bringing vehicular movement on the stretch to a complete halt. During rain, water covers the pit, posing danger to the residents.The residents and motorists said SMC workers hadn’t closed the dug-up pits properly. ‘They simply closed them with sand and the pits are now filled with rainwater. Bike riders often fall off the vehicles with wheels getting stuck in the mud,” said K Manoj Kumar, a motorist.S Gokilavani, a resident, said the UGD work had thrown their lives out of gear. “The entire area is filled with dust and we are forced to wear face mask in our houses.”When contacted, an SMC official, who didn’t want to be named, said they would relay the road after completing the UGD and water pipeline laying works. The residents and motorists, however, urged SMC and the district administration to take some steps to temporarily close the pits to avoid road mishaps.The SMC had been carrying out UGD work in the city for more than a decade. While the work has been completed in many areas, the project is yet to be implemented in some areas. “We have started pipe laying work for the UGD project in residential areas bordering the city limits. The work will be completed in a couple of months,” said a senior engineer with SMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/incomplete-ugd-work-leaves-road-unmotorable-in-salem/articleshow/87170565.cms||---

It has no truth and I will remain in AIADMK,” he said.“About 18 lakh people were estimated to be trained across the country through the Skill India initiative. But effectively, they were not able to exceed over 14 lakh. It was mainly because of the challenges in terms of placement and mobilisation of the right people,” he said. “We will have these centres in Coimbatore, Erode and Tirupur. A total 16 such centres will come up in Tamil Nadu starting from Virudhunagar where a centre will be inaugurated on Thursday.”“Ma Foi, in due course, intends to build capacity and scale up using technology that aggregates employers, training providers and students through a robust multilingual platform,” Pandiarajan added.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/former-minister-pandiarajan-vows-to-create-three-lakh-jobs/articleshow/87170556.cms||---

In an interview to TOI, the senior IMF official talks about the need for high fuel taxes. Excerpts: How durable is the economic recovery? The recovery in investment and consumption is expected to continue as reflected in the momentum of high frequency indicators. The pick-up in vaccinations should also support a further normalisation in activities. At the same time, there are both downside and upside risks to economic outlook. Taxes on fuel have emerged as a key issue which is seen fuelling inflation. Should the government cut taxes? Fuel taxes implemented at the central and state levels became an important source of revenue for the government during the pandemic and helped create much-needed fiscal space to provide support to vulnerable households and increase spending in priority areas like healthcare. Our recommendation is to maintain the existing taxes on fuel, while at the same time increase direct support to low-income households. Reducing fuel taxes in general disproportionately benefits higher-income households, making such policies highly regressive. Times ViewThe IMF official’s contention may be true elsewhere. But in India, with its large number of two-wheeler users, it would be inaccurate to say that fuel consumers belong only or even largely to high income groups. The high taxes on fuel thus hurt the lower middle class too. Given this situation, the government should roll back some of the tax hikes from recent years.How much of worry is the inflation situation? Despite recent moderation, inflation pressures persist, including sticky core inflation and pandemic-related supply disruptions. Given the negative output gap, an accommodative monetary stance, coupled with adequate systemic liquidity through various instruments, while closely monitoring elevated inflation pressures as conveyed, remains appropriate. Although the near-term inflation outlook is likely to be driven by lower food prices and base effects, inflationary pressures need to be closely monitored, given strengthening demand, rising commodity prices and higher inputs prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/maintain-existing-taxes-on-fuel-imf-indias-ex-chief/articleshow/87172933.cms||Surojit Gupta

Residents said that inundating parts in the city were ignored. The corporation is establishing the structure at a cost of Rs 75,000 to Rs 1.15 lakh per structure on EVR Road, Puthur Road and Pattabiraman Street, all near the government medical college hospital. Around 31 such structures involving drilling of multiple bore wells for a depth of 20 feet were established at a very close distance with 5-6 feet distance between each pit. While one or two pits are adequate for 50 metres length, the civic body has established around 10 such pits at very close distance. Further, architects said that the rainwater could be diverted to the stormwater drains running parallel to the road, which merges with the Uyyakondan canal situated within 100m distance from the site, a low-cost solution to avoid inundation. “It is an example of poor planning, public money is wasted to establish numerous RWH pits for a single road as if Trichy is deprived of inundation,” H Ghouse Baig, a consumer rights activist said. “The locations identified were prone to stagnation, in the next phase, we will cover the left out areas,” an official with the corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-faces-flak-on-sites-of-rwh-pits/articleshow/87170604.cms||Deepak Karthik

Based on a tip-off, the Tuticorin Q branch police arrested the petitioner on June 11. He was booked for offences under various sections of Passport Act and Foreigners Act.In his petition, Thorn stated that he was a British citizen and he also has an Overseas Citizenship of India.

The court had on September 17 ordered issuance of notices to the complainants directing them to be present on the next date of hearing. On September 30, the investigating officer told the court that the notices to all the complainants could not be served personally for want of sufficient time as he had received them from the ahlmad a day before. The court had sought an explanation from the court staffer regarding the delay. On October 16, the ahlmad submitted that the notices could not be issued on time due to shortage of staff. “The aforesaid explanation is unacceptable considering the fact that there are two assistant ahlmads along with one ahlmad appointed in this court against the pendency of approximately 540 cases, and hence, the non-compliance of the previous order can only be attributed to the gross negligence of the ahlmad and the assistant ahlmads and their scant regard towards the directions of this court,” chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg said in the order. The court noted that there was “dereliction of duties” on their part and “gross insubordination”. It also noted that the investigating officer had reportedly been transferred as the station house officer of the Lajpat Nagar police station and no substitute had been deputed by the DCP concerned till date. The court sought an explanation from the DCP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-requests-action-against-its-staff-for-not-carrying-out-orders/articleshow/87170640.cms||---

While the work on the service road for a length of 14.5 km has been pending for more than a decade, the recent proposal by the state government to establish an elevated corridor did not go well with the residents who depend on the highway for everyday commute. Claiming that even after the Madras high court instructed the state government to complete the land acquisition, it dragged on for two years. Alleging that the delay is intentional to safeguard the business interest of the people who vehemently oppose the service road project, the federation sought for the intervention of the Union minister and the CM to prevent frequent fatal accidents on the stretch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/residents-demand-service-road-for-nh/articleshow/87170611.cms||---
---||Trichy||Trichy records decade’s highest rainfall in October||TRICHY: Even as the northeast monsoon is yet to begin, Trichy district has already registered surplus rainfall as on October 19. The recorded average rainfall of 260 mm in the month of October is the highest for the past 10 years. Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai and independent weather observers attributed the surplus rainfall to the upper air wind rotation. While the northeast monsoon is anticipated to commence by October 25, the convectional rainfall powered by the upper air wind rotation is likely to continue in the district for the next few days. The recorded total average rainfall of 260 mm (till October 19) is the highest for the district since 2011. With more rainfall is expected later in the month, Trichy is likely to cross 400 mm monthly rainfall recorded in 2005, the highest ever for the district in October. The convectional rainfall has benefitted the Manapparai, Manachanallur, Thuraiyur and Marungapuri regions the most where rainfall so far was recorded between 130 mm and 491 mm. “Continuous rainfall is on cards for Trichy even before the arrival of the northeast monsoon. The last week of the month and days before Diwali may record substantial rainfall in Trichy and other central districts,” N Selvakumar, independent weather blogger said. Around 300 mm rainfall was recorded in Trichy city, well spread in all urban and suburban parts. Musiri and Lalgudi have also received an average of 330 mm to 410 mm rainfall in the first three weeks of the month. “So far, the rain has not affected the rural areas much. Crops are good but we are wary of gusty winds damaging banana crops,” Ayilai Sivasuriyan, a farmer, said. Apart from Trichy, the other eight districts in the central region have received a 40-100% surplus over the normal rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-records-decades-highest-rainfall-in-october/articleshow/87170593.cms||Deepak Karthik

More than 15 lakh commuters made their way across the city in 2,800 Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses. Fast forward to 2021, daily patronage has almost halved and the MTC is on the verge of becoming a failed state transport undertaking. A metropolitan city will need at least 60 buses for every one lakh population, as per guidelines from the Union urban affairs ministry. By this standard, Chennai would need at least 4,500 MTC buses. However, it has just 3,400 buses on the road, according to official data. In fact, MTC’s fleet size has remained stagnant for almost 10 years. The state transport department has not replaced old buses at regular intervals either. The average age of an MTC bus now is seven years, when just a decade ago the city had the youngest bus fleet compared to other Indian metros. Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), which covers only 850sqkm, has around 6,500 buses —almost double the fleet size of MTC which covers 1,189sqkm. As a result, bus frequency is very poor in Chennai compared to Bengaluru, said Rama Rao of Traffic and Transportation Forum (TTF), Chennai. “The government’s inaction has forced more people to opt for unauthorised modes of public transit like share autos,” he said. MTC operates buses along 600 routes. Fewer than three buses are operated on 57% of these 600 routes, according to Chennai city’s Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP). This means passengers would have to wait for longer hours for a bus. The CMP recommended that MTC increase bus frequency along routes connecting Avadi, Broadway, Poonamallee, Guindy, T Nagar and Vadapalani with suburban areas. “Things have worsened after the recent Covid lockdown relaxations. The average wait time at bus stops has increased by at least 30% in these areas,” said R Rengachari, a transportation activist. MTC has failed to prevent bus bunching too, he added. Bus bunching is a phenomenon in which two or more buses along the same route arrive at the stop at the same times instead of frequent intervals. The transport workers’ union claimed that the bus departure schedule from depots has not been changed for years. A senior MTC official rejected the claim, saying schedules are revised at regular intervals according to road traffic conditions. Recently, changes were made on routes 54 (Poonamallee-Broadway), 88K (Kundrathur-Broadway) and 570 (Koyambedu-Kelambakkam). However, due to frequent traffic congestion, MTC could operate only 8 trips along certain routes in suburban areas compared to 10 in pre-Covid times, the official said, requesting anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/mtc-on-the-verge-becoming-a-failed-public-transit-option/articleshow/87160990.cms||Ram Sundaram

---||Kolhapur||Mills & experts: Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader Raju Shetti’s demand not practical||KOLHAPUR: The sugar mill operators in the region have claimed that the price of Rs 3,300 per tonne of sugar cane — as sought by Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader Raju Shetti — is impractical and they are in no position to pay the same. Shetti, during the congregation of farmers on Tuesday, demanded that the farmers be paid Rs 3,300 per tonne for sugar cane. The mills, meanwhile, are offering between Rs 2,800 and 3,100 per tonne, excluding the charges for cutting and transportation. Shetti has claimed that sugar will retain its price above Rs 37 per kg and also ethanol prices are skyrocketing in the international markets. As a result, the mill operators will be in a position to pay the price as per demand. Arun Lad, the chairman of the Kranti Cooperative Sugar Factory in Sangli district, said, “The current situation does not permit the millers to pay as per the demand. We are ready to pay a one-time amount equal to the fair and remunerative prices (FRP).” Lad further said that if the farmers’ leader claims that the millers are in a position to pay the price as high as Rs 3,300 per tonne, then an independent audit should be conducted to let everyone know what the mills can actually pay. “If the audit says that the mills cannot pay more than the FRP, the farmers’ leader should approach the government to get the additional amount claimed. The amount can be deposited in the farmers’ accounts directly. We are facing several issues. If we have to pay more than the FRP, we will have to pay mandatory income tax on that additional amount, which many millers have not paid,” added Lad. Vijay Autade, an industry expert, said the millers are not in a position to pay what the farmers’ leader is demanding. He said given the loans, maintenance and operational costs, salaries of the staff, and charges paid to cutters and transporters, only the financially stable factories are in a position to pay equal to the FRP. BJP delegation meets Amit Shah Meanwhile, Maharashtra opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis, along with BJP leaders who run sugar mills, met Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday. He requested the minister to address the issue of income tax required to be paid on the additional amount if value more than the FRP is paid to the farmers. “We have also requested that the millers should get loans over the ethanol produced by them after entering into an agreement with the oil companies. These measures will help millers pay a fair price to the farmers and that too on time,” Fadnavis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mills-experts-shettis-demand-not-practical/articleshow/87166416.cms||---
---||Chennai||God save Tamil Nadu cops: Madras HC in harassment case||CHENNAI: “God save the (police) department,” said an exasperated Madras high court on Wednesday, wondering whether an SP-rank officer would murder someone if his superior instructed him to do so. The court made the observations while refusing to discharge the then Chengalpet district superintendent D Kannan from a case registered against him for having intercepted a woman IPS officer from proceeding to Chennai to lodge a sexual harassment complaint against the then special DGP Rajesh Das. Justice P Velmurugan, refusing to accept Kannan’s argument that he merely carried out the instructions given to him by his superior officer, said: “Only lawful instruction could be followed. If a senior officer faces such allegations, how people will have faith on the department?” Asserting that only 10% of police officers were acting as per conscience, the judge said such incidents would bring bad name to the department. “Only a few women, that too in higher cadre, gather courage to come out with such complaints. Most of such victims in lower cadre do not come out openly,” the judge said. He then dismissed as withdrawn a plea moved by Kannan seeking to discharge him from the case. He directed the trial court to complete the trial in three months. Kannan was added as a co-accused in the case based on the complaint filed by the woman IPS officer that he had stopped her car to prevent her from proceeding to file a complaint against the DGP. ‘Tried to stop the car as per instructions’Kannan contended that he had tried to stop the car of the woman IPS officer who had been proceeding to file a complaint against the DGP ‘only as per the instruction of Rajesh Das who was his superior.’ As the counsel for the petitioner objected for the same citing the order passed by the Supreme Court setting aside the suo motu proceeding initiated by another single judge to monitor the investigation, the judge said, if you are aggrieved you can approach the Apex Court. Earlier, counsel for the petitioner submitted that the car of the woman IPS officer had been stopped only by the public since it had been driven in a rash and negligent manner. Kannan only handed over his phone to her as per the instructions of the DGP, he added. Since the court was not inclined to entertain the plea, the SP sought to withdraw his petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/god-save-tn-cops-hc-in-harassment-case/articleshow/87170628.cms||---

Vegetables like tomatoes, drumsticks (sajne data), capsicum and beans have reached a price that is quite unaffordable for middle-class consumers. “I used to buy 1kg of tomatoes every alternate day. Now I buy 500 grams a week,” said Anirban Ghatak, a state government employee who lives at Parnashree. Vegetables of everyday essentials like egg plants and parwal are hovering around Rs 100 and the price of chillies has crossed Rs 150 mark. Fruits like Kashmiri apple, pear and pomegranate are hovering around Rs 200 a kg. “To cut corners to strike a balance in the budget, we now rarely buy these fruits. Most of the fruits are prohibitively expensive these days,” said Sunita Iyer, whose mother has been unwell for the last few days. Since Mahalaya, the prices of most of the fruits rose sharply because of supply issues. A huge quantity of fruits got damaged because of untimely and excessive rains. “We grade the fruits and after sorting, a huge quantity of fruits is getting wasted. Thus, the graded fruits comes costlier,” said Sahajada Alam, a fruit trader at Gariahat. Md Nayim, a fruit trader of Thakurpukur bazar, added: “We don’t have a facility to preserve fruits. We sell fruits on the day we get the consignment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/prices-of-vegetables-fruits-touch-new-highs/articleshow/87169306.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Additional Sessions Judge Sunil Beniwal said the processes, which included court notices, summons, bailable warrants, non-bailable warrants, notices under sections 446, 350 and 82/83 of CrPC, should be received in the prescribed format with details of all column properly filled in along with the date of the execution and the time of the visit of the person who served the legal document. Section 446 CrPC relates to the procedure when bond has been forfeited, a notice under Section 350 relates to summary procedure for punishment for non-attendance by a witness in obedience to summons and Section 82/83 relates to proclamation for person absconding or attachment of property of person absconding. In an attempt to murder case, two prosecution witnesses were summoned by the Dwarka court. However, only one summons was received back and there was no report on the other. The judge noted that directions were issued to the joint commissioner of police to ensure handover of the processes to the court staff at least one day before the next date of hearing. “The acknowledgment report was received from the office of the joint commissioner assuring this court that necessary directions had been passed for compliance. What sort of compliance is this that the court does not understand? Even after so many days, the situation is still the same,” the court said in its order. The court issued a notice to the joint commissioner to file an explanation for disobedience of its order by the police stations concerned. It also said that a copy of the order be served to the police commissioner to inform him about the state of affairs of the administration at the level of the police station. It directed that all summons to witnesses would from now be served by either the investigating officer or the SHO himself/herself and under their full signatures along with date.

The members, led by MPs Imtiaz Jaleel and Fouzia Khan, also reached out to NCP chief Sharad Pawar, seeking a package of Rs 500 crore for the overall revamping of Waqf and modernizing it. Following the meeting held at the official residence of Walse-Patil in Mumbai, Jaleel said, “We have been informed that already offences have been registered at five places including Thane, Beed, Parbhani and Pune, for usurping prime Waqf properties by using forged documents.” The probe so far has raised several questions over revenue department officials as well as Waqf employees. “Despite the fact that the revenue department does not have direct jurisdiction on Waqf properties, they have passed orders on the basis of forged NOCs issued from Waqf,” Jaleel said. Echoing similar views Khan said the home minister has issued directives to additional director general of police (law and order) Rajender Singh to issue written orders to all police unit commanders to take cognizance of the complaints received against land sharks, carry out in depth probe and register offences on priority. The members in a written representation made to Pawar demanded a joint meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and also for an order to carry out district-wise survey of properties, including the ones currently under the possession of different departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-told-to-lodge-offences-waqf-board/articleshow/87166441.cms||---

The commission quizzed Shamshabad DCP N Prakash Reddy on Wednesday over custody, safety lock of police weapons as well as then Cyberabad commissioner VC Sajjanar’s certain inaccurate assertions during the press meet on November 29, 2019. The DCP said that it was Shadnagar ACP V Surender’s idea not to produce the accused before the judicial magistrate and it never occurred to him to ask the ACP the reason. The ACP was the investigating officer (IO) of the Disha rape and murder case. When the commission chairman VS Sirpurkar asked if he agreed “that while praying for police custody the accused must be produced before a judicial magistrate”, the DCP, after referring to CrPC section 167 (2) (b) pertaining to the subject, said “no”. The commission recorded in the deposition that “this answer is given in spite of the witness reading provisions of section 167 (2) (b) of CrPC”. Quizzed on how the magistrate would know if the accused were injured or if their relations were given a notice of police custody application without they being produced by police, DCP said that only the magistrate would be able to answer the question. Regarding discrepancies in press meet at the alleged encounter site by then CP Sajjanar about recovery of Disha’s articles and collection of DNA samples, the DCP said they were “due to presentation by the CP”. DCP said that in retrospect he believed he would have corrected the CP but there was too much noise and he could not listen properly. DCP said that he told Sajjanar that weapons of cops at the spot of exchange of fire were already unlocked based on information from Shadnagar SHO Sreedhar Kumar, adding that he never checked with the SHO how he had concluded that the safety lock was off. On commission’s queries regarding SC observations on media briefing in ongoing investigation and dignity of the accused, DCP said the accused were not paraded before the press.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sc-panel-quizzes-dcp-over-police-custody-of-4-accused/articleshow/87171836.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The tribunal awarded a compensation of only Rs 1.23 lakh (with interest) after holding the deceased woman’s attendant responsible for contributory negligence as she abandoned the senior citizen on the middle of the road after being unable to navigate traffic while crossing the road. Holding the attendant responsible for 50% of contributory negligence, the tribunal said, “As the deceased was blind she cannot be held responsible, but certainly the lady who was accompanying the deceased should have been cautious and seen that the deceased should have crossed the road. It is nobody’s case that lady accompanying deceased sustained any injury or dash.” However, the tribunal held BEST responsible for the remaining contributory negligence. The tribunal reasoned that since the driver was aware that the two women were crossing the road, he should have driven the bus to avoid a collision with the “old lady”. “That means both ladies accompanying the deceased and driver of bus are equally responsible for the accident. Hence, this is case of contributory negligence where the BEST bus is also responsible to the extent of 50% for the accident,” the tribunal said. The victim Ramila Vora’s son, Nikhil Vora from Vile Parle, moved the tribunal against BEST in August 2018. The accident took place on May 9, 2018 at 3.25 pm. Ramila died on the spot. He blamed the bus driver for rash and negligent driving. However, BEST submitted that Ramila and the attendant were negligent as they were crossing the road at King’s Circle station without paying heed to traffic. At that time one tempo suddenly came near the women. It was alleged that when both crossed half the road, the attendant ran away, leaving Ramila in the middle. BEST alleged that Ramila turned back, slipped and came in contact with the bus. Nikhil told the tribunal his mother had gone to visit a relative and he learnt about the accident over the phone. He said an FIR was lodged that day. While calculating compensation, the tribunal considered Ramila’s age and the fact that she was unemployed. It pegged her monthly notional income at Rs6,000. The tribunal also calculated the funeral expenses to be Rs15,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mact-halves-payout-to-son-of-woman-run-over-by-bus/articleshow/87172289.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Hyderabad||Padayatra to restore welfare rule of YSR, says Sharmila||Hyderabad: YSR Telangana Party chief YS Sharmila asked chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and TRS working president KT Rama Rao to accompany her on her padayatra to understand people’s problems. Addressing a public meeting before launching her padayatra in Chevella on Wednesday, Sharmila said: “If there are no difficulties on the ground, I will call off my padayatra. If there are problems, the CM should retire and a Dalit should be appointed as chief minister.” Sharmila claimed that until she arrived on the Telangana political scene, KCR never bothered about opposition parties. “But now, he is paying attention to issues of the people. The opposition and the government have both failed the people. My padayatra is intended to restore the welfare rule of YS Rajasekhara Reddy ,” she said. Targeting TPCC president A Revanth Reddy, she said: “We don’t know how to blackmail or threaten people the way he does. He was saying that our party is an NGO. Sure, we are an NGO that works for the welfare of the people.” She said Revanth’s life was in the hands of KCR. “He cannot afford to ignore the CM, even if he ignores his boss Rahul Gandhi because he is facing so many cases.” She questioned why the state BJP was refusing to provide evidence while accusing the CM of corruption. She said BJP state chief is deceiving the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/padayatra-to-restore-welfare-rule-of-ysr-says-sharmila/articleshow/87171842.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Kolhapur||Activists ask Kolhapur Municipal Corporation to send fresh merger proposal||KOLHAPUR: Activists met Kolhapur Municipal Corporation administrator Kadambari Balkawade on Wednesday and requested her to send a fresh proposal of merger of fringe villages in civic limits. The activists cited Bombay high court proceedings in which the state government has pledged to approve the merger proposals. Ramesh More, a pro-merger activist, said, “The KMC provides several services to the nearby villages, but the villagers are not ready for merger. We maintained that the civic administrator should take a call and send a fresh proposal of merger to the state government in the interest of the city.” The activists cited the HC order issued in 2016 over the petition filed by former mayor R K Powar and others that mentions that the state must take a decision in appropriate manner and in accordance of the law in case of merger proposal sent by KMC. “For the last 50 years, the civic limits have not changed. At the same time, the pressure on the infrastructure has multiplied. The city is devoid of major infrastructural schemes and funds set aside by state and central governments,” said More. Responding to the delegation, Balkawade assured to take necessary steps with regards to the merger issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/activists-ask-kmc-to-send-fresh-merger-proposal/articleshow/87166459.cms||---
---||Chennai||Several schemes to boost MTC patronage non-starters or fizzle out fast||CHENNAI: Many key projects aimed at attracting more passengers to MTC and SETC services basked in success but only for a while. Vestibule buses and vehicles with pantry and toilets are among projects that attracted a decent response from the public, but subsequent state governments shelved them. A senior transport department official attributed this to the new bus body code (AIS:052), mandated by the Union road transport ministry in 2019. The code, which looks to bringing in uniformity in city buses across the country, doesn’t allow states to modify the design finalised by the manufacturer. “Accordingly, MTC or SETC is not in a position to reintroduce vestibule or pantry buses. However, we are trying our best to procure electric buses for Chennai and other parts of the state soon,” the official said. Tamil Nadu with financial assistance from German Bank (KfW) will buy 500 battery-operated buses. It will, however, not buy 525 e-buses for tier-II cities under the Union government’s FAME-II scheme due to financial reasons. Setting aside bus designs, the government is yet to take adequate steps to implement other related projects like Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) or Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA), said Rama Rao of TTF, Chennai. The BRTS project involved creating a dedicated bus lane along Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR). Meetings were conducted seeking public comments in 2019, but the plan came to standstill soon after. CUMTA has been a non-starter for a decade now. The project would allow people to easily travel across different modes of mass transit. When asked, a CUMTA member said plans were on to introduce a single smart card that would let the commuter travel in local trains, MTC buses and metro trains. But certain changes were proposed to the board’s organisational structure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/several-schemes-to-boost-mtc-patronage-non-starters-or-fizzle-out-fast/articleshow/87161063.cms||---

Police have arrested the accused in both cases, including the survivor’s father in the second one. In the Amar Colony case, a woman from Nepal alleged that she was sexually assaulted by a person in the area. On Tuesday, police received a PCR call regarding the sexual assault. “A police team reached the spot and the woman’s complaint was recorded,” an officer said. According to police, a case was registered under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code. A 41-year-old man, who lives in Noida, has been arrested. “He told us that they were in a live-in relationship in 2013-14,” the officer said. In the other case, a man was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting his daughter in northwest Delhi’s Jahangirpuri after the girl approached police on Monday. She was also threatened to stay quiet. A case has been registered under POCSO Act and further investigations are on, the officer said.

Since the exam was to be conducted online, parents and schools had been preparing for the proctored exam. Some parents said all their efforts in accordance with the schools’ instructions now seemed to be a waste of energy and time. Parent of an ICSE student, Parikshit Jha, said, “The sudden notification was a bit disappointing considering we were so prepared for the exam with all the arrangements for online method. Our child's mind was totally focussed on the exam. Now, children will tend to feel relaxed.” Another parent, Ashwini Malviya, said, “Since the schedule was declared, the board should have gone ahead with it. The students are disappointed and so are parents as they also had made arrangements to ensure that there were no hurdles in the online exam.” CISCE affiliated students said there is no clear instruction from the board about the new dates for the examination. If the board does not announce the new schedule soon, it would be difficult for them to plan for the main exams if the first term gets delayed to December, they said. ICSE student Devansh Agarwal said, “I got to know about the postponement in the morning news and later in the day we got a school circular abbout the exams being postponed.” The prelims for the board exam is usually conducted in December or January. However, with the first semester exam being postponed, schools are in a fix over the schedule for the next three months. Principal of Dr. Mar Theophilus School, Roshani George, said,“We had made all the arrangements to conduct the online semester examination. ” Principal of Vidya Pratishthan’s Magarpatta City Public School, Chandrika Banerjee, said the council posted a circular on Tuesday night stating that the semester I examination has been postponed. “They have called off the meeting with the principals and have cancelled the training session for the proctors, buffer proctors and IT professionals who are connected to the online examination,” she said. ISC student Vanshika Patil said, “I was juggling between my competitive exam preparation and the semester I exam but this postponement has skewed my timetable. I hope that the semester I exam is not rescheduled to December as my mock tests for the competitive exam will also be held by then.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/icse-isc-exams-uncertainty-skews-future-study-plans/articleshow/87169359.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Chennai||Civic body races to finish work, ensure a flood-free city||Chennai: Greater Chennai Corporation is working to ensure zero incidents of water stagnation in the city this monsoon. The civic body appointed IAS officers zonal level monitoring officials ahead of the monsoon, expected to set in around October 27, and has held three meetings to tackle the issue that invariably brings many areas to a standstill every year. The civic body maintains 31 canals of which 16 are in core city areas and 15 in extended areas. All canals have desilted before monsoon. About 620km of the 1,894km length drain network, that includes about 3,842 drains, has also been desilted, said an official adding that the numbers are updated every day as the work is ongoing. “We have men and machinery available and have deployed them in all zonal offices for emergency operations. Tree pruning is being carried out every day and we are monitoring the work closely by inspecting drains every day,” said commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. Critical locations where up to 2ft water stagnation is possible includes Kargil Nagar in Thiruvottiyur , Kailasam Street and Meenambal Nagar in Tondiarpet, Pullianthope High Road and Senthil Nagar in Thiru Vi Ka Nagar, Korattur North Avenue, Habibullah Road and R A Puram 1st Main Road in Teynampet, Bazullah Road, R K Shanmugam Salai in Kodambakkam, AGS Colony in Velachery, Selva Nagar and Semmencheri housing board in Sholinganallur and Ram Nagar and Mylai Balaji Nagar in Perungudi. “There were 306 such locations in 2015 and they have been reduced to 23 after several interventions including storm water drain construction and other infrastructure interventions. This year, apart from just constructing drains, we have focused more on de-clogging major inlet and outlet points of all drains, canals and lakes. We have also de-clogged silt catch pits on all streets to ensure water doesn’t stagnate at all. This work is being monitored daily by IAS officials,” said Rajendiran, chief engineer and in-charge of storm water drains department. He added that if there was inundation in some location due to reverse flow in the sea, the civic body will ensure that it is cleared in an hour using pumps and other machinery. Apart from this, meetings were conducted with all line departments including public works, forest, TNEB and revenue departments to ensure there is coordination during the monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/civic-body-races-to-finish-work-ensure-a-flood-free-city/articleshow/87161097.cms||---

Police said some unidentified thieves attempted to break the ATM between 2.15 am to 3.45 am on Tuesday. As per the complaint registered with the MIDC Sinnar police station, the thieves smashed the screen of the ATM in the attempt to steal the cash. The burglary attempt came to light only at around 9 am, when the owner of a shop next to the ATM kiosk noticed that the ATM was damaged. Soon after, the police and bank officials rushed to the spot and found the damaged screen. However, the cash box was safe. On the compliant of an official from the company responsible for the upkeep of the ATM, its security and loading cash, a complaint of theft has been registered against unidentified burglars. When the police and bank officials checked the CCTV footage of the adjoining shop, they found movement of unidentified burglars around the kiosk between 2.15 am to 3.45 am. Recently, on the night of October 14 and 15, an unidentified burglar stole Rs 22.71 lakh from an ATM in Sinnar taluka. The thief used a gas cutter to break open the ATM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/thieves-strike-atm-in-sinnar-fail-to-break-in/articleshow/87166516.cms||---

SK Pati, from the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), and Tejas Thackeray, from the Thackeray Wildlife Foundation, carried out the research and their research paper has been published in ‘Zoosystema’ journal published by the National Museum of Natural History, France. These freshwater crab species have been named Sahyadriana keshari, Sahyadriana inopinata, Sahyadriana tamhini, Ghatiana rouxi and Ghatiana durrelli. “I feel honoured to have named a stunning species — Ghatiana durrelli sp. nov. — endemic to Koyna and Amba ghat in the Sahyadris in Maharashtra after British naturalist Gerald Malcolm Durrell, who was a master conservationist. This paper is part of my long-standing collaboration with Pati that began in 2015 and this is our third publication together,” Thackeray said. “Four species of these crabs are endemic to Maharashtra. The Ghatiana rouxi is found in a handful of localities in Goa and Karnataka. Sahyadriana species are regional. Sahyadriana inopinata was found near the Dhobhi waterfall at Mahabaleshwar, while Sahyadriana keshari was found at Bramhagiri in Nashik. Sahyadriana tamhini was found in the Tamhini ghat region in western Maharashtra,” added Thackeray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/5-new-species-of-freshwater-crabs-recorded-in-western-ghats/articleshow/87166491.cms||---
---||Delhi||In state’s interest to ensure access to grain at subsidised prices: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi High court has asked the Delhi government to open a fair price shop (FPS) in the vicinity of a residential complex in Baprola to ensure that citizens do not have to go through “difficult areas” simply to get foodgrains at subsidised prices. “It is appropriate that the Delhi government open an FPS in the aforesaid place or in the immediate vicinity… so that the poorest of the poor are served well by the state. It is in the interest of the state to ensure that citizens do not have to chart their ways through difficult areas simply to get foodgrains at subsided prices,” Justice Najmi Waziri said in an order. The directive came in relation to a contempt plea by a petitioner who had moved court against non-compliance of an order of October 2019 in which the Delhi government and others were directed to examine the feasibility of opening of a fair price shop for the convenience of residents of Rajiv Ratan Awas Yojana Phase-II in Baprola on the outskirts of Najafgarh. The FPS that now serves them is approximately 2.5km away and women have to walk through deserted stretches and forest areas to fetch rations to feed their families, the petitioner’s counsel had said. The Delhi government’s counsel had said there were only 320 ration card holders in the residential area and, therefore, it might not be feasible for an FPS licensee to operate a shop with a small amount of margin money. The margin money is Rs 2 per kilogram of foodgrain supplied by an FPS. Ordinarily, each FPS caters to about 1,000 ration card holders, the counsel said. The petitioners’ counsel submitted that in special circumstances, an FPS could be opened for lesser numbers. She contended that relaxation in the guidelines could be considered in case of jhuggi-jhopdi clusters and other areas inhabited by poorer sections of the society. She further said more than 800 families had been seeking the opening of the shop in the area. A portion of a community centre in the residential area has already been earmarked for opening the FPS, the lawyer said, urging that the Delhi government should look into the matter afresh. The counsel added that the petitioner and others seeking the opening of an FPS belonged to the economically weaker section. Each morsel of food comes at a palpable cost to their safety and security, she submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-states-interest-to-ensure-access-to-grain-at-subsidised-prices-hc/articleshow/87170730.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur Municipal Corporation begins road repair works||KOLHAPUR: With the withdrawal of the monsoon, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has started the much-awaited road repair works, which are expected to be completed by November-end. Most of the small and big roads across the city were damaged in the heavy monsoon rainfall and floods. More than 120 road stretches were affected. The damaged roads were also causing traffic congestions at several locations and, therefore, urgent repair work was required. On Wednesday, the KMC started the work to restore the Tawade hotel entrance and the Lisha hotel road areas. The heavy-traffic roads will be repaired first. Harshit Ghatge, the deputy city engineer, said, “We have identified the stretches that need to be completely restored, the stretches where patchwork can be done, and the areas where new roads need to be built. Almost 74 stretches require new roads. The work orders have been issued to the contractors. The roads that were built recently but were damaged due to rain and floods too are being rebuilt. In such cases, the contractors are liable to get the roads repaired without any financial burden on the KMC. For patchwork, the civic body is using ready-mix material and not the murrum. Ghatge said since the monsoon has withdrawn, the ready-mix patchwork will be retained for a longer time. Some activists had demanded that the potholes not be filled with murrum. “We are spending over Rs 18 crore through Nagarotthan and other road work schemes to restore the roads. For the first time, we are spending such a huge amount. We are also awaiting more funds from the government to restore roads damaged due to other infrastructural works,” added Ghatge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kmc-begins-road-repair-works/articleshow/87166526.cms||---

---||Ranchi||CBI files chargesheet in Dhanbad judge death case||SINDRI: In a significant development, the CBI filed its first chargesheet in the judge Uttam Anand death case in Dhanbad on Wednesday. Sources said revealed that the probe agency filed chargesheet in the special CBI court against the autorickshaw driver Lakhan Verma and his accomplice Rahul Verma under sections 302, 201 and 34 (murder) of the IPC. Though the CBI has not named any conspirator behind the murder in its charge sheet, it has mentioned that there seems to be a deep conspiracy behind the crime and that the investigation into the case was still on. Both the accused were subjected to narco analysis and brain mapping in Gujarat by the CBI and interrogated different suspects lodged in different jails of the state. However, the agency is yet to conclude on who might have conspired to kill him and what action of the judge may have triggered his killing. Initially, the two accused confessed to having hit the judge in an inebriated condition. Later, CBI officials found some inconsistency in the statements of Rahul Verma, but nothing concrete has come out so far. Anand was hit from behind while he was jogging by the roadside by the autorickshaw driven by Lakhan Verma with Rahul sitting in the middle seat in Dhanbad on July 28. The CCTV footage of the incident clearly showed that the auto suddenly took a left turn, hit the judge from behind and then returned to the middle of the empty road in the early hours, raising suspicions that the incident might be a deliberate attempt to knock down the judge. The death of the judge created ripples in the judicial fraternity all over the country and even the Supreme Court Chief Justice took exception to it and called upon the authorities to ensure the safety of the judicial officials. Though the state government constituted a special investigating team (SIT) led by ADGP Sanjay Anand Latekar, the case was referred to CBI on orders from the Jharkhand high court which kept monitoring the case at regular intervals. The CBI is supposed to have filed the charge sheet within the stipulated 90-day period, which would end on October 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cbi-files-chargesheet-in-dhanbad-judge-death-case/articleshow/87169354.cms||Anil Ashutosh
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: After petrol, diesel now costs over Rs Rs 100 per litre in city; bus owners' association wants govt to cut taxes||RANCHI: Three days after the price of petrol per litre crossed the Rs 100 mark in the city, the price of diesel, too, touched a record high of Rs 100.17 on Wednesday. The spiralling fuel price hike is likely to impact a host of sectors like transport and prices of commodities among others. Talking to TOI, Pramod Kumar, the spokesperson of the Jharkhand Petroleum Dealers Association and proprietor of city-based Shambhavi Fuels, said, “The fresh price of diesel after rate revision has come into effect from Wednesday. Diesel is now Rs 100.17/L. On Tuesday, it was Rs 99.80/L. Petrol, on the other hand, has further spiked to Rs 100.58 from Rs 100.25 till a day ago.” The surge in fuel prices is like rubbing salt on the wounds of people who are battling job losses, slash in salaries and wages due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Anil Kumar, a medical representative, said he is forced to spend at least Rs 50 extra on his weekly petrol expense for client visits. “Our earnings primarily depend on the sales for which I need to undertake extensive client visits and do follow-ups. The hike in fuel prices have dented my budget as I am spending anywhere between Rs 50 and Rs 70 extra per week to refuel my bike,” he said. Ragini Kumari, a homemaker, added that the all-round inflation is affecting her kitchen budget every month. “Mustard oil has touched Rs 200, cooking gas is close to Rs 1,000, rates of vegetables are skyrocketing and unchecked fuel price will further add up to surge in prices of all commodities. On the contrary, a person’s monthly salary is static,” she rued. Kishore Mantri, the general secretary of the Ranchi Bus Owners’ Association, demanded that Jharkhand government must step in to the check price rise. He said, “The state government must cut down on its taxes on fuel to balance the price. It is only blaming the central government and running away from its responsibility. Meanwhile, we are in a catch-22 situation — if we increase the bus fares, passengers will opt for share cabs for long distances. If we don’t, we end up losing.” He further said, “Buses which ply on long routes daily must also be excluded from the daily toll taxes or the rates must be trimmed. I pay Rs 1,500 toll tax per bus daily while plying between Ranchi and Gaya. In one month, it comes to Rs 45,000. The government must reduce it to help us.” Mantri added that the government must also waive off the road tax and other permit fees for the four months of the lockdown during the second wave of the pandemic. The government is, however, non-committal on slashing the state VAT on petrol and diesel. Earlier, state finance minister Rameshwar Oraon had ruled out any slash in VAT stating that such a move will make it difficult for the government to fund its activities. “After the imposition of GST, states are left with hardly any avenue to earn taxes to run the government. So, the onus of slashing fuel prices lies with the Union government,” Oraon had told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/after-petrol-diesel-now-costs-over-rs-rs-100/ltr-in-city/articleshow/87169390.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Bihar-bound trains fully booked ahead of Diwali, Chhath||RANCHI: Ahead of Diwali and Chhat Puja, all Bihar-bound trains are witnessing a heavy booking rush and most express trains, which ply between Jharkhand and Bihar, have run out of tickets for journey dates between November 3 and November 8. Berths and seats in trains like Hatia-Purnea Court, Ranchi-Patna Jan Shatabdi Express, Hatia-Islampur, Hatia-Gorakhpur Maurya Express and Rourkela-Jainagar, Ranchi-Bhagalpur Express have already run out for journey dates between November 5 and November 8. Just a handful of them is available in AC coaches in a few select trains. Adding woes to the passengers’ problem is the railways’ decision not to restore the services of a few key trains on which the passengers rely heavily during the festive season. Jatin Kumar, a native of West Champaran of Bihar and living in Ranchi’s Morhabadi, said, “In trains like Jan Shatabdi and Maurya Express, the waiting lists have already crossed the three-digit mark. On the other hand, the railways is yet to restore the Ranchi-Patna-Pataliputra Express, Ranchi-Deoghar Intercity Express, which cater to passengers who live in places bordering Jharkhand.” Jatin Kumar, a native of West Champaran living in Ranchi’s Morhabadi, said. Another Bihar (Begusarai) resident, Amit Kumar Choubey, who is living in Lalpur here, said, “Every year, the railways run one or two festive special trains during Diwali. It was understandable that the trains were not run due to the Covid-19 pandemic last year, but it is beyond comprehension why there are no such special trains this year.” Prem Kataruka, the secretary of the Jharkhand Passengers’ Association, said, “On one hand, the railways is overcharging the passengers in the name of special trains and on the other, several trains are yet to be restored. It is a weird situation.” However, the chief public relations officer of the South Eastern Railways, Niraj Kumar, said, “During the festive season, extra coaches will be added in all trains to clear the extra rush.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bihar-bound-trains-fully-booked-ahead-of-diwali-chhath/articleshow/87169431.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Acting on local politician Ramrao Wagh's complaint, Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) held an inspection. “A total of 17 containers were found," Wagh said.The area belongs to Azossim comunidade. In his complaint to authorities, including revenue minister, GSPCB, and the local panchayat, Wagh alleged that the transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals is a serious issue and poses a threat to the natural habitat such as the state bird peacock. “It (peacock) is found abundantly in this area,” he said. A 15m wide road for a stretch of 50m has been constructed and suspicions are being raised it may be extended to an upcoming project in the area. “This amounts to encroachment and illegal use of Azossim comunidade land,” Wagh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chemicals-stored-on-hill-upsets-mandur-locals/articleshow/87170826.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||DAP shortage worries farmers in Punjab, Haryana||CHANDIGARH: As farmers in Punjab and Haryana prepare to sow wheat, the biggest rabi (winter-sown) crop in both states, they are worried over the shortage of chemical diammonium phosphate (DAP). Along with urea, DAP is the key fertiliser required for wheat, the sowing of which is likely to gain pace from the fourth week of October after the harvest of paddy in both states. According to information available on the Urvarak portal of the Union government’s department of fertilisers, the total requirement of urea for October in Punjab is 3.5 lakh metric tonne (LMT) and the supply is 4.17LMT. The portal states, against the requirement of 2.75LMT of DAP for the month, only 1.72LMT has been supplied till October 19 in Punjab – a deficit of 1.03LMT. Till October 19, 2.34 LMT of urea was supplied for the month in Haryana against the requirement of 2LMT while 1.07LMT of DAP has been supplied against the requirement of 1.1LMT. There is a marginal shortfall of 4,000 metric tonnes (MT). Both urea and DAP are crucial fertilisers needed for wheat that is grown over 35 lakh hectares in Punjab and 25 lakh hectares in Haryana. Farmers also apply muriate of potash (MOP) and nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulphur (NPKS) for rabi crops in both the states, which are the biggest contributors of wheat to India’s foodgrain buffer stock. For the month, 33,000MT of MOP has been supplied to Punjab till October 19 against the requirement of 20,000MT while the NPKS supply is 45,000MT against 30,000MT needed. In Haryana, 25,000MT of MOP has been supplied till October 19 against the monthly requirement of 6,000MT. Similarly, 18,000MT of NPKS has been supplied till October 19 against the required 15,000MT for the month. Punjab and Haryana have sent the requirement of 14.5LMT and 1LMT of urea, respectively, to the Union government for the rabi season till March 31, 2022, and have requisitioned 5.50LMT and 3LMT of DAP, respectively. Recommended fertilisr dosage for wheat According to farm experts, about 110kg of urea per acre and 55kg per acre of DAP are recommended for wheat. The recommended dosage of MOP is 20kg per acre. Urea is applied in two doses of 55kg each usually during first and second irrigation of wheat crop while DAP is applied while sowing. Experts suggest using MOP in the fields before sowing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dap-shortage-worries-farmers-in-punjab-haryana/articleshow/87170922.cms||Ikhhlaq Singh Aujla

The government has acted on a complaint filed by the deceased’s sister, who alleged that he was allured by some unknown persons and taken to Singhu, where he was murdered by some Nihangs on October 15 for alleged sacrilege. On Tuesday, Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa had called the lynching of Lakhbir, a Dalit Sikh from Tarn Taran, a possible conspiracy to defame the farmers’ agitation. The incident has kicked off a political storm after photographs of one of the Nihang leaders with Union minister N S Tomar surfaced on social media. Referring to the photographs, Randhawa said, “This has raised genuine doubts and suspicion in the minds of people which will need to be cleared and the Punjab government will do everything to reach to the root of the conspiracy and expose and punish the culprits.” As per the order issued by DGP Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota, ADGP-cum-director, bureau of investigation, Varinder Kumar will be the SIT chairman while DIG, Ferozepur Range, Inderbir Singh and SSP, Tarn Taran, Harvinder Singh will be members.

The case was registered on January 14, 2018, and Aman had got anticipatory bail from the Punjab and Haryana high court on October 13, 2020. The police had seized 910 kg ganja (cannabis) in 35 plastic sacks and arrested five persons on January 14, 2018. Three more were nominated the next day. Out of the eight accused, charges were presented in the court against six. As Aman was not among those against whom the challan was presented, police now claim that it will be done in a day or so. One accused has not been arrested so far. The CIA police of Barnala district, led by then sub inspector Baljit Singh, had stopped a truck on January 14, 2018, in the jurisdiction of Mehal Kalan police station and arrested five persons with 910 kg ganja. Police had nominated three others, including Aman Singh, in the case after their name figured during investigations. Aman could not be arrested and he had approached the high court for anticipatory bail, which he got on October 13, 2020. He had joined the investigations on October 17, 2020. CIA in-charge (now inspector) Baljit Singh confirmed that a case was registered and Baba Aman was among those nominated later. Mehal Kalan Police Station SHO Baljit Singh said, “There were eight accused in the case. Challan has already been presented in the court against six accused and one is yet to be arrested.

---||Nagpur||‘Bhandara’s vax feat bigger than that of Mumbai, Pune’||Nagpur: Bhandara district collector Sandeep Kadam has always led from the front. He worked hard initially to make the district first in the state to have no under-treatment patient on August 6 and now to bring it in top 3 of the vaccination coverage chart. Kadam said the district achieving 91% vaccine coverage is a big achievement and a success story of teamwork, strategy, and cooperation by people. How do you see Bhandara district completing at least one vaccination dose of 91% of the eligible population? We are third in the state after Mumbai and Pune. Our achievement in comparison with these two big cities deserves more accolades. This is because nearly 75,000 domicile residents of Bhandara district have migrated to other cities for professional and other purposes. This reduces the number of the eligible population from 8.98 lakh to 8.23 lakh. Of these, we have jabbed at least 8.1 lakh people. Mumbai and Pune have a significant population of migrants. Eventually, these districts will achieve more than 100% target of vaccination. But Bhandara, even if being a rural and tribal-dominated district, has achieved the feat. What was your strategy to vaccinate people scattered in different hamlets and villages? Reaching out to more and more people and engaging locals in the campaign was our strategy. Especially in villages, we involved teachers who enjoy good respect among masses. Not only on the block level, we also formed village and locality-level committees to convince people for vaccination. Our USP was the location of vaccine sessions. We selected locations so strategically that people from any locality could get a vaccination centre at walking distance. But there is vaccine hesitancy in people. How do you tackle it? Like other districts in Vidarbha, Bhandara also had some villages where people were reluctant in taking vaccines. We took a positive approach and made it a point to organize camps in villages attached to such places. Gradually, as people mixed up and through word of mouth, some residents of these reluctant villages also started taking interest in vaccination. They helped us in convincing others. Now, we have covered over 90% of the rural population. There are religious and community-level opposition to vaccines in many districts... Of course, some communities or people belonging to a particular religion were not cooperating earlier. So, we involved the religious leaders and educated doctors, teachers from the same community to deal with these people. These people believe in the word of religious leaders. So, they also cooperated later. What is your next target? We still have around 15,000 people unvaccinated. They are too much reluctant and spread in scattered pockets, so it’s not easy to target them. As a result, we have decided to focus on the second dose. We had given a record number of the first dose in the second half of August. All these people will become eligible for their second dose post-Diwali. You will see a record second dose in Bhandara by November-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bhandaras-vax-feat-bigger-than-that-of-mumbai-pune/articleshow/87168330.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||India||Prisoners spend up to 23 yrs on death row, take huge mental hit, says study||Death row prisoners could spend up to 23 years in jail and might have to wait up to 14 years for their sentence to be executed. This long incarceration and time spent agonising over the death penalty takes a heavy toll on prisoners who suffer from psychiatric illnesses and intellectual disability, according to a new study. The study conducted by Project 39A, a criminal justice program at the National Law University Delhi, also found that a majority of death row prisoners are from a disturbed family environment and one in two suffered physical or verbal abuse as children. It also found that 51 death row prisoners (62.2%) were diagnosed with at least one mental illness. The researchers interviewed 88 death row prisoners and their families. Project 39A executive director Anup Surendranath calls the theoretical approaches to punishment flawed. “At the core of the conversation around ‘blameworthiness’ is the unshakeable assumption that individuals act in a vacuum. However, there is now extensive research to show that this assumption is necessarily false and that individual actions are influenced by a whole host of factors involving social contexts, personal histories, psychological and developmental experiences etc.” The report ‘Deathworthy: A Mental Health Perspective of the Death Penalty’ — released on Wednesday — says of the 88 prisoners interviewed, 35% were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (the proportion of prisoners with MDD is about 11 times higher than that in the community population), 22% were diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, 20% suffered from substance use disorder and 6% screened for psychosis. Nine out of 83 prisoners were diagnosed with intellectual disability. The SC has often considered the emotional and mental agony of living with the uncertainty of the death sentence, as a factor in commuting the sentence after the rejection of mercy petition by the President but researchers say the torture for the prisoner begins as soon as he is sentenced to death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/prisoners-spend-up-to-23-yrs-on-death-row-take-huge-mental-hit-says-study/articleshow/87173050.cms||Himanshi Dhawan
---||Chandigarh||Rigid norms, little relief forcing farmers to exit crop cover plan||Karnal: In five years, the farmers’ registration under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has declined to about 59% in this district, more since the government made it optional. Earlier, buying crop insurance was compulsory for the farmers who had outstanding loan and its premium was deducted from their credit accounts. Figures secured from the district agriculture department suggest that the Union government had launched the scheme in 2016 with 54,350 subscribers but by Kharif (summer crop) season 2020-21, the count has dropped to 22,597. In these five years, the insurance companies collected more than Rs 14,292 lakh as premium from 3,77,238 farmers, who till more than 6,09,523 hectares in Karnal district alone. But the companies paid only a little more than Rs 8,901 lakh as claims to 55,219 farmers. The farmers say they have several reasons for quitting the scheme, the foremost being the norms fixed for compensation. The relief is calculated based on 70% of the entire village area, while they want every acre counted. Not all of the multiple factors that damage the crop are covered. For example, waterlogging doesn’t count, and they get no cover for it. Those who grow non-MSP crops claim they have no price security, so they are reluctant to sign up. Farmer Naresh of the Assandh subdivision said: "I did not opt for the PMFBY after 2018 when I lost almost 4 acres of Kharif crop but got no compensation despite paying the premium." Karnal agriculture department subdivisional officer (SDO) Dinesh Sharma said: "Earlier, crop insurance was mandatory for debtor farmers but now it is optional. However, non-loanee subscribers have increased. In 2016, we had only 1 farmer in this category and now we have 2,312 in 2021. In Karnal, 5,000 farmers await their insurance claims from the 2018 Kharif season. Running from pillar to post and moving the consumer forum haven’t helped. The insurance company rejected their claims over minor clerical errors by their banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rigid-norms-little-relief-forcing-farmers-to-exit-crop-cover-plan/articleshow/87171092.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Lakhimpur Kheri killings: ‘SC’s observations points at UP govt’s apathy’||Bathinda: The remarks of Supreme Court in Lakhimpur Kheri killings on conduct of impartial investigation speaks a lot, said Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Wednesday, hours after the resumed hearing in the case. The bench led by Chief Justice N V Ramana said it did not receive the report on the status of investigation in time, and that it never asked for such a report to be submitted in a sealed cover, which in itself is a welcome departure from earlier such instances. The bench also remarked that this (investigation) cannot be an unending story. The court asked UP government to dispel the feeling that it is dragging its feet. It asked pointed questions with regard to protection of witnesses. Asking why statements of all listed witnesses have not yet been recorded, why the most vulnerable witnesses who can be browbeaten have not been recognised and statements recorded. UP government had to commit to protection of witnesses, said the SKM while reacting to the arguments during the hearing. A fair investigation in this matter and securing justice are not possible with MoS for home Ajay Kumar Mishra is a Union Minister, stated SKM. It stated that as more reports emerge about a group of Nihang Sikhs having met Union agriculture ministers in the presence of other people with dubious antecedents, and even the offer of money for leaving the morcha sites, SKM reiterates its demand for a comprehensive investigation into the conspiracy related to Singhu border brutal murder on October 15. While the attempt to tarnish the image of the farmers’ movement has not succeeded, the true story behind the whole episode has to come out to reveal to the world what BJP is up to, said SKM. It said heavy rains in several parts destroyed the season-long effort and toil put in by farmers in different states. Thousands of hectares of paddy and other crops lie destroyed in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana and other places. Farmers of the entire Terai region have received a massive setback. SKM demands that the governments take up a comprehensive assessment of the damage being faced by farmers and pay them compensation immediately. It said to take forward the struggle for justice in Lakhimpur Kheri killings, many Kisan Asthi Kalash Yatras are underway right in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab. These yatras are strengthening the resolve of peasants to carry forward the struggle strongly as before.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/lakhimpur-kheri-killings-scs-observations-points-at-up-govts-apathy/articleshow/87171129.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Flyover span collapse: Rivals target Gadkari, Khopde points finger at NHAI contractors & officials||Nagpur: A political war of words has started after the collapse of a 30 metre segment of the one-km-long Kalamna bridge, which is part of the Pardi flyover project being constructed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). On Wednesday, major political parties voiced concerns over the incident demanding action against the NHAI officials and the contractors Gannon Dunkerley & Company Limited (GDCL) and SMS Infrastructure Limited for alleged shoddy work and negligence in the construction. Shiv Sena district deputy chief Yashwant Guddu Rahangdale, city chief Nitin Tiwari, Deepak Kapse and other party activists raised slogans against Union highways minister Nitin Gadkari, BJP MLA from East Nagpur, Krishna Khopde, and the contractors. On October 8, Khopde was part of the team that inspected the entire project. The MLA was all praise for the NHAI. He also walked one km along the Kalamna bridge, part of which collapsed on Tuesday night. While there was no reaction coming from Gadkari, Khopade said, “No doubt the incident is unfortunate. It must have happened due to negligence of the contractors or officials. But I took information from NHAI officials and gave a feedback to Gadkari, following which he ordered an inquiry to be conducted by NHAI’s Delhi head office and experts from VNIT.” Taking on the rivals, Khopade said that let the findings of the inquiry come. “The NCP-Congress and Shiv Sena, who neither pursued the Pardi flyover project nor worked for the city’s development, should not play politics over the issue,” he said. “It is a pity that the Rs 650 crore project launched in 2014 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in a mess now. Ironically, Gadkari, who makes tall claims about the quality of work done by NHAI, has met this fate in his own constituency,” said Rahangdale. NCP corporator Duneshwar Pethe demanded resignation of Gadkari. In a memorandum to NHAI regional officer Rajeev Agrawal, he demanded a “transparent” audit of the work done by the contractors and suspension of the project director. “The contractors should be booked. Unless an audit is done, the contractors must not be allowed to work,” Pethe said. Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Sanghatana leader Prashant Pawar and others had a wordy duel with Agrawal who had on October 8 dubbed GDCL as one of the best companies in construction of bridges. “However, 12 days later a portion of the same bridge has collapsed. The NHAI has already done the billing for the work,” said Pawar. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) activists also staged protests in the evening at the site and demanded action against the guilty. “Crores of rupees are being spent on such big projects and if this is the end result, it smacks of corruption. Collapsing of a bridge is not natural. Certainly it is a case of goof-up by the officials and contractors,” said Devendra Wankhede, Vidarbha convenor of AAP. People’s Republican Party (PRP) leader Jaydeep Kawade alleged large-scale corruption in the Pardi flyover project. “Over 160 people have died in accidents due to incomplete projects. The NHAI officials promised to open three flyovers of the project by January 2022, but now it also seems unlikely.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/flyover-span-collapse-rivals-target-gadkari-khopde-points-finger-at-nhai-contractors-officials/articleshow/87168461.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Chandigarh||Farm outfits for SC judge-headed panel||Bathinda: A total of 32 farmer organisations of Punjab have demanded setting up of a probe panel headed by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court to look into the “conspiracy” behind the brutal killing of a person at Singhu border on October 15. Till the probe is under way, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and minister of state Kailash Chaudhary should be asked to tender resignations, organisations said. This is needed in view of pictures of the Union ministers appearing in a section of press with Nihang Sikh leader Aman Singh, who allegedly approved the killing, they claimed. In the meeting headed by farmer leader Harmeet Singh Kadian, a 5-members committee was formed to look into the episode and was asked to submit a report within the next three days. “The committee comprises farm leaders Kanwalpreet Singh Pannu, Baldev Singh Sirsa, Kaka Singh Kotda, Pargat Singh and Jatinder Singh Chhina,” said Harmeet Kadian, who urged farmer activists to reach in large numbers at the borders of Delhi to stand against those forces working against the farmer struggle. In the meeting, it was decided that the ashes of the farmers killed at Lakhimpur Kheri will be immersed at Kiratpur Sahib, Goindwal Sahib and Hussainiwala on October 24. Various yatras would be taken out in Malwa, Majha and Doaba region. The farm leaders said the Centre had allowed procurement of paddy with 19% moisture content. Kadian said due to rains in September and October, the moisture content is more, which is why the central government must give relaxation on that count.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-outfits-for-sc-judge-headed-panel/articleshow/87171216.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chandigarh||Amritsar (North) candidature: AAP chooses ‘wait & watch’||Amritsar: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leadership has continuously held brainstorming sessions to mull over the name of party candidate from Amritsar North assembly constituency from where party’s new joinee former inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh has been working since June. Sources said during the recent Amritsar visits of AAP’s national leaders, including Delhi chief minister and deputy chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, detailed discussions had been held on the candidature of Kunwar in light of reports of the internal survey. “For now, we are of view that Kunwar will be fielded from Amritsar North unless Congress brings in deputy chief minister O P Soni from Amritsar Central constituency to Amritsar North,” said sources. At present, Amritsar North assembly constituency is represented by Congress MLA Sunil Dutt, but he himself is facing challenge from another Congressmen ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. “We have received reports that Congress could even field Soni from the constituency, but we have to wait and watch,” said a senior AAP source, adding that ensuring victory of Kunwar was a matter of prestige for the party which was also delaying the decision. Talking to TOI on Wednesday, AAP spokesperson Gurbhej Singh said, “The former IPS officer who has earlier joined AAP is working relentlessly in not just Amritsar North assembly constituency, but in other constituencies too.” While refusing to divulge the reports of internal surveys on Amritsar North assembly constituency, he said the party was likely to announce its candidates by November. “We don’t believe doing politics on faces, but on the issues and it was only after AAP took up the issue of free electricity that Congress announced the similar step in desperation,” he alleged. Before the announcement of Joshi as SAD candidate from Amritsar North constituency, AAP’s local leadership would admit fielding Kunwar from Amritsar North, but they immediately changed their stance once Joshi’s candidature was announced by Akalis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amritsar-north-candidature-aap-chooses-wait-watch/articleshow/87171246.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||World||UK, New Zealand approve trade deal; hope it opens more doors||LONDON: Britain agreed to a trade deal with New Zealand on Wednesday, eliminating tariffs on a wide range of goods as the UK seeks to expand economic links around the world following its exit from the European Union. The deal was cemented in a conference call between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his New Zealand counterpart, Jacinda Ardern, after 16?months of talks by negotiators. Although trade with New Zealand accounts for only 0.2% of the UK's trade, Britain hopes it will help open the door toward membership in the trans-Pacific trade partnership. The partnership, which includes Japan, Canada, and Vietnam, had GDP of 8.4 trillion pounds ($11.6 trillion) in 2020. ``This is a great trade deal for the United Kingdom, cementing our long friendship with New Zealand and furthering our ties with the Indo-Pacific,'' Johnson said? ``It will benefit businesses and consumers across the country, cutting costs for exporters and opening up access for our workers.'' In New Zealand, where it was Thursday when the announcement came, Ardern said the deal was among the best ever achieved by New Zealand and would boost the nation's economy by about 1 billion New Zealand dollars ($720 million) as it opens the way for more sales of the country's wine, butter, cheese and beef. ``This is a historic but substantial deal and it's been achieved basically in a year,'' Ardern said. "That has never been done before.'' Trade officials in the UK trumpeted the benefits of the deal, declaring that sauvignon blanc wine, Manuka honey and kiwi fruit from New Zealand would be cheaper for British consumers. Clothing, buses and bulldozers will also no longer face tariffs. British farmers expressed disquiet, however, saying the deal, together with another signed with Australia earlier this year, would mean significant extra volumes of imported food at a time when labor shortages and rising costs are already hurting many UK farmers. ``This could damage the viability of many British farms in the years ahead, to the detriment of the public, who want more British food on their shelves, and to the detriment of our rural communities and cherished farmed landscapes,'' National Farmers Union President Minette Batters said. ``Instead of repeating the refrain that these deals will be good for British agriculture, our government now needs to explain how these deals will tangibly benefit farming, the future of food production and the high standards that go along with it on these shores,'' Batters said. Asked if the deal meant New Zealand would be less reliant on China for its exports, Ardern said diversification would improve options and resilience for its exporters. There remain some hurt feelings in New Zealand after Britain joined what was then the European Economic Community back in 1973, leaving many New Zealand exporters feeling abandoned. Ardern said the new deal meant that perhaps it was time to draw a line under that period of history. Some of the details of the deal are still being finalized, and officials expect it to come into effect next year. Johnson's Conservative government has been focused on negotiating free trade deals around the world in an effort to boost economic growth following Brexit. The biggest prize would be a trade deal with the United States, although a deal with America seems far off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-new-zealand-approve-trade-deal-hope-it-opens-more-doors/articleshow/87173183.cms||---

The directives came after petitioner Arun Patil, himself a lawyer, submitted an application pointing out that an accident took place on the highway on October 3, where four persons were killed after a car jumped the road divider and rammed into a bus stop after losing control in the afternoon. The petitioner through counsel Firdos Mirza claimed that the deadly mishap took place as the driver was trying to avoid a pothole. The vehicle was driven at breakneck speed by a trainee doctor and left an elderly woman severely injured near Satnaviri under the jurisdiction of the Kondhali police. “This accident, as stated in the application, took the lives of four human beings and injured many more. No reply to this application has been filed. We grant time to respondents to file a reply to this application,” the judges said. NHAI counsel Aneesh Kathane informed that Kondhali police had provided only an FIR copy, but did not supply spot panchanama and statements of witnesses. “We direct the police to supply copies of the spot panchnama and other documents. They should also submit the case diary of the accident in court,” the bench said while directing additional government pleader Deepak Thakare to convey the HC orders to the cops. Earlier, the respondents, including NHAI, filed a reply regarding imposition of the proposed penalty against erring contractors who failed to maintain the road. “The reply stated that a penalty has been proposed to be imposed upon IRB, Talegaon-Amravati (Tollways) Limited, one of the concessionaires, for not maintaining the stretch between Talegaon and Amravati. However, it is not stated whether the proposed penalty has been recovered. The respondents need to clarify the issue,” the justices said, before adjourning the hearing by two weeks. Patil’s application came during the hearing of his own PIL (No 22/2019) highlighting the pathetic condition of the Amravati-Akola-Jalgaon road and Wardha-Sindhkhed Raja road which led to many fatal mishaps and loss of precious lives. According to the petitioner, the NHAI had awarded the contract for constructing the Amravati-Akola-Jalgaon stretch to a private firm which went bankrupt and since then the work was stopped a couple of years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-seeks-reply-from-nhai-over-deadly-mishap-due-to-pothole/articleshow/87170367.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||NHAI launches probe into flyover collapse||Nagpur: A day after the collapse of a segment of the Pardi flyover between Kalamna and HB Town, a one-member team of Alok Kumar, member (administration) NHAI, launched a probe into the incident. On Tuesday night, a 30-metre segment of the superstructure, said to be around 1,000 tonnes, collapsed, raising question mark over the quality of the works. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials were quiet about Kumar’s visit. “The high-level technical expert committee shall investigate the incident and necessary steps will be taken after submission of the report by the committee,” a NHAI release stated. The work of Pardi flyover is being executed by a joint venture of Gannon Dunkerley & Company Limited (GDCL) and city-based SMS Infrastructure Limited. The superstructure of the flyover slipped from Pier P7 and fell to the ground. The other end of the segment is still on Pier P8. A lateral upward movement was found towards Pier P8. NHAI officials said the reasons for this failure are not clear at this point of time. Prime facie, it appears that the bearings below the segment have failed. However, the exact reason will be found after detailed investigation by the technical committee. When the mishap occurred, no work was being carried out on the flyover. Due to the collapse, the adjacent box girder P8-P9 also moved longitudinally from the centre of the pedestal towards P10. There was no damage seen on the adjacent span on either side. The officials said the gradient between piers P7-P8 (30 metres span) was of M55 grade of concrete used for superstructure and pedestal. The segment between P7-P8 was launched on January 20, 2018, and fixed on April 13, 2018. NHAI said, “All the tests at the time of erection have been done by the authority engineer LASA, Mumbai. The bearing was manufactured by Metal Engineering & Treatment Company Private Limited (METCO) and the HT Strand used was from Usha Martin.” Sources said Ramakant Ingle, a VNIT professor with applied mechanics department, also visited the spot to inspect the cause of the collapse. Sources said VNIT’s team differed with NHAI views on bearing theory. It felt that looking at the collapsed superstructure the concrete looked proper. Such a huge structure generally doesn’t fall due to bearing faults. How it slipped needs to be studied, which needs more time, they said. The VNIT experts felt it is perhaps the first such collapse which will need non-destructive testing (NDT), involving the process of inspecting, testing and evaluating materials and components. VNIT will certify all the remaining structures to avoid more such incidents. Sources said the collapsed structure has gone waste now and will have to be replaced. One of the theories doing the rounds is that Gannon Dunkerley & Company, which claims to be the best in bridge construction, cut the bearing locks, which led to the slipping of the superstructure. GDCL officials in Mumbai promised to answer TOI’s queries but did not respond till the filing of this report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nhai-launches-probe-into-flyover-collapse/articleshow/87170416.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Goa||Monsoon set to withdraw on October 23, light rainfall forecast across Goa||PANAJI: Conditions are turning favourable for a further withdrawal of the south-west monsoon from remaining parts of the country from October 23, the India meteorological department (IMD) said on Wednesday. Currently the conditions are favourable for a further withdrawal of the south-west monsoon from North-east India; entire north Bay of Bengal, remaining parts of West Bengal, some parts of central Bay of Bengal, remaining parts of Odisha, some parts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, entire of Goa, some parts of Karnataka and some parts of central Arabian Sea by around October 23. “Rainfall activity is yet to stop in the close-lying regions such as Karnataka and some parts of Telangana. These regions are expected to experience the withdrawal of rainfall,” IMD scientist Rahul M said. The withdrawal of the monsoon was delayed this year due to the formation of a low-pressure area that recently formed along the coast of Andhra Pradesh and south Odisha. The system’s movement was north-westward and continued with the rainfall activity in the Telangana region. Now the withdrawal line is expected to come even up to the northern parts of Karnataka. The normal date of withdrawal for Goa is October 14 while the complete withdrawal of monsoon over India takes place by October 15. This year’s delay however is not the most delayed monsoon. In 2020 the monsoon withdrew from Goa on October 28 while in 2019 it withdrew on October 16. In 2018 the withdrawal date was October 25. The IMD has also forecast light rainfall activity over Goa on October 22 and 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/monsoon-set-to-withdraw-on-oct-23-light-rainfall-forecast-across-state/articleshow/87170511.cms||---
---||Nagpur||In a first, eateries to operate till midnight||Nagpur: Probably for the first time in the district, restaurants and hotels have been allowed to operate till midnight. A decision on extension of timings of wine shops and bars is likely on Thursday. As per the latest guidelines of the state government, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and collector R Vimala issued orders on Wednesday for implementation of increase in timings. For other establishments the closing time is now 11pm. The revised timings came into effect from Wednesday itself. Till Tuesday, everything had to be shut by 10 pm. Treasurer of Nagpur Eatery Owners’ Association Mandeep Singh Padam told TOI that extension till midnight is “a historic and welcome move”. “Before Covid-19 set in, eateries were permitted to remain open till 11.30pm. An additional one hour was permitted for clearance. We will request the authorities that this should be now 1-1.30 am,” he said. Padam added hoteliers should comply with all Covid-19 guidelines. “Home delivery has been allowed for 24 hours and should be continued,” he said. Welcoming the move, hotelier Rahul Modi said, “We have incurred huge financial losses due to lockdown, consistent revision in timings and not being allowed to function till late evening. The extension will also benefit people as they will get their choice of food till midnight. Also, a large number of staff working in eateries can hope to go back to old salaries. The midnight timing should be made permanent,” he said. Modi also feels that the extended timing will help comply with all guidelines. “Now it will be easier to maintain 50% capacity as customer entry can be staggered,” he said. The district administration did not issue revised order for bars and wine shops on Wednesday. Sources from the district administration and excise department said timings of bars and wine shops too will be up to midnight. Hotelier Jasbir Singh Arora said bars should be allowed to remain open till 1.30am. “It was permitted before the pandemic,” he said.

The councillors unanimously agreed to this at a council meeting held recently under chairperson Mario Rebello. Rebello said fees in the form of shop rentals, taxes under various heads including house tax, licence fees for shops, shacks, spaces, signboards etc amount to over Rs 2 crore. The council also resolved to appoint a recovery team to start collecting taxes and fees from next week. When made aware that the house tax has not been revised and verification of houses not conducted for nearly 25 years, the councillors agreed that the house tax has to be revised and increased. The council also deliberated on shifting municipal offices to make room for reconstruction of the municipal building. It has also decided to fill up pending clerical posts including LDCs, drivers, stenographer among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/canacona-council-to-seal-shops-of-tax-evaders/articleshow/87170548.cms||---

In recent years, incidences of breaches in the Tillari canal on the Maharashtra end has grown increasingly frequent, allegedly due to poor maintenance by officials of the neighbouring state. Though repair work has begun, Bardez and Pernem taluka will face drinking water shortage till such time that the works are completed and flow of water into Goa resumes from Tillari. “Due to shortage of raw water supply to Assonora water treatment plant, Bardez taluka will have restricted water supply till the restoration of supply from Tillari irrigation canal, due to the breach in Tillari canal,” the PWD said in a notice on Wednesday. Minister for ports Michael Lobo led a delegation in protest to the PWD headquarters. “It has been years now that we are facing water shortage along the North Goa coastal belt. It has been five years since Manohar Parrikar as chief minister announced in the assembly in 2017 that he will augment the capacity of the Assonora plant. The works have even been tendered, but the work order has not been issued till date. We do not want free water. We have no supply in the first place,” Lobo said, taking a potshot at chief minister Pramod Sawant’s scheme of 16,000 litres of free water per month. “We need a plan of action. I have told the PWD principal chief engineer that I will get the works cleared from the CM whether it is Rs 150 crore or Rs 180 crore, but the problem needs to be resolved. The incidents of breaches in the Tillari canal are growing increasingly frequent. Does it mean that we will not receive water supply each time,” he said. Meanwhile, Morjim locals also threatened to protest if supply was not restored to them soon. “We are receiving a very thin flow of water, that too at 2am and 3am. Should we sit through the night to fill up water for storage? This water too is muddy. We are, however, getting the water bills on time. We have complained to the panchayat, the MLA, but no one is interested in resolving our issue,” a local said. The left main canal of the Tillari dam developed a breach last week at Maneri-Dodamarg and repairs by the Sindhudurg irrigation department began on Monday. Sawant has already initiated the process of laying a pipeline from Tillari reservoir in Maharashtra to the Goa border. This is meant to help Goa overcome frequent canal breaches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bardez-pernem-stare-at-acute-water-shortage-after-breach-in-tillari-canal/articleshow/87170519.cms||---

As part of an altered evaluation pattern for this year, two terminal exams will be conducted by the board due to the pandemic and in line with the provisions of the National Education Policy (NEP). As per the schedule released, the first terminal exam of the board for Class X will be held from December 1. The second terminal exam is tentatively expected to begin from April 4, 2022.For Class XII, the first term exam will start from December 8, while the second term exam will begin from March 18, 2022. “This pattern of having two assessments by the board in a year will continue for at least two years as of now. It is expected to reduce the stress for students and this pattern is in light of recommendations of the NEP. This is a student-friendly step,” said Goa Board chairperson Bhagirath Shetye. It is also expected to help the board evaluate students better in case a single public exam, as was being held until now, cannot take place due to the pandemic. The board exams in 2021 could not be held due to the second wave. The last date for students to register without late fees is November 1. Besides the two exams conducted by the board, the schools will also carry out their own internal assessments. The results of the internal assessments and the two board terminal exams will be all taken into account to prepare the students’ final marksheet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/class-x-class-xii-1st-term-board-exams-in-december/articleshow/87170568.cms||---

On Monday, Bengaluru recorded only 83 new cases, the figure dipping below the 100-mark for the first time in close to 16 months. The last time the capital city had less than 100 cases was on June 20, 2020, when 94 cases were reported. With the virus getting more virulent by the day, the city had breached the 500 mark on June 30, 2020 marking the beginning of the first wave. Although daily positive cases dipped, especially in January and February this year, when the first wave receded, the lowest number of cases reported in a day in the city was 196 in mid-February. Thereafter, cases began increasing, the surge turning into mayhem which reached a crescendo at the height of the second wave in April. Bengaluru has been consistently clocking 150-240 cases daily over the past two weeks. The last time daily figures were so low was in July 2020. On October 3, the city recorded less than 200 cases for the first time since February. More than 200 people have tested positive only on six days so far this month. On Wednesday, the city reported 253 cases, but officials attributed it to the “usual midweek spike”. Experts say two factors have contributed to the ebb in cases. First, since Bengaluru was the epicentre of the second wave, lakhs of its residents were infected and gained natural immunity in the process. Second, one of out of every two Bengalureans is fully vaccinated against the virus. The daily test positivity rate has been less than 0.4% for more than a week now and experts TOI spoke with said the city is fairly insulated against a third wave, unless a new highly virulent variant that is resistant to the vaccine emerges in the days ahead. Gaurav Gupta, BBMP chief commissioner, said Herculean efforts of people linked to the public health system and cooperation from the public besides vaccination coverage, resulted in the decline in cases. More than 85% of Bengaluru’s adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine and 53% has got both doses. “This is very creditable and the highest in any of the metros,” said Gupta. Gupta added: “Discipline among people and adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour along with the gradual lifting of the lockdown and restrictions have helped stabilise the situation. Aggressive vaccination coverage by utilising the capacity of the government system and the private health sector has been instrumental.” D Randeep, commissioner, health and family welfare department, called it a collective achievement of the government and public. “People came forward to report symptoms and get tested,” Randeep said. “Containment zones were strictly enforced, and the numbers were brought down to three for it to be labelled a cluster. We did not miss any containment zone. Also, vaccination has been a game changer.” He said genomic sequencing of cases confirms that there is no new variant of the novel coronavirus in circulation and this has injected authorities with a healthy dose of confidence. “There were only three samples infected with the Delta plus variant, while the rest were all Delta and its variants,” said Randeep. No room for complacency However, Gupta admitted Covid-appropriate behaviour has slipped a bit now that the fear of the virus has receded. “But people have to wear a mask when they go out. It not only a safe but a healthy habit,” he said. Dr MK Sudarshan, chairperson, state Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said the decline in the number of cases in the city must not lead to Covid-appropriate behaviour being ignored. “The virus is still around us and neither can we let our guard down nor become complacent,” Dr Sudarshan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/new-covid-19-cases-in-bengaluru-drop-to-pre-first-wave-levels/articleshow/87173306.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Satarkar said the commission will organise various programmes to raise awareness about the act and will try its best to reach out to every citizen. Since taking charge six months ago, the newly-constituted commission has already commenced holding hearings in morning and evening sessions and has disposed of almost 124 cases including appeals, complaints and penalty matters, he said. Satarkar said the commission is working towards disposal of the maximum number of cases in terms of the spirit of the Right to Information Act. The commission’s revamped website, gsic.goa.gov, was also launched. Apart from information on the act, the website contains information on rules framed by the government, judgements and other details regarding the act. The website also includes a section on frequently asked questions. The website however has some setbacks. The complex format of judgements, which doesn’t permit citizens to search for judgements on appeals, complaints and penalty matters datewise, has been retained. Also, it doesn’t upload the cause list for the day’s hearings for citizens. The commission’s contact number, located at the very bottom of the page, is also almost a blink-and-miss feature. The state government had approved grants in aid to the commission in 2009. The amount provided under the relevant budget head to the commission for 2021-22 stands at Rs 2 crore. This amount will cover salaries, office expenses, wages, advertising and minor works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-depts-told-to-update-websites-with-relevant-info/articleshow/87170598.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A delegation led by party joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami met Ravi at Raj Bhavan. “A representation has been submitted to the governor, detailing the malpractices of the DMK and how it murdered democracy. The state election commission acted as a mere puppet in the hands of the DMK government,” the former chief minister told reporters later. He alleged that the AIADMK winners were announced as losers by the officials, while the rival DMK candidates were declared elected. The party moved the court after it failed to evoke any response from the commission for a free and fair poll, but even the court directions were not implemented by the commission. The petition alleged that violations were committed at every stage of the election such that the ruling party would have a clear advantage over other parties. At the behest and insistence of the ruling party, the bureaucracy made a mockery of the election process, and nominations of many AIADMK candidates were rejected. Ministers and MLAs held meetings with poll officials, violating the model code of conduct. “The ruling party openly distributed cash and other benefits to public to procure votes,” the AIADMK alleged. Palaniswami said that he also took up the issue of ‘deterioration’ of law and order in the state with the governor. He said he was “anguished over the silence of the media,” and recalled an alleged incident of a minister’s assistant slapping a traffic police in Tuticorin district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aiadmk-complains-to-tamil-nadu-governor-on-local-body-polls/articleshow/87173215.cms||---

He said electricity switch boxes found without covers on poles can also be reported on the same number. “The complaints can be registered on 1912, the department’s call centre, which will then direct the complaint to the sub-division concerned,” Cabral stated in response to questions by Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco over open switch boxes posing a risk to people, especially children. “Line staff are instructed to inspect open switch boxes and rectify the same at the earliest,” Cabral said, responding to the question over whether the department has proactively conducted inspection drives of such open switch boxes. When asked for details of switch boxes in Salcete whose front cover is missing, Cabral said that it is a “continuous process and that street light junction boxes found without covers are either fitted with new covers or replaced.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/report-streetlights-lit-during-day-open-switch-boxes-on-1912/articleshow/87170625.cms||---
---||Goa||Underground cable repairs done on priority: Cabral||Panaji: All major faults in low- and high-tension cable are repaired immediately on priority basis either using a fault detecting machine or by outsourcing the work, power minister Nilesh Cabral told the House on Tuesday during question hour. He was replying to a question by Nuvem MLA Wilfred D’Sa over the details and location of the fault detecting machines for underground cabling. To detect faults in 11KV and low tension underground cable in the Nuvem constituency, there is one machine available at the department’s sub-division in Benaulim, Cabral said, adding that for LT consumer cable faults, estimates have been sanctioned for Nuvem, Verna and Nagoa and tendering is in process. To a question by Santa Cruz MLA Tony Fernandes, he listed out several underground cabling projects that are in the process of being tendered for both Santa Cruz and Merces as also those where the work order has already been placed. “All the works are proposed for completion within a period of one year once tendering formalities are completed and as per availability of funds.” On a question related to a few houses yet to be linked to underground power cables in the Curtorim constituency, Cabral said that the 150 connections in ward 24 of the Margao Municipal Council are “anticipated to be completed by December end”. Cabral also said that the Tamnar project will help the state draw more power. Presently, in the event of any 220kV line tripping, scheduled maintenance or breakdowns, the state has to enforce load shedding as the available transfer capability (ATC) of the interstate transmission lines is 690MW, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/underground-cable-repairs-done-on-priority-cabral/articleshow/87170602.cms||---

A press note by Konkan Railway said, “TTEs are equipped with SBI’s YONO merchant app, an android based app which is installed in the handset. Instead of collecting cash from passengers towards excess fare tickets, TTEs are now authorised to accept digital payment through QR code generated in the YONO App.” Passengers will be requested to scan the QR code and make the payment through any digital mode — BHIM, Paytm, Google Pay, Phone Pay, etc. On successful transaction, excess fare ticket will be issued to the passengers in the train. The application was launched recently at Ratnagiri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/konkan-railway-ttes-to-accept-digital-payments/articleshow/87170644.cms||---

More than 500MLD of water is treated for supply in the state daily, but this still falls short of the requirement currently. PWD also saw 2,481 complaints of drinking water supply being cut off, which in most cases was caused by a breakdown in the pipeline. As per Pauskar’s reply, the work on 15MLD water treatment plants are in progress in Porvorim and Chandel in Pernem. Similarly the construction of a 25MLD water treatment plant at Ganjem on the Mhadei river s expected to be completed by December 2022. The state will also be tendering work for the construction of a 30MLD water treatment plant in Tuem, Mandrem soon. This plant, along with enhancement in capacity of the Chandel plant is expected to resolve Pernem’s water shortage. Currently Pernem has only one 15MLD plant at Chandel serving the entire taluka. The growing tourism sector in Pernem’s coastal belt of Morjim, Mandrem, Ashvem and Arambol has further increased the demand for water in the taluka, resulting in shortages. PWD will also be augmenting the capacity of the Assonora water treatment plant by another 30MLD. The plant meets the water requirement of Bardez taluka and parts of Bicholim. The work is in the process of being tendered. Estimation work has been initiated for a 15MLD plant to serve the Pilerne industrial estate area. A new 15MLD plant has also been planned near the Siolim bridge area, Pauskar stated in his reply. PWD will additionally be installing a pressure filter to be able to supply 10MLD more to the Pale area, while another pressure filter to supply a similar quantity of water will be fitted at Podocem in Sattari. Keri and Bhironda areas will also get pressure filters to enhance supply in the area by 2MLD and 1MLD, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-augment-treated-water-supply-to-168mld/articleshow/87170651.cms||---

They also complained about several trees being cut. Locals led by Tony Rodrigues and Taleigao Congress block committee members alleged that a 15m-wide vertically inclined access road is being illegally built by cutting the hill at Satismo waddo in Taleigao. At the site, the construction of a house is also underway. “The illegal road access is purely done to benefit the private individual and this road acts only as a private access to the under construction house,” the letter stated. The letter stated that many trees have been cut without due permissions from the forest department in a bid to aid the construction, and that they are lying around at the site. “The illegal access and hill cutting have been done without necessary permissions from the competent authorities. The construction of the illegal road/access as well as hill cutting is in violation of the law and no permissions have been obtained from the competent authorities. The panchayat and the local ward members have turned a blind eye and is probably hand in glove with the illegal activity. Such acts of hill cutting damages the natural balance and there is great likelihood of soil erosion, landslides which might endanger the neighbouring houses,” the letter read. The letter demanded that the people carrying out the act be stopped from doing so and legal action be initiated against them. The letter also demanded that the forest officials inspect the site and direct the police to register an FIR under section 17A of the town and country planning department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unauthorised-hill-cutting-in-taleigao-locals-raise-alert/articleshow/87170681.cms||---

The order comes following a complaint lodged by the Calangute Constituency Forum (CCF). The CCF, through a resident of Candolim, had filed the complaint in March alleging that a beachside club at Vaddy, Candolim, had been constructed by damaging the beach, sand dunes and beach vegetation. According to the CCF, the structures comprised a restaurant, wash rooms, swimming pool, a deck and other amenities. Following the complaint, the GCZMA had issued a show cause notice to the owner of the beach club, but they failed to appear for any of the hearings. As the owners failed to respond, the GCZMA recently passed an order stating, “The authority is of the opinion that major environmental damage is being caused in the property under consideration and inorder to avoid further environmental damage, the property needs to be sealed and commercial operations should be stopped immediately.” However, despite the GCZMA order dated October 14, the beach club premises have not yet been sealed as of Wednesday evening, CCF president Premanand Divkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/coastal-body-orders-beachside-club-at-candolim-to-be-sealed/articleshow/87170801.cms||---

The daily case positivity rate hit an all time low — 0.94% — for the month. Six patients were hospitalised and and equal number were discharged. The recovery rate marginally increased to 97.78%. In South Goa, 13 centres had a caseload of less than 20 cases each, while the Madkai primary health centre had zero cases. The caseload of other centres was also low, below 50, and only the Margao urban health centre had 69 active cases. In North Goa, the scene was not different, and all had less than 50 cases each, while centres at Casarvarnem and Mayem had the least cases. Meanwhile, a total of 6,402 people were vaccinated of Tuesday of which 845 received their first dose and 5,578 their second.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: AIADMK files plaint against V K Sasikala for identifying as general secretary||CHENNAI: The AIADMK on Wednesday hit back at ousted leader V K Sasikala by lodging a police complaint, challenging her proclamation as party general secretary. In a complaint given to the Mambalam inspector in Chennai on Wednesday, former minister and AIADMK organisational secretary D Jayakumar sought action against Sasikala and her “accomplices” for “cheating by impersonation, promoting disharmony, enmity and hatred and circulating statements with intent to cause fear or alarm”. Jayakumar hit out at Sasikala for unveiling a plaque with an engraving identifying her as AIADMK general secretary at party founder M G Ramachandran’s memorial in his T Nagar residence on October 17, the party founding day. Recalling the dispute over the AIADMK’s two-leaves symbol and leadership, Jayakumar said after the demise of former CM J Jayalalithaa, the Election Commission of India had declared that the group led by O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami was the “real AIADMK” and was entitled to use the party symbol. Sasikala approached the Delhi high court and later the Supreme Court staking claim, but her petition was dismissed. “Having lost her claim to the party before various forums, Sasikala has taken law into her hands with intent to create chaos, confusion and disharmony by dishonestly portraying herself as general secretary of the AIADMK. Sasikala has nothing to do with the AIADMK,” Jayakumar said. Jayakumar further alleged that Sasikala, masquerading as general secretary, was going to places and trying to create confusion and illwill among party members, which is likely to result in law and order problems and breach of peace. Jayakumar said the conduct of Sasikala and her “henchmen” amounted to offences punishable under IPC sections 153 (a), 419 and 505 (b). “I request that appropriate action be taken against Sasikala and her henchmen,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-aiadmk-files-plaint-against-v-k-sasikala-for-identifying-as-general-secretary/articleshow/87173219.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal BJP headed for major shuffle after Diwali||Kolkata: Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar has got his hands full. He has to rejig the party organization, re-energize the ranks running out of steam after the assembly poll results and retain the status of the main opposition in the assembly bypolls and the upcoming civic polls. Majumdar will start touring the districts from the third week of October. The BJP brass in Delhi is also mulling a shuffle in the organization after Diwali. Majumdar has taken over the reins when Bengal BJP is faced with a reverse flow to Trinamool Congress, unlike before the assembly polls. The party’s assembly strength has gone down from 77 to 70 in the last five months. Prominent faces like Mukul Roy, Babul Supriyo and Sabyasachi Dutta have left the party, while state office-bearers Locket Chatterjee and Bharati Ghosh are not in their usual form. State secretaries like Tanuja Chakraborty, Sarbari Mukherjee, Falguni Patra and Sanghamitra Chaudhuri are out of public memory. Majumdar, as leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari told a meeting recently, has to handpick organizers who can form primary committees in the 77,000-odd booths ahead of the crucial 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Bengal BJP seniors can’t vouch for more than five Lok Sabha seats as of now. Jangalmahal, once a positive terrain for BJP, has also come under question except Purulia and parts of West Midnapore. Majumdar has to deliver if he wants to arrest erosion at the grassroots. A fact-check shows that three of 12 vice-presidents and only one of the five general secretaries are from north Bengal where the party tasted success in the assembly polls. Desertions and reverses in Malda and the two Dinajpurs leave little scope of expectation for BJP. BJP organizers can also name only a handful — young and veterans — capable of running the show at the state level. Former Union minister Debasree Chaudhuri, Adhikari, BJP Cooch Behar president Malati Rava Roy, Saumitra Khan and BJP Mahila Morcha president Agnimitra Paul are some of them. BJP organizers with RSS background like Debojit Sarkar, Loknath Chattopadhyay and organizers such as Tushar Ghosh might get berths in the new state committee. Lawyer Priyanka Tibrewal, who took up the cause of post-poll violence victims in court and later fought the electoral battle against Mamata Banerjee from Bhowanipore, has a chance in the new committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-bjp-headed-for-major-shuffle-after-diwali/articleshow/87170259.cms||Saugata Roy
---||Kolkata||Cong emulating us, says TMC on UP poll quota for women||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress on Wednesday saw Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s announcement to reserve 40% seats for women in the 2022 UP assembly polls as a Congress attempt to “emulate” the party in dire times, and hoped the sentiment was “genuine and not tokenism”. It chose to remind Congress that Trinamool was the first party to allot 40% seats to women during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In a statement posted on Twitter, Trinamool said: “Under the visionary leadership of Mamata Banerjee, AITC has shown the way to ensure increased participation of women in politics in this country. We’re the first party to give 40% seats to women in LS elections! Amid such dire times, Congress is understandably trying to emulate, and one can only hope that this is genuine and not tokenism. If they are to be taken seriously, they must give 40% seats to women in states other than UP as well.” In the 2019 general elections, Trinamool had fielded 17 women candidates (over 40%) in the 42 seats it contested. As many as 22 candidates won and nine (41%) among them were women. In Rajya Sabha, among 12 Trinamool MPs, four (33%) are women. In the Bengal assembly polls earlier this year, the party fielded 50 (17%) women candidates among a total 291 and 33 of them won. There is also 50% reservation for women in panchayati raj institutions in the state. Proposed by the Left Front government in 2010, it was given shape by the Trinamool government after it came to power in 2011. Among the 59,229 elected rural representatives (across all three bodies) in Bengal, 30,458 are women. It is largely held that women voters form a formidable support base for chief minister Banerjee. Trinamool also questioned the political intent of parties in letting the women’s reservation bill die a slow death. The bill was first introduced on September 12 a quarter of a century ago by the H D Deve Gowda government, but still hasn’t become an act. It seeks to reserve a third of the seats in Parliament and state assemblies for women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cong-emulating-us-says-tmc-on-up-poll-quota-for-women/articleshow/87170276.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: First arrest in executive’s murder sets police on course to cracking case||KOLKATA: Police on Wednesday evening made the first arrest in the murder of senior executive Subir Chaki and his driver Robin Mandal, inching closer to cracking the twin murders. Chaki and his driver were found brutally murdered inside the executive’s Golpark house late on Sunday night. Mithu Haldar, a 42-year-old woman who works as a maid, was picked up from her rented accommodation in Diamond Harbour for conspiring with her elder son Vicky, the prime accused, and attempting to destroy evidence by washing his blood-stained clothes. Mithu told cops after prolonged interrogation that her son and his friends had initially attacked Chaki with the intent to loot but ended up stabbing him and the driver to death after the executive recognised Vicky. According to police sources, Vicky, who is a small-time broker in Diamond Harbour, had come across an advertisement that Chaki had placed for the sale of the house some time ago. He had then contacted Chaki and visited the house, knowing fully well that fixing a high-value deal was beyond him. He had again visited the neighbourhood a few days ago and learnt that the house was still unsold. He then hatched a plot to threaten Chaki and loot him. CCTV footage also showed them stepping into Chaki’s house, the sources said. The arrested domestic helpAccordingly, Vicky posed as a prospective buyer and fixed an appointment with Chaki for Sunday eveing. When Chaki opened the door to show him the house, Vicky and his friends threatened him at knife-point and attempted to loot him. The plan went awry when Chaki recognised Vicky, whom he had met earlier. Realising that he had been exposed and could get caught by cops later, Vicky lashed out at Chaki with the knife, leading to fatal injuries. Since driver Mandal was a witness, he was also killed. Chaki’s wallet, ring and a gold chain have been recovered from Mithu’s Diamond Harbour residence, the sources said, but Vicky and his friends are on the run, shifting hideouts and changing their phones. Both Vicky and Mithu were earlier arrested but released on bail for attempting to kill Mithu’s husband. According to Mithu, her son and his friends took a train back from Ballygunge Station and told her everything that had happened. The sniffer dog deployed by the detective department had led the cops to Ballygunge Station from the scene of crime. Mithu confessed that she had taken Vicky’s blood-stained clothes and washed them. The owner of the house, however, spotted her scrubbing the stains. Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said a hunt was on to nab the accused. Sources in Diamond Harbour police claimed Mithu’s younger son and a relative, believed to be her brother, have been detained but senior officers in Lalbazar refused to confirm this. Police claimed they had used mobile tracking to reach Dimond Harbour on Tuesday night but could zero in on Mithu in the Kopathatt area only on Wednesday with the help of local police. The police have also identified a third suspect from Sonarpur. His phone is currently switched off. Sources said that this person acted as a linkman between Chaki’s driver and prospective buyers. All through the day though, cops kept tracking the other accused involved in the crime. The cops also summoned at least three property dealers from Gariahat and Salt Lake to record their statements at Lalbazar. Police sources said all of them had at some point of time shown interest in the Gariahat property.

---||Kolkata||House MHA panel to take up BSF issue after TMC prod||Kolkata: The newly formed parliamentary committee for home affairs has sought inputs from states and the Union government on the October 11 notification extending BSF’s territorial jurisdiction from 15km to 50km in Bengal, Punjab and Assam, and reducing it from 80km to 50km in Gujarat. On Monday, Trinamool Congress pushed for the issue’s inclusion in the committee’s deliberations, stressing the new rule brings into its ambit half of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha constituencies across 10 districts along the 2,216km international border with Bangladesh. The party argued that the notification gives an excuse to BSF to raid, arrest and make seizures in Bengal within the 50km radius and that this is contrary to the state’s primacy over police and law and order. The issue has erupted in Bengal also because three of the four constituencies where bypolls are scheduled to be held on October 30 fall within this 50km zone — Dinhata fully, and Santipur and Gosaba partially. “Bengal has the longest international border with Bangladesh. This rule allows a central agency to act at will inside a state, which is anti-federal. The committee chairperson has agreed to incorporate this in the five-point agenda, by extending the ongoing discussions on coastal security to border management and coastal security. It has also been said that the committee will hear the state and the Union government’s views on the matter,” a source said. The 31-member committee includes five senior Bengal MPs: Trinamool’s Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and Derek O’Brien; Congress’ Adhir Chowdhury and Abhishek Manu Singvhi, and BJP’s Dilip Ghosh. The issue has emerged as a political flashpoint in Dinhata, which is part of Cooch Behar, most of which falls within BSF’s new ambit. This assembly segment is hemmed in by the Indo-Bangladesh border on three sides. “We will oppose this. In a border town like Dinhata, BSF will be everywhere if this is not stopped,” said Trinamool candidate Udayan Guha. BJP’s Cooch Behar president and Tufanganj MLA Malati Rava Roy said: “Bengal police are now basically run from TMC offices. Miscreants active in border areas were safe once they crossed the 15km zone and police did nothing. Now it will be a new game. For commoners, this new rule will be like a boon.” Rule 139(1) under BSF Act 1968 allows the central force to act only under central Acts of illegal entry, cross-border smuggling, customs and foreign exchange violations. Santipur too comes under BSF’s ambit now. Several villages in this segment fall within a 30-40km distance from the Indo-Bangladesh border. Santipur itself is less than 50km from the two border outposts — Baranbelia and Hanskhali. The Gede international border is closer. Social worker Jyotirmay Dutta said: “Rarely does BSF step out in the 15km range. This isn’t a China or Pakistan border. There have been no reports of major problems in Nadia along the border. I find no reason (for the new rules).” Ranaghat BJP MP Jagannath Sarkar said: “Militancy and arms smuggling are on the increase. I find no reason to oppose the new rules.” Parts of Gosaba assembly segment are less than 50km from the Indo-Bangladesh riverine borders in Bagna Island and Katoya Jhuri. Trinamool’s South 24 Parganas president and MP Subhasish Chakraborty said: “We will not accept that BSF will now leave the borders and exert its powers in Gosaba. State police don’t interfere in border management. Why will they (BSF) interfere in state affairs?” Trinamool, which has opposed the new rules, has also said it will welcome all efforts by the Centre to take states into confidence and arrive at a consensus. Under BSF Act, 1968, the Centre doesn’t need to consult states to redraw BSF’s territory for it to implement central acts, but it needs to consult and ratify in Parliament if BSF were to implement penal and state laws. The SC had held that central forces could not “supplant or substitute” police but had to “aid” the states.

---||Chennai||Chennai: Man sells Covid negative certificate, held||CHENNAI: The city police on Wednesday arrested a Triplicane resident who sold fake Covid negative certificates atRs500 each to those flying abroad and began efforts to nab his Dubai-based friend who helped prepare the certificates. While S Irfan Khan, 29, was picked up from a lodge in Triplicane and a hunt has been launched for Praveen who is in Dubai. The certificates were sent on WhatsApp after payment was made on Gpay, police said. The fraud came to light when Harish Parvesh, who runs KHM Medical Centre in Mannady, came across a message on WhatsApp which used his lab’s name and promised a Covid negative certificate within 30 minutes of the passport copy being sent on WhatsApp. Suspecting that some of his staff were behind the fraud, he sent a friend’s passport copy to the phone number given in the message and paidRs500 on GPay. To his shock, he received a Covid negative certificate via WhatsApp in the promised 30 minutes. Realising that his lab was in trouble, he lodged a complaint at the North Beach police station. A team headed by inspector Rajkumar launched a hunt and secured Irfan Khan from a lodge. Interrogations revealed that Irfan Khan ran the racket from an office in the North Beach area. Khan got the details from the flyers and sent it to Praveen who used the name of Pravesh’s lab in Mannady and prepared the certificates, said an officer. “Praveen would replace the names and addresses of the ‘buyers’, while all the certificates had the same sign and seal,” he said. Khan and his associate over the past six months issued about 70 ‘Covid negative’ certificates, mostly to ‘Kuruvis’ (couriers) who travelled abroad frequently. Police said the seeds of the racket were sown in Irfan’s mind when he made a trip to the United Arab Emirates (Dubai) and got acquainted with Praveen who prepared a Covid negative certificate and helped him travel to Chennai. Soon, the game flourished and they shared in the profits, the officer said. They were in the process of making 50 more certificates when Irfan was nabbed, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-sells-covid-negative-certificate-held-chennai-police/articleshow/87173403.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Vax coverage in 5 Vid dists better than state average||Nagpur: It is now well-established that Covid-19 vaccination is proving beneficial in containing the virus spread. The daily caseload in Vidarbha has gone down significantly as more than 65% of the eligible population is now vaccinated. A recent data released by the state health department shows that the vaccination coverage is good in almost all districts of Vidarbha. In fact, Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur, Nagpur and Wardha – five out of six districts in Nagpur division — have performed better than the state average of 69.58%. While Bhandara has achieved more than 90% first dose coverage and stands third in the state after Mumbai and Pune, neighbouring Gondia district is at the 6th spot while Chandrapur, Nagpur and Wardha are at 11, 12 and 13th rank, respectively. These five districts are in top 13 districts where more than 70% of the eligible population has been already vaccinated with at least one dose. Gadchiroli in Nagpur division is at 19th rank with more than 60% population jabbed. The performance of Akola health division (Amravati revenue division) has been a matter of concern so far. With less than 50% of adults vaccinated, Akola is in the bottom five districts of Maharashtra at 32nd rank. Revenue divisional headquarter Amravati is at 27th rank. Buldhana (28) and Yavatmal (30) have inoculated just more than 50% population with at least one dose. Overall, these districts need to work on their vaccination model to achieve the desired results. As far as the state vaccine coverage is concern, Nanded district in Marathwada is at the bottom with near 46% coverage while neighbouring Hingoli is second last at 48%. Mumbai (97%) leads the chart, followed by Pune (91%). The administrations there are expecting more than 100% coverage because both the cities have a large number of migrant population who will be taking the jabs in these cities only. At present, the government has no mechanism to know whether the vaccinated people were the domicile residents of the city or migrants. Now, the next target is to increase the second dose coverage. This will help in bringing life to normalcy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-coverage-in-5-vid-dists-better-than-state-average/articleshow/87168233.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||World||North Korea claims latest missile test didn't target US||SEOUL: North Korea has hit back at US criticism over its test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile this week, saying it was rightfully exercising its rights for self-defense and that the weapon doesn't specifically target the United States. The comments by an unidentified spokesperson of the North's Foreign Ministry on Thursday came as the UN Security Council was set to hold an emergency closed-door meeting over the launch at the request of the United States and the United Kingdom. On Tuesday, the North launched a new ballistic missile from a submarine in its first test of such weaponry in two years, marking the most significant demonstration of its military might since President Joe Biden took office. Washington has condemned the launch, which underscored how the North continues to expand its military capabilities amid a freeze in nuclear diplomacy, and called for Pyongyang to “engage in sustained and substantive dialogue.” In comments published by Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency, the North Korean spokesperson said its recent test posed no immediate threat to neighboring countries and that there was no need for Washington to agonize over a weapon that doesn't specifically target the United States. The spokesperson said Pyongyang expresses “serious concern” over what it sees as a “nonsensical” reaction by the United States over a rightful exercise of its rights to defense. Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled for more than two years over disagreements in exchanging the release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against North Korea and the North's denuclearization steps. Ending a months-long lull in September, North Korea has been ramping up its weapons tests while making conditional peace offers to Seoul, reviving a pattern of pressuring South Korea to try to get what it wants from the United States. North Korea has been pushing hard for years to acquire the ability to fire nuclear-armed missiles from submarines. The submarine missiles are the next key piece in an arsenal that includes a variety of weapons, including ones with the potential range to reach American soil. Still, experts say it would take years, large amounts of resources and major technological improvements for the heavily sanctioned nation to build at least several submarines that could travel quietly in seas and reliably execute strikes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/north-korea-claims-latest-missile-test-didnt-target-us/articleshow/87173482.cms||---

---||World||America needs to build constructive ties with Lanka: US diplomat||WASHINGTON: The US needs to build constructive relationships with Sri Lanka, which is positioned in a strategic location at the heart of the Indian Ocean, a senior American diplomat nominated by President Joe Biden as his envoy to the island nation has said. Foreign service officer Julie Chung, during a Congressional hearing on Wednesday, told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Sri Lanka is positioned in a strategic location at the heart of the Indian Ocean and its critical ports with access to global maritime lanes and trading routes play a pivotal role in a free and open Indo-Pacific architecture. “This reinforces the necessity for the United States to build constructive relationships with Sri Lanka, including with civil society, the private sector and the Sri Lankan people,” she said. Chung told lawmakers that if confirmed, she will work tirelessly to advocate for quality infrastructure and investment based on transparency, respect for international law and good governance, which is mindful of sustainable environmental and labour standards. “We must also support US companies doing business in Sri Lanka and utilise the tools we have with the Development Finance Corporation and the Export-Import Bank to provide alternatives to coercive lending and opaque contracts,” she said, without naming any country. China is one of the biggest investors in various infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka. But there has been criticism, both locally and internationally, and growing concerns that China has lured Sri Lanka into a debt trap. The previous Maithripala Sirisena government handed over the Hambantota port to a state-run Chinese firm in 2017 for a 99 years' lease as a debt swap amounting to $1.2 billion. US diplomat Chung said: “the sinking of the MV X-Press Pearl cargo ship near the shores of Colombo a few months ago, causing its biggest marine disaster in Sri Lanka's history, points to the need for upholding such standards”. “US humanitarian assistance, emergency response capabilities and environmental surveillance tools helped Sri Lanka respond to this tragedy and is emblematic of how we can be a positive force and strong partner to the people of Sri Lanka,” she said. Sri Lanka, she said, is Asia's oldest democracy and survived the tragedy of a civil war that resulted in unimaginable violence and continued ethnic and religious divisions. “If confirmed, I am committed to speaking clearly and consistently in support of democratic values, human rights and a strong civil society that are essential to democracies and central to our foreign policy approach. “We must also be strong partners in encouraging justice, accountability and reconciliation so that all Sri Lankans can share in the benefits of peace, security and prosperity,” Chung added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/america-needs-to-build-constructive-ties-with-lanka-us-diplomat/articleshow/87173529.cms||---

The incident had taken place on October 3. The arrested accused are Thekkeparambath Sayooj, 24, from Moyilothara; Shibu, 32, of Parachalil (H) from Adukkath; Rahul Thaminjal, 22, from Moyilothara; and Akshay Paloli, 22, from Kayakkodi. Nadapuram ASP Nidhin Raj arrested them after the police registered a case on a complaint filed by the girl’s parents. Police said that according to the girl’s statement, she had acquaintance with Sayooj. He had invited her to the ecotourism centre at Janakikkad on October 3, where he allegedly raped her at the forested location. Later the other three accused, who were friends of Sayooj, also raped her. Police said that the girl said in her statement that she was given a juice suspected to be spiked with some intoxicant, following which she lost consciousness before the assault. Police added that scientific investigation would be carried out about that as well. The accused took her in a vehicle after the assault and dropped her near her house. They threatened that she would have to face dire consequences if she told anyone about the incident. Later, she revealed the incident to her parents, following which they lodged a complaint with the police. ASP Nithin Raj said that the accused have been book under IPC sections 376 D (gang rape), Pocso sections and also under SC/ ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act as the rape survivor belongs to the SC community.

Upholding the conviction of a man accused of raping his 16-year-old daughter and impregnating her, Justice R Narayana Pisharadi said credibility of the testimony of a rape survivor will not be affected even if she admits that she has sexual relations with another person. It was contended on behalf of the accused in the court that the girl had sexual relations with another person. Rejecting the contention of the accused, the court said in the judgment, “Even in a case where it is shown that the victim is a girl of easy virtue or a girl habituated to sexual intercourse, it may not be a ground to absolve the accused from the charge of rape. Even assuming that the victim is previously accustomed to sexual intercourse, that is not a decisive question. On the contrary, the question which is required to be adjudicated is, did the accused commit rape on the victim on the occasion complained of. It is the accused who is on trial and not the victim.” The court also observed that there cannot be a graver and heinous crime than a father committing rape on his own daughter. “The protector then becomes the predator. The father is the fortress and refuge of his daughter. Charged of raping his own daughter under his refuge and fortress is worse than the gamekeeper becoming a poacher and treasury guard becoming a robber,” the high court said in the judgment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cant-cite-survivors-easy-virtue-to-justify-rape-kerala-high-court/articleshow/87173564.cms||---

It was his birthday, according to the Hindu calendar. Two terrorists were gunned down in the encounter in Cheerbagh area of Shopian. Karnveer, who was with 21 Rajput Regiment, hailed from a family of soldiers. He donned the Olive Green in 2017, the year his father retired from the Army. The family lives in ward 22 of Satna town and hails from Daldal village in Rampur tehsil of the district. He last spoke with his father on Tuesday night, just hours before setting out on what would turn out to be his final service to the country. On Wednesday, as usual, his father dialled his number in the afternoon, but couldn't get through. Worried, the Army veteran rang up Karnveer's unit headquarters, and came to know of his martyrdom, his family members said. News spread rapidly and hundreds flocked to their home and ancestral village. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan paid his tribute, calling Karnveer a brave son of India. "He attained martyrdom in a brave and heroic manner in service of the country," he tweeted. Karnveer's mortal remains will be brought to Satna late Thursday evening and the last rites will be performed at his native village the next morning. The Satna additional collector and senior police officials have visited the martyr's home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/soldier-from-madhya-pradesh-martyred-in-shopian-encounter-on-birthday/articleshow/87173624.cms||---

Taking suo motu cognisance, police launched a probe and arrested three people on Wednesday. A senior cop said some people had taken police permission and organised an annual procession on Eid on Tuesday in Sector 8. The video was allegedly shot during the event. Uma Nandan, Noida unit chief of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which staged a protest at the Sector 20 police station along with other outfits, alleged that some people at the procession started raising Pakistan Zindabad slogans and when others tried to stop them, they failed. “Some people captured the incident on phone and sent it to me while others shared it on social media. We informed the police after that,” he added. Rajesh S, deputy commissioner, said since the audio quality of the videos was poor, they were sent to an expert team. Three people, Mohammad Zafar, Sameer Ali and Ali Raza, were identified and arrested. They were booked under IPC Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/3-held-after-pakistan-zindabad-video-surfaces/articleshow/87171853.cms||---

According to officials, this plan is under consideration in accordance with the state government’s ‘Reuse of Treated Waste Water Policy’, aimed at conserving water by using every drop of treated waste water for different purposes, such as in thermal plants and industries, or for horticulture and irrigation purposes. “Our plan is to use treated waste water for gardening and landscaping in the 30-metre-wide green belt on both sides of the KMP expressway, between Pataudi Chowk and the Panchgaon cloverleaf,” said a GMDA official, who did not wish to be named. Officials said that this proposal was submitted and discussed in July this year, where it was decided that a pipeline would be laid from the nearest sewage treatment plant to the expressway for the purpose, from where an internal pipeline would be laid. The water will be sourced from the common effluent treatment plan (CETP) in Manesar, “where 45-48 MLD of treated waste water is available”. The official said, “An estimate has been prepared for sourcing a total of 20 MLD of treated waste water from the plant, of which 10 MLD will be used for the KMP expressway while the remaining 10 MLD will be used for the Kasan forest area. The water will be sourced by laying a major distribution pipeline between the CETP and KMP, from where further distribution will be provided by the GMDA.” The entire project, officials said, is expected to cost approximately Rs 5 crore. Public feedback is currently being sought on the proposal, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gmda-plans-to-use-treated-waste-water-for-kmp-eway/articleshow/87171147.cms||Sakshi Dayal

The HC bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice C Praveen Kumar extended the interim orders passed earlier suspending the operation of the GO appointing special invitees to the board. Three PIL petitions were filed before the high court raising contentions over the appointments. While two petitions challenged the appointment of 52 special invitees to the board, another petition challenged the appointment of some of the board members on the grounds that they have pending criminal cases against them. Appearing on behalf of the TTD, senior counsel S S Prasad sought two weeks' time to file the counter affidavits. Allowing his request, the court granted four weeks' time to file the counters and extended the interim orders in the meanwhile. The high court had earlier observed that GOs 568 and 569 are not in consonance with section 96 of AP Endowments Act, which specifies the size of the TTD board. The court passed interim orders suspending the operation of the GOs and directed the third petitioner to implead the trust board members as respondent parties as specific allegations were made against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/trust-board-size-andhra-pradesh-hc-asks-govt-ttd-to-file-counters/articleshow/87173732.cms||---

However, when it comes to administering the second dose of vaccine, the state has only vaccinated 30.45% of the eligible population so far, putting it at the 8th position among the same highly populated states. States like Maharashtra, Kerala, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Odisha and Gujarat are better than Madhya Pradesh in completing full vaccination of the individuals. The output is mainly due to persistently less vaccination in October so far. Even on Wednesday, all the seven states which are better than Madhya Pradesh in administering second dose, administered at least close to 2 lakh doses while some even administered 4 to 5 lakh doses. However, in MP only 1.2 lakh people in MP managed to get their second shot. The fact that vaccination has slowed down this month could be well understood from the fact that daily average vaccination in October so far, has nearly come down to one third when it is compared with daily average vaccination in the month of September. While as per daily average, 5.71 lakh vaccine doses were administered everyday in September when a total of 1.7 crore doses were administered, only 34 lakh vaccine doses have been administered in 20 days of October so far - or only 1.70 lakh jabs per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/slow-pace-of-2nd-jab-pushes-mp-down-to-8th-rank-maharashtra-kerala-fare-better/articleshow/87173773.cms||---

---||Ghaziabad||Reserve 20% beds for fever patients, Ghaziabad hospitals told||GHAZIABAD: The health department has directed 50- and 100-bed private and government hospitals to reserve a fifth for fever patients. The move came following complaints from patients of non-availability of beds. Moreover, at four community health centres (CHCs) in Loni, Muradnagar, Dasna and Modinagar, 20 out of 30 beds have been reserved for fever patients. “There were some complaints about shortage of beds in hospitals, especially in private ones. As fever and dengue cases are still being reported in large numbers, the health department has taken steps to ensure that patients do not face any inconvenience,” chief medical officer Bhavtosh Shankhdhar said. He added that the reports on patient admissions will be taken from hospitals periodically. Earlier, over 3,000 beds had been reserved for Covid-19 patients in about 60 government and private hospitals. Officials said a line-listing of fever patients is also being undertaken as part of a one-month special campaign. For this purpose, Asha and anganwadi workers are conducting door-to-door surveys. Meanwhile, Ghaziabad reported 19 fresh dengue cases on Wednesday, taking its tally to 683. Five of the new patients have been admitted to hospitals. At present, 70 patients are undergoing treatment in various hospitals. The district also recorded one more Covid case. The patient, who had recently travelled to Mumbai, works in the district collectorate. He is stable and in home isolation. District surveillance officer R K Gupta said the patient’s family and other contacts are being monitored. In October so far, Ghaziabad has reported nine Covid cases. At present, there are four active cases in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/reserve-20-beds-for-fever-patients-ghaziabad-hospitals-told/articleshow/87170816.cms||Aditya Dev

While the stretch is said to be ready, as a final step, the Authority has asked the contractor deputed for the work to paint the interior walls of the underpass. The underpass, which will provide connectivity to those travelling between City Centre and Parthala Chowk, has faced several hurdles. The Authority had started work on the stretch in July 2019. In October that year, the Authority blocked the Vikas Marg that connects Noida to Greater Noida and Vishwakarma Marg that connects sectors 61/71 to other 7X sectors and Barola. While the Authority managed to open the sectors 61/71 and 7X sectors route in a year, the underpass is yet to be thrown open to the public. Once operational, the 780-metre-long underpass will provide seamless access to Noida-Greater Noida commuters. Officials from the engineering division of the Authority said that all the civil work has been completed. “But the walls and the roof of the underpass has to be spruced up. At present, painters have been deployed to give finishing touches before the underpass is thrown open,” said an officer. The workers have to scale more than 25 feet to do the painting work. “Painting the concrete span under sectors 61/71 to 7X sectors carriageway is turning out more difficult than it appeared initially. The area is 1,250 sqm, but only 150-200 sqm can be painted in a day. It will take another week to finish the work,” said an officer of the Authority. The general manager of the Authority, PK Kaushik said that workers have been deputed in shifts to finish the job. “It is a matter of a few more days after which the stretch will be inaugurated,” he said. The officials insisted that a partial opening of the carriageway will not be as effective as workers deployed at the site for the painting and finishing work will be at risk and the pace of work will go down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/underpass-at-sector-71-to-be-ready-this-mth/articleshow/87170807.cms||Shalabh
---||Gurgaon||Stinging in the rain: At 2.6k, Hry’s dengue tally at 3-yr high||Gurgaon: Haryana’s official dengue case count is at a three-year high, owing to a long monsoon. With the rains continuing late into the year, health officials have warned that the number of cases is likely to increase. As of Wednesday, the state’s tally stood at 2,646, already significantly higher than the total 1,936 cases reported in 2018. In 2019 and 2020, the caseload was 1,207 and 1,377. So far, Haryana has not reported any dengue deaths this season. Districts with the highest number of cases have been marked “most affected”. These include Panchkula (331), followed by Sirsa (272), Fatehabad (206), Sonipat (192), Gurgaon (189), Nuh (175) and Faridabad (173). The lowest number of cases have been reported from Palwal (20), Karnal (38), Panipat (39), Rewari (43) and Jhajjar (57). Of the total 2,646 cases, 1,643 were reported by government hospitals and 1,003 by private facilities. Rajeev Arora, ACS (health), Haryana, said, “With an aim to prevent mortality due to dengue, a provision of free single donor platelets (SDP) has been made for patients in government hospitals across the state. Earlier, the hospitals charged Rs 8,500 per unit of SDP.” Aedes Agypti, the dengue-causing mosquito, typically breeds in stagnant water in containers such as desert coolers, overhead tanks, plastic bags, bottles, cups thrown on garbage, discarded items on rooftops, flowerpots and bird baths. During the rainy season, it is important to identify and eliminate mosquito-breeding sites by emptying water from containers. According to the health department, about 420 domestic breeding checkers have been deployed in all districts while 1,410 hand-operated and 35 vehicle-mounted fogging machines have been pressed into service. Indoor residual sprays are also being carried out in 57 high-risk areas where malaria incidence was high in the past three years. Moreover, about 8,023 water bodies have been identified for release of Gambusia fish (mosquito killer fish). The fish have already been released in 7,167 water bodies and will be released into the rest as well. About 112 fish hatcheries are functional in the state at present. Meanwhile, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon, said rapid response teams were carrying out door-to-door screening in dengue clusters. “We appeal to people to ensure that water doesn’t remain stagnant in and around their locality,” he added. The city reported its first cases of the season on August 24, when five people tested positive. It had seen the highest number of cases in 2015, at 451. The figure stood at 86 in 2016, 66 in 2017 and 93 in 2018. While 22 cases were reported in 2019, 51 cases were recorded in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/stinging-in-the-rain-at-2-6k-hrys-dengue-tally-at-3-yr-high/articleshow/87170987.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||World||Taliban face hurdles while implementing law, order in Afghanistan||KABUL: The Taliban have taken over Afghanistan but the affiliates of Islamic State-Khorasan, Syria and Iraq-based terrorist groups have emerged as a big problem to the public safety of the Taliban controlled country. The Taliban has failed to contain the terrorists, who have incited a number of attacks in the country since the collapse of the Ghani government in Afghanistan, The Washington Post reported. These attacks also included two bombings of Shiite mosques that recently took place within a week in Kandahar and Kunduz that killed scores of worshipers. The situation has raised questions upon the Taliban's capability to take down ISIS-K cells in Kabul and other urban areas, The Washington Post reported. Not just the terrorists from other groups but internal members of the Taliban are also undisciplined and have been committing brutal crimes after the group's takeover. As a recent example of this, the members of the Taliban have executed suspected kidnappers and hung their bodies in public view. Videos of Taliban fighters whipping alleged criminals have also emerged on social media, The Washington Post reported. The Taliban are also showing signs of their previous regime in which they used to undertake brutal methods in implementing 'order' in the country. Meanwhile, the Taliban after the siege of Afghanistan is trying to deliver a moderate image to the world in an attempt to gain international confidence but experts say that the scenes at the Kabul airport were proof that the terrorist group has returned with the same radical and violence mindset. Violence was an integral trait of the Taliban even in their previous term. The so-called transfer of power exercised in Kabul without any bloodshed, was nothing but a part of 'good image plan', Inside Over reported. As the Taliban took control of Afghanistan once again after 20 years, experts also believe that Afghan women are most likely to face an uncertain future under the terrorist group regime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-face-hurdles-while-implementing-law-order-in-afghanistan/articleshow/87173932.cms||---

Out of these, Covishiled will be given at 124 sites, Covaxin at five sites while Sputnik V at one site. On Wednesday, a total of 11,368 people in the age group of 18-44 years got inoculated. In the 45-plus category, 2,098 people took the vaccine shots while three healthcare staff and nine frontline workers also received the jabs. In all, 13,478 jabs were administered. On Wednesday, 5,114 first doses and 8,364 second doses were administered. At present, the district is aggressively administering second doses to the recipients. The plan is to have 80% of doses reserved for the second dose recipients daily in the district with a view to inoculate them at the earliest. 9 new cases reported The city witnessed nine fresh cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday taking the caseload to 1,81,342, of which 59 are active. The positivity rate stands as 0.1%. Seven people also recovered, increasing the total number of recoveries to 1,80,342. The recovery rate stands at 99.6%.

---||Gurgaon||GMDA to repair road linking new sectors with Delhi||Gurgaon: The pothole-riddled 11-kilometre stretch between Sectors 99 and 115 connecting Dhankot with Delhi-Gurgaon border will soon be repaired by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA). The metropolitan authority has already invited online bids for the work that will cost around Rs 1.86 crore, officials said. The road, constructed by the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) in early 2000s, sees heavy traffic each day, especially with the Dwarka Expressway still under construction. It is currently the main access road from the new sectors to the national capital, including the Indira Gandhi International Airport. However, nearly 10-km stretch of this road is dotted with craters and potholes that exacerbates traffic congestion, chaos and pose a risk of mishaps. “The work will include repair of the road, surface drains and clearing bushes as well as any other obstructions. It is currently at the tender stage. Work will commence once it has been allotted,” Major Shaveta Sharma, executive engineer, GMDA, said on Saturday. The Authority, she said, had floated tender inviting online bids earlier this week for a contractor to repair and maintain the stretch for 12 months. Recently, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had directed the Gurgaon district administration to ensure that all roads damaged during the rains are repaired by November 30. Local residents told TOI that the road was in a dire strait and needed immediate repairs, but for them seeing would be believing. “It is great that the GMDA intends to repair this road, however, we know better than to expect the work will be executed anytime soon,” Nirmal Kumar, a resident of Sector 102, said. The proximity to Delhi, he added, was actually a big perk and that is why several people chose to live in this part of Gurgaon. “However, our expectations have completely backfired. The Dwarka Expressway is nowhere near completion at present and this road is so difficult, and dangerous, to use. The craters are huge and the entire stretch is uneven,” Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gmda-to-repair-road-linking-new-sectors-with-delhi/articleshow/87171070.cms||Sakshi Dayal
---||Noida||Winter is coming, where are smog guns? Noida asked to finish work||NOIDA: The installation of smog guns across construction sites in Noida and Greater Noida is incomplete despite the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) having set an October 15 deadline for the work. Officials, however, said that the smog guns have been installed at some public places. The pollution department has asked the authorities to ensure that the installation work is completed at the earliest. Meanwhile, a Quick Response Team (QRT) and a special helpline for pollution-related complaints are expected to be launched in Noida and Greater Noida soon. “The helpline numbers are ready in Greater Noida. We are coordinating with the Noida Authority to issue it soon,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB. Earlier this week, the GNIDA prepared an action plan dividing the entire city into eight zones with nodal officers for all zones to coordinate with each other. As part of the plan, every officer will periodically report any pollution-related complaints or violations found in the coming months. The Authority has also issued directions to all private contractors to install smog guns at all construction sites spread over an area of 20,000 square metres. The Greater Noida Authority does have a helpline number in place for air pollution complaints. People can call on 0120-2336046/47/48/49 or send their complaints with a picture and location to a WhatsApp number (8800882124). “Every year, we get several complaints. We take quick action based on the feedback from the residents. We are serious about dealing with the issue before it can escalate this year. We will try to ensure that the local sources of pollution are minimised and do not add to the poor air quality during the winter months,” said Narendra Bhooshan, CEO of GNIDA. In Noida, the helpline number has not been set up yet and general guidelines issued by the UPPCB have been forwarded to officials as well as contractors. UPPCB officials confirmed that while the Authority has started installing smog guns, there is no clarity yet on how many are functional and how many are yet to be installed. “We had been receiving complaints through the CPCB and CAQM portals and tweets so far. This is why there was no separate helpline so far. However, we are working on making one operational soon. We have also issued instructions regarding misting, waste disposal and no burning of waste in the city. It will take a couple of days for the plan to formalise,” said Ritu Maheshwari, CEO, Noida Authority. Residents, meanwhile, continue to complain regarding the unavailability of any person or helpline from the Noida Authority that can tackle the pollution-related issues. Residents are also complaining across the social media platforms regarding manual sweeping and that the mechanical sweeping leaves out the left side of wide roads even as dust accumulate over it for months. Air slips into ‘poor’ zone After witnessing the cleanest day of the year on Monday, the air quality in Delhi deteriorated to the “poor” category on Wednesday and the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) touched 221, as against 69 in the “satisfactory” category on Tuesday. It is likely to enter the “very poor” category on Thursday. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), a body under Union ministry of earth sciences, said the contribution of farm fires in Delhi’s PM2.5 was 12%. Experts said as stubble burning was on the rise in the neighbouring states, they were likely to impact Delhi’s air as northwesterly winds were favourable for transportation of pollutants to the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/winter-is-coming-where-are-smog-guns-noida-asked-to-finish-work/articleshow/87170551.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Gurgaon||AQI poor again after ‘good’ break, spiking ozone levels a worry too||Gurgaon: In less than 48 hours, the city’s air quality has nosedived to the “poor” category from “good” due to a combination of local emissions, meteorological factors and a high volume of particulate matter (PM). While fall in wind speed, from Tuesday’s 11 km/hour to 6 km/hour today, and dip in temperature slowed down dispersion, experts say lack of effective clampdown on industrial emissions and vehicle exhaust gasses has further led to an accumulation of pollutants. On Wednesday, the city’s Air Quality Index hovered at around 235 (poor) on a scale of 500, down from 81 (satisfactory) and 36 (good) recorded on October 19 and 18, respectively, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). An analysis of data obtained from the city’s five air monitoring stations revealed that apart from PM 2.5 and PM 10, which are the most prominent contributors of pollution, there was a high presence of toxic pollutants like ozone, carbon monoxide (C0), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur oxide (SOx). Between October 1 and 20, three of five stations had unsafe levels of ozone. On October 15 and 16, the concentration of ozone touched 124 ug/m3 and 224ug/m3, respectively, at Vikas Sadan -- the highest concentration recorded in the city this month so far, as per CPCB data. The Sector-51 station, meanwhile, recorded 160 ug/m3 and 203ug/m3 of ozone in the corresponding period, while at Manesar centre it touched 152ug/m3 and 170ug/m3 respectively on October 14 and 15. Experts have called the trend “alarming” as the prevalence of ground-level ozone indicates other pollutants, such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) and SOx, are also present in higher quantities. According to Aarti Khosla, director of Climate Trends, a climate research agency, a high presence of ozone in Gurgaon could be mainly linked with emissions from tailpipes. “A lot of ozone pollution is caused due to vehicular emissions. Breathing the gas has a documented impact on lung health causing short-term breathing problems as well as dangerous conditions, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to long term exposure,” Khosla told TOI. Devising a traffic plan that moves people and not vehicles, allowing space for public transportation to build up, she said, were some long-term measures that could be adopted to bring ozone level down in a city like Gurgaon. “But let us not forget that ozone also comes from industrial sources like factories, chemical plants, power plants. Unless industrial emissions are not checked, it’s hard to get rid of ozone. The gas can travel long distances as well so all ozone present in an area might not have been generated there, thereby compounding the effect of ozone,” Khosla added. Currently, 266 industrial units are operational in Gurgaon. The sprawling city has nearly 1.1 million vehicles while more than 50,000 vehicles enter the city every day, according to the Regional Transport Office. According to experts, the concentration of ozone is directly proportional to NOx. “The chemical reacts with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight to form ozone. So, the more the NOx, the more is the production of ozone. The major sources of CO2 and NOx are almost the same -- vehicular and industrial emissions,” Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at Amity Centre for Air Pollution Control, said. On October 12, the Vikas Sadan centre recorded NO2 at 110µg/m3, while it was at 125µg/m3 on October 17. The permissible standard for both NO2 and sulphur dioxide (SO2) is 80.00µg/m3. Garbage burning, experts said, was a dominant factor contributing to SO2, besides PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. Besides, rampant use of diesel generators across housing societies, hospitals, malls, hotels, offices and industrial units, also significantly add to PM and NOx emissions. Road dust and dust from construction sites, too, spike PM2.5 concentrations. “Existing estimates on sources affecting Gurgaon’s air quality indicate that vehicles, industries, dust and stubble burning are the leading sources of winter PM 2.5 levels in the city. With wind expected to predominantly blow from the northwest direction of NCR on October 20 and 21, stubble burning in neighbouring states, in addition to emissions from local sources, is likely to deteriorate air quality in the city. The state government should roll out pre-emptive measures to target deeper emission cuts,” Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead at Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), told TOI. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), meanwhile, recommended the government should take active steps to curb vehicular emissions, increase electric mobility, scale up public transport and pedestrian infrastructure, deploy citywide parking management to curb the use of private vehicles, and aggressively control industrial emissions. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE, said, “Implementation of these norms can only reduce pollution levels in the air. Though there are several factors that contribute to the pollution of air quality, dust from construction sites in the region is a major contributor.” Meanwhile, CPCB has implemented Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) measures under the “moderate” to “poor” range with immediate effect in National Capital Region (NCR) from October 18. On Wednesday, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) officials said that they were taking all required action to mitigate air pollution. “Our staff is vigilant of local pollution such as road dust, dust from construction sites and garbage burning instances,” Sandeep Singh, HSPCB regional officer, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/aqi-poor-again-after-good-break-spiking-ozone-levels-a-worry-too/articleshow/87171244.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Chandigarh||Ellenabad bypoll: BJP SC neta invokes caste to seek votes||CHANDIGARH:In a blatant violation of the model code of conduct as well as the Supreme Court (SC) guidelines, Krishan Lal Panwar, state president of BJP’s Scheduled Caste (SC) Morcha invoked caste to seek votes for the bypoll to the Ellenabad assembly seat slated to be held on October 30. The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) has lodged a complaint before the state election commission. While addressing the party's election meeting at Kagdana village under Ellenabad seat on October 18, Panwar appealed to SC and backward class (BC) to vote in favour of BJP, saying that SCs and BCs have significant numbers in the constituency and they should vote for BJP, otherwise people from other castes would get elected. “Hamari voton pe chaudhar dusre kyon karein. Tees October ko jo SC or BC chahenge vo hi Vidhayak Banega (why others should become leaders. The MLA would be a person as per the wishes of people belonging to SC and BC category),” Panwar had said in his speech. He was seeking votes for BJP nominee Govind Kanda. INLD files poll code violation complaintPanwar further said that there are around 1.86 lakh voters in the Ellenabad assembly seat, of which 40,000 are from SC category and around 43,000 from BC. “If we have a significant number of votes, why should somebody else lead us,” he had said. Panwar was the state’s transport minister from 2014 to 2019, but lost the October 2019 assembly polls and is currently heading the SC Morcha of Haryana BJP. He was in the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) before he joined BJP prior to the 2014 assembly polls. Meanwhile, the INLD has submitted a complaint against Panwar to the chief electoral officer Haryana for violating the model code of conduct by seeking votes in the names of caste. It has been alleged by the INLD that Panwar’s speech has destroyed the social fabric and harmony of society and created social bitterness among voters. A video clip of Pawar’s speech too has been attached with the complaint. No politician can seek vote in the name of caste, creed or religion: SC On January 2, 2017, the apex court had held that no politician can seek vote in the name of caste, creed, or religion. The Supreme Court had passed these orders while deciding several petitions in the Hindutva case. The judgement has also been uploaded on the website of the Election Commission of India (ECI) for the information of all the candidates and the political parties. What the EC code saysEven the EC’s model code of conduct says: “No party or candidate shall do any activity that may aggravate differences or create hatred or tension between castes and communities, religious or linguistic. Don’t appeal to caste or communal feelings for votes or use temples, mosques, churches, or other places of worship for poll propaganda.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ellenabad-bypoll-bjp-sc-neta-invokes-caste-to-seek-votes/articleshow/87173941.cms||Ajay Sura

Residents of the society have written to MCG and the department of town and country planning (DTCP) with details of deficient infrastructure, work that needs to be carried out and the estimated cost. Malibu Towne is among 11 private developer colonies that are expected to be taken over by the MCG. The civic body will conduct its own survey of deficient infrastructure before takeover of the colony. Malibu Estate Private Ltd had developed Malibu Towne on 205 acres in Sector 50. The DTCP has taken a series of actions against the developer of the colony for various violations. The residents of the colony have joined hands to form a Malibu Towne Residents Group to take up the issues. Nirvair Singh, a member of Malibu Towne Residents Group, said, “Through newspaper reports, we got to know that MCG is getting ready to take over Malibu Towne. It is a good move as Malibu Towne needs to be taken over. The developer is not taking adequate steps to fulfil all the mandatory services.” The colony was offered to the public in 1985 and thereafter, the development started. As the colony grew and new rules of FAR came to place, a lot of new developments took place. The developer submitted revised plans to DTCP in 2016 and they approved the same with some conditions. “Now in view of rampant development, a lot of pressure is on the infrastructure of the colony and needs to be augmented,” said Swapnila Mehta of the residents’ group, adding that the deficit infrastructure includes electrical substation, internal cabling, streetlights, road relaying, sewage and a rainwater drainage system among others. “The developer has collected infrastructure development charges (IDC) from each resident or property owner as it is their duty to see that proper infrastructure is provided,” said Singh. “During our interaction with MCG, we have pointed out the various shortcomings. We requested DTCP to take note of our estimate and ensure that the developer complies with the mandatory services before handover,” a resident said. MCG officials said that as per norms, they will conduct their own survey to map the deficit infrastructure and require cost. A senior officer of MCG added that the developer has responsibility to complete the deficit works before handover. If developers fail to do so, then they will be asked to deposit the required amount needed for completion of the works. Official of DTCP said MCG will prepare an estimate of deficit infrastructure and they will ensure developers comply with the government norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/rs-130-crore-needed-for-infra-work-in-malibu-towne-before-takeover-say-residents/articleshow/87171578.cms||Bagish Jha

In the video, a person clad in a white kurta-pyjama can be seen slapping a young boy Harsh Kumar at Sakalgarh village falling under Bhoa assembly constituency of Pathankot district. The person is identified as Congress MLA Joginder Pal. However, TOI has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the video. The youth had asked the MLA, "Tu ki kita (what have you done?)". Commenting on the video, Pathankot district BJP president Vijay Sharma said, “There is rule of law in the country, if a young boy posed a question to his elected representatives, the MLA should have replied and satisfied him and not started beating him.” SAD seeks arrest of Cong MLACondemning the roughing up of a SC youth by Congress MLA from Bhoa, SAD spokesman Pawan Tinu said a criminal case should be registered against him and he should be arrested immediately. “CM Charanjit Channi should prove he is ready to secure the interests of the SCs by ordering his arrest,” he added. Oppn, Cong leaders condemn incidentIn her police complaint, Harsh’s mother Sunita alleged that her minor son had gone to attend the village jagrata, where local MLA Joginder Pal was present, and was thrashed for asking about the work done by the MLA in the constituency. State president of SC wing of AAP Lal Chand Kataruchak said he had got the medical examination of Harsh done. He said it was heart-rending to watch the elected representative and his gunmen allegedly beat a boy for asking a question. Even Congress has criticised the incident. Former organizing secretary, AICC, Avinash Sharma said, “I condemn the MLA’s behaviour and demand suitable action against him.” Asked whether he had taken up the issue against at an appropriate platform within the party, he replied, “No, I didn’t take up the issue to avoid any disgrace to the party.” An agency report quoted Punjab deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa as saying on Wednesday that the MLA should not have behaved in this way.Joginder Pal couldn't be contacted for comments.

Aviation secretary Rajiv Bansal on Wednesday said that India will be “happy to add frequencies under air bubbles formed with other countries on a need basis.” Scheduled international flights are suspended since last March and since then international connectivity is being provided under Vande Bharat flights and air bubbles with about 30 countries. The mismatch in demand and supply, especially with travel restrictions lifting post the second wave, is leading to a surge in fares during the coming winter months. “We are willing to add more frequencies that will lead to more competitive fares. However, generally speaking international fares are usually not very high (with bookings yet to pick up). According to Air India, advance bookings during the (period starting) mid-December is in the range of 40%,” Bansal said. To be sure, international travel is a bilateral issue whose modalities are decided by two countries mutually. India unilaterally will not decide on fully reopening its skies as the same has to be reciprocated by other countries. But travellers — with most doing so out of dire necessity — are suffering. What used to be return fare in pre-pandemic times is now not even one-way fares on several routes like India-Canada and India-UK on peak demand days. “When travel with UK resumed, fare skyrocketed. Flights were later on increased between India and UK and till that announcement was made, hundreds of people bought tickets at prohibitive rate. If India is planning to add more capacity by whatever route it deems fit like more frequency under bubbles, the announcement should be made fast so that airlines ave more inventory to sell and fares fall,” said a leading travel agent who did not want to be named. India had allowed foreign tourists to fly in from charters starting October 15 and then on non-charter from November 15. So far no charter with tourists has flown into the country, say officials. Travel agents have started getting queries for tourist charters for one place — Goa. “We are going to launch a campaign to attract foreign tourists very soon,” said tourism secretary Arvind Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/international-airfare-relief-in-sight-india-open-to-adding-more-frequencies-under-air-bubbles-on-need-basis/articleshow/87174104.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The analysis of data reveals that the dengue cases has been eight times higher than the number of people contracting the virus during October 13-19. The number of dengue cases went up from 7,691 on October 13 to 9,047 on October 19. Around 193 new cases surfaced on average per day whereas only 168 cases of Covid infection were reported throughout the week. The bulk of the cases are being contributed by Mohali, Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Amritsar and Pathankot. What is more worrying, the state has already surpassed 8,435 dengue cases reported during last year. If the cases continue to grow at the current pace, the health experts fear that the state might breach the highest ever count of 15,398 recorded in 2017. From 2018 to 2020, the state had witnessed a steady decline in cases. Punjab deputy chief minister OP Soni admitted that there has been a rise in the number of cases, but said the spread is confined to a few districts. Soni said that he will hold a review meeting with officials on Thursday. Special teams have pressed into service while district-level committees under deputy commissioners have been formed besides other containment measures. Earlier this week, the government reduced the rate of dengue tests to Rs 600. The record outbreak of dengue cases during the ongoing Covid pandemic, which is far from over, has posed a serious health problem and compounded the challenge of doctors due to overlapping clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters. The problem has also been flagged in a study done by a team of doctors -- Amandeep Kaur, Navneh Samagh, Nimish Singh and Navdeep Kaur – of All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bathinda. The study published in the Journal of the Association of Physicians of India stated: “Health care workers are facing difficulty trying to distinguish between both the viruses and further managing the diseases with limited sources. More emphasis should be laid on preventive measures for this kind of endemic diseases so that we can effectively control these diseases and further reduce the burden on the health care workers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-dengue-outpaces-coronavirus/articleshow/87174197.cms||Vinod Kumar

A drought of backup for the health department means there is forecast for a spike. On Wednesday, the tally was 2,646, already much higher than 1,936 recorded in 2018. In 2019 and 2020, the caseload was 1,207 and 1,377, respectively. So far, Haryana has not reported any dengue death this season. The maximum cases are from Panchkula (331), followed by Sirsa (272), Fatehabad (206), Sonipat (192), Gurgaon (189), Nuh (175) and Faridabad (173). The least affected are Palwal (20), Karnal (38), Panipat (39), Rewari (43), and Jhajjar (57). Of the total 2,646 cases, the government hospitals reported 1,643 and private ones 1,003. Single donor platelets (SDPs) are now provided for free, while earlier it cost Rs 8,500, while the Haryana government has also claimed to have doubled the testing speed and capacity in all the 27 laboratories of 22 districts. Haryana health minister Anil Vij said: "We have directed the departments of health, urban local bodies, and panchayati raj to intensify fogging, and sent mobile teams to detect the larvae and breeding grounds of mosquitos." The state has deployed 1,410 hand-operated and 35 vehiclemounted fogging machines, besides releasing larvae-killer Gambusia fish into 7,167 water bodies. Vij claimed that the state had enough beds to manage this fever along with Covid. He said: "All those tested for dengue fever are checked for Covid-19 as well." In two months, 37,883 people were tested for both conditions. The government has deployed 420 domestic breeding checkers (DBCs) in all districts for the transmission season (July to November). Haryana’s hurdles are lack of backup from the civic bodies when Vij is in charge of both health and urban local bodies departments and had asked them recently to work in tandem. Till September 30, 69,310 house owners had received notices under the municipal bylaws for letting mosquito breed. Of these, 63,478 notices were from the health department, while only 5,832 from the civic bodies, in Gurgaon, Charkhi Dadri, and Rohtak districts. Water is logged around these homes. "A copy of every notice goes to the civic bodies. Had there been a follow-up or warning to the households, people would have taken corrective measures," said a senior officia. Vij promised to look into it complaints of irregular fogging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/stinging-in-the-rain-haryana-dengue-score-2600-a-3-year-high/articleshow/87174326.cms||Manvir Saini
