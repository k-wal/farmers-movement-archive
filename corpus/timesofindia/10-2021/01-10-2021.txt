A 30-member team of the City Armed Reserve (CAR) police took part in the cannon firing practice to acclimatise the elephants for the grand historical Dasara. Though elephants Dhananjaya, Gopalaswamy and Lakshmi partially showed some fear, it was negligible compared to the previous years, when few elephants ran helter-skelter due to the burst of sound. Seven cannons fired three rounds each totalling to 21 rounds as part of the practice session. — Inputs by Sridhar VG||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/preparation-for-dasara-festivities-in-mysuru-in-full-swing/articleshow/86649240.cms||---

While one person has been arrested in connection with this, the father-son duo who own the agency is absconding. Sources with the Bengaluru zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence said Alert Commandos Private Ltd, a subsidiary of Eagle Hunter Solutions Ltd in Delhi, has offices in Bengaluru and other parts of the country and provides security personnel services to private institutions. The firm owned by Bachh Raj Lohia and his son Ajai Lohia had collected fees, including GST, from its clients but did not show it in their balance sheets and other financial documents. “Despite collecting GST from their clients since 2017, Alert Commandos Private Ltd failed to pay GST by mis-declaring their taxable earnings of Rs 74 crore as ambulance charges which is exempted from GST as it’s an essential lifesaving service. The security agency was evading taxes through this fraudulent declaration. We’ve initiated legal action,” said an investigating officer. Sanjay Kundra, the finance manager of Alert Commandos, was arrested last week in Bengaluru and a GST Intelligence team went to Gurgaon to apprehend Bachh Raj Lohia and his son Ajai Lohia, who had fled and are absconding. A manhunt has been launched for the two men who are directors in the firm, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/firm-evades-13cr-gst-by-declaring-earnings-as-ambulance-fee-1-held/articleshow/86662273.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||After 17 years, Odisha man gets rid of 8kg face tumour in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: A 31-year-old man from Odisha, who lived with a face tumour weighing more than 8kg for 17 years, has got a fresh lease of life in Bengaluru. Manbodh Bagh lived with a bulky mass drooping from the right side of his face. His rare condition was called plexiform neurofibroma, a benign tumour of peripheral nerves that developed since childhood. The tumour extended from his head till the neck, affecting his daily life. Manbodh underwent 16 surgical procedures over the last six months to get rid of the tumour at Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru. The treatment, which began in December 2020, cost Rs 72.7 lakh and he was assisted by Milaap crowdfunding platform. “I consulted various doctors, but in vain. I’d be hesitant to go outdoors,” said Manbodh. Treating Manbodh involved doctors from departments of neurosurgery, plastic surgery, oncology, ENT, neuroanaesthesia and ophthalmology. The tumour involved his face — from forehead to half of the lower jaw — engulfing the right eye. CT scan revealed his facial bones were destroyed. “Since the tumour had destroyed his facial bones, the challenge was to restore them after removing it,” said Dr Sathish MS Vasishta, craniomaxillofacial surgeon, who treated Manbodh. With his CT scan data, a 3D printed skull model of his face was made to assess the extent of the tumour and design excision plan and reconstruction, said Dr Vasishta. The first surgery was done in December 2020 and it lasted for 19 hours. Dr Raghavendra Pai K, lead consultant, neuroanaesthesia said that the man suffered blood loss on the first day of surgery and was transfused nearly 40 litres of fluids, blood and blood components. “We had reserved 12 units of blood for this surgery, which is huge by regular standards and we were able to get additional eight units in a short span of time. Since his tumour was affecting the opening of his mouth, it was a challenge to get his breathing tube into the trachea for the first surgery. After three days of stabilisation in the ICU, he underwent the reconstruction surgery, which lasted for 23 hours...,” said Dr Pai. Dr Ravi Gopal Varma, lead consultant, neurosurgery & chief of neurosciences at the hospital said dealing with such highly complex cases often requires different modalities of treatment and a multi-disciplinary approach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/after-17-years-odisha-man-gets-rid-of-8kg-face-tumour/articleshow/86662580.cms||---

---||Guwahati||Plight of evictees worse than prisoners of war, says Brinda Karat||GUWAHATI: CPM polit bureau member Brinda Karat, after meeting the evicted families in Dholpur, on Thursday rued the plight of the families living in unhygienic conditions without medical aid, drinking water and other basic amenities. “The plight of the displaced is worse than the prisoners of war. Not a single paisa has been given for rehabilitation. We were told by women and children, many of whom were weeping, that they have no water, latrine, shelter, food and medical facilities,” said Karat. Karat feared a possible outbreak of typhoid epidemic due to the dirty water which the families are being compelled to drink. “Girls and women with menstrual-related conditions are the worst sufferers. There are some rules even for prisoners,” she said. While schools have reopened in the state phase-wise, she lamented that scores of children from the evicted families are unable to go to school. “We also found that all roads leading to the area have been blocked by the administration and so it is very difficult to get them medical aid,” said Karat. She accused the BJP-led government of uprooting families from the fertile cultivable lands of Dholpur in Sipajhar constituency of Darrang district without checking their documents which validate their claims of settled their for years. “They have necessary papers to show their occupation and in some cases ownership of the land,” said Karat, claiming that she saw many such documents in the public consultation. “It seems that the Constitution and the legal framework is suspended in this area,” said Karat. Revealing the findings of Wednesday's visit to three segments of Dholpur, she shot off a letter to Himanta Biswa Sarma asserting that around 1,000 poor peasant families, who have been tilling the land for the last 50 years or so, have been evicted. The CPM leader alleged that since the last eviction drive on September 23, no government officials have visited the people. “On the contrary, we saw several squads of armed police in the area which is nothing but intimidation. We also saw government deployed tractors ploughing and sowing the land. Without settling the claims, the government is taking illegal measures to grab the land,” Karat wrote to CM Sarma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/plight-of-evictees-worse-than-prisoners-of-war-says-karat/articleshow/86662687.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Over 22,000 students are appearing for the exam. However, following a Gauhati High Court order, the Board of Secondary Education, Assam (Seba) is also contemplating to start the process of conducting the compartmental examination for around 10,000-12,000 students. The high court, while hearing a plea for holding compartmental examinations for students who failed in the statistical formula-based evaluation by Seba, gave liberty to students to approach the board to appear again in the subjects in which they have failed. The court hoped Seba would sympathetically consider it. Seba secretary Suranjana Senapati said the board, in accordance with its policy, “had held compartmental examinations in the past, only in respect of the failed students”. According to the Seba policy, compartmental examination was held in the past for those candidates who could not come out successful in HSLC/AHM examination but failed maximum in three subjects and obtained minimum 170 marks in aggregate. They were eligible to appear in the compartmental examination only once in a single chance. The candidate appearing in compartmental examination has to secure 30% and above marks in the subjects appeared in and his total marks must be 180 to come out successful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/class-x-special-exam-begins-today/articleshow/86662718.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

---||World||Sikh Unani physician killed in Peshawar||ISLAMABAD/ AMRITSAR: Unknown gunmen shot dead a Unani physician belonging to the Sikh community in Pakistan’s northwestern city of Peshawar on Thursday, triggering panic among the tiny minority community in the provincial capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Sikhs have demanded that the Pakistan government ensure their security and rein in the elements targeting them. According to the police, the attackers escaped after firing four shots at Hakeem Satnam Singh who was inside his clinic, Dharmandar Dawakhana, on Charsadda road in Peshawar. Singh was rushed to the nearby Lady Reading hospital in a critical condition where he succumbed to his injuries. The hakeem, locals said, had returned to Peshawar a day earlier from Hassan Abdaal, where Gurdwara Punja Sahib, one of the famous holy sites of Sikhism, is located. Police said a case has been registered against unknown assailants and investigation is underway. A Sikh social activist, Radesh Singh Tony, told TOI on phone from Pakistan that Satnam’s family members were from the Tira tribal community in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai Agency. The community members had relatives in Afghanistan's Jalalabad and often went there. Just 520 Sikh families live in Peshawar, the provincial capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Majority of them had migrated to the city from the tribal regions of Orakzai, Kurram and Khyber to escape terrorism. The gradual movement of these families from the tribal areas started in the mid-1980s which increased tremendously with the emergence of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an umbrella organization of a number of Pakistani terror outfits, in 2007. The demand for jizya (protection money from minorities) and several socio-religious curbs by the TTP had forced the Sikh families to leave their ancestral homes for a new abode. Tony said Satnam Singh along with his family had shifted to Peshawar following attacks on Sikhs, little knowing that he would fall victim to hate-mongers even here. "The Sikh community has appealed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to ensure their security," he said. Pakistan has been described as an unsafe country for minorities by rights groups. There have been over a dozen killings of Sikhs in the last few years. Among the victims was Dr Swaran Singh, adviser to KPK chief Parvez Khan Khattak, who was shot dead on April 22, 2016. “We fear the targeted killing of Sikh community members may increase with Taliban holding power in neighbouring Afghanistan since they had earlier been targeting the Sikhs in Afghanistan,” Tony said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/sikh-unani-physician-killed-in-peshawar/articleshow/86663441.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Commuters must wait till November for first e-bus ride||BENGALURU: Seven years after Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) mooted electric buses for the city, the first e-bus was unveiled on Thursday. Passengers will have to wait till November to travel in them. After inspecting it at Kengeri bus depot, transport minister B Sriramulu said: “Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai will formally induct 10 e-buses in November.” The first bus will undergo trial runs on road and traffic conditions after completing transport department registration. BMTC was the first state-run transport utility in the country to conduct trial-runs of e-buses in 2014. However, induction was delayed due to various reasons. National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) along with JBM Auto got the contract to provide 90 non-AC, midi (9-metre-long) e-buses. These are for Metro feeder service on Gross Cost Contract (lease) model under the Bengaluru Smart City scheme. BMTC is paying Rs 51.67 per kilometre with electricity for 180 assured kilometre per bus for 10 years. Each bus can take 33 passengers. The remaining 89 buses will be inducted in a phased manner by December 15. BMTC may face operational challenges in running these buses. While it can run 120km per single charge, BMTC will have to ensure they go the full distance, according to the tender’s terms. Officials said opportunity charging (charging the battery for short periods throughout the day) time of 45 minutes will be provided to cover the remaining 60km. In fact, BMTC has to pay under-utilisation charges (50% of the GCC) if an e-bus runs less than 180km per day. “It’s difficult to operate 180km per bus during weekends and holidays when demand is low. Also, we need to set up additional charging facilities,” a BMTC official said Meanwhile, BMTC will expedite induction of 300 e-buses under the Centre’s Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India (FAME)-II scheme with Ashok Leyland the lowest bidder to supply them. BMTC officials said charging infrastructure is available at Yeshwantpur, KR Puram and Kengeri. Though additional charging points were planned at Banashankari, Yelahanka and Central Silk Board mainly for opportunity charging, it’s yet to be finalised. “We plan to deploy 30 electric feeder buses each to West, North and East,” said an official.  At present, the operational cost of a non-AC bus diesel is Rs 65/km. This means a saving of around Rs 15/ Km. “Operational cost is less and it’s environment friendly,” said a BMTC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/commuters-must-wait-till-nov-for-1st-e-bus-ride/articleshow/86663476.cms||---

TTP, a conglomerate of several Pakistani terror outfits, has intensified its attacks on Pakistani security forces in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces since Kabul fell to the Afghan Taliban on August 15 after ousting the US-backed government there. The group, along with the Afghan Taliban, had remained active for years in the fight against the US-led Afghan forces in their war against terror. In a statement, the ISPR said that security forces conducted an operation after receiving information about the presence of terrorists in Tank. “During the exchange of fire, Captain Sikander — who was 27 years old and hailed from Pakpattan (located in the Punjab province) — was killed,” the statement said, adding that a TTP commander, Khawaza Din alias Sher Khan, was also killed. “Weapons and ammunition were recovered from the hideout.” Separately, the Pakistani security forces claimed they had killed 10 suspected terrorists, including four commanders, on Tuesday in the remote Sarwakai area of South Waziristan. A statement from the ISPR said the terrorists were killed in an intense exchange of fire. The TTP, however, contradicted the military’s claim, saying that Pakistani security forces had carried out a drone strike that killed a woman and two children. These conflicting claims could not be independently verified. The TTP was formed in December 2007 and its members were trained and educated at the same religious seminaries that produced the Afghan Taliban. The group has carried out some of the most horrific attacks against Pakistanis, even killing schoolchildren, and was eventually pushed by Pakistan’s armed forces into Afghanistan in 2014. Their frequent attacks inside Pakistan, locals and independent observers believe, show that the group has been regrouping in its former stronghold of Waziristan. The TTP has carried out 33 attacks inside Pakistan in last one month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/ttp-kills-pakistani-army-captain/articleshow/86663569.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Excerpts from an interview: Are violations of food safety norms on the rise?As the state has lifted most Covid-19 restrictions now, we are seeing new eateries and more people trying them out. Also, the target given to food safety inspectors has increased to at least 15 samples a month against one or two samples until 2020. What is the most common food safety violation in the city?In most cases, it is the use of artificial colours. These are toxic and in the long run can cause diseases such as cancer. The dark red colour in Chicken 65, grilled meat and bhajis comes from artificial colours. Many sweets and savoury shops also add such colours. The other common violation is the use of stale meat. Eateries either buy stale meat because it costs less or it turns stale because they fail to preserve them at the right temperature. Over the last ten years, we have filed 94 criminal cases for such violations. Other violations include adulteration, misbranding, and substandard quality of bakery items, groceries, milk, aerated drinks, package water, tea and coffee. Over the last ten years, we have filed more than 866 civil cases and 526 criminal cases. What happened to the cases?Punishments for civil cases can be a fine of up to 10lakh, and for criminal cases courts can impose a jail term of up to 7 years with or without a fine of up to 10 lakh. How many eateries are there in the city now?We don’t have the exact number. Zonal officials are conducting a survey to map all eateries. How can people find out if their food is adulterated?For instance, dhaniya is injected with a green colouring agent and pepper is coated with mineral oil to make it look dark and shiny. Consumers should lodge complaints with the food safety department if they see violations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/file-a-complaint-if-food-is-adulterated/articleshow/86663381.cms||Pushpa Narayan

The boy’s father had lodged a complaint and a police team intercepted at Villupuram a car with the child’s mother and some of her friends. They were taking the boy to Tirunelveli. The Chromepet police, however, made no arrest as the boy’s father Mohammad Ismail, 29, withdrew his complaint after he became aware that his wife Fatima was involved in the incident. On Wednesday night, a police officer said, Ismail’s son Mohammad Siddique was playing outside his house in Chromepet when a car halted a few metres away. The occupants called out to Siddique who went there and got in. The car sped away. The boy’s friends who noticed this informed Ismail. Ismail and a few residents of the area immediately ran to the Chromepet police station and lodged a complaint, virtually besieging the station and demanding swift action. A case was registered. A police team went to the spot, checked footage from a few CCTV cameras and found the boy boarding the car. All the tollgates and check points were alerted and the vehicle was stopped at Villupuram. Fatima, who was inside the car, said that it was her son and she was taking him home. They were sent back to Chennai. At the Chromepet police stations, inquiries with both parties revealed that Ismail and Fathima had separated seven years ago soon after their son was born.

Fathima, who had moved in with her mother at Tirunelveli after the separation, had made a few attempts earlier to bring her son home but failed, police. She finally decided to forcibly take him away, an officer said. The boy was finally reunited with his father. “Both the families were pacified and decided to sort out the things among themselves. The couple had been in a long standing tussle on who should bring up the child,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/police-foil-child-abduction-attempt/articleshow/86663761.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai, suburbs to receive rain in next 48 hours: IMD||CHENNAI: The city and several other districts in the state are likely to receive more rain in the coming days due to favourable weather conditions and a likely withdrawal of the southwest monsoon from October 6. The monsoon withdrawal will pave the way for the onset of northeast monsoon, which brings more than 60% of the city’s annual rainfall. IMD has forecast thunderstorms with light to moderate rain in the city and the suburbs at least for the next two days and heavy to very heavy rainfall over parts of southern districts in the state till October 4. Maximum and minimum temperature could hover at 31 deg C and 25 deg C. N Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, IMD said an upper air circulation over the south Bay of Bengal will trigger the convective rainfall activity. “As it moves from west to east from the sea towards the land, it’s the easterly trough is likely to bring widespread rainfall in the state,” he said. On Thursday, IMD announced that southwest monsoon will begin withdrawing from parts of northwest India around October 6. The normal onset date for northeast monsoon is October 20 with a deviation of six days. The monsoon is expected to bring 867 mm rainfall to the city between October and December, which is nearly 63% of the city’s 1383.9mm annual rainfall. The June to September season has concluded with Nungambakkam recording 558mm rainfall and Meenambakkam 497.9mm which were 115.4mm and 10.1mm in excess. Chennai subdivision has so far received 500.2mm against a normal 459.9mm leaving a 9% excess rainfall during the same period. City’s neighbours Tiruvallur has recorded 19% and Kanchipuram 6% surplus rain while Chengalpet recorded 15% deficit rainfall during the season. “We can expect late night or early morning rainfall in the city and as the day progresses, the action shifts to interior districts. The rainfall activity may continue till the first week of October,” said blogger Pradeep John.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-suburbs-to-receive-rain-in-next-48-hours-imd/articleshow/86663770.cms||---

But instead of losing heart, he utilised the enforced time indoors to come up with new designs and later, market them online. Now, Ansari is exhibiting the latest of his weaves at Crafts Council of India’s (CCI) ‘Textiles & Accessories’, which is being held at Mayor Ramanathan Chettiyar Centre (MRC Centre), San Thome High Road, from September 30 to October 1. “We are traditional weavers who have been doing this for generations, so even when I modify old patterns, I try to preserve the traditional designs while giving it a modern twist,” says Maheshwar-based Ansari. After a hiatus of one-and-a-half years, 16 master weavers and designers have come together to participate in the 36th edition of CCI’s exhibition. “It’s also a fundraiser for CCI, and we have brought in weaves that people in Chennai otherwise wouldn’t be able to buy,” says Gita Ram, chairperson, CCI. The textiles on display are the result of an interface among designers, master weavers and artisans. There are Benarasi, mulmul, jamdani and cotton sarees from West Bengal; handwoven, cotton sarees from Assam’ Chanderi, organza and silk embellished garments as well as well-known brands. Anuradha Kuli from Assam, whose label ‘Naturally Anuradha’ uses only 100% natural dyes, says orders from her clients abroad helped her stay afloat during the pandemic. “I only use indigo, raw turmeric etc to dye the stoles, sarees and mekhela chadors I create. And that’s what attracts my customers,” says Anuradha, whose creations have been showcased at the Lakme Fashion Week and India Fashion Week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/weavers-designers-come-together-for-crafts-council-expo/articleshow/86663781.cms||Priya Menon

Sources said that Musk’s satellite internet venture, Starlink, and Amazon have held separate consultations with the telecom ministry – as well as the Department of Space – for starting satellite-based internet services in India, “though they are yet to apply for a license through the formal route”. “Consultants representing the companies have had discussions with us, and have indicated that they are keen to offer internet services in India using a constellation of satellites. We expect them to apply for the licence very soon,” a telecom department source said. Read AlsoElon Musk thinks here's why Jeff Bezos retired as Amazon CEOThis isn’t the first time Musk has taken a dig. In fact, a couple of years he also called Bezos a “copycat.” The most recent tweet comes after Amazon is unhappy about Starlink's satellite internet future plans.Currently, OneWeb – where Mittal’s Bharti Global holds the largest stake and has partners such as the UK government – has publicly announced plans of launching satellite-based services in India by next year (also launching across other global geographies). OneWeb has received a national long distance (NLD) license from the telecom department. The plan of the companies is to offer large swathes of bandwidth – with speeds as high as 1 GBPS and even more – through low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites that would be deployed at a distance of around 1,000km from Earth. The bandwidth would then be sold to a variety of users/customers that will include business enterprises, railways, shipping companies, defence establishments, airlines, and telecom companies, thus directly competing with the likes of Airtel and Jio. Also, these services can be used to reach dark zones in rural areas, as well as difficult terrains such as deserts and mountainous regions, and those infested with naxals and other sensitive locations. The telecom department source said that companies will have to follow the guidelines stipulated for telecom services as and when they begin services. “All the mandates, including those around lawful interception and other security needs, will need to be adhered to as per the licensing conditions.” Read AlsoWhy Elon Musk wants to send a silver medal to Jeff BezosThey are two of the richest men in the world. In the last 12 months or so there has been a game of musical chairs between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos in the world’s richest person list. Now, the Tesla CEO has overtaken the Amazon founder once again and the Tesla CEO couldn’t resist a jibe.Musk has said publicly that his company is keen to come to India through his ambitious project, Starlink, and is studying government regulations for beginning services. “Just figuring out the regulatory approval process,” he had told a user on Twitter recently when asked about the India plans. In fact, Starlink has appointed Sanjay Bhargava – a “founding employee” of PayPal (where Musk was amongst the co-founders) – as “country director” for India. Bhargava, who joins the company from Friday, had said on his LinkedIn page a few days back, “Super excited to join Space X effective October 1, 2021, as Starlink country director India. Had worked with @elonmusk on the PayPal founding team. Have been in India since 2004 and Starlink and I share a common passion for supporting a transformed India starting with rural India.” Amazon, also a top online retailer in India, is looking to step into the satellite-based internet service in the country. The company, as per sources, feels that a bigger footprint in India through high-speed broadband will help it reach a wider online audience, which can also be another enabler for its retail business. Amazon will get its services in India through its “Project Kuiper” programme which is engaged in launching low-earth orbit satellites to cover the entire globe. A few weeks back, Mittal’s OneWeb and American Hughes Network entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for a strategic agreement to distribute internet services to large enterprises, small and medium businesses, government, telcos and ISPs (Internet Service Providers) in rural and remote parts of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/musk-bezos-set-to-offer-broadband-in-india/articleshow/86663775.cms||Pankaj Doval

The minister was to board an early morning flight from Chennai to Tuticorin. The CISF personnel who was manning the baggage scanners raised a question about the two laptops in the bag that was placed for screening. The security personnel usually insist that all gadgets are taken out and kept in separate trays for scanning. However, his questions gave the impression that he was insisting that two gadgets should not be in the bag. This led to a flutter and senior officers intervened to resolve the issue. An official of Airports Authority of India (AAI) said that this was a case of miscommunication as the CISF personnel wanted the minister to place the laptops and a tablet on separate trays. “There is no rule saying that more than one laptop cannot be carried in flight. The security personnel raised a question because the gadgets were not taken out. Officials who were nearby intervened and solved the issue. The minister boarded the flight on time," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ptr-faces-minor-hassle-at-airport/articleshow/86663787.cms||---
---||Chennai||This day 25 years ago it was Vanakkam Chennai||Twenty-five years ago, on this day, the residents of the city woke up to find they no longer lived in Madras but Chennai. The previous day -- September 30, 1996 -- then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M Karunanidhi had issued a Government Order changing the name of the city. “In 1969, then chief minister C N Annadurai got the name of the Sstate changed from Madras to Tamil Nadu,” says R Rangaraj, president of Chennai 2000 Plus, which runs programmes on the antiquity of Chennai. “Before 1969, both the capital and the state were known as Madras and that created confusion. Also, in other districts of the State, the capital was always referred to as Chennai or patnam, short for its original name of Chennapatnam.” Theories abound as to how the names Madras and Chennai came to be, says historian KV Raman in ‘The Early History of The Madras Region', originally published in 1957. One of them, according to Raman’s book, is that it comes from Madresan, headman of the village of fishermen who persuaded Francis Day to name the settlement after him. In 1637, Day, bought this piece of land for the British East India Company from the Raja of Chandragiri through a local chief named Damarla Venkatappa Nayak. Raman’s book say the name may have also come from the Church of St Mary Madre de Deus, a third is that it derives from Mahraskuppam, mentioned in a Persian manuscript of the 18th century as the original name of the site granted to the British. The name Chennapatnam though is not “shrouded in mystery”, says the book. Raman says the Telugu work Ushaparinayam, written by Anka, a brother of Damarla Venkatapa, refers to his brother Ayyappa as having built the town Chennapatnam, named after his father Chennappa. Subsequently, Chennapatnam was the name given to the new town that grew immediately around Fort St George, says Raman in his thesis, while the older plot, Madraspatnam, lay to the north of it. Later, on account of the expansion of the city, the two became one. K Sridharan, retired deputy superintendent of the State Archaeology department, says a more than 450-year-old inscription in Krishnagiri district mentions Chennapatnam. Madras, Chennai, Chennai, Madras, whatever the tales behind the two names, the city survives and thrives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/this-day-25-years-ago-it-was-vanakkam-chennai/articleshow/86663451.cms||Kamini Mathai
---||Guwahati||Illegal settlers aim to capture Dispur by 2050: Himanta Biswa Sarma||GUWAHATI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday said illegal settlers in Assam are systematically encroaching on government land and changing the demography in assembly constituencies with an objective to take the reins of power at Dispur by 2050 (polls due in 2051). He added that encroachment at Darrang district’s Dholpur is a part of the blueprint to grab the Sipajhar assembly constituency. Of the 10,000 people in the area, 6,000 of them do not have their names even in the preliminary NRC. “Earlier, when I was not the chief minister, I did not have access to intelligence files. But now I have them and these reports talk about a blueprint to take over constituencies after constituencies. Their common thought is to turn around the demography and emerge as the majority to take control of power at Dispur by 2050,” Sarma said, adding, “If we can stop this from happening, it will be a big achievement for us.” By ‘they’, Sarma meant illegal settlers. “I do not want to say that these people are from Islam faith because our native Assamese Muslims are far, far away from this blueprint. You all know who I am talking about. In fact, the desi Muslims (natives) are complaining to me that their mosques have been grabbed by these illegal settlers,” the chief minister said. “In the last election, three assembly constituencies — Barkhetri, Batadraba and Mangaldai constituencies — have gone from natives to illegal settlers just by change in demography as laid down in the blueprint,” added Sarma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/sarma-illegal-settlers-aim-to-capture-dispur-by-2050/articleshow/86663925.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||India||69% adults have got at least one jab, 25% fully vaccinated: Govt||NEW DELHI: As many as 31 states and UTs have covered more than 60% of their adult population above 18 with at least one dose of Covid vaccines and 25% of this cohort has received the full two doses. Overall, 69% of the total adult population of the country has received at least one dose of vaccine. As a share of the entire population, the coverage works out to 46% and India has administered 889 million shots. India's shots per 100 population has risen to a respectable 63, with the world average at 79.4. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, despite administering a significant number of doses, are among seven states with below 60% coverage. Other states with less than 60% coverage are Jharkhand, West Bengal, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Manipur. The large population of the heartland states might in part explain lower coverage. Six states and UTs have achieved 100% coverage of their respective adult population with the first dose of vaccines. This are Lakshadweep, Chandigarh, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Sikkim. The pick-up in vaccination can be seen with 10 states having inoculated more than 80% of the adult population with at least one dose, whereas the coverage of the first dose ranges between 60% and 80% in 15 states. At present, the daily monthly average for vaccination is close to 80 lakh. The Centre also stressed on the need to ramp up coverage of the second dose, particularly among health and frontline workers who were prioritised for receiving the vaccines. Around 85% of healthcare workers and 82% of frontline workers have received both doses so far. The Centre has taken up the matter with specific states, officials said. "Certain specific states where the second dose coverage is on the lower side, we have drawn their attention. We have provided a facility in CoWin where line-listing of people who have missed their second dose can be generated. So states have got those lists, and they are looking into it that these people can be given the second dose," health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/69-adults-have-got-at-least-one-jab-25-fully-vaccinated-govt/articleshow/86664192.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Gurgaon||Durga Puja committees in Gurgaon opt for low-key celebrations||Pandal hopping has been one of the highlights of Gurgaon's Durga Puja celebrations for years. The city's Bengali community organises over two dozen Durga Pujas across the city every year. So, the disappointment was inevitable when COVID caused puja celebrations in the city to be cancelled last year. Aficionados and foodies will just have to wait longer as the persistence of pandemic and government rules in place mean that even though Gurgaon's Durga Puja committees will hold celebrations this year, they will largely be closed for the general public. Almost all of the Durga Pujas being organised in the Millennium City this year are not allowing visitors beyond the committee members. There are no big pandals, no food stalls, and no on-ground cultural programmes. Tapas Dey from the Sahasrabdi Durga Puja Committee says, "We will be holding only a small puja within the premises. There'll be no food stalls or other attractions. In fact, the pandal and puja will only be open for members of the committee and their families." Even though there is no restriction on partially vaccinated attendees, all committees say they are trying to make sure all members are double vaccinated by the time the puja begins. In fact, all pujas are ensuring all the staff and helpers, including priests, cooks, etc, are also fully vaccinated. In addition, there is no bhog at the pandal with most pujas preferring either takeaways or tying up with food delivery providers for home delivery for members. Almost all of the Durga Pujas being organised in the city this year are not allowing visitors beyond the committee membersCertain pujas that are allowing outsiders have also introduced a timeslot roster system for visitors to avoid overcrowding at the venue, using technology for it. Nitish Mukherjee, a governing body member from the Bangiya Parishad that organises a big puja in Sector 56, tells us, "We have an app where visitors can register themselves and book time slots in advance for their visit to the pandal. There are limited visitors at each time slot to make sure the number of visitors in the pandal at any one time does not exceed the limit prescribed by the administration." For some, the reduction in scale has also meant a change in the venue. The Purbapalli Durgotsav, for instance, usually organises a large scale puja in Sector 15 but due to COVID, this year, they have not only scaled the festivities down but also shifted the venue to a farmhouse on the outskirts of the city. "Since the puja is open only for members and much smaller in scale, we are organising it in a farmhouse just outside the city. We can ensure COVID protocols are being followed much better over there," says Shoubhik Sen, who is associated with the puja. Many of the puja committees will be organising cultural programs, albeit virtually. Most will be streaming them either live or delayed on their social media pages or websites. Organisers say that the virtual model has allowed them to be more ambitious with their choice of artistes. "The scope of cultural activities has actually increased this year due to it all being digital. Moreover, as COVID and work-from-home situations have been ongoing for a year-and-a-half, everyone is now well-versed with the technology. This way, we can have artistes from Kolkata perform for us virtually, some of whom may not have travelled down to Gurgaon otherwise," says Nitish Mukherjee from the Bangiya Parishad. The puja committee has bought a licensed software to stream the performances on their social media. Like last year, the committees have together formed a Joint Puja Committee in Gurgaon to oversee the visarjan of the idols in an eco-friendly manner. Usually, it is done in a big tank in Sector 56 but this time, since most of the idols are much smaller than regular years, it will also be a smaller affair. "There will be no processions during the visarjan and each committee will be allowed to bring only five people for the visarjan," informs Shoubhik Sen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/durga-puja-committees-in-gurgaon-opt-for-low-key-celebrations/articleshow/86652580.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur
---||Delhi||Durga Puja committees opt for low-key celebrations||From thematic pandals with grand décor and magnificent idols to cultural programmes and scrumptious bhog – there are many reasons why people await the onset of Durga Puja celebrations in the city. But last year, many missed the grandeur of puja as the puja committees decided to go for virtual celebrations. This year, too, many puja committees have decided to either go for virtual celebrations or organise the pujawith a limited number of people – mostly members. On Wednesday, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) reportedly decided to allow Ramleela,Dussehra and Durga Puja celebrations, but with restrictions like the number of people should not exceed the total number of seats in a venue, no stalls and fairs to be set up, 100% mask compliance and separate entry and exit points at the venue. Most puja organisers in the city say that they have too little time to prepare for celebrations now and have decided to have low-key celebrations this year, too. ‘Entry only for members – vaccination certificate and negative COVID test reports will be mandatory’Last year, Arambagh Puja Samiti, which used to organise one of Delhi’s biggest puja pandals at Panchkuian Road ground, moved their celebrations to a temple complex in Paharganj. This year too, the puja celebrations will be held there with entry restricted only to the members. “We will have a 5ft idol at the venue, but only members will be allowed. And even they will be given slots to avoid crowding at the venue. Last year too, we did the puja in a similar manner. Everyone involved in the puja, even the support staff, had to take the COVID test before entering the venue. This year, we have made it mandatory that everyone will have to produce a vaccination certificate to enter the venue. We have made arrangements for visarjan within the premises of the temple. We want to keep it low-key, ” informs Abhijit Bose, Chairman, Arambagh Puja Samiti. In Chittaranjan Park (CR Park), the most popular puja location in the city, while some puja committees have cancelled the celebrations, some have decided to do a ghot puja (worshipping an urn symbolising the goddess). And only a few committees like the Chittaranjan Park Kali Mandir Society will do the puja with 5ft idol of the goddess. Only members from the managing committee will be allowed entry. “Even those members will have to submit COVID negative report on October 10 (puja begins from October 11). No one will be allowed at the venue without the COVID negative report,” says Sabir Datta, managing committee member, Chittaranjan Park Kali Mandir Society. Vivek Roy, Joint Secretary, Mela Ground Durga Puja Samiti, says that most puja committees in CR Park are planning to do a symbolic puja. “We can’t plan anything in a few days. We do not even have the budget to plan anything big. Most societies in CR Park will do a ghot puja on one of the days. We will perform a small puja and other rituals in just one day with a limited number of people,” he adds. Ashim Banerjee,a spokesperson from B Block Durga Puja in CR Park, says that “going by restrictions and budget limitations, this year it seems impossible for us to organise puja.” Debashis Saha from Matri Mandir Samity, adds, “We haven’t finalised anything, but looks like we will have to go ahead with a ghot puja. It is too late to plan a puja now. Puja preparations have to start months in advance.” Home delivery of bhogThough not all devotees will participate in puja celebrations, Durga Puja committees are making sure that they aren’t deprived of the bhog and prasad. Some puja committees have a group of volunteers who will be delivering bhog on the four days of the puja. Some have come up with collection centres at different locations in their area, from where people can collect bhog, but it should be pre-booked online. “We will be delivering bhog within a 10km radius of our location. People can book bhog thalis online, and it will be delivered to their place. Like last year, this year, too, we are not having any grand celebrations. We might do ghot puja with the goddess’ photo frame that we have from last year. We still haven’t decided about having an idol. Even décor will be minimal. Before last year, we would spend around Rs 50,000 on floral decoration, but this year that budget has come down to Rs 5,000. But bhog is something that we will continue to deliver even this year,” says Ena Pathak, Treasurer, Durga Bari, Greater Kailash I. Almost all of the Durga Pujas being organised in the city this year are not allowing visitors beyond the committee members Live streaming of puja and online cultural programmesEvening aartis and all other puja rituals will be live-streamed on social media pages of different committees. “We have also arranged streaming on TV through a local cable operator. If visitors cannot participate in the puja at pandals, they can, at least, virtually be a part of it. Devotees who want to do some puja in their name can book it online. Pandit ji will say their name while doing the puja, and they can watch it online. We are also doing online cultural competitions, and we have even got entries from participants in Abu Dhabi, Bangkok, Switzerland, etc,” says Sabir Datta, managing committee member, Chittaranjan Park Kali Mandir Society.

Interacting with the residents of Vathalmalai, a tribal hillock hamlet in Dharmapuri district, Stalin pointed out that former chief minister late M Karunanidhi was instrumental in launching self-help groups in Dharmapuri and that he (Stalin), as the then local body minister and deputy CM, had provided them plenty of loans. “The self-help groups had a tough time getting funds from banks during the AIADMK government. So, we revived the scheme after forming the government to help women stand on their own legs and lead a life with self-respect,” Stalin said. He told the residents that the government had already fulfilled 202 of the 505 poll promises and that the remaining would be implemented in a phased manner. Stalin also heard their grievances and handed over welfare measures to the tune of 16.5 crore to 2,116 beneficiaries in the tribal hamlet. The villagers, who said it was the first time a chief minister was visiting the hamlet, thanked Stalin. Stalin promised them that the government would soon take steps to appoint a chairman and other members to the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Commission. Earlier in the day, Stalin inaugurated the comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care services building built at 10 crore cost at the Dharmapuri medical college hospital and various other projects implemented at a cost of 17.44 crore. The chief minister also visited Hogenakkal, where he inspected the water pump house and discussed about the Hogenakkal combined water supply scheme with the officials. Stalin was accompanied by health and family welfare minister Ma Subramanian, Pennagaram PMK MLA G K Mani and senior officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/self-help-groups-didnt-get-funds-during-aiadmk-rule-we-revived-them-stalin/articleshow/86665079.cms||Senthil Kumaran

The NGT had taken up the case suo moto in July 2020 based on a newspaper report highlighting pollution in the 1,000-year-old Chola-era irrigation canal, which benefits farmers in Trichy and Thanjavur districts. The tribunal had appointed a committee comprising senior officials from the revenue department, TNPCB, PWD and Trichy Corporation to inspect the canal and initiate permanent corrective measures. To prevent wastewater from entering the canal at around 36 points, the urban local body has proposed underground drainage project (phase II) under the AMRUT scheme and smart cities mission, the corporation informed the tribunal. The corporation also proposed to revamp the 30-year-old underground sewage in the Uyyakondan area and link treated wastewater from Trichy MGMGH to the underground sewer network at a cost of 94.6 lakh. Quality tests by TNPCB showed presence of E Coli in the water, indicating the presence of sewage in it. IT also showed dissolved oxygen levels from 1.3 mg/L to 4 mg/L, less than permissible standards of above 6 mg/L, making the water unfit for even bathing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ngt-seeks-trichy-corpn-report-on-polluted-canal/articleshow/86665086.cms||Deepak Karthik

The party said its founder MGR was instrumental in the DMK capturing power and Karunanidhi becoming chief minister. In a statement, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami condemned DMK general secretary and minister S Durai Murugan for his purported statement at a party meeting recently that MGR was a betrayer. “It is like Satan quoting scripture,” the AIADMK leaders said, adding that MGR never betrayed anyone at any time. He was a popular leader and earned goodwill of the people. Many relied on him for survival, but he never relied on any individual,” they said. Accusing Karunanidhi of committing ‘countless betrayals,’ the AIADMK leadership said withdrawal of a case from the Supreme Court in Cauvery inter-state river water dispute was his greatest betrayal to the people of Tamil Nadu. “Ceding of Katchatheevu islet was a betrayal to the fishermen; claiming that civil war ended in Sri Lanka, which led to massacre of Tamils was a betrayal to the Sri Lankan Tamils; introducing NEET was a betrayal to the poor rural students; being supportive to the Centre to ban jallikattu was a betrayal to the sportspersons; supporting foreign direct investment in retail was a betrayal to the trading community,” the leaders said. Partymen considered the DMK as their family but ‘turning the family into party’ was the greatest betrayal, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/karunanidhi-is-a-betrayer-not-mgr-aiadmk-hits-back-at-durai-murugan/articleshow/86671582.cms||---

In a statement, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami condemned DMK general secretary and minister S Durai Murugan for his purported statement at a party meeting recently that MGR was a betrayer. “It is like Satan quoting scripture,” the AIADMK leaders said, adding that MGR never betrayed anyone at any time. He was a popular leader and earned goodwill of the people. Many relied on him for survival, but he never relied on any individual,” they said. Accusing Karunanidhi of committing ‘countless betrayals,’ the AIADMK leadership said withdrawal of a case from the Supreme Court in Cauvery inter-state river water dispute was his greatest betrayal to the people of Tamil Nadu. “Ceding of Katchatheevu islet was a betrayal to the fishermen; claiming that civil war ended in Sri Lanka, which led to massacre of Tamils was a betrayal to the Sri Lankan Tamils; introducing NEET was a betrayal to the poor rural students; being supportive to the Centre to ban jallikattu was a betrayal to the sportspersons; supporting foreign direct investment in retail was a betrayal to the trading community,” the leaders said. Partymen considered the DMK as their family but ‘turning the family into party’ was the greatest betrayal, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/karunanidhi-is-a-betrayer-not-mgr-aiadmk-hits-back-at-durai-murugan/articleshow/86671578.cms||---

---||Business||Adani’s wealth surges 261%, now Asia’s second richest||MUMBAI: India has added five billionaires every month in the last 12 months as the value of businesses such as chemicals, software and pharmaceuticals soared. Among the traditional billionaires, Gautam Adani (59) and family, with Rs 5.1 lakh crore (a 261% surge), for the first time has become Asia’s second-richest. His family has added Rs 1,000 crore a day over the last year. Mukesh Ambani (64), with Rs 7.2 lakh crore, remained the richest Indian for the 10th year in a row. The rise in commodity prices has enabled magnates, including Lakshmi Mittal (71) and Kumar Mangalam Birla (54), to be part of India’s top 10. Vaccine king Cyrus S Poonawalla of Serum Institute of India, whose wealth increased by 74% to Rs 1,63,700 crore occupies the 6th position. Gautam Adani's brother Vinod Shantilal Adani, who owns a trading business in Dubai, too made it to the top 10, ahead of Birla, with his wealth growing threefold to Rs 1.31 lakh crore. The last decade has seen the fastest pace of wealth creation with India’s rich adding Rs 2,020 crore of wealth every day for the past 10 years. Hurun, which compiles a list of the super-rich in India in partnership with IIFL Wealth management, has in this year’s ranking highlighted trends for the last decade. “The number of entrants in IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List has grown from just under 100 ten years ago to 1,007 today. At this rate, in five years, I expect the list to grow to 3,000 individuals. The evolution of the IIFL Hurun India Rich List is a reflection of India’s economic growth story,” said Hurun India MD & chief researcher Anas Rahman Junaid. According to Junaid, a decade ago the cut-off for being part of the top 10 in India was Rs 30,800 crore, which has gone up to Rs 1,21,600 crore. However, the cut-off to enter the top 100 has risen nine-fold from Rs 1,800 crore to Rs 16,800 crore. Pharma has been the biggest contributor to wealth creation with 130 individuals in the rich list from pharma, followed by chemicals (98) and software (81). Following the addition of 59 new billionaires, the number has gone up to 237. Another interesting finding is that, unlike a decade ago, wealth creation is no longer limited to big cities and includes people from Haridwar to Thiruvananthapuram, with the total number of cities at 76. According to IIFL Wealth joint CEO Anirudha Taparia, most billionaires invest largely in equity and in fixed income securities. Also, most of their money is invested in India where wealth creation is fastest. “They may invest some Rs 10 out of Rs 100 overseas, but most of it is invested back in the country,” he said. Also, new-age billionaires who have created wealth through startups have been giving back a lot to startups. “They are investing back in the ecosystem. They are far more comfortable in taking this particular risk where there is a lot of illiquidities,” said Taparia. He added that of late there were a lot of pre-IPO investments as well. Other trends include a drop in age. From Shivinder Mohan Singh being the youngest billionaire at 34 ten years ago, the lowest age has dropped to 23 with Shashvat Nakrani of Bharat Pe making it to the list. Another trend was the entry of professional managers with 14 of them making it to the rich list. Also, self-made billionaires now occupy two-thirds of the list, up from little more than half a decade ago. A global new entrant to the top-ten is Jay Chaudhry (62), of California-based enterprise cloud security firm Zscaler. The sector which has not done well in the last 12 months is jewellery with 12 businessmen dropping out of the rich list. Businessmen who have dropped out over the decade include Anil Ambani, Vijay Mallya, Venugopal Dhoot, Rana Kapoor, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Mohan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/adanis-wealth-surges-261-now-asias-second-richest/articleshow/86664528.cms||Prabhakar Sinha

Earlier this year, concerns emerged over the side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine due to very rare cases of blood-clotting after vaccination. After some nations temporarily suspended the use of the vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it considers the benefits of the drug to outweigh its risks.  "We continue to work with the FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] on submission," the company said on Wednesday. "Currently, the situation with respect to the pandemic and availability of alternative vaccine supply in the US doesn't really support an Emergency Use Approval. So, we believe that US approval will be via a BLA [Biologics License Applications] which we expect to be submitted later this year."  The FDA has so far authorized three vaccines for emergency used across the United States,  In February 2021, the World Health Organization listed two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, giving the green light for these vaccines to be rolled out globally through the COVAX mechanism.  According to AstraZeneca, its vaccine shows 92 per cent and 86 per cent efficiency against hospitalization in the Delta and Alpha variant cases, respectively. At the same time, a UK-based study from May, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 21, showed that AstraZeneca was 33 per cent effective after one dose, 60 per cent effective after two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/astrazeneca-to-seek-us-approval-for-covid-19-vaccine-later-this-year/articleshow/86665627.cms||---

In taking up a rarely entertained curative petition, a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana, and Justices U U Lalit, D Y Chandrachud, B R Gavai and Surya Kant allowed a request from senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Adani, for three weeks time to file response to Urja’s curative petition, which was ordered to be heard in open court on September 17. Appearing for Gujarat government and Urja, attorney general K K Venugopal and senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, said they would need a week to file a rejoinder. SC posted the matter for further hearing on November 17. An aggrieved party can file a petition seeking review of the judgment rendered by the SC. The review petitions are decided in chambers without the presence of counsel for parties and most are dismissed. Upon dismissal of a review petition, the aggrieved party can file a curative petition, which again gets decided in the same process in the chambers. It is extremely rare for the SC to entertain a curative petition and go for open court hearing on the issues raised against the earlier judgment. In its 2019 judgment, an SC bench of Justices Arun Mishra, Gavai and Kant had held that Adani Power had no option but to terminate the PPA as the supply of coal from Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation's Naini block was erratic and failed to meet the requirement of the power plant. Industry sources said that if the SC allowed the curative petition, then Urja could be entitled to around Rs 11,000 crore as compensation. Adani Power had terminated the 1,000-MW power purchase agreement with GUVNL from its plant in Mundra, citing non-coal supply by GMDC. Adani had claimed that the power supply was conditional to supply of coal. The termination notice was challenged by GUVNL before the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission which held the termination was illegal. The decision was upheld by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity but was later reversed by the Supreme Court. Recently, the SC had rejected an appeal by Adani Gas challenging denial of City Gas Distribution network in Gujarat and slapped a cost of Rs 10 lakhs on Adani Gas for acting naive about Rules and Regulations when it had taken advantage of the identical rules and regulations in bagging gas distribution network in Khurja, Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sc-seeks-adani-powers-response-to-gujarat-urjas-curative-plea/articleshow/86665661.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Rape accused IAF officer to face court martial||COIMBATORE: The rape case against Indian Air Force flight lieutenant Amitesh Harmukh will go before a military court for trial, a Coimbatore mahila court ruled on Thursday directing the city police to hand over the accused and the case to the IAF. Following the order, IAF officials took custody of Harmukh for a court martial. The Coimbatore central all-woman police arrested Harmukh on September 25 after a woman IAF officer lodged a complaint saying she was raped in her room when she was not in a fully conscious state. The 28-year-old officer had to go to the police after her complaint to IAF authorities did not yield any result for five days. ‘Accused would come to class daily and roam around as if nothing had happened’In her complaint, the rape survivor said she was pursuing a professional knowledge course at the Air Force Administrative College (AFAC) in Coimbatore and that Amitesh Harmukh was her coursemate. On the evening of the incident, she had taken pain killers for an ankle injury and was among a few of her friends when the flight lieutenant brought a drink for her. She said that after completing her second drink, she started feeling nauseous and was helped to her room by friends. While she was asleep, Amitesh came to her room and tried to wake her up several times though she asked him to leave her room. She then realised that she had been raped. She first approached higher authorities and lodged a complaint, but was scared that her name could be leaked and her family would come to know of it. She then said she did not want to complain. “I was told either to file a complaint or give in writing that it was all consensual and that I had no complaint to make. Later, I decided to go ahead with the complaint,” she said. When she presented herself at AFH for medical examination, doctors did a two-finger test on her and took swabs from her vagina. “Only later did I find that two-finger test was not supposed to be done for a rape examination. This action made me nauseous, and I had to relive the trauma,” she said, adding that she had also handed over the bedsheet and a mattress cover with semen stains. She also gave a written complaint to a wing commander-cadre officer and later officials had taken her statements. “One of the officers was being rude throughout the conversation,” the rape survivor said, adding that Amitesh came to class every day and roamed around in the building as if nothing had happened. She also alleged that the commandant-cadre officer asked her to give her withdrawal in writing. “This was the time I sought to withdraw the complaint, hoping that the mental harassment would stop, and that Amitesh would leave AFAC. But, my statement was changed entirely and new words added to it. I was feeling sick, my trauma intensified by the authorities’ attitude,” said the woman officer. On September 25, she approached central all-woman police in Coimbatore who registered a rape case against Amitesh and arrested him on September 25 night itself. He was remanded in judicial custody on September 26. Even as the city police sought the police custody of Amitesh Harmukh for seven days, the IAF demanded that the special court hand over the flight lieutenant to it for a court martial. On Thursday, additional mahila court judge (incharge) Thilageswari pronounced the order handing over the accused flight lieutenant to the IAF for court martial. He was taken to Air Force Administrative College (AFAC) premises by IAF officials immediately. Earlier, his counsel N Sundaravadivelu argued that Coimbatore city police do not have any right to conduct investigation in the rape case as it was an IAF case for court martial. After the arrest, the city police should have handed him over to IAF authorities, he said, adding that Coimbatore police sent him judicial custody instead. NCW flags 2-finger test on IAF officerCiting media reports, the the National Commission for Women on Thursday asked the IAF chief to look into charges of the woman officer being subjected to ‘two-finger test’ by doctors after her rape charge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rape-case-iaf-officer-to-face-court-martial/articleshow/86665635.cms||A Subburaj

While Singh clarified he wouldn’t join BJP, the announcement of his departure from Congress puts paid to party efforts to mollify him, even as the sudden resignation of his bete noire Navjot Singh Sidhu as Punjab state chief continues to roil the party, posing a stiff challenge to the Gandhis who have backed the former cricketer. “I will not remain in Congress. I have already made my position very clear. I will not be treated in this manner,” Amarinder told NDTV. Later, he dropped Congress from his twitter profile. Read AlsoNavjot Singh Sidhu may stay on as PCC chief, likely to get say in Channi govt key decisionsMiffed at not having a say in key decisions taken by the restructured cabinet in Punjab, Navjot Singh Sidhu stood his ground on Thursday even as Congress worked out a face-saver in the form of a party-government coordination panel that would ensure each side is heard. New CM Charanjit Singh ChanniHe also let out that a new force will come up in Punjab, suggesting the launch of a new party. If he does that, it will be for the second time, having floated a party when he left Congress protesting Operation Bluestar. Chidambaram’s tweet pointed to rising unhappiness over how Rahul and Priyanka have handled Punjab, as he said, "I feel helpless when we cannot start meaningful conversations within party forums. I also feel hurt and helpless when I see pictures of Congress workers raising slogans outside the residence of a colleague and MP. The safe harbour to which one can withdraw seems to be silence." Manish Tiwari and Shashi Tharoor also came out strongly in Sibal’s support a day after family loyalists like Ajay Maken suggested that the senior lawyer was an ingrate in questioning Sonia Gandhi who "had sent him to Parliament and made him a Cabinet minister". Immediately afterwards, a group of party workers aggressively demonstrated in front of Sibal’s house which was pelted with tomatoes. The protesters also damaged his car. Statements from members of G23 — a grouping of party leaders who are unhappy with the current arrangement marked by the absence of a full-fledged party president, an elected Congress Working Committee (CWC) and where Rahul Gandhi takes crucial decisions without holding any formal role — suggested that they considered the protests to be a "command performance". Read AlsoAzad seeks CWC core panel meeting to discuss turmoilAfter demanding an immediate meeting of the Congress working committee (CWC) to discuss the present turmoil in the party, senior G23 leader Ghulam Nabi Azad is learnt to be pushing for a “compact platform” for discussion instead of a “sprawling gathering” that the apex decision-making body usuallyG23 leader Ghulam Nabi Azad called for an urgent meeting of the CWC, and in what seemed like an effort at damage control, party spokesman and Rahul aide Randeep Surjewala said the apex panel is likely to meet soon. Azad is understood to have called for a meeting of the "core" CWC and not invitees, who, dissidents suspect, play the role of drum beaters for the official faction. Support for Sibal, who had upset family loyalists by attacking the leadership for the mess in Punjab, made it clear that the fear of Gandhis getting annoyed with them, was speedily losing its deterrence value. Singh followed up his meeting with home minister Amit Shah with a call on national security advisor Ajit Doval, ostensibly to discuss the security situation in Punjab in the light of incidents like drone attacks. The political significance of his Delhi visit was not missed as it is clear that he has moved closer to the BJP leadership. Even as he refused to join BJP, that does not rule out the possibility of him launching his own outfit which may join hands with the saffron outfit for the forthcoming Punjab polls. The balance between asking Shah to take steps to end the farm stir — signalling to farmers’ unions and Sikhs that he continues to take up the cause — and calling on the NSA on an issue where he is more in sync with BJP, indicated Singh might be keeping his future options open. Singh’s plea to the Modi government to repeal the controversial farm laws also does not reveal other parts of his conversation with Shah. His reference to farm laws could set the stage for a renewed outreach to the farm unions, it is felt. Interestingly, Singh told NDTV that Congress’s 18-point programme given to him for implementation by AICC’s Mallikarjun Kharge panel had focusd on Dalits and OBCs, but there should have been schemes also for Hindus "which were not there". Read AlsoCongress CMs can breathe easy as Punjab, G23 occupy core focusThe unexpected crisis in its Punjab unit wrought by the leadership’s choice Navjot Sidhu and the renewed G23 aggression are likely to provide relief to Congress incumbents in the two other party-ruled states which have been rocked by demands for change in recent months. The twin events have createdThe big announcement about his future plan was accompanied by the forecast that Congress’s popularity is steadily dipping in the state while AAP is gaining ground, a claim he ascribed to the two surveys conducted by the Congress during his regime. He blamed Navjot Sidhu’s attacks on his government for a 20% fall in Congress popularity as measured by a survey in June. Singh questioned Rahul Gandhi’s style of leadership, saying he wants to bring in young members in all positions and sideline all experienced leaders whom he does not listen to. He said this is contrary to the tradition where seniors are treated as planners of the party and young leaders are the implementers. He said the dissident bloc G23 are the experienced members who are the planners. Continuing with his sharp attacks on Sidhu, Singh called the sulking Congress state chief a "childish man, an unstable man" who cannot be trusted to take an organization or a team like a political party along. "Sidhu is good at drawing crowds. He is good at drama. He can do what he did in Kapil Sharma’s show and get a crowd, but he is not a serious guy. How can a non-serious person be taking serious, major decisions in the running of a party and the state government?" Singh said. "I have been in politics for 52 years. I have my own beliefs, my own principles. The way I have been treated... At 10.30 am the Congress President said you resign. I didn’t ask any questions. I said I will do it just now. At 4pm, I went to the Governor and resigned... still, the AICC observers told all the MLAs not to visit my residence and asked them to gather at the party office. If you doubt me after 50 years and my credibility is at stake... if there is no trust, what is the point of me staying in the party?" he lamented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-crisis-peaks-as-capt-says-will-quit-party-sr-leaders-back-sibal/articleshow/86665878.cms||---

The key infrastructure sector spanning coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement and electricity grew an annual 11.6% in August, higher than the 9.9% in July. The sector had contracted by 6.9% in August last year. The expansion was also helped by a low base of last year. Growth for the April-August period was at 19.3%. The eight core sectors account for 40.3% of the Index of Industrial Production and the August numbers augur well for the data of the factory output. Several key indicators have pointed to a sharp overall economic recovery as curbs were lifted across states. Economists forecast the economy to grow by double digits at around 10% in current fiscal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/core-sector-grows-11-6-in-august-on-low-base-effect/articleshow/86666242.cms||---

"If procurement is not started in Haryana by October 1, then the residences of all BJP and JJP MLAs and MPs will be gheraoed by paddy-laden tractor and trolleys on Saturday," BKU (Charuni) national president Gurnam Singh Charuni warned the Haryana government.  He added in Haryana, they had urged the government to start paddy procurement from September 25 if not by September 15.  "But the government procurement starts from October 1. When the norms were made for starting procurement from October 1, paddy seeds took longer time to get ready than now, with a crop cycle of 100 to 120 days. But now most of the farmers are cultivating hybrid seeds, which are reaped in 80 to 90 days,” said Charuni, adding that the paddy crop is fully ready and has started to arrive at the grain markets in large quantities.  "By issuing the instructions to delay the paddy procurement, the government is trying to evade the MSP (minimum support price). The rulers are not aware of the ground situation,” said the BKU Charuni in a press statement on Thursday.  BKU Charuni spokesman Rakesh Kumar Bains said the government should immediately start the paddy procurement from October 1 and provide relief to the farmers. “Otherwise, BKU Charuni will be forced to take a strict decision and the government will be responsible for the same," he said.  Bains added the government claims to be farmer-friendly and Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala was talking about starting the purchase of paddy from September 25, but today it has been delayed by 10 more days, while the paddy has been coming to the markets for sale for the last 10 days.  “Haryana dy CM Dushyant, who also holds the state ministry of food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, should immediately resign from his post,” Bains said.  BKU Charuni added that the ruling government is not aware of the ground situation and anti-farmer new decisions are issued from their air-conditioned rooms.  Haryana farmers’ union said that they have already dropped their paddy at the grain markets, which is now lying in the open, fearing loss due to unexpected weather.  For the said postponement of paddy procurement, the government referred to a Food Corporation of India (FCI) letter dated September 30, 2021, that due to recent heavy downpour in the states of Punjab and Haryana, the maturity of paddy has been delayed and the moisture content in the fresh arrival at present is beyond permissible limit.  On the other side, BKU Charuni said that the paddy is fully ready and that harvesting has also started.  "Now the farmers are in a position that they cannot even leave their crop in their fields or drop them at the grain markets because there is no space for more crop as it is not being lifted due to non-procurement. The arrangements at the grain markets are improper and recent rain has exposed the government as the farmers' paddy was washed with rainwater,” said BKU Charuni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bku-charuni-threatens-stir-if-paddy-procurement-doesnt-start-today/articleshow/86666571.cms||JK Singh

The comparison might not hold any water at this point of time. But the statement made by Elon Musk, the self-proclaimed Dogefather and owner of SpaceX, about accepting Dogecoin for a satellite launch on the moon indeed holds great significance for investors and stackers of the meme-based crypto. Musk's frequent tweets about Doge have led people to believe that he is the founder of the coin. However, belying popular belief, Elon Musk is not the founder CryptocurrencyLiveJourney of DogecoinThe genesis of Dogecoin in December 2013 lies in the sarcastic approach of the founders, Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus to create a payment system based on a joke, making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time. It all started with a tweet from Palmer, a software engineer of good standing in 2013. He tweeted - “investing in Dogecoin, pretty sure it’s the next big thing”. Palmer was later joined by another innovator Billy Markus who was working with IBM. They both founded Dogecoin. Whether it remains a sarcastic meme coin or not, Dogecoin is taking great strides in the world of cryptocurrencies. The price of Dogecoin was unpredictable but it went spiraling upwards to reach over $1 billion market capital by January 2018. Dogecoin has an incredibly active and supportive community with participants known as ‘Shibes’ who have engaged in a number of social causes and fundraisers. Since it is an open-end source, Dogecoin reportedly has a circulating stock of 118 billion presently after an initial supply of 100 billion coins in 2015. Sheer numbers can be a tipping point sometime in the future for Dogecoin considering Bitcoin has capped its production at 21 million. Dogecoin is built from fine-tuning open-source code. Doge’s followers say investing in it when it is in good stead can be very fruitful. Dogecoin's large user base and stabilityDogecoin has a large user base. It is used as a currency and not as an asset. Stacking up Dogecoin is not as heavy as others in investment. This is why Dogecoin is in larger circulation than any other crypto. For the more serious and large volume holders, Dogecoin can surely be an investment for a definite return. The endorsements and testimonials from celebs such as Elon Musk, Mark Cuban and rapper Lil Yachty have pepped up the popularity of Dogecoin considerably. However following another statement of Musk that “popularity of Dogecoin was a hustle” there was a slight dip in its fame but it was short-lived. This shows that Dogecoin is here to stay. It was again Elon Musk who took it up when he announced his SpaceX plans. However, investors will be more confident when the Dogecoin reaches the value of $1. Chairman of the Wallstreet Bets tweeted in hope “Has Doge ever been to a Dollar?”. But none of the tweets from the masters of the market had any long-term effect on the popularity of Dogecoin. One can definitely say, it is the most stable coin in value and volume in circulation. It’s exciting to wait and watch where Dogecoin will go from here.

While dealing with Shaheen Bagh anti-CAA road blocking protests that went on for months, the SC had on October 7, 2020 ruled that “We have no hesitation in concluding that such kind of occupation of public ways, whether at the site in question or anywhere else for protests is not acceptable and the administration ought to take action to keep the areas clear of encroachments or obstructions.” On Thursday, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh reminded the government of its judgment and said, “The law has already been laid down. We cannot keep repeating it again and again. It is the duty of the executive to implement it. Road blockades cannot be continued till perpetuity.” Solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the court that the Haryana government had constituted a committee of senior bureaucrats to negotiate with the farmers protesting against the three farm laws for more than a year at the border point on national highways, but the farmers’ leaders did not come for the meeting. The UP government said it was making efforts to inform the agitating farmers about the illegality of blocking public roads. The SG said the protesting farmers’ leaders and organisations should be made parties to the PIL by Monicca Agarwaal, who has complained to the SC that blockade of roads by farmers is making the commuters sweat everyday for hours to reach Delhi and travel back to their homes in neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The bench asked the SG to make an application for impleadment of farmers organisations and leaders as parties to the PIL and posted the matter for further hearing on October 4. In a lighter vein, the bench asked the SG whether this would constitute encroachment of judiciary into the domain of the executive. The SG responded by saying, when the judiciary is invited to resolve grievances on both sides — farmers and commuters — arising from road blockade, then it would not be considered as an encroachment by judiciary into executive turf. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been on sit-in protests for more than a year on highways, jamming Delhi’s three border points — Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur — to drive home their demand for repeal of the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September last year. In the Shaheen Bagh sit-in protest case, the SC in Amit Sahni judgment had said, “While appreciating the existence of the right to peaceful protest against a legislation, we have to make it unequivocally clear that public ways and public spaces cannot be occupied in such a manner and that too indefinitely. Democracy and dissent go hand in hand, but then the demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone. The present case was not even one of protests taking place in an undesignated area, but was a blockage of a public way which caused grave inconvenience to commuters. We cannot accept the plea of the applicants that an indeterminable number of people can assemble whenever they choose to protest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/road-blockade-by-farmers-inconveniencing-commuters-sc/articleshow/86666833.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

However, it frowned on the trial court judge and public prosecutor for allowing the defence to put unnecessary questions to her involving graphic details during cross-examination. The trial court judge conducted and concluded the trial with sincere efforts, but failed in his duty to protect the dignity of the woman, held the HC. An accused has the right to cross-examination to prove his innocence, but the court under the evidence Act is duty-bound to forbid any question that appears intended to insult or is offensive. The court is also empowered to forbid questions it considers “indecent or scandalous’’, it pointed out. After being convicted in October 2011, the trio appealed to the HC the next year. Turning it down on Tuesday, the HC said the prime accused, Subhash Bhosale, who was the autorickshaw union chief of a rickshaw stand, had bragged about the rape to a friend, which helped nail him. On April 1, 2010, the well-educated woman, who was new to Pune, was running late for a seminar and waiting at a bus stand around 4.30pm. Bhosale, with another man in the car, drove up and offered a drop, saying they were going the same way. She thought it is one of the call centre cabbies trying to make a quick buck and got in. The driver stopped at a garage, got his cell phone charged at a shop, and drove for an hour but her destination was not in sight. She was initially calm as she had been told the seminar was about one and a half hour’s journey away. But she started feeling uncomfortable and called and texted a friend expressing suspicions about the driver. She later called another friend, who spoke to Bhosale and gave him directions. It was 6.30pm by then, and the woman asked the driver to drop him at the nearest bus stop. Bhosale agreed, but drove on to a highway, where a third man joined them. As she protested, she was slapped, gagged and threatened with a knife. The trio picked up food, beer and drove to a secluded place. In the secluded spot, the trio took turns to rape her, and then dropped her near her house around 12.45am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-frowns-on-trial-judge-over-quizzing-of-rape-survivor/articleshow/86666872.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||World||Congress passes bill to avert partial government shutdown||WASHINGTON: With only hours to spare, Congress passed legislation that would avoid a partial federal shutdown and keep the government funded through December 3, and sent the bill to President Joe Biden.  The back-to-back votes by the Senate and then the House will help avert one crisis, but just delay another as the political parties dig in on a dispute over how to raise the government's borrowing cap before the United States risks a potentially catastrophic default.  The House approved the short-term funding measure by a 254-175 vote not long after Senate passage in a 65-35 vote. A large majority of Republicans in both chambers voted against it. The legislation was needed to keep the government running once the current budget year ended at midnight Thursday. Passage will buy lawmakers more time to craft the spending measures that will fund federal agencies and the programs they administer.  The work to keep the government open and running served as the backdrop during a chaotic day for Democrats as they struggled to get Biden's top domestic priorities over the finish line, including a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill at risk of stalling in the House.  With their energy focused on Biden's agenda, Democrats backed down from a showdown over the debt limit in the government funding bill, deciding to uncouple the borrowing ceiling at the insistence of Republicans. If that cap is not raised by October 18, the US probably will face a financial crisis and economic recession, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said.  Republicans say Democrats have the votes to raise the debt limit on their own, and Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is insisting they do so.  The short-term spending legislation will also provide about $28.6 billion in disaster relief for those recovering from Hurricane Ida and other natural disasters, and help support Afghanistan evacuees from the 20-year war between the US and the Taliban.  "This is a good outcome, one I'm happy we are getting done," Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said. "With so many things to take care of in Washington, the last thing the American people need is for the government to grind to a halt".  Once the government is funded, albeit temporarily, Democrats will turn their full attention to the need to raise the limit on federal borrowing, which now stands at $28.4 trillion.  The US has never defaulted on its debts in the modern era and historically, both parties have voted to raise the limit. Democrats joined the Republican Senate majority in doing so three times during Donald Trump's presidency. This time Democrats wanted to take care of both priorities in one bill, but Senate Republicans blocked that effort Monday.  Raising or suspending the debt limit allows the federal government to pay obligations already incurred. It does not authorize new spending. McConnell has argued that Democrats should pass a debt limit extension with the same budgetary tools they are using to try to pass a $3.5 trillion effort to expand social safety net programs and tackle climate change. He reiterated that warning as the Senate opened on Thursday, even as Democrats have labeled that option a "nonstarter."  "We're able to fund the government today because the majority accepted reality. The same thing will need to happen on the debt limit next week," McConnell said.  House Democrats pushed through a stand-alone bill late Wednesday that would suspend the debt limit until December 2022. Schumer said he would bring the measure to the Senate floor, but the bill is almost certain to be blocked by a Republican filibuster.  The arguments made in both chambers about the debt ceiling have followed similar themes.  "You are more interested in punishing Democrats than preserving our credit and that is something I'm having a real tough time getting my head around," House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., told Republicans. "The idea of not paying bills just because we don't like (Biden's) policies is the wrong way to go."  Undaunted, Republicans argued that Democrats have chosen to ram through their political priorities on their own and thus are responsible for raising the debt limit on their own.  "So long as the Democratic majority continues to insist on spending money hand over fist, Republicans will refuse to help them lift the debt ceiling," said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla.  The Treasury has taken steps to preserve cash, but once it runs out, it will be forced to rely on incoming revenue to pay its obligations. That would likely mean delays in payments to Social Security recipients, veterans and government workers, including military personnel. The Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank, projects that the federal government would be unable to meet about 40% of payments due in the several weeks that follow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/congress-passes-bill-to-avert-partial-government-shutdown/articleshow/86666876.cms||---
---||India||Boost to agriculture: Monsoon set to withdraw from Oct 6||NEW DELHI: The four-month summer monsoon, which ended as a ‘normal’ rainy season on Thursday and is set to withdraw from October 6, leaves India’s agriculture on a good footing with the levels of soil moisture and water storage in key reservoirs sufficient to support the Rabi or winter crop at a time when the economy is still recovering from Covid. The withdrawal, the second most delayed after 1960, comes at a time when the India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s prediction of a ‘normal’ winter (northeast) monsoon is a hopeful signal for agriculture as it would help the 2021-22 crop year (July-June cycle) to remain on track for a record output of food-grains in the pandemic-hit year, giving much needed boost to the rural economy. Overall acreage of Kharif (summer sown) crops such as paddy, pulses, cotton and maize have already crossed the normal sown area figure. Water storage in reservoirs and adequate soil moisture due to good rains in 30 out of 36 meteorological subdivisions, covering 83% of total area, will help in sowing of Rabi (winter sown) crops such as wheat and mustard as well. The summer monsoon had seen the most delayed withdrawal in 2019 when the retreat started on October 9 as against its normal withdrawal date of September 17. Before 2019, the most delayed withdrawal was recorded in 1961. “The 2021 October to December rainfall averaged over the south Peninsular India is most likely to be normal (89-111 % of long period average),” said IMD director general, M Mohapatra, while noting that the southwest (summer) monsoon, that brought ‘above normal’ rainfall in ‘monsoon core zone’, could help farming operations in the region which depends on rain-fed farming. The probabilistic rainfall forecast for winter monsoon in south Peninsular India shows that all five meteorological subdivisions (Tamil Nadu, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, Kerala and South Interior Karnataka) of the region are most likely to get ‘normal’ rainfall. Its onset may happen towards the second half of October. Since the summer monsoon will see late withdrawal, the IMD predicted that the northwest India (Punjab, Haryana, western UP and Delhi-NCR) may get more than normal rainfall in October. Mohapatra, however, said the rainfall in northwest India in October should not be interpreted in the context of southwest monsoon as this region normally gets low rainfall in October whereas the northeast monsoon rainfalls (October-December) primarily occur in south Peninsular India. The spatial distribution of probabilistic forecast suggests normal to above normal rainfall over most parts of south peninsular India except few small pockets of the region. Though extreme rainfall events during the summer monsoon affected standing crops in certain areas of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and parts of Odisha in September, it was mainly due to excess and intense rains linked to cyclone ‘Gulab’ that had hit eastern coast on last Sunday and then crossed over the land mass before emerging in Arabian Sea along western coast in Gujarat on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-agri-boost-monsoon-set-to-withdraw-from-oct-6/articleshow/86666918.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Four of the six BSP-turned-Congress legislators from the desert state on Thursday reached New Delhi to seek "legal and political" support to save their places in the face of a Supreme Court petition challenging their assembly membership under the anti-defection law. BSP and BJP had filed petitions in the apex court and the Rajasthan high court soon after Sachin Pilot revolted against CM Ashok Gehlot’s leadership last year. On September 21, the SC directed the six MLAs to submit their response within four weeks. If all six turncoat MLAs lose their assembly membership, Congress would be reduced to 100 seats in the 200-member House, in which case the Pilot camp’s support would become even more crucial to the stability of the Gehlot government. There are 71 BJP MLAs and 13 independents, besides others, in the state assembly. Two seats are vacant, for which bypolls are scheduled for October 30. The group of six ex-BSP MLAs, whose merger with Congress was orchestrated by Gehlot in 2019, is said to be miffed with the Congress central and state leadership for not providing either "strong legal support" or accommodating them in the government. Sources said they were open to seeking political support outside Congress, if it comes to that. But Wajib Ali, one of the four MLAs camping in Delhi, contested talk of him or his colleagues deserting Congress. MLA Joginder Singh Awana, who along with MLA Deepchand Kharia, has stayed back in Rajasthan, told the media in Jaipur that he was unaware of his four colleagues planning to meet BSP supremo Mayawati or Union home minister Amit Shah. "We recently received a SC notice asking for a reply in four weeks; so maybe my colleagues were a bit disturbed. We joined Congress after following all legal procedures and will stay with it. Congress has a strong legal team to defend our case in the apex court," Awana said after meeting CM Gehlot. Awana is likely to join the four MLAs — Ali, Rajendra Singh Gudha, Lakhan Singh and Sandeep Yadav — in Delhi soon. The quartet met senior lawyer Devdutt Kamat in Delhi on Thursday. BSP state president Bhagwan Singh Baba, who moved the apex court against his former colleagues, told TOI, "We will not accept them back in the party at any cost. They have cheated us twice. All six will lose their memberships; we have faith in the court." Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariya dismissed reports that the six MLAs were seeking political support outside Congress as they were disappointed at being "ignored" for long. "All six are now an integral part of Congress and there is no threat to their assembly membership. We will not let any injustice happen to them," the minister said. Khachariyawas claimed there was no threat to the stability of the Congress government in Rajasthan."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/six-turncoat-mlas-put-congress-in-a-spot-in-rajasthan/articleshow/86667002.cms||Bhanupratap Singh

The twin events have created enough disturbance within Congress, that many believe is likely to dampen the leadership’s appetite for experiments. A cabinet reshuffle is pending in Rajasthan, which is also to be accompanied by appointments in state corporations and also the reconstitution of district party units. At the same time, Congress has lately indulged the demand of senior minister in Chhattisgarh, TS Singh Deo, that he be named in the top post in place of chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, claiming that the party had promised a split term between the two of them when it came to power in December 2018. While Rahul Gandhi recently held a meeting with Baghel, the latter has repeatedly claimed that he has not been conveyed any message about leadership change. Crucially, many G23 leaders are also privately voicing favour for Singhdeo. The Congress brass has been mum on the twin issues while the party managers have claimed that it is to take a final decision on Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Meanwhile, a meeting of Rajasthan leader Sachin Pilot with Rahul Gandhi last week triggered speculations that the leadership may be thinking of a “bold step” in some months. Just when the Gandhi siblings were finalising leadership issues across states, the sudden flareup within the party ranks coupled with growing desertions may force them to slow down initiatives that are likely to result in tremors in the state units. Even the loyalists are citing that Sidhu was appointed the Punjab Congress chief despite the warnings of party MPs and other leaders that he was too much of a solo player to lead the party in the crucial election months, with many underlining that he was handpicked by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul as part of their “bold decisions”. The continued desertions from state units, including of leaders seen close to the Gandhi family, aided by the “Cannibalising tendencies” of Congress allies like TMC, have alarmed the party ranks. The defections are one of the reasons reportedly cited by senior G23 leader Ghulam Nabi Azad in his letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi demanding the convening of the meeting of the Congress working committee (CWC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-cms-can-breathe-easy-as-punjab-g23-occupy-core-focus/articleshow/86667034.cms||---

Amrinder Singh, goalkeeper of the Indian national football team and ATK Mohun Bagan FC in the Indian Super League, is a celebrity in his own right, but his name with one syllable less than the former CM has fortuitously invited a whole lot of unwanted political attention. After being repeatedly tagged by the media and others in heated discussions and speculation about the Punjab turmoil, Amrinder has stood up to protect his “identity” like he would the Indian and ATK goal. The exasperated footballer on Thursday issued an appeal on Twitter that may not have reached many among his intended audience — news anchors, editors, reporters and political enthusiasts — but it did elicit commiseration from Capt Amarinder. “Dear News Media, Journalists, I am Amrinder Singh, Goalkeeper of Indian Football Team and not the Former Chief Minister of the State Punjab. Please stop tagging me,” wrote the footballer, who had a modest 6,371 followers on the microblogging site till Thursday afternoon, as opposed to Capt Amarinder’s 1.1 million. While a large section of the Twitterati still did not bother to untag Amrinder from their posts despite his request, the former CM was quick to respond to him. “I empathize with you, my young friend. Good luck for your games ahead,” the former CM tweeted. Historian of science S Irfan Habib, who is often confused with the historian of medieval India Irfan Habib and tagged incorrectly on Twitter, wrote to Capt Amarinder in jest, “You too, I face this all the time.” While Twitter remained abuzz with speculation about Capt Amarinder’s meeting with national security adviser Ajit Doval earlier on Thursday, so did the football player’s timeline.

While in a spate of tweets from the letter writers did not mention who was behind the protests that they called orchestrated, the allegation appeared to be pointing at the AICC managers. The protests broke out Wednesday night after Sibal addressed a press conference in which he demanded organisational elections while saying that the party was headless and facing a crisis. While Sibal refused to react, Ghulam Nabi Azad tweeted, “I strongly condemn the orchestrated hooliganism @KapilSibal’s residence last night. He is a loyal Congressman fighting for the party both inside and outside the Parliament. Any suggestion from any quarter should be welcomed instead of suppressing; hooliganism is unacceptable.” I strongly condemn the orchestrated hooliganism @KapilSibal’s residence last night. He is a loyal congressman fight… https://t.co/FEFHpde84s— Ghulam Nabi Azad (@ghulamnazad) 1632994370000Crucially, P Chidambaram who is not part of G23 also slammed the incident. “I feel helpless when we cannot start meaningful conversations within party forums. I also feel hurt and helpless when I see pictures of Congress workers raising slogans outside the residence of a colleague and MP. The safe harbour to which one can withdraw seems to be silence.” Deputy leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, asked Congress president Sonia Gandhi to take action. “Shocked and disgusted to hear the news of attack and hooliganism at Kapil Sibal's house. This deplorable action brings disrepute to the party and needs to be strongly condemned. Congress has a history of upholding freedom of expression. differences of opinion and perception are integral to a democracy. Intolerance and violence is alien to Congress values and culture. Those responsible must be identified and disciplined,” he said. Lok Sabha MP Manish Tewari said, “Those who are trying to defend the ‘command performance’ last night, This is what happened @KapilSibal ‘s house - They damaged the car. Stood on top so it caved in, Threw tomatoes both outside and inside the house. If this is not hooliganism, then what else is it?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pc-lends-voice-to-g-23-protest-on-orchestrated-hooliganism/articleshow/86667268.cms||---

Revenue minister R Ashoka on Thursday said work orders have been issued to two firms to fill the potholes. The deadline comes in the backdrop of rising public anger against the condition of roads and increasing accidents due to potholes. Craters on 246km of city roads fixedThe minister said potholes on major roads will be filled in the first 10 days from now, sub-arterial roads in the next 10 days and bylanes and roads by October 30. Ashoka said the bigger issue for BBMP was bitumen procurement and cyclone-induced rain in the city. The BBMP has procured 585 loads of uninterrupted tar supply for the streets of Bengaluru. Of the 13,074km of roads in the city, the BBMP has so far fixed potholes on 246km. Ashoka said Rs 1,000 crore has been released to the BBMP for taking up road restoration projects on the outskirts of the city which has seen 2,500km of roads damaged due to pipeline-laying work for drinking water and underground drainage for the 110 villages brought under BBMP in 2006. He said each of the 198 wards has been allocated Rs 20 lakh for the pothole-filling exercise. Ashoka and officials went on a city tour to take stock of the condition of roads. The minister admitted the poor condition of roads has given rise to accidents and resulted in back-breaking journeys for motorists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ashoka-will-fill-all-potholes-in-bluru-by-oct-30/articleshow/86667473.cms||---

TheKHB has allotted the site without following the allotment regulations, a division bench observed, while directing the KHB to take back the land in 30 days. Imposing Rs 1 lakh cost upon the KHB, the bench directed the principal secretary to the housing department to hold an inquiry and recover the cost amount from the erring officials, while pointing out there is collusion as the sale deed was executed 16 years after the allotment to overcome the conditions in the original allotment. The KHB had executed the sale deed on July 28, 2020 in relation to a 278 sqm of the site at 5th phase, Yelahanka New Town. The original allotment was made on August 23, 2004 to Murthy Charitable Trust, headed by Gayathri, wife of Umesh Jadhav, MP. The trust had paid Rs 3,87,000 at that time towards 232 sqm of CA site. The allotment was for educational and public purposes and the construction has to be made in two years. However, no construction was done and no steps were taken for the cancellation of allotment either under KHB Act or KHB allotment rules. Adinarayana Shetty from Koramangala challenged the sale deed, stating Rs 10 crore worth land has been parted with for just Rs 21,87,000. Counsel for the petitioner argued the trust has been favoured only because the president happens to be the MP’s wife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/revoke-land-allotted-to-mp-wifes-trust-hc/articleshow/86667491.cms||---

I thank him for the trust he has reposed in me. We follow different political ideologies. Yet he spoke about it open-heartedly because he trusts me. This friendship, and the trust and faith, are the biggest strength of a democracy,” said Modi. He laid the foundation stones in Dausa, Hanumangarh, Banswara and Sirohi and inaugurated the Central Institute of Petrochemicals Engineering and Technology in Jaipur. Earlier, Gehlot said, “We have three backward areas — Pratapgarh, Rajsamand and Jalore — which still do not have a medical college. You could consider new colleges for these districts. If we have medical colleges in all the districts of the state, it will create history.” Gehlot sought help from the Centre to tackle problems of availability of water and financial help for infrastructure like electric transmission, roads and for education. Gehlot also asked for the Centre’s support in developing a petrochemical investment region, medical device park in Jodhpur, bulk pharma intake park in Kota and demanded help in revival of a government-run pharma company in Jaipur. “It is a joint-venture company which manufactured medicines. But it remains locked. I request the Centre to waive off its liabilities,” said Gehlot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gehlot-trusts-me-says-pm-calls-cong-cm-good-friend/articleshow/86667468.cms||---

He also questioned different statements issued by planning and development minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav and the CM regarding demand for special status to Bihar. Tiwari said Yadav was one of the most trusted ministers in the Nitish cabinet and he even gives replies in the assembly on behalf of the CM. “He just can’t issue such a statement on his own,” Tiwari said. A couple of days back, Yadav had said the state government was “tired” of demanding special status and would now root for special package from the Centre. Meanwhile, Tiwari stressed on the need for a summit to discuss the loopholes in the developmental policies and said special status would not solve the problems of Bihar. “Present policies need to be challenged to get rid of regional and economic disparities,” he said. “Bihar has been a backward state for long. It supplies workers to other parts of the country. This was exposed during the first Covid-induced lockdown when migrant workers from state walked miles to reach home. Most these workers were from dalits and extremely backward class communities,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hold-meet-of-leaders-of-backward-states-shivanand-tells-cm/articleshow/86658798.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The social media giant has also recorded over 160% YoY growth in in-stream ad revenue earned by monetizing creators and video publishers in the country. In-stream ads help eligible video creators earn money by including short video or image ads in qualifying videos. “India is one of our fastest growing countries and it is becoming one of the most important places for us to focus on at Instagram,” Adam Mosseri, head of Facebook-owned Instagram, said, during the launch of an Instagram creator education programme in India called ‘Born to Instagram’. There is a shift of power from institutions to individuals in all sorts of verticals, and creators are at the forefront of that, he added. Facebook announced on Thursday one of its largest creator education and learning programme that is freely available to all. This is the next phase of the company’s ‘Born on Instagram’ program, which was launched in 2019, but will now be at scale as creators get to learn through a self-paced e-learning course. It will provide creators an opportunity to learn the nuances of content creation, grow their network and also earn from it. At the end of the course, they will receive a course completion letter as well. Ajit Mohan, VP and MD, Facebook India, said Instagram’s short video feature Reels is a big example of democratisation of creativity as people from the smallest towns of India are active on it. “An average of six million Reels are produced in India every day and it's also the most reshared product in India on Instagram,” he added. Some of the top categories of content on Instagram in India are dance, entertainment comedy and humor, music and lipsync, and fashion among others. Ankit Agarwal, founder of Do Your Thing, a creator skilling platform, estimates that Instagram has over 180 million users in India holding the lion’s share among various global markets. “Some of the ways Instagram is helping the community grow is by broadening direct payments with Badges, allowing direct merchandise selling, and introducing a native affiliate tool soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/desis-make-6-million-insta-reels-per-day-fb/articleshow/86662101.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Plastic use continues in Kolkata markets despite ban||KOLKATA: Use of banned polybags continued unabated in markets across the city on the day a ban on plastic bags thinner than 75 microns kicked in. State officials, though, said they were seriously considering imposing a fine of Rs 2,000 for those flouting the norm. Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has started informing market committees about the ban. “We are telling the committee to ask traders to strictly avoid plastic bags thinner than 75 microns. It will take a few days to implement it,” said a senior market department officer. Once implemented, the solid waste management department will conduct raids against violations. While Bangur had banned plastic bags years ago, the only market that appears to have implemented the ban on Thursday was CB Block market in New Town’s Action Area I. “Since the notification has been issued, we are striving to make our market plasticfree. The market used to generate 154kg of thin plastic bags. From Thursday, there will be none,” said Sourav Mukherjee of Kolkata Society for Cultural Heritage, which works with New Kolkata Development Authority. TimesViewUsing the right plastic is the next best option if we cannot do without plastic bags altogether. The law should be implemented fairly and citizens should cooperate; this is for our common good.Paper bags have been introduced for smaller quantities of materials, cloth bags for heavier things and starch bags for wet items, like fish and meat. Each starch bag costs Rs 2. NKDA, which initiated the pilot study, subsidized it to make it available to traders at 16p, the same as that of a 12×16 inch thin plastic bag. Kolkata and the neighbouring localities, including Salt Lake and New Town, have been the worst sufferers with the thin plastic poly bags choking drains, blocking canals and causing severe inundation. Various studies indicate that the volume of plastic being discarded daily in Kolkata may be anything between 500 tonnes and 1,200 tonnes. The studies also point out that the volume is growing rapidly. The government is also concerned about the ill effects of the use of plastic products. The ministry notification on the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, has banned single-use plastic, including polystyrene and expanded polystyrene commodities, with effect from July 1, 2022. “If we are asked to not use plastic bags, we will carry our own bags. But traders keep giving us plastic bags even if we don’t ask for it,” said Ambika Gupta, a retired government officer at Parnasree. “The biggest problem is carrying fish. We cannot carry it in a cloth bag, nor in porous nylon bags,” said Tuhina Sarkar, a homemaker from Bhowanipore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/plastic-use-continues-at-mkts-despite-ban/articleshow/86662327.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

These details came to the fore on Thursday when police produced Bhatt before a court of judicial magistrate seeking his custody for two weeks. Bhatt was, however, remanded till 1 pm on October 3. Police sources said that during interrogation Bhatt kept repeating that he did not do anything wrong and the relations he had with the woman were consensual. It has also come to light that Bhatt had met her not just at her rented apartment in Diwalipura but at other places too. Police also said that Bhatt admitted that he knew the girl for several months. The court was also informed that Bhatt had sent photos captured through the spy camera installed at the woman’s room to her. He will be interrogated about how he managed to get the photos and who else was involved in making the photos viral. The woman had alleged that a spy camera was installed in her room at the rented apartment. Police are yet to find out who had installed the spy camera or who has its memory card that contains all the photos and videos of the woman. Cops will also be interrogating Bhatt about the so-called deal of a land which belonged to Sahara Group and which was later taken over by the government. The girl was promised a share in the profit once the deal was finalized. “It was argued in the court that before the case was registered there were attempts to reach a compromise with the complainant. Also, the investigators have to reconstruct the crime,” said additional public prosecutor Sagar Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bhatt-in-police-custody-till-oct-3/articleshow/86659589.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Cabinet leaves two colleges in Goa headless||PANAJI: Two professional colleges in the state, the Goa College of Art and the Goa College of Architecture, will continue to function without a full-time head as the state cabinet on Thursday rejected the recommendations of the Goa Public Service Commission (GPSC) for appointment of a principal by relaxing the Konkani criterion. The architecture college principal’s post has been vacant since demise of its principal in 1997. A senior faculty from IIT-Mumbai was deputed to the institute as principal in-charge till he was relieved. Since then, different officers have been appointed to the post. Presently, one of the professors of the college has been holding charge as principal on an officiating basis since August 2010. The post of principal of Goa College of Art has fallen vacant following superannuation of its principal in November 2019. The recommendation of the GPSC was put up to the government, but was rejected on grounds that the requirement of knowledge of Konkani could not be relaxed. Earlier this month, TOI had reported that four major professional colleges in the state were functioning without a regular principal or head of institution even as highly-qualified and experienced candidates have been recommended for these posts by the GPSC. The Goa College of Engineering, Goa College of Architecture, Goa College of Art, and Goa Medical College are all currently headless. Most of these institutes are under the control of the director of technical education, and questions are now being asked in academic circles as to why the government is delaying the appointments of these institutional heads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabinet-leaves-two-colleges-in-state-headless/articleshow/86665428.cms||---

The promoters will now engage with strategic players and financial investors to sell the solar power plant construction company, which has a market cap of over Rs 6,500 crore. In a regulatory filing, Sterling said that its promoters have facilitated the repayment of their balance loan of Rs 741 crore along with interest before the due date. “With this, their entire loan of Rs 2,563 crore as on the date of listing of company’s shares on the stock exchanges along with all further interest accrued till date stands repaid in full”. Sterling’s shares were listed on August 20, 2019 and they are currently trending at Rs 399 apiece on the BSE, up from their all-time low of Rs 70 at the end of fiscal 2020. The promoters’ dues to Sterling were looming over the proposed sale of the unit. With the debt issue resolved, they will move forward with the sale of the asset. Further, the improved mcap of the company and investors’ interest in clean energy, including in related activities like solar power plant construction, will boost the valuation of the asset. The promoters are planning to exit Sterling to pare their debt. Larger promoter SP has a debt of Rs 25,000-30,000 crore. Of this, about Rs 12,000 crore is under the RBI’s Covid relief scheme. This scheme gives SP time till 2023 to settle the amount, by when it could find a buyer for Sterling. Nearly a fortnight ago, SP inked a deal to sell consumer durable outfit Eureka Forbes to private equity fund Advent International for Rs 4,400 crore, including debt. SP owns 51% in Sterling but nearly 74% of its holding — or about 37.4% of the company — is pledged. The promoters established Sterling Solar in 2011, which now has a play in 24 countries and has revenue of over Rs 5,080 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sterling-promoters-repay-debt-to-co/articleshow/86663377.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Sources said the mining in the remaining eight districts would be resumed after getting clearance from the state cabinet. The auction of authorised mining ghats will be done after the cabinet’s nod. The sources said old contractors have been allowed to restart mining of sand in eight districts — Nawada, Arwal, Banka, Madhepura, West Champaran, Vaishali, Kishanganj and Buxar. Though the contract of the old licence holders had ended on September 30, the department decided to extend their tenure of lease for the next three months. Hence the old licence holders will start mining on their respective ghats from Friday. Sand mining in the state remained banned for three months — from July 1 to September 30 — on the directive of the National Green Tribunal. The deadline came to an end on Thursday. State mining minister Janak Ram said with the mining of sand resuming from Friday in some districts, the construction work is likely to gain momentum. “The sand will be sold at the rates fixed by the government,” he added. The minister, however, said senior officials of the department have been asked to monitor the mining of sand where old licence holders have been allowed to resume work from Friday. The prices of sand soared manifold ever since the mining work was suspended in the wake of guidelines issued by the NGT. “We hope the prices will fall after resumption of sand mining,” an authorised dealer of sand said. The government has initiated stern action against 41 administrative and police officers for their alleged links with illegal sand mining mafias. Apart from suspension, cases of disproportionate assets were lodged against six officers. “We will not compromise on the issue of illegal sand mining in the state,” the minister told this newspaper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sand-mining-to-resume-in-eight-districts-from-today/articleshow/86658605.cms||Ramashankar

According to the district transport office (DTO), the percentage of failure in driving tests was only 5-10% earlier. The new facility is equipped with scientifically-designed test tracks with multiple high-definition cameras to assess 20 essential driving skills of the applicants on serpentine tracks, loops, and S-shaped bends. The tracks are lined with sensors which when hit result in loss of marks. “Of the 596 people taking the test for permanent driving licence since September 1, only 320 succeeded whereas 276 of them failed. Around 21% of the applicants failed in recognising the traffic symbols,” the officials of the Patna DTO claimed and added, “As many as 96 of the 2,923 applicants seeking learning licence failed in their first attempt and 22 in the second attempt.” The district transport officer of Patna, Shri Prakash, told this newspaper that the applicants, who did not pass the test, could go for a retest after a week. “Those who are caught violating the Motor Vehicles Act are sent to Sultan Palace for attending corrective classes conducted by experts,” he added. Talking about the benefits of driving tests on automated tracks, transport secretary, Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, pointed out, “It has been observed that chances of road accidents increase when everything is manual because people take the driving test in a casual manner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/over-47-of-applicants-fail-in-driving-test/articleshow/86658630.cms||Faryal Rumi

Officials said water was being released only when rainfall increased in the catchment areas. “We are near the end of the monsoon period, so stocks are being maintained at full capacities. We have instructed the authorities to release water only when necessary,” a senior official of the state irrigation department said. The department expects rainfall to continue in the catchment areas of the dams in the coming days as monsoon withdrawal was yet to be announced. “Most dams in Bhima basin received good rainfall during July and August, after which the intensity of showers dropped. Last year, the monsoon had continued till last week of October. We are hoping that the dams will receive rainfall for the next few days as the monsoon is yet to begin its withdrawal. Delay in withdrawal of monsoon helps us to maintains better water levels in dams,” he said. Data with the department showed that collective stock of water in the four dams in the Khadakwasla circle, which supply water to Pune, was at 98.7%, while storage in Bhama Askhed dam was at 100%. The stock in Pavana dam was also at its full capacity. Popatrao Shelar, deputy engineer at the irrigation department, said, “We are monitoring water levels in the dams. Release from Panshet and Varasgaon has been stopped, while Khadakwasla is releasing water into the Mutha canal. The stock in dam has been reduced to 80% to accommodate water released from Panshet and Varasgaon. Pavana dam was releasing water for power generation at 1,300 cusecs.” Meanwhile, the collective stock in 35 major dams in Pune division was at 96% on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/18-dams-in-bhima-basin-full-khadakwasla-discharge-on/articleshow/86662309.cms||Sarang Dastane

The Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited (BSPHCL) recently have no-objection certificate (NOC) to Patna Metro Rail Corporation Limited (PMRCL) for laying of underground wires and cables and relocation of transformers on three stretches. Once free of overhead power cables, the city’s skylines along with metro network will change the way the state capital looks at least along the stretch where it would run in the first phase. The metro trains will run overhead on the initial 6.63km stretch, which include five elevated stations — New Patliputra ISBT, Zero Mile, Bhootnath, Khemnichak (interchangeable station) and Malahi Pakri. The first phase, which is also called a priority corridor, is part of Corridor II and it is likely to be ready by 2023. A PMRCL official said the work on removing the dangling wires has started from Malahi Pakri and Khemnichak with the help of BSPHCL engineers. “We have got the approval for laying of wires underground to make way for the elevated routes of both the corridors. The three stretches will be free of overhead cable wires by October-end. The piling work and construction of pillars to make base for the elevated tracks have been going on between Malahi Pakri to Patliputra ISBT. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has also given its NOC for the construction of elevated network over NH- 20,” the official said added. According to an official in the urban development and housing department, 5% work on Patna metro project has been completed so far. “The PMRCL will expedite the project after getting funds from the Japan International Cooperation Agency,” he added. “For the funds, we need land and the process for land acquisition has started. The land will likely to be acquired by December after which the work will gather pace. For the underground network, tunnels and stations, we need more funds. Presently, we are working on priority corridor as there is a funds crunch,” the official said. The soil testing and topographical survey have started on the elevated stretch between Danapur and Patliputra in the Corridor I. The construction work is likely to begin after the survey.  The Corridor I will be 17.9-km-long from Danapur to Khemnichack via Mithapur, of which 7.3km will be elevated and 10.5km underground. Corridor II, which is 14.5-km-long from Patna Junction to new ISBT, will have 7.9-km-long underground stretch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/overhead-power-cables-set-to-go-underground-for-metro-rail/articleshow/86659149.cms||Faryal Rumi

There has been an onslaught of viral videos by citizens on social media highlighting the ‘pathetic’ conditions of city roads that have resulted in several mishaps. One such viral video doing rounds since Wednesday was that of a three-wheeler loading rickshaw that had turned turtle on heavily damaged road. In the video, a loading rickshaw moving on a pothole-ridden road in Sachin GIDC overturns in the middle of the road leading to a traffic jam. The rickshaw driver lost control as it bounced on the huge potholes. A traffic cop and other commuters helped in lifting the vehicle and moving it aside. In another video, a moped is seen stuck in a water-filled pothole. The rider manages to take out the moped’s front wheel even as its rear wheel gets stuck in the pothole. Another incident was reported from Dindoli, where the rear wheel of a bus got stuck in a pothole while taking a turn on the road. A crane called in to pull the bus out of the crater. SMC has started repair work at multiple locations in the last couple of days. Not only the city roads, but the surface of several flyovers bridges have also been damaged due to rain. “The situation has gone from bad to worse. Due to constant rain repairs did not last long. I am demanding that cement mixed material should be used for carpeting which protects the road for at least five years unlike current tar roads,” said Dharmesh Bhanderi, leader of opposition in SMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/videos-of-damaged-surat-roads-goes-viral/articleshow/86659995.cms||---

Paras clarified that no other faction could use the LJP’s election symbol in any election except his. “I have been recognized by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha Om Birla as LJP parliamentary party leader,” he said. The Hajipur MP said he had been nominated as a minister in the Narendra Modi cabinet on the LJP quota. “We are the real LJP as we have the majority. I was also nominated as the national president of the LJP by the national executive committee,” he added. Paras said there was no confusion about his faction being recognised as the real LJP founded by former Union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan. “I am the real political heir of senior Paswan after his demise,” Paras told this reporter over the phone. Paras’ reaction came after Chirag announced that he would field candidates for both Tarapur and Kusheshwar Sthan assembly seats where bypolls will be held on October 30. The seats fell vacant following the death of the serving MLAs. Chirag faction’s national spokesperson A K Bajpai said, “We have written to the election commissioner and urged him to dismiss the claim of Paras group.

He hoped Bihar would emerge as one of the major ethanol production centres in the country. “So far, the bids of as many as 29 companies to establish units for the production of ethanol in the state have been cleared. Their combined proposal is to produce 168 crore litres of ethanol,” he said. The State Investment Promotion Board headed by development commissioner has received project proposals worth Rs 35,000 crore, the minister said, adding after the framing of the ethanol policy, the work has started on the preparation of textile and leather policies of the state government. He said that not a single company had told him orally or in writing that the rate of electricity in the state was higher than in other states. “I have not heard anyone even talking about it,” Hussain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-will-make-bihar-countrys-ethanol-hub/articleshow/86659359.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Kolkata||Profs attend ‘classes’ for ease of e-teaching||Kolkata: As higher education institutions geared up to begin online undergraduate classes from Friday, a large section of teachers and students is still grappling with e-teaching methods, leading to fear of gaps in the newly adopted digital teaching-learning process. A few outside Kolkata have decided to stay off the digital platform and circulate study material among students, most of whom either have no access to digital devices or are not comfortable using them. While the state is getting ready to start physical classes after the Puja vacation, higher education institutions are flagging off online classes according to the previous notice issued by the higher education department. Several, like Scottish Church College, have organized a series of faculty development and learning management programmes before commencing online classes. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had announced that, depending on the Covid graph, a date for commencement of physical classes will be declared. Supratim Sarkar, vice-principal and professor of history, Scottish Church College, said, “We have prepared a special app-based teaching-learning process which students can use to enhance their learning ability. We have a programme of mentor-mentee sessions, which we have made more comprehensive for study-based counselling, where students will get guidance from teachers.” New Alipore College has launched ‘E-Adhyayan’, a training process organized in collaboration with other colleges, including senior teachers from other colleges. “They have all learnt a lot about e-learning, and, I must say, they are doing very well,” said principal Jaydeep Sarangi. The e-learning process requires very good knowledge of digital devices and technological understanding, which many teachers have been finding difficult to grasp. Most colleges have organized skill development programmes to assist them. The principal of a city college said, “We have organized several programmes to enhance their skills. Many have picked them up, but the rest haven’t. If you are not willing to learn, nobody can teach you. But right now, none of us have any choice but to adapt to the system.” Kolkata colleges have made it mandatory, but colleges in districts have not been holding online classes regularly. A professor of a South 24 Parganas college pointed out that since some students come from underprivileged backgrounds, it could be difficult for them if they are forced to attend online classes. “We circulate study material via an app and students help each other by distributing it,” he said. Pradipta Mukherjee, assistant professor of Hiralal Mazumdar Memorial College for Women, said, “It’s tough to reach all students through online classes. I feel physical classes are the only option. We have a visually challenged professor who can’t conduct online classes. We are managing his classes by dividing them among others. So, we have planned to circulate study material among students till physical classes start.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/profs-attend-classes-for-ease-of-e-teaching/articleshow/86662355.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Cabinet nod for new start-up policy, eyes 6,000 jobs for locals||PANAJI: The revamped Goa start-up policy 2021 which was approved by the state cabinet on Thursday has set a target to generate employment for at least 6,000 Goans. The vision of the policy is to make Goa one of the most preferred start-up destinations in India, and make it feature in the top 25 start-up destinations in Asia by 2025. To encourage women to launch their own start-ups, the new policy provides special incentives to women entrepreneurs. Tech bodies have been pushing the government to roll out the new policy ever since the existing policy lapsed in 2020. The Goa Startup Policy 2017 lapsed in September 2020 and was given two six-month extensions as the government dragged its feet in rolling out the revamped policy. The Goa Startup Promotion Cell (SPC) began work on the new policy in the first half of 2020 by taking the learnings from the then prevailing startup policy and inputs from startups. For the new startup policy a single round of discussions with local startups and startup ecosystem stakeholders was held, while inputs were also sought from the Centre’s department for promotion of industry and of industry and internal trade (DPIIT). Discussions between local stakeholders and the IT minister Jennifer Monserrate and chief minister Pramod Sawant, though scheduled often, were cancelled repeatedly. The new policy aims at evangelising creation of at least 500 innovative, technology enabled products and building sustainable services and solutions start-ups in Goa by providing requisite assistance and support in the next three years, targeting generation of employment for at least 6,000 Goans. The start-up policy also aims at developing technology and innovation hubs, centres of excellence, research and development labs and incubation centres in the next three years. The revised policy also states that for start-ups hiring local talent, 50% salary of the freshers will be reimbursed subject to a cap of Rs 15,000 per month per recruit. Earlier, the limit was Rs 10,000. As per the R&D reimbursement scheme, 50% of R&D expenses, including salaries of Ph D holders by start-ups will be reimbursed for a period of two years subject to a cap of Rs 5 lakh per annum. As per the new policy, it will also include salaries of employees with master's degrees. The new policy has said that women entrepreneurs at idea stage will be given a monthly allowance of Rs 22,000 for a period of one year, in addition to marketing or technology support assistance up to Rs 10 lakh. Venture capital funds will be in the nature of fund of funds. This fund can invest up to Rs 1 crore in lieu of equity in promising start-ups. The charter of the fund of funds will determine the modus operandi and process of the fund. The start-up promotion cell will extend support from fund of funds to start-ups from outside Goa who set up their major operations in Goa and employ more than 50% locals. Start-up promotion cell will explore the possibility of development and operation of a vertical incubation platform for start-ups. The virtual platform can be without charges for registered start-up. The cell will explore the possibility of development of this virtual platform which can be a self-sustaining model in a few years. Presently, there are 111 start-ups certified by the start-up promotion cell, while there are more then 140 start-ups certified by start-up India, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) government of India and there are more than 15 coworking and incubator spaces in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabinet-nod-for-new-start-up-policy-eyes-6k-jobs-for-locals/articleshow/86665149.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Goa||Rights’ panel notice to Goa Medical College, govt over Covid workers’ dues||PANAJI: The Goa human rights commission on Thursday issued notice to the director of administration Goa Medical College and director of accounts over non-payment of salaries to Covid workers at GMC for the past five months. The commission took suo motu cognisance of a TOI report, “Hired during Second wave Peak, Covid workers yet to be paid”. “We are of the view that prima facie there is violation of human rights and hence, we take suo motu cognisance of the news item,” the commission stated in the notice issued on Thursday. The commission has asked the director of administration and director of accounts to inquire into the matter and submit a report by October 18 and be present before the hearing. TOI had reported that majority of the 430 multi-tasking staff (MTS) hired at the height of the second wave of the pandemic and given the arduous task of serving in Covid-19 wards haven't received their first salary five months later. Following the TOI report, director of accounts Dilip Humraskar tried to pass the buck and said that they had queries about certain bills and had raised the same with the GMC. “As soon as GMC’s response to our queries is received, we will clear the bills," Humraskar had told TOI on Sept 23. “When salary bills of hundred or more staff are submitted together, and there are queries about even three to four bills, they cannot be split,” he had said. The multi-tasking staff were hoping to get paid at least before Ganesh Chaturthi, but barring 40 the rest are yet to receive their salaries. They were at GMC's super specialty block where Covid-19 patients are treated. They were hired for a monthly salary of Rs 17,000. One of them who had completed a course in electronics at ITI told TOI that he decided to take up the job and work in Covid wards after he failed to find regular employment and in the hope of getting a steady job. Despite lifting bodies, placing them in body bags, shifting patients to different wards and segregating waste, he has difficulties making ends meet as he awaits his salary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rights-panel-notice-to-gmc-govt-over-covid-workers-dues/articleshow/86665347.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Varanasi||Immolation by rape victim: Suspended DSP held in Barabanki, sent to jail||VARANASI: Former circle officer of Bhelupur and suspended DSP Amaresh Baghel was on Thursday sent to jail in 14-day judicial custody after his arrest from Barabanki. He has been booked under various sections of IPC, including 306 (abetment of suicide) in connection with the suicides of the complainant and the prime witness in a rape case against jailed BSP MP Atul Rai. Commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh said, “Following his arrest, Baghel was booked under sections 193 (intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a judicial proceeding), 218 (public servant framing incorrect record or writing with intent), 219 (public servant, corruptly or maliciously makes or pronounces in any stage of a judicial proceeding, any report, order, verdict, or decision which he knows to be contrary to law) and 306 (abetment of suicide) of IPC in a case registered by inspector Lanka Mahesh Pandey.” “After his medical examination, he was produced before the court and later sent to jail in 14-day judicial custody. Baghel has been charged for extending help to rape accused Aul Rai,” he added. The FIR lodged at Lanka police station has alleged that “with an intention to protect Atul Rai, who was booked in under section 420, 376, 504 and 506 in 2019, Baghel fabricated incomplete and baseless documents while performing his duty. During investigation, a report was prepared with legal and factual errors to give advantage to Rai. Upset by the acts of Baghel, the complainant in the rape case along with the prime witness committed self-immolation after holding Baghel responsible through social media. Baghel is responsible for abetment of suicide”. The case against Baghel was lodged on the complaint of inspector Lanka after Wednesday midnight following his arrest in Barabanki. He was brought here in police custody. Baghel was suspended by the state government on December 30, 2020 for performing laxity in the investigation of the rape case after parts of his investigation report had leaked, showing BSP MP as a victim of conspiracy hatched by a jailed gangster. The complainant and prime witness in the rape case had set them on fire outside the Supreme Court in New Delhi on August 17 after levelling serious allegations on the police and other authorities, including DIG Amit Pathak, retired IG Amitabh Thakur and a judge of conspiring against her through live streaming on Facebook page. The witness succumbed to injuries at RML hospital on August 21 while the complainant died on August 24. This incident had led to largescale action as former Varanasi SSP Amit Pathak was attached to DGP headquarters by the state home department. Hetoo was accused of harassing them during his stint as Kashi district police chief. The in-charge of the Cantonment police station in Varanasi, Inspector Rakesh Singh and sub-inspector Girijashanker Yadav, were suspended in the same connection. State government had formed a SIT to probe into self-immolation case by the duo and on the basis of the report submitted by the two-member panel further action like arrest of Thakur in Lucknow and now of Baghel took place. This episode had started in May 2019 when the woman had filed a case against Atul Rai with Lanka police station, alleging that he had raped her at his apartment on March 7, 2019 and also recorded a video. Rai, who had filed nomination as BSP candidate from Ghosi parliamentary seat, won the elections as an absconder and later surrendered before court on June 22, 2019. Since then Rai is lodged in Naini Jail of Prayagraj.

The funding will accelerate Ola’s development and entry into other vehicle platforms including electric cars. Ola chairman and group CEO Bhavish Aggarwal said, “India is building technologies of the future and becoming a global EV hub. With this raise we will accelerate our vehicle development across two-wheeler scooters, motorbikes and four-wheelers.” Ola Electric’s S1 and S1 Pro electric scooters were launched in August. The company has claimed that it has already sold over $150-million worth of scooters in its first purchase window. Ola Electric was founded in 2017. Its series-A funding round of $58 million two years ago is one of the highest series-A rounds in India. In July 2019, Ola Electric became a unicorn with a $250-million series-B funding from SoftBank. It later also raised funding from investors like Tiger Global and Matrix India. In July this year, Ola Electric signed up a $100-million, 10 year-term debt financing agreement with Bank of Baroda. Ola Electric’s factory in Tamil Nadu’s Krishnagiri district is the largest in the world. It has completed phase-1 construction and is currently undergoing production trials.

However, it has retained NatSteel’s wires unit in Thailand. Singaporean alloy trader TopTip Holding, which has a turnover of over $1 billion, has acquired NatSteel’s two Singapore facilities and one Malaysia unit. The divested business, which had posted a revenue of Rs 2,852 crore in FY21, had a negative net worth as on March 31, 2021. Negative net worth means an excess of liabilities over assets. Tata Steel said the wires business in Thailand (Siam Industrial Wires) was separated from NatSteel Singapore and was consolidated with T S Global Holdings, an indirect 100% arm of the Indian company. In the past, Tata Steel had attempted to sell NatSteel Singapore but the move had failed. In 2019, the Indian company had inked an agreement with China’s Hebei Iron and Steel Group to sell NatSteel Singapore along with its other operations in Vietnam and Thailand (Millennium Steel). But the deal had collapsed as it failed to pass muster with the Hebei government. Tata Steel subsequently sold NatSteel Vietnam to Thai Hing Trading, a local player in that country. Following the latest development, Tata Steel is left with the larger Millennium Steel operations in Southeast Asia. NatSteel Singapore was Tata Steel’s first major overseas acquisition in 2004 that put the Indian company in a beachhead position in the global alloy market. Subsequently it bought Millennium Steel and the UK-based Corus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-steel-sells-spore-unit-natsteel/articleshow/86663421.cms||Reeba Zachariah

---||Kolkata||Virtual reality: Students in Kolkata clear phone memory, get high-speed internet to step into college life||KOLKATA: For Dolon Rakshit, the excitement to start her college life, a phase she has waited for many years, is muted since she will be attending classes from her home and not the campus. The usual flurry of activities in a student’s life as the first day of college approaches has been missing in Mayukh Bhattacharjee’s life this year as he knows his only interface with his teachers and classmates will be his smartphone camera for some time to come. For thousands of students who will be stepping into college for the first time from Friday onwards, the excitement to start such a crucial phase of their lives has been robbed by the fact that they will be doing so from the confines of their homes instead of being on the campus. Most students still feel that in-person classes should be resumed only when Covid cases are under control and a large number of population has been vaccinated. The run-up to the first day in college is usually full of activities for a student, including shopping and other preparations. “But I have cleared the memory in my phone to save notes from the teachers and switched to a stronger internet connection as a part of my preparation to start my college life,” said Bhattacharjee, who is now a student of Maulana Azad College. Most colleges are starting first-semester classes from Friday following the guidelines of the higher education department, but the mode of teaching will be online due to the pandemic. Campuses have been shut since March 2020 and both classes and examinations are being conducted online. The government has given signals that campuses might be opened after Durga Puja in a controlled manner, but no specific date or plan has been mentioned. “Stepping into college is normally a watershed moment in a students’ life but I am feeling half as excited. Yes, I am happy that I have managed to secure admission in a college and subject of my choice despite so many students scoring such high marks but the experience of stepping on to the campus will have to wait,” said Rakshit, who has taken admission in Lady Brabourne College. This batch has been having online classes even before they took their Class XI annual examinations.“I am tired of looking at the screen for the past 18 months and yearning for personal interaction. For the past one and a half years, I have been attending online classes. Add to it the uncertainty and stress related to everything, from examinations to admission in college,” said Mayank Jaiswal, who would start his college life at Seth Anandram Jaipuria College. Portals reopen for fresh applications:Several colleges, like Asutosh, Maulana Azad, New Alipore and Lady Brabourne College, have reopened admission portals, inviting fresh applications for UG courses. The higher education department has extended the deadline till October 8 after many colleges and unitary universities reported a number of vacant seats. Once new applications are received, colleges will draw up merit lists from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/virtual-reality-students-clear-phone-memory-get-high-speed-internet-to-step-into-college-life/articleshow/86662290.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Business||NCLT tells Zee to take up EGM request of Invesco & comply||MUMBAI: The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Thursday directed Zee Entertainment to consider positively the requisition for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) made by shareholder Invesco under the Companies Act. It also directed Zee to “comply with section 100 of the Companies Act” and posted Invesco’s application for compliance on October 4. Invesco Developing Markets Fund and OFI Global China Fund LLC, two US-based foreign funds, had on Wednesday approached the NCLT against Zee for failing to announce a date for the EGM. They had requisitioned the meeting on September 11 to remove Zee’s MD Punit Goenka and reconstitute the board by bringing in six more independent directors. Senior counsel Gopal Subramanium with solicitor Nitesh Jain of Trilegal made a statement on behalf of Zee that its board would be holding a meeting on Thursday or Friday to decide on the requisition and will communicate such a decision to Invesco on Friday, well within the 21-day deadline under the law once such requisition is made. “It still has three days to decide,” he said, and the NCLT recorded his statement that the board meeting will be held. The NCLT bench of acting president B P Mohan and member C B Singh, which was hearing the matter, asked senior counsel Sudipto Sarkar appearing for Goenka of Zee, “Their (Invesco’s) right to call a board meeting — can you deny that?” Sarkar said, “That will depend on the requisition, whether it is valid or not.” Former attorney general for India Mukul Rohatgi and Janak Dwarkadas, as counsel for Invesco, said they were almost 18% shareholders out of 96% public shareholding of Zee, which has over 2.5 lakh public shareholders and only 3.99% shareholding is by Goenka. Rohatgi said the company’s board has no discretion in deciding “one way or the other” once a requisition is made by shareholders who qualify with the necessary 10% shareholding threshold. They have to call for the EGM and, if they do not as the apprehension is, the NCLT should direct them to call for it.Rohatgi started the online hearing before the NCLT’s Mumbai bench by saying, “We wanted three people to go. One was the MD Goenka and two others…Of the three, two resigned on September 13. We also want six new independent directors to come in.” He said, “We read in the newspapers that Zee is contemplating a merger and Goenka to continue as MD in the new proposed entity.” He said Invesco’s investment in Zee is over Rs 5,000 crore. “We are worried our investment will go down the drain,” he said, adding “Goenka doesn’t want to lose his saddle.” Both Rohatgi and Dwarkadas with solicitor Dhruve Liladhar for Invesco said it has an “inalienable right” under the law to call for the EGM. Dwarkadas added, “We never said we are against a merger. We are saying the merger must go through a board we agree with, and our apprehension is that they will stall calling for an EGM by raising frivolous objections.” Senior counsel Arun Kathpalia for independent directors said they were a responsible lot and NCLT does not have to direct compliance of section 100 of Companies Act. Section 100 (3) of the Companies Act states that on receipt of requisition, the board of directors shall proceed to call EGM within 21 days from the date of the deposit of requisition, on a date which shall not be later than 45 days of the date of deposit of requisition. The board shall be said to have failed in calling the meeting if it does not call it within 21 days or convenes it for part demands or posts it after 45 days. Subramanium said it is not yet a merger, it is only a document of “disclosure” to the stock exchanges as is required of a public listed company under regulation 30 of the Sebi listing obligations. It says that at its meeting on September 22, Zee has agreed for “execution of a non-binding term sheet with Sony Pictures Networks India in relation to a potential transaction involving a composite scheme of arrangement for a merger of the company and Sony India…The proposed transaction is subject to completion of satisfactory due diligence by the company and Sony India.” At this juncture it is a “non-binding term sheet”. Later, after due diligence, will they go to the shareholders, Subramanium said, when NCLT asked why did the company have to go public with the information?A Zee spokesperson said after the NCLT hearing, “The board of the company is scheduled to meet as per the statutory time allotted, in relation to the matter. The company will continue to take all the actions needed in the interest of the shareholders and as per law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nclt-tells-zee-to-take-up-egm-request-of-invesco-comply/articleshow/86663487.cms||---

The five-member committee of Congress observers will interact with local party members and then take the call on its candidate and poll strategy. The committee was formulated by Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee president Madan Mohan Jha as per the instruction of state Congress incharge Bhakta Charan Das. It is being headed research cell head of the party Anand Madhab. Other members of the committee are Kapil Dev Prasda Yadav, Kaisar Khan, I P Gupta and Ajay Paswan. The development assumes significance amid tussle between alliance partners RJD and Congress over fielding candidate at Kusheshwar Asthan. While senior RJD leaders have claimed they will not give this seat to Congress, the Grand Old Party is in no mood to relent. The Congress is following the seat-sharing formula reached in the 2020 assembly polls when it had got the Kusheshwar Asthan seat. “Our candidate had lost by a small margin in 2020. We have already done the groundwork for the seat,” Madhab said, adding he will leave for Darbhanga with his team on Friday. RJD state spokesperson Chitran Gagan said the party would fielding its candidate at Kusheshwar Asthan this time and Lalu Prasad will take a final call on it. Meanwhile, the Congress on Thursday protested against the NDA government at the Centre as well as the state government over price rise, unemployment and farm laws. Leading the protest, party’s acting chairperson Sameer Singh said unemployment and inflation were at their peak, but the government was least bothered to solve these issues. Another party leader, Kaukab Qadri, hit out at the NDA government for “ignoring the plights of farmers and youths”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-fumes-as-congress-forms-committee-to-select-candidate/articleshow/86658938.cms||Sheezan Nezami

They will also prepare a coronavirus effigy which will be burned on the occasion of Vijayadashami on October 14. Kamal Noopany, the chairperson of the Dussehra Committee Trust, told this reporter that all the guidelines issued by the district administration in view of the Covid-19 pandemic would be followed. “We will shrink the size of the effigies of the three demons this year. Ravana’s effigy will be only 15 feet tall, Kumbhakarna’s 13 feet tall, and Meghanada’s 11 feet tall. The Covid effigy, on the other hand, will be 10 feet high,” Noopany said and added, “Lesser number of crackers, which are eco-friendly, will be used in the effigies so that they do not cause air pollution.” While the effigies of the three demons will wear Rajasthani clothes, the Covid effigy will have red-coloured spikes. They are likely to be ready by October 12. According to sources, a sum of Rs 6 lakh will be spent on Vijayadashami celebrations this year. Only 300 visitors will be allowed to attend the ‘Ravana Vadh’ programme at Kalidas Rangalaya. Artists begin rehearsals: With a view to keeping the tradition of Vijayadashami alive even in Covid times, the artists of Kalidas Rangalaya and a few locals have started rehearsals for ‘Ramleela’, ‘Ravana Vadh’, and ‘Bharat Milap’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/effigies-of-covid-three-demons-to-be-burned-to-ashes-this-dussehra/articleshow/86659305.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Patna||Education minister: Hygiene practices can help reduce girls’ school dropout rate||PATNA: State education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary on Thursday said healthy environment and hygiene practices in schools would go a long way in helping children study well and reducing the dropout rate of girls. Launching the Bihar Swachh Vidyalaya Puraskar (BSVP) at an event jointly organised by the Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC) and UNICEF-Bihar here, Choudhary said the school sanitation award would prove to be a milestone in improving the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) standards in schools, especially in rural areas. “It will also help ensure hygiene standards in schools in view of Covid-19 pandemic. The state government is committed to providing all possible help for the successful implementation of the programme,” he said. Additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar, said under-5 mortality in Bihar was primarily occurring due to pneumonia and diarrhoea which are directly related to the lack of provision of WASH. “These diseases, especially diarrhoea, can be prevented by ensuring safe drinking water to kids. Similarly, availability and maintenance of running water is very essential in schools. In this context, the role of state government’s flagship programme ‘Har Ghar, Nal ka Jal’ is very crucial. Maintenance and regular cleaning of toilets in schools is also our priority. All these issues will be taken care of in each and every school through this award. From this year only, we are going to ensure 100% participation of schools for the award,” Kumar said. The unique initiative – ‘State-specific WASH in schools benchmarking system’ – was launched in the presence of secretary Asangba Chuba Ao, special secretary Satish Chandra Jha, state project director of BEPC Shrikant Shastri, UNICEF India’s deputy representative Yasumasa Kimura and Bihar chief (UNICEF) Nafisa Binte Shafique. Shrikant said keeping in mind the special circumstances of Bihar, guidelines related to this award have been developed in line with the ‘Swachh Vidyalaya Puraskar’ initiated by the central government in 2016. “The state-specific benchmarking system is very much aligned with national SVP. Moreover, this will help the school administration improve WASH infrastructure and sustain it,” he said. Srikant added, “Seven themes and 50 indicators have been identified through a consultative process. From the selection of schools to the distribution of prizes, the process will be completed under the supervision of the state government. A mobile-based application is being developed for self-nomination by the schools. The schools will be ranked under 5-star rating.” Yasumasa said ‘WASH in Schools’ aims to leave a deep impact on children’s health and hygiene. Highlighting the special needs of girls, the UNICEF-Bihar chief Nafisa said apart from separate toilets for girls, provision of adequate and smooth sanitation facilities in schools for menstrual hygiene management was very important. “Basic facilities that provide for good hygiene and privacy, along with sensitive health promotion, assist girls to stay in school and complete their education. UNICEF Bihar’s WASH specialist Dr Prabhakar Sinha said according to U-DISE 2019-20, 99.8% of the 72,517 schools in Bihar have drinking water facilities. “Similarly, about 98% of the schools have separate toilet facilities for girls. If we talk about all the WASH facilities (separate functional toilets for boys and girls, drinking water and hand wash), they are available in 17,329 primary, 13,174 middle, 2,055 higher secondary and 1,210 secondary schools in the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/education-minister-hygiene-practices-can-help-reduce-girls-school-dropout-rate/articleshow/86658869.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||Current a/c swings into surplus in Q1||Mumbai: India’s current account balance moved into a surplus in the first quarter of FY22 following a contraction in the trade deficit and an increase in services receipts. However, the surge in economic activity and rising oil prices could result in the country slipping back into a current account deficit in the coming quarters. The current account surplus stood at $6.5 billion, or 0.9% of GDP, compared to $19.1 billion in the same quarter a year ago, which was a record high. In Q4FY21, the current account deficit stood at $8.1 billion.“The merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $30.7 billion in Q2, though it is likely to widen again in the coming quarters. While exports registered a record quarter ($97.4 billion), India’s import bill could increase further in the coming months due to improvement in activity and elevated commodity prices,” said Barclays India economist Rahul Bajoria. “The surplus in the current account in Q1 2021/22 was primarily on account of contraction in the trade deficit to $30.7 billion from $41.7 billion in the preceding quarter, and an increase in net services receipts,” the RBI said in the release. Helping to balance the $30-billion trade deficit was $25 billion of IT exports and $12.4 billion of networker remittances. A current account surplus is seen as positive for the currency as it reduces the demand for dollars. However, the exchange rate is influenced by total capital flows including investments by foreign investors which is reflected in the overall balance of payments. A surplus in the balance of payments adds to the country’s foreign exchange reserves. “There was a record accretion of $31.9 billion to the foreign exchange reserves (on a BoP basis) as compared with that of $19.8 billion in Q1:2020-21,” the RBI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/current-a/c-swings-into-surplus-in-q1/articleshow/86663289.cms||---

They were identified as Anil Singh of Musepur Khaira in Aurangabad, Prabhat Kumar of Nardiganj in Nawada, and Pawan Singh of Baksu in Nalanda. According to STF sources, the trio was nabbed when Anil and Prabhat were delivering the cartridges smuggled from Jharkhand to Pawan at Baksu. “The cartridges, which are used by criminals in breech-loading firearms, were to be supplied to criminals in Nalanda, Nawada, Patna, and neighbouring districts,” a senior police officer told TOI. He added, “Of the Rs 3.5 lakh, which Pawan had to pay for the consignment, only Rs 26,000 was left. He had decided to sell the cartridges to criminal gangs here.” Now, the STF is planning to conduct raids in Jharkhand and identify the place from where the consignment was sent to Bihar amid the ongoing panchayat polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/stf-seizes-1000-live-cartridges-smuggled-from-jharkhand/articleshow/86659117.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The air quality index (AQI) in Patna on Thursday morning was 59 which further improved to 52 at 4pm, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin. The prominent pollutants in the air were ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide- CO (which produced in the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels), the board said. The officials added the overall AQI of 52 for Patna was the average of AQI level of air monitoring stations at BIT-Mesra (70), Eco Park (37), S K Memorial Hall (78), Patna City (39) and DRM office, Khagaul (37). The planetarium air monitoring station was out of order due to a technical snag. The environmentalists have attributed the improvement in AQI to favourable wind speed and rain which have settled the air pollutants to some extent. Pradhan Parth Sarthi, professor at department of environmental science at Central University of South Bihar, said the creation of ozone and carbon monoxide was basically due to vehicular emission, which affects lungs. “Due to rain, PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns) and PM 10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns) are not the prominent sources of air pollution. The dust particles have settled down in the atmosphere. Presently, the main reason of air pollution is vehicular emission,” he said. The Air Quality Early Warning System of the ministry of earth sciences has predicted that the overall AQI of Patna would improve to “good” category over the next two days. No sudden deterioration of AQI is expected till the end of this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/air-quality-satisfactory-for-fifth-consecutive-day-in-patna/articleshow/86659266.cms||Faryal Rumi

The BJP, a major partner of the NDA government that Nitish leads, clearly saw on Thursday that the ball had been put back in the Centre’s court, and accordingly, maintained that the Centre would concede the demand and also give special status to Bihar “as and when the occasion comes”. “In view of the future scenario, the demand for special status should not be abandoned. It cannot be granted in the present situation as the provision for it has been removed. Those states which have been enjoying special status will continue to enjoy it, but no new state can be given this status,” state BJP spokesman and former MLA Prem Ranjan Patel said. Patel added if NITI Aayog recommends it and the National Development Council (NDC) – which actually grants it – also decides to resume the practice in the future, Bihar would stand the chance of getting special status. He added that PM Narendra Modi had announced to give special status to Bihar, but the provision for it was abolished, and accordingly, the Rs 1.25-lakh crore worth of special package that he gave to Bihar was “worth much more than the benefits that could have been offered to the state through the special category status.” However, the opposition parties were not convinced by the stand of Nitish and asked him to stick to the demand. “The cabinet speaks in one voice, but a senior minister is saying one thing and the CM quite the opposite. The matter must have been in discussion at some level. That is why the minister has a different view,” RJD spokesman Chitranjan Gagan said adding that the CM made the U-turn after the opposition parties led by RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav assailed the government. RJD MLA Bhai Birendra said, “Every demand of the state (central university status for Patna University, special category status and now caste census) has been turned down by the BJP-led government at the Centre. Nitish is with the BJP only to save his chair.” Congress MLC and party’s media department head Prem Chandra Mishra said the CM was only confusing the people on the matter. “Technically, the CM cannot unilaterally decide to abandon the special status demand, because it was passed by the state legislature in 2007 and the resolution for the same was sent to the Centre. If it has to be abandoned, the matter should come to the state legislature,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-confusing-people-on-special-status-issue-opposition/articleshow/86658721.cms||Abhay Singh

Schoolchildren study online but toddlers' parents were not ready for this shift. Huge losses and a grim business forecast prompted us to call it quits,” says Jamtani. For the past 18 months, all schools in the state either remained shut or shifted to online education. Government permission recently to allow class 8-12 students in schools too has not led to any beelines for classrooms as majority students still prefer to study from the safety of their homes. Needless to say, the pandemic scare has practically sounded the death knell for the otherwise thriving preschool or or playschool sector where parents are highly averse to any risk of exposing their 1.5-3.5-year-olds to possible virus risk. There are an estimated 1,500 preschools in Ahmedabad of which more than 70% have shut shop due to Covid-19, says Pathik Shah, president of Ahmedabad-chapter of Early Childhood Association and Association for Primary Education. Firdosh Lalkaka, who runs one of the oldest preschools in the city located in Navrangpura, has shifted to online education but numbers have dwindled from 300 to merely 75. He says he can afford to suffer losses as he does not have to pay rent. “Majority preschools which closed down were franchise-based. Cost of running a preschool from rented premises costs anywhere between Rs 10-15 lakh. With only a handful of parents ready to opt for online classes, it was not feasible for most,” says Lalkaka. “From about 100 students, we now have only 27 preschool kids. About 70-80% playschools in Ahmedabad were run on a franchise model. They have all shut down because of the high rent involved,” says Shah who also runs a preschool in Vastrapur. It needs mention playschools were a lucrative business pre-pandemic as most charged an average fee ranging from Rs 30,000-75,000 per annum. Some charged as much as Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh. Experts say parents are reeling under financial crisis due to pay cuts. Going online has not worked for this category as only 15-20% parents enrolled for virtual education in this age-group which is not enough to run a full-fledged facility. Hiral Patel, owner of a pre-school in Maninagar, says in their playgroup there were hardly any new admissions and it is just three students this year as compared to 80 prior to the Covid-19 outbreak. "My son is two years old. I would have liked to enrol in a play school for him to play and learn. But I see no point in spending Rs 75,000 for him to sit in front of a PC," says Avani Tomar, a Maninagar resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/toddlers-at-home-70-preschools-shutdown-during-pandemic-in-abad/articleshow/86662329.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Business||‘No GST input tax credit on CSR expense’||MUMBAI: The Gujarat bench of the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) recently held that corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities under the Companies (CSR Policy) Rules are excluded from the normal course of business. Its ruling came in a case where the applicant was a private limited company, Adama India. The AAR said Adama India would not be eligible for input tax credit (ITC) under goods and services tax (GST) laws. If this ruling is followed by GST authorities during assessments, it will be a big blow to India Inc which, in the backdrop of the pandemic, has spent heavily on CSR activities, such as providing medical relief by way of oxygen concentrators & sanitisers, to name a few instances. This is another classic case of divergent views on the same issue taken by two different benches of the AAR. In its edition of April 8, TOI had covered the ruling given by the Uttar Pradesh (UP) bench in the case of Dwarikesh Sugar Industries. In this case, the AAR bench had held that CSR expenditure is incurred by a company to comply with its legal obligations under the Companies Act. Thus, the GST paid by the company on the products it purchased for its CSR-related expenditure could be set off against its GST liability (this is referred to as ITC). In the ruling sought from the Gujarat AAR, the applicant-company was a supplier insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. Its CSR expenditure was towards providing notebooks and course material for schools, providing chairs and tables in schools and hospitals, construction of cement benches at public places, installation of oxygen-generating plants at hospitals, providing masks, sanitisers and oxygen concentrators. It submitted that CSR expenses were mandatory, thus, they were incurred in the course and furtherance of business. Therefore, it should be eligible for ITC. However, the Gujarat AAR bench disagreed with this contention. It went further and pointed out that the ruling given by the UP AAR bench was not binding on it. AAR rulings are binding only on the applicant and the relevant GST officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-gst-input-tax-credit-on-csr-expense/articleshow/86663339.cms||Lubna Kably

Camera brands have seen almost doubling of demand and sales of entry-level mirrorless cameras in the last 15 months. Consumer tech analysts and influencer marketing firms TOI spoke to say hobbyist creators and vloggers who started off using smartphones for producing content have tapped the entry-level digital cameras (also called mirrorless cameras) to create and share content more professionally. They are also driving sales of tripods, portable microphones, ring lights, gimbals and other equipment that help create a professional studio atmosphere at home. FujiFilm saw over 200% growth in sales of its entry-level camera line up including the XT-200 last year. “Wireless content sharing, flip-able screen, aspect ratio settings to reduce post production work and setting time limits are a few features that make it a pick among content creators,” Arun Babu, general manager, EID & Optical Device Division, FujiFilm, said. Travel and lifestyle vloggers and photographers used to be a niche segment but are now one of the key customer categories and growing, he added. Manabu Yamazaki, president & CEO, Canon India, said the company has witnessed “double-digit growth rates” in its camera division. “Features in cameras such as direct streaming on social media, IBIS (n-body image stabilization) and advanced auto-focus have only further enabled vloggers to become independent and shoot their videos,” he said. Canon has a range of cameras available with the EOS 200DMKII being a hit with content creators. Its key features include ability to share content to any platform through Wi-Fi and bluetooth and a HDMI output for direct live streaming in YouTube. Zhiyun India, a company that sells gimbals -a device that allows cameras to rotate smoothly to help film smooth footage on the move- says it has seen almost 200% rise in demand and sales. With a suge in direct streaming, the company is also planning to launch a small sim-enabled display unit that creators can mount on their DSLRs for quick sharing. “As creators gain a large following and wish to enhance the quality of their content, they move on to DSLRs/Mirrorless cameras, etc… many of these devices today facilitate transfer of data quickly in order to broadcast it,” Apaksh Gupta, co-founder and CEO of influencer marketing firm One Impression, said. In the pandemic, we have seen a surge in the indoor lighting market with ring lights, soft lights and over-the-top lights being used by the influencers, he added. Digitek, Simpex and other photography equipment companies have all expanded product lines to include tripods, gimbals, ring lighting and other preferred equipment by content creators. Industry players say one can set up a good home studio in under Rs. 25,000 with the options and get started on a creator journey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/influencer-economy-gives-boost-to-photography-allied-sectors/articleshow/86662167.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

This is because he belongs to the Valmiki community, classified as a Scheduled Caste (SC), and the panchayat of the village where he is posted as teacher, has officially stated he cannot get a house locally as there is no Valmiki housing settlement in the village. The blatant discrimination has led to the state social justice and empowerment department writing a letter to the education department last week, acknowledging that “the teacher from the scheduled caste has been a victim of torture, discrimination, inequality and casteism”. The social justice department has asked the education department to transfer him as soon as possible. A copy of the letter is available with this newspaper. Kanhaiyalal Baraiya (50), who resides at Chhatriyala village of Chuda taluka in Surendranagar district, was transferred to a school at Ninama village in the same district, which is located 75 km away. “When I went and reported for duty, I began inquiring to rent a house. I was asked which community I belong to. When I responded saying that I was from the Valmiki community, I was told that there is no Valmiki settlement in the village and hence I cannot get a house on rent in the village! In fact, the talati and sarpanch – the administrative and elected heads of the village – provided this in writing on the official letterhead of the village panchayat on December 16, 2020 to Baraiya. “I have made official complaints to all departments concerned – the social justice, education and other departments – about this. Finally, the social justice department last week wrote to the education department to transfer me,” Baraiya told TOI. Baraiya claimed that he had also explained his situation to CM Bhupendra Patel and requested for a transfer. “The CM told me that he will look into the matter," said Baraiya. When contacted, Surendranagar district collector Amrutesh Aurangabadkar said that he is presently on leave and will investigate the matter. Dalit activists say discrimination on basis of caste is commonplace and it is most unfortunate that even teachers are not being spared. “I have written a letter to the PM, asking him to declare any one village in the country free from discrimination by January 26, 2022. Such cases happen everywhere and everyday in Gujarat," said Kantilal Parmar, dalit rights activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-house-for-mr-baraiya-caste-distance-forces-teacher-to-ride-150km-to-school/articleshow/87441773.cms||Meghdoot Sharon

---||Chandigarh||Lax litigant should pay for causing delay in court matters: Punjab and Haryana high court||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has made it clear that a lax litigant should pay the price for casual and nonchalant approach for causing delay in court matters. According to the HC, “Delay is akin to a self-goal and there cannot be any premium on a self-goal”. “It is high time that a lax litigant pays the price for casual and nonchalant approach in instituting time-bound cases in the courts, particularly, as enlightened a litigant as Union of India herein which is legally backed up with an entire vertical of department’s own law officers giving them advice at every step. Despite the same, if delay is caused at the cost of forfeiture of a vested legal right of the opposite party, the same is to be deprecated. Delay is thus akin to a self-goal. Consequences, thereof, have to be suffered,” the HC has observed. Justice Arun Monga passed these orders while dismissing the plea filed by Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) seeking review of an order dated February 28, 2019, passed by the HC. In its February 2019 orders, the HC had allowed a petition filed by some CRPF officials claiming the benefit of step up/re-fixation of pay at par with their juniors. Aggrieved by these orders, CRPF wanted a review of the order. However, it approached the HC after a delay of 832 days. While seeking condonation of delay in filing the plea, the counsel for the central government had argued that time was consumed on obtaining opinion/approval of competent authority, preparation of grounds of appeal and lockdown/curfew imposed by the state/UT due to Covid- 19 pandemic. It was further stated that the movement of file was through various channels that resulted in delay of filing the said review application. “The delay was neither intentional nor deliberate and the same has been duly explained with sufficient cause and further no prejudice will be caused to any party in case the delay is condoned and the review application is heard and decided on merits,” the counsel had contended. After hearing the issue, Justice Monga observed that no doubt, a discretion had been vested with court to condone the delay, provided sufficient cause thereof had been made out. “I have already given my mind that reasons given in the application do not really make it out to be a sufficient cause. That apart, having perused the purported justification, I may hasten to add that very mechanical reasons of administrative rigmarole have been given for the same. Almost suggestive, as if, to seek condonation of delay is a matter of right, regardless of the reasons qua the same,” observed the judge while dismissing the Centre’s plea for condonation of delay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/lax-litigant-should-pay-for-causing-delay-in-court-matters-hc/articleshow/86664556.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Nagpur||Bamboo centre diverted 3.98ha forest land without seeking nod||Nagpur: The forest department, which is the custodian of the Forest Conservation Act (FCA), 1980, and is supposed to set the example for others, has itself violated the FCA by constructing units on Bamboo Research Training Centre (BRTC) without seeking forest clearance. Information was sought under the Right To Information (RTI) Act on whether the bamboo handicraft and art unit (BHAU) and vacuum pressure impregnation (VPI) plant was set up for bamboo treatment at BRTC in Chichpalli, near Chandrapur. The world-class BRTC is constructed on 4.99-hectare (ha) zudpi jungle land for which Stage-II clearance was granted under FCA by the state government on March 9, 2017. However, under the garb of clearance for 4.99 ha, the BHAU and VPI were constructed in the backyard of BRTC on another 3.98 ha of forest land in 2017. Under the FCA, any forest land diverted for non-forestry activity needs clearance under Section 2 of the Act. The project proponent has to pay the net present value (NPV) of forest land that is being diverted for non-forestry purposes. It depends on the type and quality of forests. The RTI has revealed that no forest clearance was sought under Section 2 of the FCA for 3.98 ha for BHAU and VPI — an area equalling four football fields — implying a violation of Supreme Court orders by then BRTC director and deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Rahul Patil. Though the RTI reply doesn’t mention his name, Patil was at the helm of BRTC affairs in 2017 when the units were set up. The RTI reply said, “The process to apply for forest clearance for 3.98-ha forest land is in progress.” So, the two units were constructed four years ago but the proposal for forest clearance is being processed now. In an earlier RTI query by Nagpur-based social activist Ishwar Gajbe, it was revealed that BRTC violated the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Hazardous & Other Wastes (Management & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2018 by taking no consent from Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) before operating the VPI unit. “We have applied for requisite permissions,” the RTI reply said. However, even after one year, the permission has not been sought. Action Against FCA Violation * Whoever contravenes or abets the contravention of any of the provisions of Section 2, shall be punishable with simple imprisonment for a period which may extend to 15 days * Handbook of guidelines for effective and transparent implementation of the provisions of FCA says in cases where the proposal has not been submitted and forest land is diverted without FC for non-forestry purposes, the state will be dealt with under provisions of Indian Forest Act 1,927 and other state acts. * The land in question will not be considered as diverted under FCA and the status of the land shall continue to be a forest * If the permission for use of forest land has been granted by the state authority without the prior approval of the Centre, then action under Section 3A or 3B of FCA shall be taken against the authority * The MoEFCC regional office will conduct a formal inquiry||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bamboo-centre-diverted-3-98ha-forest-land-without-seeking-nod/articleshow/86664553.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Hyderabad||Come April 2022, flying out of Hyderabad to get dearer||NEW DELHI: Flying out of Hyderabad will cost a lot more from next April. The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) has approved an annual graded hike in both user development fees (UDF) — paid directly by flyers — and other aeronautical charges — levied on airlines, based on which ticket prices are decided — from April 1, 2022. AERA tariff order for Rajiv Gandhi International Airport order is for the third control period (TCP), from April 1, 2021, to March 31, 2026. However, charges for this fiscal (till March 31, 2022) have been kept unchanged to ensure that the nascent recovery in domestic air travel does not take a hit due to higher cost of flying. UDF for departing domestic and international flyers will annually increase from current Rs 281 and Rs 393, respectively, to a steep Rs 750 and Rs 1,500 till December 31, 2025. From January 1, 2026, till the next order is issued, the UDF will fall to Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 per domestic and international passenger, respectively. Other aeronautical charges like aircraft landing and parking fees follow a similar trajectory. AERA has followed the same tariff change trajectory at other airports that sought annual hikes like Bengaluru and Kochi. “Air traffic demand in the first quarter of FY 2021-22 has been deeply impacted by the challenges posed by the Covid-19 (second wave) and the resultant slowdown in the economy,” AERA said. The first year is expected to be the most affected year of the TCP and any increase in tariffs or additional charges at this stage is likely to be detrimental for the recovery of traffic and the recovery of the sector as a whole,” the AERA order says. Due to no increase in tariff in FY 2021-22, the authority says it does not expect a “cash deficit” in this first fiscal of the TCP for the meeting operational expenses and debt servicing. And if there is a deficit, “it is expected to be of the small magnitude which the airport operator can easily tide over by renegotiating long-term loan repayment schedules and look (ing) at other innovative ways to manage cash or avail relevant credit lines,” it says. “The authority has agreed for tariff increases and additional charges in the form of UDF but at the same time it believes that the subsequent control period would be better in the context of lesser capital requirements and larger passenger base owing to the recovery in aviation sector and revival of the economy. Hence, the tariff rates for the subsequent control period are expected to be lower. In view of this, the authority has reduced the tariff rates in the last quarter of the final year of TCP (starting January 1, 2026),” it adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/come-apr-22-flying-out-of-hyderabad-to-get-dearer/articleshow/86667054.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Bank scam accused can get pacemaker at JJ hospital’||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government has informed the Bombay high court that the state-run JJ Hospital has the facility to conduct a pacemaker implantation surgery for businessman Rakesh Wadhawan, who is accused of money laundering in the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank case. Wadhawan, who is in judicial custody, is currently undergoing treatment at the civic-run KEM Hospital. The state prison authority on Wednesday made the submission before the single-judge bench of Justice Bharati Dangre in compliance with a previous query posed by the court while hearing a medical bail plea filed by Wadhawan. Last week, Justice Dangre had asked the prison authorities to inform the court if any government hospital in Mumbai had pacemaker implantation facility after Wadhawan’s lawyer Abad Ponda told the High Court that the businessman needed to undergo the procedure urgently. Wadhawan, the founder of Housing Development Infrastructure Limited, was arrested in 2019 following the PMC Bank scam.

---||Pune||Deficient rainfall in Shivajinagar this season so far, Lohegaon gets excess||Pune: Shivajinagar ended up with deficient rainfall this monsoon, while the season remained normal for the district, IMD data has revealed. Shivajinagar received 469.7mm of rainfall from June to September, as against a normal of 605.6mm — a deficit of 22.4%. On the other hand, Lohegaon received excess rainfall this monsoon season — 562mm as against 486.2mm. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, said despite the below normal rainfall in Shivajinagar, the overall rainfall for Pune city has been normal this monsoon. “The ghat areas received good rainfall this monsoon, which is why the dams that supply water to Pune city are filled to capacity. Areawise rain disparity arose this monsoon as various periods in June, July and August brought weak monsoon conditions. During such periods, there were convective rains that occur when cumulonimbus or thunder clouds develop. These clouds bring convective rains in the areas under their influence. However, formation of cumulonimbus clouds differs from area to area.” Kashyapi said areawise rainfall disparities could also occur due to differences in the orography of regions. IMD data showed that Maharashtra, as a whole, received 1,194.3mm rainfall this season as against a normal of 1004.2mm. Thus, its rain surplus was 19%. Madhya Maharashtra’s total rainfall this monsoon was 872.6mm as against a normal of 751.2mm. This is 16% more rainfall than normal. According to IMD, when the realised rainfall is 60%, 20% to 59%, -19% to +19%, -59% to -20%, -99% to -60% of long period average (LPA), the rainfall is categorized as large excess, excess, normal, deficient, large deficient respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/deficient-rainfall-in-shivajinagar-this-season-so-far-lohegaon-gets-excess/articleshow/86662350.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Chandigarh||Farmers lay siege to Wallmart mall in Zirakpur over sacking of staff||Times News Network Mohali: Farmers protesting against the three farm bills laid siege to the Wallmart-Best Price Mega Mall in Zirakpur on Thursday. Hundreds of them, under the banner of Bhartiya Kisan Union Ekta (Ugrahan) led by Joginder Singh Ugrahan protested against dismissal of employees from the Walmart’s Bathinda unit. They also demanded permanent closure of the Wallmart-Best Price mega mall in Zirakpur. Joginder Singh Ugrahan, president, BKU (Ugrahan), warned that all the best price stores of the company in Punjab would be closed if the employees’ jobs were not restored. He announced that farmers would continue to hold protest dharna till the jobs were not restored by September 30. The company ignored the warning and took action in just two days, accepting the resignations of employees and repatriating them permanently by depositing gratuity and full and final amount in their bank accounts. In the backdrop of the uncertainty caused by the deadlock between the protesting farmers and the Centre, Walmart’s Bathinda unit was closed permanently and its entire wholesale membership cancelled. Protesters alleged that company officials took resignations from employees fraudulently. Joginder Singh Ugrahan said, “The company accepted resignations by flouting the rules and arm twisting the employees. Our organisation is standing shoulder to shoulder with the employees of Wallmart Best Price Mall and will continue their struggle till the jobs of the employees are restored.” Indian Farmers Union Ekta Ugrahan state vice-president Jhanda Singh Jethuke, Manjit Singh Nial, district Patiala president Jaswant Singh were among those who addressed the protesting farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-lay-siege-to-wallmart-mall-in-zirakpur-over-sacking-of-staff/articleshow/86662336.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Protesting students brainwashed: PU VC||Over the last few months, Panjab University vice-chancellor professor Raj Kumar has faced protests by student bodies outside his office for reopening of colleges, Senate elections and against alleged conversion of PU into a central university. In an exclusive interview with Poviet Kaur, he talks about the incidents on campus and what lies ahead. Q. How do you plan to take teaching ahead despite the Covid threat? We have opened different departments, including dental and technical departments for final year students in a phased manner so that we can avoid any mishappenings and mass gatherings. We have made it mandatory for students to have at least one dose of vaccination or a negative RT-PCR. We are following all the protocols. We ask students to maintain social distance at all times. Q. What took so long to reopen? We are the first ones to open the university with 60% departments working. We wanted to make sure everything goes in the right direction. Q. What is the university doing to improve placements? There is a placement cell in the university which looks out for the best interest of the students. We give them all the help and support they ask for. I am sure there will be an improvement. We have always helped the students with the placements and we have had the best alumnus so far. Q. University is not doing well with overall ranking for the last few years, how do you plan to change that? The IQAC department is looking after the university ranking. It is coordinating with different departments and collecting data from them. We hope to be back with a bang in the years to come. I have personally met HOD's of different departments, who are preparing presentations and looking into loopholes. Q. What are your expectations from the new Senate, which will be functional soon? We have struggled a lot with it. It is the apex body of the university and I hope that once the Senate is formed, in a few months we will work together for the betterment of the university and everyone associated with it. Q. What is your stand on the spate of protests recently? Students are being misguided by a few political parties for personal gains. I and my staff always try to resolve issues. By staging protests, students are tarnishing the image of the institution. Also, teachers who are protesting under Puta should go to the UGC and protest there and not here. This is not going to help them anyway. Q. Afghan students are struggling with financial issues and have asked for your support. What are your plans for them? We are unable to help them alone. The university is facing a deficit and it is the duty of the administration to help them. If we accommodate them in the admission then we must help them with arranging hostels, food, and fees, which is not possible. Q. Many PU student parties claim that you are pro-BJP and don’t address their issues. What do you have to say? That's not true. More than any other vice-chancellor, I have met these students from time to time and addressed their issues. They are all brainwashed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/protesting-students-brainwashed-pu-vc/articleshow/86662368.cms||---
---||Nagpur||To do or not to? SBWL panel’s ‘translocate tiger’ plan stirs up debate||Nagpur: The recommendation by 11-member technical study group of the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) to remove tigers from Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL) mine and Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS) areas and put them in safaris and zoos, and translocate select tigers from low-density forest areas has stirred up a debate. The panel headed by Chandrapur CCF NR Praveen has made a series of recommendations to mitigate man-animal conflict by making four zones. The group was formed on the directives of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in the 15th SBWL meeting held on August 7 last year. Executive trustee of Conservation Action Trust (CAT), Debi Goenka, said, “Some of the recommendations are not acceptable. There is no need to capture wild tigers that are not a threat to humans. To capture and put these tigers in cages will not help because other tigers would occupy vacant habitats. Also, the recommendation that bushes and vegetation should be cleared to eliminate cover for leopards is ludicrous.” “Leopards can conceal themselves literally anywhere — on trees, in the grass, in agriculture fields, and even under vehicles or inside man-made structures. Building leopard-proof fencing is also very expensive and would need extensive maintenance. This report needs to be reviewed by the SBWL,” said Goenka. One of the panel members and WII scientist Bilal Habib said, “I agree that tigers removed will be replaced by others, but it will take two-three years. By this time, some long-term solutions can be finalized. The issue is of 30-40 breeding tigresses in Chandrapur district where new cubs are coming and hunting for territories.” “We are also not in favour of lifting tigers moving in natural forest, but a female in areas like CSTPS can be picked up to prevent further breeding. We can translocate tigers in areas like Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) where there is a prey base for at least 25-30 tigers. This will be an experiment which we need to implement,” said Habib. However, conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar says, “NNTR doesn’t have sufficient prey to accommodate 25 tigers. Tigers earlier released in Navegaon were either shot dead or killed. Those that came naturally were captured. Instead of spending crores of rupees on such projects, the department should work to strengthen corridors.” Founder of Earth Brigade Foundation Sarita Subramaniam said, “Translocation of tigers by forest department doesn’t have a single successful example. Even Madhya Pradesh, which has a higher success rate of translocation of tigers within the state, ended up losing two wild tigers when the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) relocated them to Satakosia.” “It is best to allocate budgets to keep migratory corridors patent and maintain the sacrosanctity of all tiger habitats rather than waste taxpayers’ money on ‘doomed to fail’ translocations,” she said. Gadchiroli honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel says, “If the aim is to reduce the population of tigers in the district under political pressure, then it will be injustice with natural dispersal and will affect tiger ecology.” “Conflict tigers mean those animals that are killing humans by venturing into farmlands. Human/cattle kills in forests are mere accidents. Actually, the presence of tigers reduces grazing and creates inviolate areas because the length of grazing time is reduced, thereby improving food availability for the survival of prey,” says Patel. Another panel member Anish Andheria, president, Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT), said, “The committee felt that it was important to actively manage human-created habitat like CSTPS and mining areas by removing the weed and feral livestock, and simultaneously translocating tigers from there to other viable habitats in Vidarbha.” “This should be followed by encircling these areas with solar, wildlife-proof fences so that no tiger can enter and start residing within these campuses again. We have categorically suggested this to be done on a war footing if human-tiger conflict around Chandrapur has to be reduced and that the cost of this activity should be borne by WCL and CSTPS,” said Andheria. THE MAJOR CONCERNS * Chandrapur is among the highest density tiger habitats of India. Nestled within this region are WCL coal mines and CSTPS * FDCM monoculture system creates a green desert and needs to be discouraged * Compromised connectivity across forest areas because of linear infrastructures like canals, roads, railways, and power lines causing conflict * Securing degraded corridors by planting bamboo and native tree species, and through assisted natural regeneration||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/to-do-or-not-to-sbwl-panels-translocate-tiger-plan-stirs-up-debate/articleshow/86664579.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The protests were started at Amritsar, Jalandhar, Zirakpur and two outlets at Ludhiana. The farm group will take the further decision on October 6. As the farm group had laid siege to the Best Price outlet at Bhucho, situated on Bathinda-Chandigarh national highway for close to a year now, the Best Price had retrenched a number of employees. The employees had in the past approached the farm group and had met organisation president Joginder Singh Ugrahan at Tikri border with an appeal to support them. The organisation has then asked the Walmart to get back the employees on jobs. Walmart had to approach the Punjab and Haryana high court to get the perishable and expired items from the store and it is only after the intervention of the court that perishable items were removed. Joginder Singh Ugrahan, who led the protest at Zirakpur, said, “We support the employees and want they should be recalled at the jobs. We have started continuous protests for a week and will take the further decision on October 6.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-outfit-begins-protests-in-support-of-retrenched-staff/articleshow/86664637.cms||---

The bench comprising K Ramakrishnan and K Satyagopal heard the arguments of Telangana government’s counsel, who argued that the NGT does have the right to take action against AP government in the contempt petition and cited precedents in this regard and section 26 of the NGT Act, which states that “violation of order of this tribunal is a criminal offence, punishable with imprisonment up to three years and fine up to Rs 10 crore”. He also pointed at section 28 of NGT Act — which states that “any department of the government that fails to comply with any order or award or decision of the tribunal under this Act, the head of the department shall be deemed to be guilty of such failure” — to corroborate his arguments.  The AP government stuck to its claim that it has not violated the NGT’s orders and the works undertaken at the RLIS site are only meant for the preparation of detailed project report (DPR).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ngt-case-ap-to-conclude-its-arguments-on-oct-4/articleshow/86662387.cms||---

Dr Sajal Bansal, a resident doctor at GMCH and president of MARD Nagpur city, said that as part of the statewide strike of resident doctors under the banner of MARD, they have stopped the routine work in OPDs and wards in government hospitals. Dr Bansal said, “We haven’t got any response to a number of intimations and follow-ups for our demands which the government hasn’t met, which forced us to take this step. We would be taking precautions so that patients in ICUs and Covid work are not affected due to our strike. The medical services going on amid the floods in Marathwada would also not be affected.” Bansal added that for the last one-and-a-half years, residents were working full time in Covid services, for which the government hasn’t paid them the promised allowances. He said that resident doctors hadn’t got speciality training in course like surgery, orthopaedics, radiology, medicines etc — for which we have taken admission — for the last one-and-a-half years due to the Covid pandemic. “The government is still charging fees for it. The fees should be waived and our education in specialised fields should be taken care of. Tax deducted at source (TDS) on stipend should be waived from the allowances that residents doctors getting in Mumbai. Furthermore, hostel facilities needs to be improved by the government. Resident doctors putting in long hours of work in hospitals need better facilities.” Dr Sachin, resident doctor and general secretary of MARD at IGGMCH said Friday’s strike was in support of the call given by Central MARD. “The call has been given as the government failed to fulfil the promises it made to the resident doctors, including the Covid stipend and other commitments. All emergency services would be stopped if our demands are not met immediately by the state government.” Dr Surbhi Nikam, another resident doctor said they had three demands, including waiver of tuition fees for postgraduate medical students as they have suffered on the academic front due to additional burden while performing Covid duties, Covid incentives (Covid allowance) which was promised by the government for the duties which they performed amid the pandemic, and better hostel facilities at government-run medical colleges, which are in a “very poor condition at present”. Resident doctors carried placards with messages like “No service without justice”, “No action, only promises”, “More than praise, we need a raise” during the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/resident-doctors-commence-strike-threaten-to-stop-emergency-services/articleshow/86683754.cms||Ranjit Deshmukh

Theur ranks among the famous ‘Ashtavinayak’ Ganapati temples and draws devotees from across the state in large numbers. With the government giving its clearance to reopening of places of worship from October 7, the authorities are expecting a much heavier crowd to visit the temple and this may cause further trouble and pose risk of accidents. The road stretch is also a key thoroughfare for the locals and industrial vehicles coming from Daund and going towards Shirur and Khed. However, differences between the public work department (PWD) and a group of farmers over the compensation for plots acquired for road widening have stalled the work. The Bombay high court also directed a stay order in the matter on March 31, a PWD official said. Atul Chavan, the PWD’s superintending engineer for Pune circle, told TOI, “Farmers’ opposition has hampered the road construction work. We conducted several rounds of the meeting with them to address their concerns, including compensation. We are again going to talk on the matter soon.” The PWD is constructing a 17km stretch from Theur Phata on Pune-Solapur highway to Lonikand phata on Pune-Ahmednagar highway. The road is 10m wide and has two lanes. Satyashil Nagrare, the PWD deputy engineer, said the project was crucial for locals as well as industrial transport. “We could not initiate the work in view of the court order. We inspected the stretch two days ago. It has developed several craters and big potholes. We have put across the fact in the court application. We are waiting for the next hearing in the court to address this concern,” he added. He also claimed that minor repair works had been carried out on the thoroughfare in the recent past but it is not enough considering a daily commute on it. “Since the temple is going reopen from the next month, it is going to be difficult for the devotees to travel to the temple town. We are in contact with the local politicians to resolve the crisis,” said Nagrare. Sunny Kalbhor, a zilla parishad member of the Loniklabhor and Theur group, said, “We have been trying to convince the farmers for the past few months. The road work is necessary considering the safety of the people and devotees. We are going to take up this issue with the district administration as well. The compensation issue is the key for the farmers.” The local farmers claimed that they had not opposed to the repair or construction of the existing road. “If they want to widen the road, the government should give compensation as per the rules,” a farmer said. Sandeep Kunjir, a farmer, claimed that eight acres of his agricultural land would go in the road widening work. “I will become landless in the process. I had approached the PWD officials and demanded compensation for eight acres of land. But they did not give me any definite response. Similar is the case with many other farmers” he said. Farmers in the village claimed that the widening work will need at least additional 28 to 30 acres of additional land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-5km-stretch-to-theur-shrine-a-nightmare-for-motorists/articleshow/86662444.cms||Sandip Dighe

Earlier, the procurement was to start from October 1 and the Centre had fully responded to the request of the Punjab government to allow procurement of up to 191 lakh metric tonne paddy. In a communication on Thursday to food, civil supplies and consumer affairs secretaries of Punjab and Haryana, the Union ministry of consumer affairs wrote that since maturity of paddy has been delayed as the moisture content is beyond permissible limit, it has been decided that the procurement of paddy under MSP would commence from October 11 in Punjab and Haryana so as to accept paddy stocks as per FAQs specifications. The Centre claimed that this move is in the “best interests of farmers” and to avoid any inconvenience to them. The Punjab government and farm groups have vehemently criticised the decision. Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene and direct the Union consumer affairs, food and public distribution ministry not to defer the procurement as everything has been finalised and the state government is ready to start operations from Friday itself. Farm organisation BKU Ekta Ugrahan general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said Centre was just trying to harass farmers. “Now when farmers wanted to bring crop to mandis, the Central government has deferred it just to teach them farmers a lesson. We will not tolerate it as farmers have already suffered losses in cotton crop and do not want it in paddy as well,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/paddy-procurement-delayed-by-10-days/articleshow/86664797.cms||Neel Kamal

---||Goa||Goa: Soon, get email notifications for land partition requests||PANAJI: The revenue department’s online property register with details of government and private land in the state. including ownership, zone classification and disputes is ready to go live. The online public database will bring all land data under one digital roof, allowing prospective buyers and property owners to do their own due diligence. In a bid to reduce fraud in property transactions, the government has also created a system to notify individuals every time someone applies for partition of a plot in a particular village. The directorate of settlement and land records will inform subscribers through an email, if any application for partition is received. This, said revenue secretary Sanjay Kumar, will enable Persons of Indian Origin and overseas Goans to keep tabs if any move is made on their property. Prior to this, public notices would be issued through local newspapers or authorities would request for the address of other stakeholders from the property seller itself. In the case of fraudulent transactions, the seller would give false addresses of neighbours or leave out the names of those who have a share in the property, especially if the person stays abroad. The government has already begun work on a property register with details of government and private land in Goa. The register will include data about ownership, zone classification, encumbrances, legal rights, mortgage and lease information. Details like court orders and disputes will also be included in the register aimed at bringing all land data under one digital roof. Last November, the revenue department has notified draft rules for the government’s property register which will assign a unique identification number to each property. All government departments will have access to the property registrar so that data about the property can be updated as and when required. The state department of settlement and land records will remain the custodian of the property register and will integrate the database with other government departments, local governing bodies or other agencies so that realtime property information can be provided, said government officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-get-email-notifications-for-land-partition-requests/articleshow/86664906.cms||Newton Sequeira

The rape survivor had earlier stated that the IAF doctors had made her relieve the trauma of being raped when they performed the two-finger test on her. NCW said it was disappointed at the turn of the events and strongly condemned the action of the IAF doctors, who violated both the Supreme Court order and the victim’s right to privacy and dignity. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma has written to Air Chief Marshal, IAF, to look into the matter and take necessary steps, besides creating awareness among the IAF doctors about the guidelines laid down by the government and the Indian Council of Medical Research in 2014, terming the two-finger test unscientific.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan HC takes up ‘stink’ raised by Jaipur’s blocked sewage system||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan high court has taken suo motu cognizance of a report published by the city edition of The Times of India on September 23 about choked sewer lines neglected by both the municipal corporations. Notices have been issued to chief secretary, principal secretary of the local self-government department, and CEOs of Jaipur municipal corporations, greater and heritage. The officials have been asked to reply within four weeks. The report titled, ‘City’s overflowing gutters, choked sewer lines give locals ‘stinky’ time’, revealed problems faced by residents because of poor maintenance by local bodies. The order issued by the registrar (judicial) states that the chief justice has taken suo motu cognizance of the news and verbally directed to register a PIL. According to officials of municipal bodies, this situation will not change unless decades-old sewer lines are replaced in tune with population growth. But the huge investment required for such an overhaul is not possible for the already cash-strapped corporations. ‘Working of municipal corporations in shambles’Advocate Prateek Kasliwal of the high court, who has been made amicus curiae in this case, said that this was the need of the hour. “The working of municipal corporations is in shambles. In the time of pandemic, when people are worried about their health, such reports show the true picture of the city's civic condition. The government needs to focus on this. It doesn’t matter if the cost of changing these sewer lines is high, it has to be done because the population is increasing every year.” When TOI contacted Ramprasad Sharma, councillor of Ward 125 who had complained about the sewer lines, he said they were still choked. “The lines are still choked and stinking. I have contacted all the officials but nobody has had the time to look at this issue. I am answerable to the public. These sewer lines are around 50 years old and were put in place when the housing board was created. This is a serious issue which should be taken on priority,” Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-takes-up-stink-raised-by-citys-blocked-sewage-system/articleshow/86664872.cms||---

The flowers have been spotted in the hills of Alankupara which is part of Chakkikavu hills near Elaveezhapoonchira in Kottayam district. Earlier, the flowering of neelakurinji (strobilanthes Kunthiana) was also spotted at the Alumkappara hills near Moolamattam in Thodupuzha. The area lies along the border between Kottayam-Idukki districts and close to Elaveezhapoonchira. “Neelakurinji, which blooms once in 12 years, is considered the pride of Munnar hills. Now it presents the chances of it spreading to the hills bordering with Kottayam district too,” said officials. Alunkapara is at an altitude of 900 metres high and it can be accessed through difficult terrain from Choondikulam Nirappu on Mechal route from Chakkikavu. Pala St Thomas College botany department professor and neelakurinji expert Jomy Augustine told TOI that normally neelakurinji blossom in areas at an altitude of 1,200 meters. "The height of the hills where now neelakurinji flowers were found is only 800 to 900 meters. It is for the first time neelakurinji is found blossoming in such low lying areas. I will visit the area and conduct a detailed study within two days," said Augustine. “We need to conduct more study in the area. If the flowers cover the entire hill, then the area should be protected," said Eravikulam national park assistant and wildlife warden Job J Neriamparampil. It was a Class IX student and a local resident Kozhimalakkunnel Rahul who took the photograph of neelakurinji at Alunkapara that caught the public's attention.In July, isolated flowering of neelakurinji was witnessed at Shalomkunnu, Kizhakkathi and Puttady hills under Shantanpara panchayats in Idukki. In the past year Pushpakandam Anakkara Mettu hills in the Western Ghats bordering Tamil Nadu and Puttady near Munnar have witnessed isolated flowering of neelakurinji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/neelakurinji-springs-a-surprise-blooms-in-lower-hill-ranges/articleshow/86662679.cms||Sandeep Thomas

In September 2017, the total monthly rainfall recorded was 603.2mm, and in September 2019, 1,115.7mm. The rainfall recorded this September was more than double of the month’s normal average rainfall of 327.1mm. In comparison, August saw below normal average monthly rainfall, while the months of June and July recorded normal rain activity (see box). Also for the third monsoon in a row, the city reported over 3,000mm of rainfall—3,163.5mm till September 30—and the seasonal excess for 2021 at 43%. This monsoon, Mumbaikars witnessed three extremely heavy rain days—June 9-10 (231.3mm), July 16-17 (253.3mm) and July 18-19 (235mm). The India Meteorological Department (IMD) considers rainfall of more than 204.5mm in 24 hours as extremely heavy. Officials said that there is still time for the withdrawal of monsoon over the city—the normal withdrawal date is October 8—and moderate rain spells can be expected in the coming days. However, the depression over northeast Arabian Sea off the Gujarat coast, which is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm, is likely to continue to move west-north westwards towards Pakistan–Makran coasts, moving away from the Indian coast. “The system will not hit the Indian Coast,” said the IMD. As the rainy season is coming to a close, the seven lakes that supply water to Mumbai have 100% water stocks, keeping water cut concern at bay. On Thursday, the total water stock stood at nearly 14.3 lakh million litres (98.8% of the required quantum). The total required water stock is 14.5 lakh million litres by October 1 for the city to go without a water cut for the rest of the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-witnesses-its-2nd-wettest-sept-in-4-years/articleshow/86664929.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Jaipur||BJP wants CBI inquiry on REET, resignation of minister Rajasthan education minister Govind Singh Dotasra||JAIPUR: Opposition BJP on Thursday demanded a CBI inquiry and resignation of state school education minister Govind Singh Dotasra over the alleged irregularities during the REET recruitment exam conducted last Sunday. Party state president Satish Poonia said that Dotasra should either resign on moral grounds or CM Ashok Gehlot should sack him. Pictures of a key accused, arrested for cheating, seen with Dotasra at the PCC office were widely shared on social media on Thursday. “Prior to the exam, the state government went ga ga over the arrangements made for the exam. The way it was conducted actually betrayed nearly 25 lakh youth who appeared for it. We don't believe that state government agencies can conduct a fair investigation. Thus, I demand a CBI inquiry into the matter,” Poonia said during a presser at the BJP headquarters. The prime accused in leaking the REET exam paper, Batti Lal Meena, has been seen with Dotasra in photographs and with Congress symbol and national leaders of the party in posters, he alleged. “He is a registered worker of the Congress party. Now, Dotasra should either tender his resignation over irregularities on moral grounds or Chief Minister Gehlot should sack him,” he added. Mocking the lofty claims made by the state government for the exam, Punia said, “We have seen the invention of bluetooth-enabled slippers during the exam. This has been done by the state government under the guidance of 'scientist' Rahul Gandhi.” Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria also demanded the removal of Dotasra in a video tweet. “The prime accused is seen in many photographs at the PCC office with PCC president Dotasra. Chief minister should immediately remove him,” he said. Former chief minister Vasundhara Raje also hit out at the government over the irregularities and alleged that jobs were being auctioned by the Congress government. “It is not only about REET, scams have come to the fore during JEN, RAS and SI examinations also. Now, it has been proved that jobs are being auctioned by the Congress government,” she alleged. “It is now clear that there was only cheating in the name of transparency for REET. Even after this, the government is not accepting cheating and rigging and, on the contrary, is trying to put the stamp of truth on it,” Raje said in a statement. Earlier, Poonia also lambasted the state government for betraying farmers. “At least 60 lakh farmers are waiting for a loan waiver of Rs 1.83 lakh crore which the Congress party had promised in its manifesto. On December 17, the government will complete three years and they have absolutely betrayed the farmers,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-wants-cbiinquiry-on-reet-resignation-ofminister-dotasra/articleshow/86664921.cms||---

The Aurangabad city police are already probing an offence related to issuing of certificates without vaccination. The police suspect that the latest incident is the result of a similar modus operandi. An officer privy to the latest complaint said the matter came to light after the woman received three text messages informing that she has been vaccinated. The messages asked her to click on the link to access the certificates. As the woman and her family members were done with their vaccination, she was surprised to receive messages afresh. On clicking the links provided in the text messages, she found that the vaccination certificates were issued to three men from the Khari primary health centre in Ramban district of Jammu and Kashmir. Stunned by the fact that she had not received any OTP to confirm her credentials at the time of registering her name against the three certificates in J&K, she immediately informed about it to her husband, who contacted the police control room.The couple lodged a written complaint with the Begumpura and the Cyber police stations. Officers privy to the probe said the Aurangabad city police had already in an earlier offence of issuing certificates without vaccination sent letters to the district collector as well as the health director headquartered in Pune. When contacted, Begumpura police station inspector Prashant Potdar said access to the Covid app’s server was important tp achieve a breakthrough in any of the registered cases earlier or the fresh complaints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-cops-probe-covid-certs-issued-from-jk/articleshow/86657077.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Pune||Registration dept prepares draft to manage data||Pune: The state registration department has prepared a draft data management policy to monitor and secure over 250 terabyte of its electronic and digital data uploaded on the cloud. Earlier, physical documents were preserved by the department. With the large-scale shifting of physical data to the cloud, it has become imperative for the department to secure it, department officials said. State IGR Shravan Hardikar said the data management policy would provide clear guidelines on how much data should be made available to the public, what is to be shared freely and how to keep it secured. “With the department rapidly moving to preserving records in electronic and digital form, we ought to have a policy to govern and manage the data. Moreover, many departments need data from us and there should be a policy on its sharing, protection and privacy. Data is currently shared in a fragmented manner,” Hardikar said. The department keeps the Ready Reckoner (RR) rates of each area. With this, developers’ bodies also need the areawise data. So, for all this, how much data can be shared needs to be spelt out, the officials said. The draft policy is currently on the state registration website and would be put out for a month for suggestions and objections. It would then be assessed by the Project Implementation Committee (PIC) under the additional chief secretary and various department heads, after which there would be financial allocation for implementation. The draft data policy was released last week. “We are seeking suggestions. Once it is cleared, the state finance department will allocate funds for steps to be taken to govern the data,” Hardikar said. Work on uploading data under way Currently, the state registration department has the records of the properties registered after 2001 under its eSearch domain. Work is on to upload the titles before 2001 for all the districts. The scanning and digitisation of the property documents registered between 1988 and 2001 too will be uploaded soon, the officials said. The department will commence digitising the records from 1988, the year when the ready reckoner-based registration of the properties began.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/registration-dept-prepares-draft-to-manage-data/articleshow/86662729.cms||Nisha Nambiar

He advised them to stop such activities, failing which he warned of exposing them in the public. “There are many senior leaders in Congress who themselves don’t do anything for the party and also don’t allow others to work for the party’s uplift. They only feed false information to the party leadership and thus mislead them over various matters,” Pacheco said while addressing mediapersons. To a query, he said he had many options before him if the senior partymen didn’t mend their ways. “I joined Congress by choice, and not by compulsion.” On the issue of Luizinho Faleiro’s exit from Congress to join Trinamool Congress (TMC), Pacheco said, “The Gandhi family had placed so much trust on him…If Luizinho Faleiro has become a familiar name in Goa, it is because of the Congress.” Reiterating his decision to contest on the Congress ticket, he said, “I joined Congress only after getting an assurance of a party ticket.” He also reiterated his stand that Congress shouldn’t have an alliance with other parties, when asked to comment on the latest remarks by Congress observer Dinesh Gundu Rao that the party was open to talks with other parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mickky-stop-misleading-party-brass/articleshow/86664980.cms||---

It needs more money for providing services such as water, electricity, roads and education in comparison to other states.” Gehlot also demanded Centre’s support for investments to develop a petrochemical region, medical devices park in Jodhpur, bulk pharma intake park in Kota and reviving government-run pharma company RDPL in Jaipur. “RDPL is a joint venture company which manufactured medicines, but it is closed.

R Vinumon, 36, an Athirampuzha native, was in an autorickshaw when he met with the accident. Footages from a couple of CCTV cameras in the town show the vehicle losing control and overturning around 12.10am.

---||Goa||New parties like frogs, display seasonal presence: Congress||MARGAO: South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha on Thursday, reacting to Luizinho Faleiro’s resignation from Congress and his joining Trinamool Congress (TMC), said that there was no need for party workers to feel bad about it as the new parties coming to Goa wouldn’t do any damage to Congress. “These parties like TMC are like frogs who show their seasonal presence and then go into hibernation. Let the leaders who wish to go, go. We don’t want leaders, we want voters,” he said. Stating that Faleiro, like himself, had demanded a change in leadership in Goa, Sardinha said the party’s decision to retain Girish Chodankar as president could be one of the reasons for Faleiro’s decision to quit the party. “That may be one of the reasons, but all people go because of selfish gains. Now we have to see that the party wins. We don’t care for individuals, we care for the party,” he said. Further, Sardinha criticised the central government over the refusal by some countries to accept Indians vaccinated with Covaxin. “Those who had gone to UK had to stay in quarantine for 10 days. I would once again remind the prime minister and the external affairs minister to get the vaccine approved by WHO and all developed countries. It is a shame for our scientists that after working and inventing the vaccine which had brought down the Covid-19 pandemic in this country and neighbouring countries, the government hasn’t been able to convince these countries to approve our vaccine,” he said. He further urged the government to expedite the payment of financial relief under the scheme formulated by the government for those who have been affected by the pandemic. He also urged the government to regularise the services of those who have been working in government departments for over five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-new-parties-like-frogs-display-seasonal-presence/articleshow/86665001.cms||---

---||Goa||Sawaikar: TMC’s entry won’t impact BJP’s prospects||Margao: BJP general secretary Narendra Sawaikar on Thursday said that the entry of Trinamool Congress (TMC) in Goa wouldn’t impact BJP’s prospects “at all” in the 2022 assembly elections, even as he dismissed with contempt claims by TMC that it would form the next government in Goa. “Every party has a right to come to Goa and contest elections here. But political parties who come to Goa (just before elections) and claim that they will establish their government in Goa are mocking Goans,” Sawaikar said while interacting with reporters on the sidelines of a function. He, however, said that Goans were wise enough to see through their gimmicks and would reject them. “The Goan electorate has shown their political wisdom in the past too (when new parties came to contest Goa elections). This time too, it would have no effect on Goans, and not at all on BJP,”he said. He further said that BJP wasn’t an election-oriented party as the party workers were engaged in working for the people throughout the year. “Our workers are always on the ground, always interacting with the people. BJP is a people-centric party,” he said. “We need 21 seats to gain a majority in the legislative assembly. So we definitely intend to win more than 22,” he said, adding the party’s immediate goal was to form its government in Goa for the third consecutive term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawaikar-tmcs-entry-wont-impact-bjps-prospects/articleshow/86665030.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The fraudster siphoned off money from the woman’s bank account by sending her QR codes, which she scanned. On Wednesday, the victim filed an FIR. A policeman said the complainant and her roommate wanted to sell their old fridge and posted an advertisement on an online platform. An unknown man agreed to the sale sent a QR code to the woman and requested her to scan it. “When she did so, she found that Rs 7,000 was transferred from her app,” the officer added. While she contacted the man and told him, he claimed that he had not received the money and sent another QR code. This action repeated itself seven times, as the woman did not suspect fraud immediately, leading to a loss of Rs 49,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/med-student-duped-of-rs-49k-in-qr-code-fraud/articleshow/86662808.cms||Mihir Tanksale

---||Trichy||10 get life-term for murder||Trichy: A Trichy court on Thursday awarded double life sentence to ten convicts in an eight-year old murder case. The III additional district judge awarded life imprisonment for M Rajamanickam, 28, A Sankar, 24, A Dharma alias Dharmaraj, 23, J Mohan alias Neelamegam, G Sambath alias Sambathkumar, 26, M Vadivel, 31, V Manivel, 28, M Prabhu, 24, J Mohanraj, 24 and J Jambulingam for murdering K Subban alias Balasubramanian, 60, of Ramji Nagar. The judge also imposed a fine of Rs5,000 each on the convicts. Failure of which will attract two more years of jail-term. The convicts were also sentenced to one more life-term for attempting to murder A Arumugam, 46 of Ramji Nagar. The judge ordered the convicts to undergo both the terms concurrently. Edamalaipattipudhur police investigated the case. The murder of Subban was the fallout of the enmity between the two groups over a trivial issue. On June 26, 2013, a five-member gang led by Malaivasan and four more people assaulted M Rajendran, 35 and vandalized his eatery besides damaging his mini-truck at Pirattiyur. The gang attacked him following a verbal duel between the supporters of Malaivasan and Rajendran. A case was also registered against them. The issue turned bigger when Rajendran’s younger brother Rajamanickam decided to take revenge on Malaivasan and his supporters. The ten-member gang rounded up Malaivasan’s supporters Subban and Arumugam near Periya Kothamangalam and attacked them with machete and wooden logs. While Subban died on the spot, Arumugam escaped with severe injuries. Edamalaipattipudhur police took up the case and arrested them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/10-get-life-term-for-murder/articleshow/86665026.cms||---
---||Trichy||ASI Trichy plans to include unique monuments in city’s list of protected||Trichy: As the Archaeological Survey of India’s (ASI) Trichy circle completes a year on October 1, it has disclosed long-term plans to form a heritage circuit in the city. Superintending archaeologist T Arun Raj told TOI that the circle also has solid plans to add unique unprotected monuments to the list of protected monuments and that they have embarked on a study to safeguard historical establishments in Trichy city which are facing the threat of encroachment. He said the proposed heritage circuit will include Mainguard gate, Clive House, Teppakulam, Town Hall and Rani Mangammal fort and the proposal will take shape once government offices functioning in Mangammal fort are relocated. Since street vendors encroach the space adjacent to the monuments, ASI has done replication of the sites to know how they look without encroachments. “Village-to-village study is planned where archaeologists will study the monuments in our circle for documentation. Exploration of extraordinary finds, if viable, will be considered,” Arun Raj said. He pointed out that reviving the district heritage committee involving government departments and archaeology enthusiasts will help promote lesser-known monuments. The committee will meet frequently to discuss solutions. “We have sensitised several departments including the judiciary to support our measures. We will improve the amenities at monuments through the coordination of stakeholders including the state tourism department to attract tourists,” he said. As around 68% of the protected monuments in the circle is in Pudukottai district, the unit is planning to set up an exclusive guide with maps to access the monuments there. ASI Trichy circle was carved out of Chennai circle for better maintenance of archaeological sites and monuments in central and south Tamil Nadu. In all, 162 monuments spread over 21 districts are under its control. Established amid Covid-19, the pandemic impacted the progress of the circle in several ways. The remote locality where the monuments belong to and jurisdiction of the approach facilities controlled by other stakeholders have made archaeologically rich monuments lesser-known. The circle has applied for a few excavation proposals to their higher-ups. It is trying to increase its online presence with a new website, social media handles and mobile application to fulfil their avowed objectives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/asi-trichy-plans-to-include-unique-monuments-in-citys-list-of-protected/articleshow/86665054.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Patna||Bihar gets 3% surplus rain this monsoon||PATNA: Bihar received 3% surplus rainfall in four-month-long monsoon season which concluded on Thursday. Last year, the state had received 25% above normal rainfall during the monsoon season from June to September. Though the state witnessed a whopping 52% below normal rainfall in September, the rainfall revived on the last day of the month on Thursday and the Met office has issued red alert for heavy to very heavy rainfall on Friday, followed by orange alert for Saturday and yellow alert for Sunday. A red alert stipulates that the authorities concerned should take necessary action with respect to expected extreme weather conditions. The orange alert, on the other hand, asks the authorities to be alert and yellow alert suggests them to be watchful for extreme weather conditions. Patna Meteorological Centre’s director Vivek Sinha said heavy rainfall was witnessed in neighbouring Jharkhand on Thursday and light to moderate rainfall occurred at a few places in south and central Bihar as well. “The ongoing rainy spell in the region is owing to a cyclonic circulation in Bay of Bengal in succession with recently departed cyclone Gulab. The circulation was situated over Jharkhand and adjoining Bihar and it is moving in westward direction. Though the entire state is expected to receive rainfall over the next three days, its intensity is expected to be comparatively higher in south, central and north-eastern parts,” Sinha told TOI. The all India weather bulletin issued by IMD on Thursday evening stated that a well-marked low-pressure area was lying over south Bihar and adjoining Jharkhand. The system and its remnants are very likely to move over Bihar and adjoining sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim during the next 3-4 days. Accordingly, a warning has been issued for heavy to very heavy rainfall with extremely heavy falls at isolated places over Bihar on Friday, heavy to very rainfall on Saturday and heavy rainfall on Sunday. Asked about the distribution of monsoon rainfall this year, Sinha said, “The rainfall in the first two months of monsoon season in Bihar was well distributed and bountiful owing to timely onset of rain-bearing winds supported by existing moisture level in the atmosphere. However, lull was observed in September and the statewide deficiency stood at 52%.” Southwest monsoon had entered Bihar through Purnia in north-eastern parts of the state on June 12, a day ahead of its schedule. The rain-bearing clouds had covered the entire state in the next 24 hours and light to moderate rainfall occurred across the state over the last three days. The entry of rain-bearing winds was quite impressive as the state received around 125% surplus rainfall in June, which came down to 19% by July 31, around 16% by August-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-gets-3-surplus-rain-this-monsoon/articleshow/86659457.cms||Piyush Tripathi

The victim was identified as Raju Jaiswal (52). The criminals smashed Jaiswal’s head with stone blocks and also stabbed him multiple times. Police have recovered a knife and stones from the spot. Stabbing wounds were found in the head and neck of Jaiswal. Patna City SDPO Amit Sharan said the incident occurred around 3pm. “The killers called up Jaiswal’s family members from the latter’s cellphone and sought ransom for his safe release. The call was made around half-an-hour after the murder. It seems the killers were known to Jaiswal. The murder was probably the fallout of a personal enmity. The killers later tried to give it a colour of kidnapping to misguide the family and police,” the SDPO said. He added Jaiswal’s family members and friends were quizzed. “Some suspects are being interrogated. There was no CCTV camera in the shop.

While the investigations are focussed on gathering evidence of the rape, the cops are also verifying the statements of the girl. Police officials said that some of her statements are contradictory. Also, investigations are on to find out if Bhatt and Jain knew each other. “The girl had initially said in her complaint that it was Jain who introduced her to Bhatt some months ago during some land deal case. She had claimed that Bhatt began meeting her and then raped her. But now it has emerged that she knew Bhatt through a common friend since last year,” a police official said. “Bhatt too has said that he knew the girl since last year and he has stuck to his statement that the physical relations between them were consensual,” the official added. The girl had stayed in Kanji Mokariya’s hotel last year during the lockdown. Mokariya is a friend of Bhatt. Interestingly, while the girl claimed that Jain introduced her to Bhatt, Jain has claimed in his letter to the state DGP that he doesn’t even know who Bhatt is. “The jigsaw puzzle will be solved when Jain is arrested. We are yet to get clues about his whereabouts,” the police said. The cops will take Bhatt to the girl’s flat on Friday to reconstruct the scene of crime. On September 19, the girl studying in a private university had accused Jain, who runs a CA firm, of molesting her by spiking her drink at a guest house. She said that Jain also came to her flat and raped her later. She had alleged that Bhatt also raped her and threatened her with dire consequences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cops-verifying-students-statements/articleshow/86659637.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Speaking about the elevation of Balbir Giri, Niranjani akhara secretary Ravindra Puri said, “An agreement has been reached, taking into confidence the seers of Prayagraj, the mahants, shrimahants and other akhara members at Haridwar.This has been done in keeping with the late mahant Narendra Giri’s wishes.” The formal announcement was made by Niranjani akhara acharya mahamandaleshwar Kailashanand Giri. Balbir Giri will be anointed as the mahant on October 5, the day Narendra Giri’s shodashi rites (held on the 16th day of a seer’s death) will be performed. “The new mahant will take care of day-to-day affairs and oversee routine activities while decision-making powers will rest with a five-member supervisory committee of the akhara secretaries,” Kailashanand Giri said. Reacting to allegations that Balbir Giri has a few cases registered against him, both Kailashanand Giri and Ravindra Puri said action would be taken if the allegations were found to be true. The CBI team in Haridwar for the investigation, in the meantime, visited a hotel on the Delhi-Haridwar highway where allegedly the “doctored video” of Narendra Giri referred to in his suicide note was shot. “The CBI team asked for CCTV footage of specific dates from the hotel staff,” a source told TOI. The team also raided Anand Giri’s ashram on the outskirts of Haridwar around 7pm on Wednesday evening and continued its search for electronic evidence till 3am on Thursday. The ashram staff was interrogated. Here, too, the CBI was looking for a video that Anand Giri had allegedly used to blackmail Narendra Giri. Sources said that some members of the CBI team have left for Prayagraj while others have stayed on in Haridwar to question those Narendra Giri had spoken to on the phone the day he allegedly killed himself by hanging. “Narendra Giri had called 18 people and received 17 calls that day,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/balbir-giri-is-mahant-narendra-giris-successor-confirms-niranjani-akhara/articleshow/86660142.cms||---
---||Goa||Unable to provide security outside: Supermarket owners||Panaji: An episode of queue jumping at a supermarket in Old Goa earlier this month led to a chain of events with the unfortunate attack on a customer and his eventual demise on Wednesday, following which the alleged attacker has gone missing. This has thrown a sharp focus on consumer safety and the issue of ‘road rage’ that prevails inside shopping outlets. Kirit Maganlal, director of Magsons chain of supercenters across Goa said that such customers must be shown the mirror. “Those that get into such a rage have some baggage that should’ve been nipped in the bud when it was happening earlier in other incidents. We cannot always ban such people because we have had instances wherein certain customers are stopped from entering and they have assaulted the security guard or staff,” he added. Anil Pereira, director of Delfino’s supermarkets said that the entire incident is shocking. “Something like this is really unexpected which only perhaps a maniac would do. You can raise your voice but not your hand, just because your bloated ego is punctured. Within the premises, a supermarket’s management can stop a fight or argument between customers but beyond the property we cannot anticipate such incidents to give security outside,” Pereira said. “The entire incident could’ve been easily avoided if the person had a little patience and waited in the queue. Instead, he followed the fellow customer and attacked him in the parking lot, so it was not a reactionary move inside the premises. The police should’ve taken this seriously when it was reported and registered it as attempt to murder,” said another prominent supermarket owner. The Goa Consumer Action Network said that the incident is a wake-up call for service providers and consumers in the state. “Like ‘road rage’ where road users are aware of the fallouts, supermarkets and malls need to prepare for such eventualities. Planned opening of counters, barricades so that consumers cannot jump the queue, token system, warning signage with helpline numbers and functioning CCTV cameras are some steps that can be introduced.” said Goacan coordinator, Roland Martins. A 54-year-old man, Joseph Dias, died after he was assaulted at a supermarket in Old Goa, over an argument on jumping the queue. The assailant, Gajanan Pawar, is untraceable. The incident occurred earlier this month, when Joseph was shopping at the mart with wife Caroline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unable-to-provide-security-outside-supermarket-owners/articleshow/86665092.cms||---

It made the observation that the conviction by the CBI court “is less likely to be sustained” and Solanki’s “false implication in the case cannot be ruled out”. While suspending Solanki’s sentence, the bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay and Justice A C Joshi said that the case was based on circumstantial evidence and Solanki’s conviction recorded by the CBI court is “principally based on assumptions and presumptions and the same is ex-facie unsustainable qua the applicant. The sentence imposed on the applicant therefore needs to be suspended”. The high court said, “…This court finds prima facie that the conviction recorded by the CBI court is ex-facie erroneous and unsustainable, qua the present applicant.” The judges further said, “We do not find any chain of evidence having been established, leading to conclusion that in all probability the crime was committed by the applicant. We further find that the circumstantial evidences in this case not only leads to many other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused, even false implication of the applicant cannot be ruled out.” The court cited a witness who had deposed that the real issue was a fight between two political parties — the Congress and the BJP. The HC, however, declined to stretch further the issue of political motive and asserted that Solanki’s conviction under sections 302 and 120B of the IPC is less likely to be sustained. The high court ordered Solanki to be released forthwith on his furnishing Rs 1 lakh bond and equal amount of surety. Solanki has been asked to deposit his passport with the court. In 2019, a special CBI court in Ahmedabad sentenced Solanki and six others to life imprisonment for Jethava’s murder in July 2010 in front of the high court’s campus. After a couple of changes in probe agencies of Gujarat police, the investigation was transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) by the high court. The trial was mired in controversies. As many as 105 witnesses had turned hostile out of over 190 examined by the CBI court. The allegations of pressurising witnesses led the HC to order a fresh trial in the case. But the Supreme Court modified the HC order and directed for re-examination of main 24 witnesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-suspends-ex-mps-sentence-grants-bail/articleshow/86662894.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Anand Shandaliya taken to golf course where he hatched plan to extort Jaipur based builder||JAIPUR: Police on Thursday took Anand Shandliya to a golf course for spot verification after he admitted during interrogation that the plan to demand money from a city-based builder was plotted there. Besides spot-verification, Adarsh Nagar police also opened Shandaliya’s history sheet. “He comes under the category of what we classify as hardcore criminals. We have set up his history sheet because he has been involved in multiple criminal cases,” an official said, adding that Adarsh Nagar police station has been instructed to keep him under a close vigil. Shandaliya was arrested on Sunday for allegedly helping out the Lawrence Bishnoi gang in making threat calls demanding money from a Jawahar Nagar-based builder on September 7. During the interrogation, the accused said the entire scheme was plotted in a golf course. Besides his latest involvement with Bishnoi, Shandaliya’s name first cropped up in the Himmat Singh murder case in Vidhyadhar Nagar back in 2015. He was subsequently arrested in 2017 for being one of the ringleaders of a rape-extortion racket that netted the city’s leading hair transplant doctor. He was sent to Ajmer high-security jail where he warmed up to Lawrence Bishnoi who was lodged in the same prison for a different case. Police suspect that Subash Baral, alias Subash Mund, another henchman of slain gangster Anandpal Singh and a co-accused in the case, had spoken to Shandaliya in the same golf course. “Investigation into the case is underway. We are looking for Mund as he is absconding,” said the official. Bishnoi and his aide Sampat Nehra have already been brought to Jaipur on a production warrant for the same case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/shandaliya-taken-to-golf-course-where-he-hatched-plan-to-extort-bldr/articleshow/86665083.cms||---
---||Goa||Prashant Kishor played key role in me joining TMC, says Luizinho Faleiro||PANAJI: Political strategist Prashant Kishor and his group played a key role in former Goa chief minister and veteran Congressman Luizinho Faleiro’s decision to join Trinamool Congress (TMC). “It is a fact I never met the TMC leaders. I met I-PAC (Kishor’s organisation). I met Prashant Kishor just before I took the decision. We had an interaction and it was a very difficult decision for me to leave Congress,” Faleiro said here on Thursday. Faleiro’s comment that he was personally approached by Kishor before he joined TMC is interesting given that the poll strategist has been in talks with Congress about joining the party. While Congress has not announced either way on the issue, Faleiro’s comment raises the question if Kishor is personally approaching Congress leaders to cross over to other parties. It is to be seen if Congress clarifies whether talks with Kishor have fallen through or are on track. Faleiro with eight others joined TMC in Kolkata on Wednesday. Faleiro claimed that prior to meeting West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and joining TMC, he and his supporters did not meet any of its leaders camping in Goa. TMC MPs Derek O’Brien and Prasun Banerjee have been in Goa for nearly a week. “I felt in the interest of Goa and to defeat BJP, this was the only way to go ahead. Today, politics is a science and I-PAC are wizards as far as politics is concerned,” he said. Faleiro said I-PAC, which is currently carrying out a door-to-door survey in every constituency in Goa trying to get the pulse of the voters, will also prepare the roadmap for TMC’s plunge into the 2022 Goa assembly elections. “I hope that in the next 10-15 days, we will have the details so that we can prepare a roadmap, a plan so that we can work in every taluka, every constituency,” said Faleiro. Though Faleiro has been known to share close ties with the Gandhi family, it did not stop the former Navelim MLA from taking potshots at his former high command. “The tallest leader in the Congress family is Didi... I have never seen such humility, such simplicity and such sincerity. Didi said that there is no high command,” Faleiro said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kishor-played-key-role-in-me-joining-tmc-says-faleiro/articleshow/86665070.cms||---

A hunt is on for the man’s younger son in connection with the incident.The accused was identified as Soundarrajan, 57, of Vettikadu near Orathanadu, and his two sons S Mathiazhagan, 37, and S Arivazhagan, 27. They run an eatery along with a tea shop and a grocery shop at Vettikadu . Since the hotel is located on the main road, it used to be crowded with customers without face masks and not maintaining social distancing. Orathanadu revenue inspector Mahalakshmi visited the hotel along with health department staff and on finding the violation of SOPs warned those who gathered there and also slapped fines on some of them. An irate Soundarrajan threatened the officials using abusive words. When the officials tried to record the incident on a mobile phone, they allegedly attempted to assault the officials, police said. With Mahalakshmi lodging a complaint against the man and his sons, police arrested Soundarrajan and Mathiazhagan and was looking for Arivazhagan.

---||Trichy||Report steps to check sewage being let into Trichy canal: NGT||Trichy: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed Trichy Corporation and the district administration to submit progress reports to the tribunal once in six months on the measures taken to plug sewage discharge into the Uyyakondan canal passing through the city. The NGT had taken up the case suo motu in July 2020 based on a newspaper report highlighting the pollution in the 1,000-year-old Chola era irrigation canal, which benefits farmers in Trichy and Thanjavur districts.The tribunal had appointed a committee comprising senior officials from the revenue department, TNPCB, PWD and Trichy Corporation to inspect the canal and initiate permanent corrective measures to protect it. The committee conducted inspections in the 8-km stretch passing through the city several times in the past year. To prevent wastewater from entering the canal at around 36 points, the urban local body has proposed UGD project (phase II) under the AMRUT scheme and Smart Cities Mission, the corporation informed the tribunal.The corporation also proposed to revamp the 30-year-old underground sewage in the Uyyakondan area, after which, the civic body assured the tribunal that no sewage will enter the canal. The tribunal was also informed that 163 connections letting water to Uyyakondan were closed. While Trichy MGMGH was letting treated wastewater to the canal, the civic body informed that a proposal was chalked out to connect MGMGH’s wastewater output to the city’s UGD network at a cost of Rs 94.60 lakh.“Since all the solutions are in the proposal stage, authorities must do a timely follow up as assured,” D Manoj, member, Citizen for Uyyakondan civic group, said. To prevent dumping of solid waste into the canal, Trichy Corporation has proposed to install CCTV cameras at six locations.TNPCB, which collected water samples for tests, has found the presence of E Coli bacteria in the water, signaling the presence of sewage in the water. Of the 14 locations, water samples were collected, TNPCB’s test revealed that the dissolved oxygen level was between 1.3 mg/L and 4 mg/L, while the permissible level as per TNPCB standards for drinking and bathing is above 6 mg/L and 5 mg/L. This means that the water is neither fit for drinking nor for bathing.Over the months, after receiving several status reports, NGT passed an order on September 13 directing the TNPCB to conduct periodical inspections, while PWD was told to ensure the flow of water to ayacut. NGT also ordered Trichy Corporation to submit periodical status reports on the UGD network plan and proposals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/report-steps-to-check-sewage-being-let-into-trichy-canal-ngt/articleshow/86665066.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Pune||New water pipelines, motors to boost supply in Dhayari, Raikar Mala||Pune: Over 50,000 residents from the Dhayari and Raikar Mala areas off Sinhagad Road are set to receive water supply at a much improved pressure. This became possible, as the crucial work of laying pipelines in the 5km stretch and installation of high power motors to lift water to the overhead tanks was completed recently. Local corporators said the improved infrastructure would fill the tanks and distribute water in less time. The tests of the new infrastructure were underway. Local residents had complained of water shortage and sought urgent solutions. The civic administration had done temporary arrangements to augment water availability, till the infrastructure works were completed. Ashwini Pokale, a local corporator, said, “We followed up the issue with the civic administration, as the residents were facing hardships due to shortage of water and also supply at low pressure. We hope that with the laying of the new pipelines and installation of the high-capacity water motors, the taps at individual homes and housing societies will get water at adequate pressure”. The entire area receives water every alternate day. The residents supply of water at more pressure would be a big relief. Ajay Tatkare, a local resident said, “We had approached the corporators after the water shortage was getting critical. In fact, our area is close to the Khadakwasla dam that supplies water to the entire city. Ironically, water supply to our area was frequently disrupted.” Sanjay Wadekar, another resident, said the demand for water has gone up with many residential projects coming up in the area in the past few years. He said, “The Pune Municipal Corporation should make adequate arrangements to meet the increasing demand for water. There should be a plan to supply water on a daily basis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-water-pipelines-motors-to-boost-supply-in-dhayari-raikar-mala/articleshow/86662842.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Pune||Pune: 15 succumb to dengue in last 3 months; 20 critical||PUNE: As many as 15 patients have succumbed to dengue fever-induced complications at different city hospitals in the last three months. Tests confirmed that all of them were suffering from dengue fever and associated complications, officials of various hospitals told TOI. Currently, the condition of another 20 patients with severe dengue is critical and they are undergoing aggressive treatment at various intensive care units (ICUs). Health activists in the city have demanded that the Pune Municipal Corporation or the state government should compensate the hospitalisation charges and also grant a sizeable amount towards compensation to those who lost their kin to dengue as a result of the “collective failure” in preventing and containing mosquito menace across the state. The activists also criticised the health officials of the Pune Municipal Corporation for “covering up” the dengue casualties in the city on the ground that these cannot be confirmed as dengue deaths unless audited by its expert committee. Sanjeev Wavare, head of the PMC’s insect control department, said, “As per our records, only one dengue-associated death has taken place in the city this monsoon in the last three months.” As per the norms, the expert committee of the PMC audits the deaths and confirm whether these people have died of dengue fever-induced complications or they had some other underlying medical conditions, Wavare said. However, authorities at Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, Sahyadri hospital, Ruby Hall Clinic, Jehangir hospital, and KEM hospital confirmed to have collectively recorded 15 dengue fever-induced casualties in the last three months. Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital’s chief intensivist Prasad Rajhans said, “We have recorded 327 dengue cases and five deaths due to dengue between June 1 and September 25 this year.” Barring one death that took place in June, the remaining four deaths occurred on August 19 and August 25. The other two deaths occurred this month on September 1 and September 9, Rajhans said. Sahyadri hospital’s chief executive officer Abrarali Dalal said, “We have recorded a total of 762 confirmed dengue cases and seven dengue deaths in the last three months.” KEM hospital's physician and intensivist Rajesh Gadia said, “We have recorded one death due to dengue recently.” Chintamani hospital in Bibwewadi registered a dengue casualty on July 26 this year of an 83-year-old man. “He had other co-morbid conditions,” said hospital’s critical care expert Sachin Yadav. Vishwaraj hospital registered a dengue casualty on July 27. “A 22-year-old man, a resident of Bopgaon village in Purandar taluka, died of dengue-associated complications in seven days of hospitalisation. His platelet count had dropped terribly low,” said Borawake, chief intensivist at Vishwaraj hospital. “As per the civic body’s records, only one resident succumbed to dengue fever-induced complications when a sizeable number of citizens have succumbed to dengue or many are hospitalised and are undergoing ICU care. Prevention and mitigation of communicable diseases are the mandatory duties of the health officials. They have failed in carrying out this basic duty,” said health activist Sanjay Dabhade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/15-succumb-to-dengue-in-last-3-months-20-critical/articleshow/86662873.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Allahabad||If AAP comes to power in UP, we will allocate 25% budget for education: Sisodia||Prayagraj: Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and deputy chief minister of Delhi, Manish Sisodia, has said that if the Aam Aadmi Party comes to power in UP in the next assembly elections, it would allocate 25% budget for education. Sisodia arrived in Prayagraj on Thursday to meet the intellectuals of the city and discuss ‘UP Ki Shiksha Ki Baat’ (conversations about education in UP). “If the people of UP vote for us, we will provide them with a better education system,” he said. Sisodia was of the view that “AAP has emerged as a better option” for the people of Uttar Pradesh who are always concerned about the need of a proper education system in the state. He accused the BJP-led state government for reducing the education budget from 17% to 13%. “Due to this, the education system in UP is in a shambles,” he said. Sisodia also alleged that about 40% of UP schools do not have power supply and most of the school buildings are in a dilapidated state. He said, “If AAP forms its government in UP, we will immediately allocate 25% of the budget for education. Not only the government schools will become better spots for education, but all the vacant posts will also be filled without any delay.” He also promised that just like the initiative of the Delhi government, in UP also the teachers would be imparted training in foreign countries. Sisodia further said, “We will give 300 units of electricity free to all households once we win the UP elections. Besides, the AAP government will also bring better schemes of higher education for poor children.” “The standard of education in UP government schools is so abysmal that parents of 60% children were forced to send their wards to private schools. If we go five years back and look at the records, about 60% children were studying in government schools. But this has changed now,” he alleged. “Moreover, UP schools lack toilets which has adversely affected female teachers,” he added. “More than 1.25 lakh shiksha mitras are running from pillar to post to build their future in the education sector,” he said. Sisodia claimed that the AAP-led Delhi government has improved the education infrastructure in the national capital, and the condition of government schools was better than that of private schools. Many children who studied in Delhi government schools cleared NEET and many of them are studying in IITs, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/if-aap-comes-to-power-in-up-we-will-allocate-25-budget-for-education-sisodia/articleshow/86665098.cms||---

While Purna river and some other tributaries of Godavari river were overflowing due to discharge of water from both major irrigation projects, police authorities and respective district administrations had closed a few roads offering connectivity to Parbhani, Hingoli and Nanded districts. Authorities attached with the police control room at Parbhani said vehicular traffic between Parbhani and Basmat from Hingoli district was still halted by Thursday evening due to submerging of a bridge over Dudhna river. Among other major routes, traffic on Nanded-Aurangabad road, which was stopped post-midnight, was resumed by Thursday afternoon. Nanded district collector Dr Vipin Itankar said standing instructions have been issued to local authorities for closing vehicular traffic as and when bridges get submerged. “With heavy release of water from Jayakwadi dam and other irrigation projects, Godavari river and its tributaries are already flowing either at alert or danger levels. The public have been requested not to risk their lives by using submerged bridges,” he said. Barring Lower Dudhan major irrigation project in Parbhani, which is filled to the brim, all other 10 major irrigation projects were releasing water by Thursday morning, showed official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/road-connectivity-partially-restored-in-eastern-mwada/articleshow/86657160.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||After 23 years, Shivna river attains new highest flood level||Aurangabad: Shivna River, a tributary of the Godavari, that flows from Aurangabad district had attained the new Highest Flood Level (HFL) of 513.5 m at Lasur on September 28 due the recent spells of heavy rainfall. As per database of the Central Water Commission, the river had a previous HFL of 511.6 m — observed way back in 1998. Jaising Hire, assistant superintendent engineer with Command Area Development Authority of Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC), on Thursday said heavy release of water from Shivna-takali medium irrigation project coupled with incessant showers led to Shivna River attaining new HFL. “The positive shift of 1.9 m in HFL lasted only for a few hours before the water started receding,” he added. While Lasur area already witnessed evacuation of 52 people, one team of NDRF has been prepositioned in the vulnerable area anticipating more floods. Situated near Kannad taluka of Aurangabad district, Shivna-takali dam has gross storage capacity of 1.39 TMC, including live storage of 1.29 TMC. The reservoir is already overflowing due to the good run of monsoon during the first half of September. Parineeta Dandekar, associate coordinator at South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), said more such breaches of previous HFL of rivers is possible in Marathwada considering heavy release of water from Manjra and Majalgaon major irrigation projects. Marathwada, which has received 1020.5 mm rainfall since June 1, did not receive any major rainfall activity during the past 36 hours — ending Thursday evening. The lull in rainfall activity has eased out flood situation in many areas where rivers were in spate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/after-23-years-shivna-river-attains-new-highest-flood-level/articleshow/86657194.cms||---

The court nominated Shashi Prakash Singh, senior advocate, who is also assistant solicitor general of India (ASGI) as the chairman of the Elders’ Committee, while four senior advocates — NC Rajvanshi, TP Singh, OP Singh and Anil Tiwari — will be the members of the committee. Hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by one Santosh Kumar Mishra, former joint secretary of HCBA and four others, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Piyush Agrawal fixed November 15 as the next date of hearing in the case. The court said that on the next date, it would see the progress of the election and adherence of its order. In the PIL, the petitioners had challenged the nomination of the chairman of the elders’ committee of the HCBA. Passing the above directives, the court, however, made it clear that the Elders’ Committee has been constituted this time as an exception and it is only one time arrangement to resolve the issue. The court, while constituting the committee observed, “The matter was taken up by this court from time to time. The effort was made to get the issue resolved by the members of Bar themselves. A direction was given to organize a meeting in the presence of five members of each party. In pursuance to the direction aforesaid, a meeting was scheduled and held on September 21, 2021. The issue could not be resolved, thus, the matter again came up for consideration before this court.” The court finalized the schedule of the election and fixed October 18 for a meeting of the ‘General Body’ of the Bar and November 1 for publication of the voter list.

The feature on CoWin has gone live from Thursday, National Health Authority (NHA) chief executive officer Ram Sewak Sharma said. The certificate reflects a traveller’s date of birth and the other vaccination details. The certification is compliant with the WHO’s digital documentation of COVID-19 certificates vaccination status data dictionary Sharma told TOI, “We will add more such features. If there are specific requirements needed in the vaccination certificates for specific countries, we will format the certificate, according to advice from Te Ministry of External Affairs.” If a country requires the vaccination certificates of Indian travellers in a certain format, CoWIN will introduce a feature to incorporate it. “India too will then accept certificates of other countries’ travellers in the same format. Thus, the beneficiary details will be the same, only the format will change,” he said. International travellers can click on the ‘international travel certificate’ option appearing next to the registered beneficiary’s name after logging into his/her CoWIN account, enter the passport number and the date of birth on the page and submit the request, and download the updated version of the certificate. The new travel vaccination certificate will mention the date of birth, doses taken, vaccine name, type, manufacturer, number and dates of doses in the year, month and date, dose batch numbers and will mention that the certificate is compliant with WHO-DDCC:VS data dictionary. The new feature was based on the ongoing technical discussions between India and the UK to get the CoWIN vaccination certification recognised by the latter so that fully vaccinated Indians can have a quarantine free travel. “As borders open up to fully vaccinated travellers, countries have started the process of creating a common minimum standard of information required to recognise each others’ vaccination certificates. A few months ago, the passport number feature was added to CoWIN certificates and now the date of birth will be added. The latest version of the vaccination certificate is expected to further facilitate international travel for fully vaccinated Indians,” Nikhil Thakurdas, owner of Odyssey Tours and Travels, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cowin-certificate-with-date-of-birth-for-travel-abroad-rolls-out/articleshow/86662905.cms||Neha Madaan

According to civic health officials, these teams will destroy mosquito breeding spots and ensure water does not get accumulated on the premises of houses and private properties. They will also ensure regular spraying and fogging in the city. The NMC has already started slapping fines on erring citizens responsible for creation of mosquito breeding spots. During the last one month, 175 people have been fined and the NMC has collectively collected Rs 77,000 from them. According to senior health official Rajendra Trimbake, the number dengue and chikungunya cases reduced in the month of September as compared to the cases recorded in August after various measures undertaken by the civic administration. “But the recent bouts of rainfall have again led to accumulation of water in various parts of the city that may once again lead to rise in positive cases of dengue and chikungunya. Hence, we have undertaken several immediate measures to prevent such a situation,” he said. “The deployment of various teams is part of these measures,” he added. The city recorded 243 dengue cases in September, against 311 reported in August. The city has reported 164 positive cases of chikungunya in September, against a total of 209 cases in August. With fresh cases of dengue being reported, the total number of dengue cases in the city between January and September this year has increased to 828, while the total number of chikungunya cases reported during the same period this year has increased to 606.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-deploys-60-teams-to-curb-dengue-chikungunya-cases/articleshow/86657170.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Goa||Monsoon culminates on normal note for Goa||PANAJI: As monsoon drew to an official end on Thursday, the Indian subcontinent’s rainfall deficit, which was hovering around 10% at the end of August, has now decreased to 1%. This figure will likely crossover into the positive range in the next couple of days. If this happens, then it will be the third consecutive year with a positive rainfall anomaly, meteorologists said. “It may not be as much as 2019 or 2020, but sufficient to keep it on the positive side and also within the normal,” meteorologist and retired NIO scientist, M R Ramesh Kumar said. So far, Goa has received 3,154mm as compared to the normal rainfall of 2,976.5mm, an excess of 6%. This monsoon saw two convective systems, both in the month of September. One was a deep depression from September 12-15 and another a cyclone called Gulab from September 24-28, both forming in the Bay of Bengal and travelled along Central India. From September 1 to 29, the country as a whole received 33.9% excess rainfall, while the core monsoon zone or Central India region received 83% surplus, northwest India region 40%, and south peninsula region 25%. Only the east and northeast region received a deficit of 30%. This was in sharp contrast to the peak monsoon month of August, when the country as a whole received a deficit of 24%. “Another interesting fact is that the country had a third active spell from September 25 to 28,” Kumar said. There were three break spells on the other hand during the peak mid-monsoon months of July-August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/monsoon-culminates-on-normal-note-for-goa/articleshow/86665102.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Voters in Kolkata defeat Covid fears, score with second shot||KOLKATA: Whether they were 83-year-old or 20, most residents of Bhowanipore were confined to their homes on April 26, when their assembly constituency had gone to the polls, given the spike in Covid cases during the second wave of the pandemic. But the bypoll at the constituency gave them a second chance and many of the families could finally cast their votes on Thursday. Geeta Kapat (83), a resident of Abhay Sarkar Lane, was too scared to leave the safety of her home and queue up with scores of other people the last time voting was held in Bhowanipore. Her daughter, Sushmita Sengupta, said, “My mother was vaccinated even at that time. But considering her age and the Covid scare, we didn’t think it was safe for her to visit a booth at that time. But my mother had never missed voting earlier. So now, when things got better, and with more safety measures, she went to vote.” The mother and daughter cast their votes at Khalsa High School. Even Camac Street resident Umesh Kumar Tiwari could not muster the courage to visit a booth last time. By May, he received both the vaccine doses, and voted on Thursday. “It was scary last time as cases were rising fast. Two vaccine doses are like a helmet for a biker. Even if an accident happens, the damage will be less,” Tiwari said. But it was 69-year-old Jayati Dasgupta who stole the show by arriving at the St Helen’s School booth in an ambulance. Jayati, who lived in chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s neighbourhood, had last voted in 2016. In the following years, ailments and surgeries restricted her movement. Her daughter, Anita, said, “She had a hip surgery and two knee operations. She can’t walk without help. But this time she was insistent on voting. I had no option but to bring her in an ambulance.” Though the distance from Kalighat Potuapara to the school isn’t far, it took Anita a lot of efforts to bring her mother. “I couldn’t vote in the last elections. I have known Mamata (Banerjee) for long. She is contesting and I had to vote. Yes, it took some efforts, but I am happy I could come,” Jayati said. For Priyanka Nandi (20), an Asutosh College final-year undergraduate student, it was next to impossible to vote on April 26 as she had barely recovered from Covid during that time. But she voted on Thursday at St Helen’s School. “I felt bad that I could not vote the last last. But luck gave me a second chance,” she said. Twenty-one-year-old Devyani Popat was happy to vote for the first time in her life on Thursday. “My booth was at Adarsh Hindi High School. I was under isolation due to Covid in the family last time. But when a bypoll was announced for Bhowanipur, I was keen to vote.” Similar was the story of Anisha Saha (27), a New Alipore resident. “I could not vote for the assembly elections as I was recovering from Covid. But I am happy I got a second chance,” the private sector employee said, stepping out of Mitra Institution. Jatinder Kaur has moved to another part of the city after marriage but her voter card still has the Justice Dwarkanath Road address. She was also down with Covid on April 26. “I never expected another poll in five months but I did not miss the opportunity this time,” said Jatinder, whose booth was at Khalsa High.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/voters-defeat-covid-fears-score-with-second-shot/articleshow/86662944.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Delhi||Just a preview: Tentative lists before first cutoff hint at even higher scores in Delhi University||NEW DELHI: While the first cut-off list for admission to various merit-based undergraduate courses in Delhi University is scheduled to be released on Friday, a few colleges released tentative qualifying marks a day earlier, marginally higher than last year. Aryabhatta College, for one, parked its psychology (Honours) benchmark at 98.5% and those for economics (H) and BCom (H at 98%. This was a marginal increase from last year when the asking score for psychology (H) was 97 while that of BCom (H) was 97.5%. The cutoff for economics (H), however, remained static at 98%. Courses like English, history and political science at Aryabhatta also saw marginal increases in the cutoffs this year. While the eligibility for English (H) was set at 96% from 95% last year, the asking score for honours in history and political science this year are, respectively, 95% and 96%. Last year, the cutoff for history (H) in the first list was 94 and that for political science (H) 95. At the College of Vocational Studies, Thursday saw the cutoff for honours courses in economics and BCom being applied, respectively, at 97% for both the courses, which is a 0.5% increase from last year’s first-list benchmark score. At 96.5%, the eligibility for English (H) at the college remained the same as last year, but history (H) saw a small increase to 92.5%. Several college principals maintained that the cut-off marks were likely to soar this year due to a large number of students receiving very high marks in their class XII board examinations, assessed specially in the absence of written exams due to Covid-19. Gyantosh Jha, principal, Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, said, “There is bound to be an increase in the cutoffs due to students across boards performing better this year. We have analysed the data received and have found that among the applicants there are more than 50,000 CBSE students alone who have scored above 95%. Students from state boards have also performed well.” Stating that the qualifying scores decided by the colleges were directly connected to the various board results and the number of students applying, Promila Kumar, principal of Gargi College, said, “The cutoffs will definitely increase this year because the board results were better than in previous years. We have to move accordingly and decide the appropriate score bars.” DU’s admission process under the first list is set to begin from October 4 and will be completely online. Students are not required to visit colleges for any admission-related activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/just-a-preview-tentative-lists-before-first-cutoff-hint-at-even-higher-scores/articleshow/86663031.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Police still clueless how REET paper leaked despite net ban||JAIPUR: Days after claiming foolproof security arrangements for REET, police are now trying to ascertain how the question paper reached the accused before the exam in Sawai Madhopur. Police had arrested nine persons in the case, but don’t know yet who was the first to send the question paper despite suspension of mobile internet services and heavy security arrangements. Soon after Sunday’s REET, Sawai Madhopur police had arrested one Yaduveer Singh, a head constable, his wife Seema Gujjar, Devendra Singh, another constable and his wife Laxmi Gujjar, Ashish Meena, Usha Meena, Manisha Meena and Dilkhush Meena. Police later arrested Sanjay Meena (25) who had allegedly provided the question paper and shared it with others. The real source of the alleged leak remains elusive. Sources told TOI that REET papers were brought to Sawai Madhopur from Ajmer under strict surveillance and kept inside strong rooms which were guarded by armed police commandos. Question papers were then ferried to different centres in the district amidst heavy security bando bast. The REET question papers were guarded by armed police commandos round-the-clock. Despite tall claims of unprecedented security arrangements, Rajasthan police said they have to investigate as to who first got the question paper before passing it on to others. “Some more suspects are under the scanner and once they are arrested, only then it will become clear if the paper had indeed got leaked and if yet, who played what part,” an official said. While one RAS and two RPS officials posted in Sawai Madhopur were shunted after the administration and the police found lapses and irregularities, officials are tightlipped about the modus operandi of the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-still-clueless-how-reet-paper-leaked-despite-net-ban/articleshow/86665168.cms||---

At a meeting held on Thursday at the Sahyadri state guest house and attended by MPs, MLAs and local party leaders, Thackeray said the 90-acre land in Aarey Colony reserved for the rehabilitation of tribals and non-tribals has been found to be non-feasible for the purpose.

It was not included in the 807 acres of Aarey Colony declared to be protected as a reserved forest. A Bombay high court order has stayed all construction projects in Aarey Colony. The committee headed by Aaditya Thackeray will recommend alternatives for relocation of the tribals. The Slum Rehabilitation Authority has been entrusted the task of relocating the slum dwellers in various slum redevelopment schemes.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur Municipal Corporation allows physical classes for standard VIII-XII from October 4||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has finally allowed schools in the city to reopen and conduct physical classes for students of Std VIII to XII from October 4. Students will need parents’ consent while schoolteachers and staff will need to be fully vaccinated with two doses to be allowed into school. The schools have been shut for over 18 months due to the Covid-19 pandemic. NMC has made parents’ consent mandatory for sending their children to schools. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, while issuing the order on Thursday, asked school managements to ensure that both teaching and non-teaching staff have received two doses of Covid vaccine. On Thursday, TOI had reported NMC and collectorate had made both doses mandatory for staff and devotees at religious places too. The notification states that in case a school requires its staff to be vaccinated the concerned school management – especially principal – should contact NMC medical officer to complete the vaccination programme. NMC has urged schools to start health clinics on their premises with regular screening of body temperature of students. All schools have been directed to find doctors who can work voluntarily with the school management. Schools have also been asked to register their institutions with health centres. If required, help of doctors and paramedical staff can be sought from local health clinic. To maintain physical distancing, schools have been directed that each class should not have more than 15-20 students, with one student on each bench. NMC has directed all school managements to strictly follow all Covid-19 protocols, including thermal screening, use of pulse oximeter, sanitizer, soaps, water etc as directed by the government from time to time. It also asked the managements to encourage students to walk to school instead of using public transport. If travelling in a school bus or private vehicle, only one student is allowed on each seat. Drivers and conductors should promote use of sanitisers among children while boarding a bus. Teachers and non-teaching staff should ensure students wash their hands and / or use sanitisers before and after having food. Schools should also have medical check-up facilities for sick students. Students should also be told to have a bath and wash their clothes every day after reaching home from school. The civic chief has asked schools to submit Covid-19 compliance report to the education departments of zilla parishad and (NMC). School managements welcomed NMC’s decision. Principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh) Ashnarayan Tiwari said, “It’s a welcome decision by NMC, to implement the order right from the day when state government permits school reopening. We have been in unlock mode for quite some time and cases have decreased sharply. We even had a zero-case day. So this shows people are following safety guidelines and reopening will be beneficial for the academic future of kids.” Arvind Kumar, principal Kendriya Vidyalaya (Vayu Sena Nagar), said, “Online classes cannot achieve the same level of learning experience as physical classrooms. Many kids also face issues in online classes due to internet connectivity and we have even heard of cases where kids don’t have access to devices. So it’s a welcome decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-allows-physical-classes-for-std-viii-xii-from-oct-4/articleshow/86665127.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Dehradun||Taxing registration process harries Char Dham pilgrims; local bizmen, too, feel the heat||Mussoorie: Tedious dual registration process and capped slots are not only giving a tough time to Char Dham pilgrims but also to those whose livelihood depends on the pilgrimage. Already reeling under losses, tourism operators said if the situation did not improve, their livelihood would take a hit. “Despite being fully-vaccinated, we had to register on two portals and managed to get slots with a great difficulty. After spending several hours at RTO office to complete registration formalities, we were frisked a number of times. The entire process is cumbersome and annoying,” rued Manohar Lal Shukla, a resident of Uttar Pradesh. Devotees said they were required to register on smart city portal as well as Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board portal and obtain two e-passes. “It is after days that one is able to book a slot on Devasthanam portal, given the rush of pilgrims. There were many who could not get a slot,” said Rajneesh Sharma, a pilgrim from New Delhi. Unhappy with the taxing registration process, tourism operators said the number of pilgrims allowed to visit the shrines was already less than what they had expected, adding that they saw no light at the end of the tunnel. “More than 10 lakh persons in the state are dependent on the Char Dham yatra for their livelihood. Going is getting tough for them with such restrictions in place,” said Prateek Karanwal, coordinator of Char Dham yatra for Uttarakhand Hotel Association. “Lodges, hotels and shopkeepers in Guptkashi, Fata and Sonprayag are a disappointed lot as only those with e-passes are being allowed to go beyond Gaurikund,” complained Nitin Jamlokia, secretary, Shri Kedar Dham hotel owner association. On September 27, all shops and lodges were closed in protest against the government, which has been given time till October 1 to meet traders’ demands. “Registration should be done only on smart city portal, fully-vaccinated should be allowed without any registration and the number of pilgrims visiting the shrines should be increased,” Karanwal said, saying they had submitted a memorandum to the CM in this regard. Secretary tourism department, Dilip Jawalkar said the government was contemplating appealing to the HC to allow more pilgrims while ensuring smooth registration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/taxing-registration-process-harries-char-dham-pilgrims-local-bizmen-too-feel-the-heat/articleshow/86660287.cms||Anmol Jain

Police found their “involvement in the murder of a jeweller”. The jeweller was allegedly shot dead and valuables worth Rs 2 lakh were looted on July 3. Kumar was sent to the district jail. He was kept in “barrack four” with Shahnawaj and Saleem alias Chotu - both notorious criminals. Around midnight, jail officials came to know about the “violence” in the barrack. Kumar was provided treatment by the emergency medical officer at the local hospital and is said to be stable now. Sharma, the jail superintendent, told TOI, “Santosh had minor injuries in his neck after an inmate attacked him with a spoon. The former had earlier thrashed him and another inmate. They had suffered internal injuries then.” He, however, dismissed Kumar’s allegations. “There was no attempt to kill anyone. It was just a quarrel. We are taking action as per prison manual and it will be treated in the jail records as misconduct,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/inmates-fashion-weapon-out-of-spoon-attempt-to-kill-undertrial-in-up-prison/articleshow/86660366.cms||---

As per regional transport office (RTO) data, between January and September this year, the number of cars registered in Pune was 64% higher than the same period last year, and 8% higher than the corresponding period in 2019. In Pimpri Chinchwad, car registrations were up 55% over the first nine months of 2020, and 16% over the same period in 2019. Customers and dealers said the overall positive sentiment in the market helped, buoyed by the “faceless registration” system launched by the transport department in June, under which dealers need no longer visit the RTO office in person — the buyer can get a car the same day s/he books and pays for it. “The faceless system has helped a lot — it saves a lot of time for dealers, and reduces the wait for customers,” Shailash Bhandari, Pune regional director of Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) and a dealer himself, told TOI. Another four-wheeler dealer, while admitting demand was up, said problems remained. “There remain some crippling issues at the supply chain level. The overall production cost, including shipping, freight charges and material cost, has gone up. This increased cost has also resulted in fewer and limited discounts, even during the festive season,” the dealer said. Buyers, meanwhile, said they too learned some hard lessons. “Before the pandemic, the general practice was to buy vehicles only on festive/auspicious occasions. The pandemic changed all that. For instance, I had planned to buy a car on Ganesh Chaturthi last year, but restrictions made that impossible. So, once things opened properly earlier this year, I immediately bought a car. The interest rates on vehicle loans too have been attractive,” Anand Phadnis, an engineer by profession, said. Officials expect things to improve further. “Two-wheeler sales too have improved, but not by much. One reason could be that many educational institutes and offices are still closed and work from home might continue for longer, so a two-wheeler is not needed. But a car is a vehicle for the entire family,” a Pune RTO official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/car-registrations-so-far-in-2021-outpace-past-2-years/articleshow/86662976.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Bareilly||Tiger deaths in 2021 could be highest in a decade, say experts||BAREILLY: The country has recorded 99 tiger deaths in just the first nine months of 2021, sparking concerns among conservationists that the big cat death toll this year may be the highest in a decade. According to data from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), 99 tiger deaths were recorded due to poaching, accidents and natural reasons until September 30. Of these at least seven deaths were due to poaching, as confirmed by seized animal skin or parts. A total of 45 deaths were outside the boundaries of forest reserves, data revealed. Madhya Pradesh (MP) — which is home to a number of tiger reserves including Kanha, Bandhavgarh, Pench, Satpura and Panna and has the highest tiger population among all states at 526 — recorded the maximum tiger deaths at 32. This was followed by Maharashtra (20) and Karnataka (15). India has 2,967 tigers, according to the latest population estimation which was carried out in 2018. Conservationists said the death toll is likely to be the highest in a decade since the figure is already nearing 100 in nine months. "With a growing tiger population, but limited territory available for each, infighting has increased and so has man-animal conflict, resulting in higher deaths," said a wildlife conservationist who did not wish to be named. The highest number of deaths in the past decade occurred in 2016 when 121 tiger deaths were reported. Last year, 106 tiger deaths were reported. NTCA data also showed that UP has recorded a slight increase in tiger mortality this year as eight tigers have died in the state while the average number of deaths reported annually for the last 10 years was five. Four of the tigers died of unnatural causes — two tigers were poached while another two killed in road accidents inside tiger reserves. Dudhwa’s field director Sanjay Pathak admitted that tiger deaths due to electrocution and road accidents remained an area of concern. “But we should also note that the mortality rate is still below 3% of the population and poaching incidents have reduced,” he said. Senior coordinator (Terai Arc landscape) in WWF India, Mudit Gupta, said growing population of tigers in an area forces the weaker members to seek new territories which can cause them to venture into human habitats if wildlife corridors are blocked due to encroachment. “We must make sure such corridors aren’t blocked. We have trained local community members to act as bagh mitras in UP and they have helped minimise conflict despite over a dozen tigers migrating to cane fields and small forest ranges in Kheri and Pilibhit," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/tiger-deaths-in-21-could-be-highest-in-a-decade-experts/articleshow/86660336.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

We are repeatedly experiencing the presence of tigers in the area,” Ker police sources told TOI. Confirming that it was most likely that a big cat carried away the buffalo, a wildlife biologist from the Wildlife Conservation Trust, Girish Punjabi told TOI, “The pugmarks indicate that it might have been a tiger.” The forest village is located in the Tillari river basin.

---||Pune||Maharashtra to seek Centre’s aid to pay Covid victims’ kin||PUNE: The cash-strapped state disaster management department will seek financial assistance from the Centre to pay ex gratia to the kin of those who died of Covid-19, a senior official said. The National Disaster Management Authority has recommended that Rs 50,000 be given to the kin of those who died of Covid-19. This will also apply to those involved in Covid-19 relief operations or activities associated with the preparedness for dealing with the pandemic. In the state, the total sum to be disbursed, through the State Disaster Response Fund (SRDF), comes up to Rs750 crore. The state will seek these funds from the Union government, it was decided at the SRDF state executive committee meeting held on Wednesday. Principal secretary (relief and rehabilitation) Aseem Gupta told TOI that there have been 1.38 lakh registered deaths in the state; the number could even cross 1.50 lakh. “We have already allocated funds for various other Covid-19 management measures and are currently cash-strapped. We are requesting the NDMA to allocate funds for ex gratia payments as otherwise, we will be hard-pressed to take up work related to pandemic and other calamities,” he said. The NDMA allocates Rs4,200 in total to the state disaster management department. Of this, Rs1,700 crore is spent on Covid management, while the rest is meant to be used to tackle natural disasters. An official said the amount allocated for Covid-related work is nearly exhausted, while the rest is being used to deal with natural disasters in the state. A source in the department said there was already a shortage and that the Rs750 crore required to pay the kin of Covid-19 victims would increase the burden. Also at the meeting, a decentralized approach was decided for grievance approach — committees would be appointed under the additional collector in each district. Once the death certificate is issued, the families concerned can submit a form to be issued by the government at common facilitation centres or ward offices, as will be designated by the local authorities, officials said. The district disaster management authorities must ensure that the process of claim, verification, sanction, and disbursal is simple, robust, and people-friendly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-to-seek-centres-aid-to-pay-covid-victims-kin/articleshow/86662965.cms||Nisha Nambiar

I am still waiting to see what more things are going to happen, how many more leaders are moving from one party to the other. I will wait till November and then take a decision on what to do. I have been a BJP member for the past 15 years. Let us wait and watch. Everybody is watching the situation. Ultimately, the people will decide.” He also said that if the party makes some correction, then it can win all the seats.

With the public also taking the safety norms of wearing masks and maintaining social distance easy, health officials are getting jittery.The recent spurt in fresh Covid-19 cases in Madurai has been mainly in areas under corporation limits. In Madurai city, seven streets are now designated as containment zones. Of these, four are under zone 2 of Madurai corporation while one each are under zone 1, 3 and 4. In September, Madurai has recorded a total of 596 Covid-19 cases. While the district was reporting around 10-15 new cases daily on average at the start of September, now it is consistently reporting around 25-30 a day. “There are no clusters as such but we are closely monitoring fever cases. The rise is only marginal so it is no cause for any alarm. There are also more than enough beds vacants in hospitals. However, the public must not let their guard down and must show better adherence to Covid-19 safety norms,” said a health official. He said that Covid-19 vaccination is being intensified to help bring down mortality and cases further. The district is testing about 6,000-6,500 samples a day and the positivity rate is at 0.4%. Kanyakumari currently has the most number of active cases in the region with 265 with 775 new cases reported in September alone. “On Wednesday, eight Covid-19 cases were reported in an area and hence it was made a containment area. Otherwise, the cases have largely been sporadic. We have been actively making efforts to increase Covid-19 vaccination coverage and we urge the public to avoid hesitancy and come forward,” said a health official from Kanyakumari. Cases have also been steadily rising in Sivaganga and Tirunelveli though marginally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/small-but-steady-rise-in-covid-cases-in-some-southern-dists/articleshow/86663027.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

An FIR was registered at traffic accident investigation (east) on Wednesday. Police said Kunal Tank had gone out to run an errand. He was standing alongside the road when a speeding bike hit him. He was tossed up several feet high into the air. The motorist fled from the scene. Locals rushed a profusely bleeding Kunal to hospital where doctors pronounced him dead. Police said Kunal was a resident of Khada Basti in Adarsh Nagar. “We examined around a dozen CCTV cameras across multiple locations. We plucked out one footage which captured the movement of a bike barreling through Adarsh Nagar main road,” an official said, adding that the vehicle caught in the footage is suspected to be the same bike that hit Kunal. “There was complete chaos on the road following the accident. No one spotted the registration plate of the bike. Even in the CCTV, the number plate is not clearly visible,” the official added. Police have enquired locals to check if the same white-coloured bike was seen regularly on the road. “Except for the colour of the vehicle, we don’t have much information about the vehicle and its rider,” the official claimed, adding that an FIR was filed under Section 279 (rash driving), and 304A (causing death by negligence). Locals requested cops to rein in on youths who regularly flout traffic norms by barreling on busy streets. “It appears that the rider was riding very fast and hit the child. We handed over the victim’s body after post-mortem,” the official said. . TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/speeding-bike-kills-boy-in-adarsh-nagar/articleshow/86665243.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Power privatisation: MHA seeks UT’s clarification on cabinet note||Chandigarh: The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) has sought some clarifications from the Chandigarh administration on the cabinet note it sent them in connection with the power privatisation project. Sources in the UT administration said the MHA has sought more details related to the bidding process, transfer of assets and finalisation of the company for the project. A senior UT official said they would provide all relevant information to the MHA and submit their reply at the earliest. The UT administrator had sent the cabinet note to the MHA on September 24 after the approval of former UT administrator V P Singh Badnore. Recently, the UT’s empowered committee of power privatisation, under the chairmanship of UT adviser Dharam Pal, had approved Kolkata-based Eminent Electricity Distribution’s highest bid for privatisation of the electricity department, of Rs 817 crore against a reserve price of Rs 174 crore. On August 5, the Chandigarh administration informed the Punjab and Haryana High Court that the process of getting cabinet nod for UT’s power privatisation project would take two to three months more and submitted that the petition challenging the privatisation project was premature. Kolkata-based Eminent Electricity Distribution was the highest bidder for privatisation of the electricity department. With Rs 817 crore against a reserve price of Rs 174 crore, it defeated giants like Tata and the Adani group. The company is a subsidiary of Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation Ltd, a flagship of RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group.The administration expedited the project after getting relief from the Supreme Court. In June, the Apex court stayed the May 28 order of the Punjab and Haryana high court of staying the privatisation process on the application filed by Gopal Dutt Joshi, general secretary, UT Powermen Union. At this, UT moved Supreme Court.Recently, the administration opened technical bids of all seven companies and submitted the case to the technical bids evaluation committee. The UT planned to open the bids in the first week of June but the union moved high court. The UT engineering department issued a notice on November 9, 2020 and invited bids for distribution licence in Chandigarh. The bids closed on February 8.On March 8, UT issued an amendment to the bid document and extended the bidding date to March 18. The amendment also provided an opportunity to new bidders to submit their bids and allowed existing bidders to modify theirs. Box: 2.47 lakh power consumers in city The electricity department caters to 2.47 lakh consumers divided into nine categories. According to official figures, of the total consumers, 2.14 lakh are domestic, accounting for more than 87% of the total consumers. The remaining 23% belong to other categories, commercial, small power, medium supply, large supply, bulk supply, public lighting, agriculture power and temporary supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/power-privatisation-mha-seeks-uts-clarification-on-cabinet-note/articleshow/86663057.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Nashik||Supply hit, veggie prices soar||Nashik: The retail price of various vegetables in the city have soared as the rain has adversely affected the supply. The vegetable prices in the retail markets have increased between 20% and 30% in the last few days. According to Nashik Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) officials, the supply of the vegetables has been reduced by 30% in the wholesale markets, leading to a rise in vegetable prices in retail markets. Even the prices of vegetables have increased in wholesale mandis following a drop in supply of vegetables as compared to the demand. The retail prices of tomatoes have doubled from Rs 20 to Rs 40 per kg, while onion price has increased to Rs 30 a kg from Rs 20 a kg last week. The prices of tomatoes had dropped excessively in wholesale markets during the last one-and-a-half months. But the supply of tomatoes has also reduced at large at the wholesale mandis in the district due to a drop in the supply of tomatoes to the markets. Arun Kale, the Nashik APMC secretary said, there had been heavy rain in parts of the district during the last two days which affected the supply of vegetables in the wholesale mandis. Farmers were unable to bring the vegetables to the markets. Like tomatoes, onions are also becoming costlier due to the drop in supply. In wholesale markets, the average price of onions has already increased from Rs 1,450 per quintal around a week ago to Rs 2,250 per quintal so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/supply-hit-veggie-prices-soar/articleshow/86657404.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Nashik||Now, vax drive underway for 33k cattle in 10 districts||Nashik: Even as the state government is conducting a huge drive to vaccinate people against Covid-19, it has simultaneously undertaken a mammoth inoculation drive in 10 districts, including Nashik and Pune, to inoculate cows and buffaloes. “The highly infectious viral Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) involving cows and buffaloes have unfolded in these 10 districts 2-3 months back. The transmission of the virus through flies, mosquitoes and cattle movement is rapid. To prevent more cattle getting infected, the animal husbandry department has started a huge vaccination drive of cattle in these 10 districts,” Dr Vinayak V Limaye, joint commissioner of state animal husbandry department and in-charge of Pune-based Institute of Veterinary Biological Products (IVBP), told TOI. The swab samples of cattle suspected to be suffering from LSD have been sent to IVBP for confirmation. According to Limaye, so far over 33,000 cows and buffaloes were infected in the 10 districts and present active cases are around 3,400. So far, over 6.83 lakh cattle, in these districts have been vaccinated so far. There were no deaths due to the infection. Nashik, with around 13,800 cases, is the worst-affected in the state. Other affected districts include Pune as well as districts in Konkan and North Maharashtra. “The cattle infected with LSD have high fever and refuse to take fodder. Their bodies develop skin nodules. They are administered antibiotic injections and it takes around 7-10 days to heal. Once infected, the milk production of the animals gets severely impacted resulting in financial loss to dairy farmers,” said an animal husbandry official. This is for the first time that LSD has been reported in the 10 districts. Last year, some districts in Vidarbha and Marathwada had reported the disease and the department had undertaken a similar vaccination drive. Limaye said, as per guidelines of the Union government, once an animal tests positive for LSD, the entire cattle population within a radius of 5 kms must be vaccinated. “The vaccination has to take place in such a manner where the inoculation starts from the periphery of the 5 km radius and gradually moves towards the epicentre of the infection. Trained animal husbandry employees have been working for the last few months to vaccinate the cattle with one shot of goat pox vaccine,” said Limaye. Nashik district animal husbandry chief Dr Vishnu Garje said that the ailment is ebbing in the district. “The situation was critical about a month ago but since we have been administering the vaccine at a rapid pace, the situation is under control. The cases of infection have drastically reduced,” added Garje.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/now-vax-drive-underway-for-33k-cattle-in-10-districts/articleshow/86660500.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

A case was registered in this regard. Police said that they received information around 9.30 am from Safdarjung Hospital about the man, Shubham, being brought dead to the hospital. Further inquiry revealed that the deceased was a native of Uttarakhand. He was working as a waiter in a hotel and was living at a rented accommodation in Mahipalpur. A police officer said that the incident took place during a get-together that was organised inside the farmhouse. “Shubham and his colleagues had organised a get-together at the farmhouse. There was a swimming pool in the backyard of the farmhouse and he and his friends had entered the pool,” the officer said. Deputy commissioner of police (South) Benita Mary Jaiker said that after some time, his friends came out of the pool but found that Shubham was missing. During the search, they discovered that he had drowned. The 25-year-old victim was admitted to a hospital in south Delhi by his friends where the doctor declared him brought dead. “The deceased did not know how to swim,” the officer said. During the inspection, police found negligence on the part of the farmhouse owner. “There was no life-saving equipment near the swimming pool. How did he then allow for such a get-together,” the officer wondered. A case under Section 304A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against the owner of the farmhouse. Further investigation is underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/25-year-old-drowns-in-swimming-pool-at-farmhouse-in-south-delhi/articleshow/86663072.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: CBI files 13 documents in Narendra Dabholkar murder case||PUNE: The CBI on Thursday submitted to the special UAPA court here 13 documents to be considered as evidence in the August 20, 2013, murder case of veteran rationalist Narendra Dabholkar. The CBI’s special public prosecutor, Rajendra Suryavanshi, has given notice to the five accused to admit or deny the documents under Section 294 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Panvel-based ENT specialist and Sanatan Sanstha activist Virendrasinh Tawde, described by the CBI as a key conspirator, Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar, the two men accused of shooting Dabholkar dead on the Vitthal Ramji Shinde bridge near Balgandharva Rang Mandir in Pune, and Vikram Bhave, who is accused of assisting the duo in a recce of the crime spot, the escape route and related aspects are among the five men charged in the case. The special judge, S R Navander, has given time till October 6 to defence lawyers representing the accused to file their written say in relation to the CBI’s documents. The prosecution will submit the list of witnesses to be examined during the trial and the case diary of the CBI superintendent of police S R Singh who is the investigation officer in the murder case on the same day. The court had earlier rejected the plea filed by Tawde seeking temporary bail of three days for performing the post-death rituals on the first death anniversary of his father. Tawde through his lawyer had filed a plea stating that he should be allowed to visit his residence for performing the rituals under police protection on October 4 and 5 between 12pm and 5.30pm. Suryavanshi said, “The CBI opposed Tawde’s plea on the grounds that the court had earlier thrice rejected his bail pleas. Tawde will go absconding and may tamper with the prosecution witnesses/evidence if he was released on temporary bail.” Tawde’s defence lawyer, Prakash Salsingikar, said, “The court has granted permission to Tawde to perform rituals via video conferencing mode for three hours on October 5. The bail pleas filed by Tawde and Andure are pending for hearing before the Bombay high court.” Three of the five accused, Tawde, Andure and second alleged shooter Sharad Kalaskar, were produced before the court via video conferencing mode from Yerawada and Arthur Road jails. Bhave was present in person before the court while Mumbai lawyer Sanjiv Punalekar had sought exemption from personal appearance. Lawyer Omkar Nevagi representing Dabholkar’s family was present before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cbi-files-13-documents-as-evidence-in-dabholkar-murder-case/articleshow/86663047.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Kolkata||But many cite age, poor health, rain to stay away||Kolkata: Several residents of the Bhowanipore assembly constituency rued that though given a second chance, they could not exercise their franchise on Thursday. Some were still recovering from Covid-related complications, for some, the rain played spoilsport and for the others, work pressure prevented them from queueing up to vote. Former Chief Justice of Bombay High Court and Calcutta High Court Chittatosh Mookerjee was among those who could not visit a booth. Several health conditions prevented him from stepping out of his home, though he wanted to. “I am super-senior since I am 92 and I expected the Election Commission to come home and enrol me for postal ballot. They are doing it for the very old and sick. During the polls in April, they enrolled me but at that time, I had to be hospitalised because I was Covid-positive. This time, I was given a voter’s slip to go to South Suburban School to vote but I couldn’t venture out. I thought of complaining on 1950 voters’ helpline, but did not do that,” he said. For 76-year-old Swapna Mukherjee, who lived on Kedar Bose Road, the wish to go out to vote reduced a bit after her 83-year-old husband, Purnendu, was given the opportunity to use the postal ballot by the election commission to vote from home. She couldn’t muster the courage to go alone to her booth at South Suburban School. “The sky didn’t look good and it rained several times. So finally, I decided not to go. At my age, I need to be a bit careful,” she said. Resident of Rammoy Road, Rukmaniben Popat, who was suffering from Covid when the elections had happened earlier, had to stay away from the poll process. But after receiving two doses of Covid vaccine, she wanted to queue up and vote. But Covid had left the 74-year-old woman frail and she still suffered from post-Covid complications. “I was mentally prepared to go but my health did not permit. So I could not join the rest of the family when they went to vote,” she said. For some, like young bank manager, Harsimran Kaur (28), who attended to her clients all day, it was difficult to take some time off from work to go out and vote. So while her father, Narinder Singh, took out the rest of the family to the polling booth, he had to leave his daughter at home, undisturbed. “Harsimran caters to a foreign clientele, whose timings are different from that of ours. So, she could not leave work even though she wanted to vote,” said Narinder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/but-many-cite-age-poor-health-rain-to-stay-away/articleshow/86663096.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

As the patient declined bypass surgery, it was decided to do angioplasty. “The challenges involved in this case were severely calcified vessels, involvement of left main coronary artery and bifurcation lesion. Intravascular ultrasound was used to assess the calcium burden and the vessel size and then a novel technology called ‘Intravascular lithotripsy’ was used to break the calcium in the blood vessels,” said a doctor.

---||Mangaluru||Opposition questions delay in Jalasiri, LED projects||Mangaluru: Congress corporators in the opposition in the MCC council, questioned the ruling BJP and officials for delaying the implementation of the Jalasiri and LED streetlight projects in the city. Jalasiri, a 24x7 drinking water project, is being implemented by Suez Projects Private Limited (lead partner), Suez India and DRS Infratech, at an estimated cost of Rs 792.4 crore. Meanwhile, the work to convert nearly 70,000 conventional streetlights into LEDs under the Smart City Mission is under progress in the city. At a council meeting on Thursday, opposition leader A C Vinayaraj said that the progress of the work on the conversion of conventional streetlights into LEDs in the city was not satisfactory, and he pointed out that the supply of lamps was also not proper. “It is aimed at completing the project by December this year, but the work has not been completed in many wards yet,” he said. Mayor Premanand Shetty said, “I have convened a meeting recently, and it has been found that the work is not progressing satisfactorily. We have warned the agency and the commissioner has a served notice in this regard. We will invoke the penalty clause too for the delay.” Meanwhile, former mayor Bhaskar Moily from the Congress pointed out about the slow pace of work on the Jalasiri project. Shashidhar Hegde, another senior corporator from the Congress, also noted that there is a mismatch in the work estimate and the ground reality, when it comes to the implementation of the Jalasiri project. Officials said that more workers will be deployed to speed up the implementation of the Jalasiri project. Meanwhile, the mayor told the council members that separate meetings will be held to discuss about the LED and Jalasiri projects. New software for SAS tax The council approved a proposal to develop a new software to facilitate the online payment of property tax under the Self-Assessment System (SAS), through the Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation Limited (Keonics). Mayor Shetty said that a demonstration of the proposed online property tax payment system will be organised within a week. Waste collection: Contract extension As the existing contract between the MCC and Antony Waste Handling Cell, to collect and transport waste from the city ends in January 2022, the city corporation has proposed to extend the contract for one more year. “We have already prepared an alternative DPR for the collection and transportation of waste from the city. Meanwhile, Ramakrishna Math will also submit a DPR for the purpose. However, it may take time for the city corporation to get an approval from the government for a new DPR. Hence, the present contract of the AWHC can be extended for one year till January 31, 2023, or till the alternative DPR is finalised,” the mayor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/opposition-questions-delay-in-jalasiri-led-projects/articleshow/86657412.cms||---

However, we have started inspections of blood banks in the state,” said Rajaram Sharma, state drug controller, Rajasthan. According to the Rajasthan state blood transfusion council officials, blood can be transferred in bulk from one blood bank to other in case if there is risk of getting it expired. But, there is a proper procedure of bulk transfer of blood from one blood bank to other, which has to be followed. If the blood banks are not following the norms issued by the Centre, they are breaking the law. Since blood is a drug and its mention is made in Drug and Cosmetic Act, the department of drug controller has the responsibility to keep a check on illegal trade of blood, if it is happening. Dr SS Agarwal, former president Indian Medial Association, who runs one of the oldest blood bank in the city, demanded from the government to take measures for preventing such incidents and to act strictly against those involved in it. He appealed to the government to cancel the licence of the blood banks who are involved in such incidents and earning bad name for the state. Besides, the activists working for encouraging blood donations appealed to the state to monitor the blood distribution online. “There should be a portal through which the availability of blood in a bank can be checked,” said Hitesh Bandhia who runs an NGO, which encourages blood donations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-gang-not-involved-in-blood-smuggling-racket/articleshow/86665296.cms||---

The announcement was made on Thursday by the standing committee chairman Hitesh Barot. The ‘non-vegetarian’ food carts also include those selling egg preparations as well, Barot claimed. While addressing a press conference, Barot said that the AMC had been receiving complaints from various residential areas and religious places to control proliferation of such illegal food outlets and the “health issues”. When asked whether the present drive was against unhygenic ‘non-vegetarian’ food outlets only while other food outlets could operate, Barot said, “We are taking non-vegetarian food carts on priority for now, which does not mean that there is an exemption for other food outlets operating without food licences. There is no provision in GPMC Act to act against illegal non-vegetarian food carts. But keeping in mind sanitation concerns we wanted that hand carts selling non-vegetarian food also adhere to norms,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/illegal-non-vegetarian-joints-in-amcs-crosshairs/articleshow/86663254.cms||---

With the latest action, ED has so far seized Rs 237 crore belonging to the company. ED had found FEMA violations while probing money laundering allegations against the loan app company and seized Rs 106 crore earlier. The company provides instant personal micro loans through its mobile application ‘Cashbean’. It was found to have suspicious foreign outward remittances. PCFS has allegedly illegally remitted huge funds outside India in the guise of imports of non-existent software and marketing services to park funds abroad and hold them in the accounts of related foreign companies. PCFS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oplay Digital Services, SA de CV of Mexico, which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tenspot Pesa Limited of Hong Kong. Tenspot is owned by Opera Limited and Wisdom Connection I Holding Inc of Cayman Islands, which are ultimately beneficially owned by Chinese national Zhou Yahui. The original Indian company, PCFS, was incorporated in 1995 by Indian nationals and got NBFC licence in 2002. After RBI approval in 2018, the ownership moved to the Chinese-controlled company. ED, in a press release on Thursday, said “Investigation further revealed that the foreign parent companies of PCFS had brought FDI worth Rs 173 crore for lending business and within a short span of time, made foreign outward remittances worth Rs 429 crore in the name of payments for software services received from related foreign companies. PCFS also showed high domestic expenditure of Rs 941 Crore.” “Detailed investigation into the foreign expenses paid by the NBFC revealed that most of the payments were made to foreign companies, which are related and owned by the same Chinese nationals, who own the Opera Group,” ED said in the release. ED found that exorbitant payments were blindly allowed by the dummy Indian directors of PCFS without any due diligence and, on the instructions of country head Zhang Hong, who directly reported to Zhou Yahui. “PCFS remitted forex worth Rs 429 Crore to 13 foreign companies in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, the US and Singapore in the guise of payments for licence fee for ‘Cashbean’ mobile app Rs 245 crore per annum, software technical fee of around Rs 110 crore, online marketing and advertisement fee of around Rs 66 Crore. These services are available in India at a fraction of the cost incurred by PCFS,” ED said. The firm provides instant personal micro loans through its mobile application ‘Cashbean’ and was found to have suspicious foreign outward remittances.ED has seized Rs 106cr earlier for FEMA violations||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ed-seizes-rs-131-cr-from-chinese-loan-app-co-for-violating-fema/articleshow/86663133.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Dehradun||On green mission, U’khand activist vow to save 11k trees||Dehradun: Netizens stepped in on Thursday to save 11,000 trees to be axed for the expansion of Delhi-Doon expressway, a project that claims to cut the distance between Dehradun and national capital from existing 250 km to 180 km. A ‘tweetstorm’ was conducted by activists using the #savemohund tag. The activists said they were particularly worried about the felling of 2,500 Sal trees, which they say are part of climax species and its forest plays a vital role in holding slippery hills of the Shivaliks and forms a perfect habitat for wildlife. These trees date back to the British era and need to be preserved. The axing of buffer zone of Rajaji will only lead to distress among the wildlife and heightened human-wildlife conflict in Dehradun and nearby areas, the activists added. The issue was raised after TOI, in August 2020, reported that the state had plans to axe 2,500 British-era Sal trees for the expansion of an expressway in which Dehradun would get barely 3.5 km. And then Doon-based NGO -- Citizens for Green Doon -- filed an application only to find out that the stretch from Ganeshpur in Saharanpur forest division to Daat Kaali in Dehradun would actually witness felling of 8,500 trees. Thursday’s tweetstorm to register their concerns and aggression resulted in a chorus. TOI had recently reported that WII, in its survey of the 19.5-km stretch from Ganeshpur in Saharanpur forest division to Asarodi in Dehradun, had clearly stated that the 11.5-km patch of the road had important wildlife corridors used by leopards and elephants. Incidentally, ranger, Saharanpur forest division, Manoj Kumar Balodi said the forest land had been transferred to NHAI this year and there was “nothing illegal about the tree felling.” “We have marked around 5,000 trees of Sal, sheesham and kher for the four-laned elevated road from Ganeshpur to Daat Kaali temple. The area where felling is happening is a part of eco-sensitive zone of Rajaji Tiger Reserve. Therefore, the ministry was kept in the loop.” Dr Aanchal Sharma, who initiated teh tweetstorm, told TOI, “We will celebrate Gandhi Jayanti to express solidarity with these trees. They will not be killed by anyone, we will save them because we all struggled to get oxygen during the deadly second wave of Covid-19. We should learn lessons from that crisis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/on-green-mission-ukhand-activist-vow-to-save-11k-trees/articleshow/86660492.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Delhi||CNG and PNG prices set to jump as gas price up 62%||NEW DELHI: The government raised the price of natural gas produced from domestic fields by 62% to $2.9 per unit, the first increase in two years that will hit consumers by steeply pushing up cost of CNG and PNG but boost income of producers such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Cairn India and state-run ONGC. The new gas price will take effect from Friday and CNG and PNG prices are likely to see a 10-11% upward revision in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai on Saturday or Sunday. Higher gas prices will increase the burden on user industries just when the economy was recovering from the impact of the deadly second wave of Covid-19 infections. But even after the revision, CNG will retain its advantage due to record prices of petrol and diesel, which have started crawling up again, according to Prashant Vasisht of rating agency ICRA. Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, the oil ministry’s market tracker that revises domestic gas prices on April 1 and October 1 every year as per a 2014 formula, also raised the ceiling price for gas produced from difficult fields such as RIL’s KG-D6 block by 69% to $6.13 per unit. ICRA’s Sabyasachi Majumdar said the increase in gas prices will provide only a limited relief to producers as the new price is still insufficient, in absolute terms, for covering the cost of production. Higher gas prices would increase the subsidy burden for the government. Every $1 per unit increase in the pooled price at which gas is supplied to fertiliser manufacturers, the subsidy requirement rises by around Rs. 4,500-5,000 crore. The current budgetary allocation for fertiliser subsidy will prove to be inadequate, ICRA said. This is the first increase in gas prices since April 2019 and has been driven by hardening of benchmark rates at global hubs. Pricee had dropped during the last two years. According to Vasisht, operators of city gas networks could raise CNG price by Rs 4.5-4.7 per kg and PNG price by Rs 2.5-2.7 per unit. This is assuming the operators maintain their absolute margins.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cng-and-png-prices-set-to-jump-as-gas-price-up-62/articleshow/86663155.cms||---

Pushpa Devi, 50, told TOI she took over teaching duties at the school in Shamli’s Khanpur block after a teacher died of Covid-19 while the other went on medical leave earlier this month. “I’m the only one running the school since September 5,” said Devi, admitting that she has only taken Hindi and social science classes as she can’t read English and doesn't have experience teaching mathematics. The BEO, Geeta Verma, told TOI she will take cognisance of the matterA letter was written to the district magistrate on Wednesday by zila panchayat member Umesh Kumar after parents of some kids raised concerns about lack of proper education for the children. “Many government schools face unavailability of teachers while poor quality of midday meals is also a common grievance. Why can’t the authorities make temporary arrangements for teachers rather than make students suffer? We have asked the DM to look into this serious issue and appoint four teachers at the institution,” said Kumar. The basic education officer (BEO) of Shamli, Geeta Verma, meanwhile, told TOI she will take cognisance of the matter. “We can't control death and illness, but we are looking into the matter,” Verma said. The primary school is hardly the only one where conditions are deplorable. A video of another primary school from Bulandshahr’s Lakhawati area that went viral earlier this week purportedly showed the cook mixing 5 litres of water in 2 litres of milk to feed 100 students for their midday meal. BEO Akhand Pratap Singh said the school principal and an assistant teacher have been suspended. “I have also stopped the salaries of two teachers, one shiksha mitra and three cooks. The matter is being investigated,” he said. The teachers of the school declined to comment on the issue. In yet another incident of cutting corners for midday meals, an inspection by Virendra Kumar, the divisional coordinator of midday deal (MDM), earlier this month found that a school in Hapur’s Pipleheda block with 1,330 students was serving only half the required portion to students and chapatis were being ordered from a roadside dhaba, instead of being cooked in school. The students were provided uniform or utensils. “The food was being prepared at gram pradhan’s home and chapatis were ordered from a dhaba. Teachers seemed to have no idea what the ideal proportion of food was for kids in each grade or what was on the day’s menu. A detailed report has been submitted in the matter and a notice issued to the school principal,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/school-shocker-1-teacher-for-124-kids-5l-of-water-in-2l-of-milk-for-midday-meal/articleshow/86660536.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Kolkata||For some, getting inked twice in five months is not once too many||Kolkata: Several families, who had cast their votes on April 26 despite the rising Covid cases at that time, stepped out again on Thursday—merely, five months apart—to elect a representative of Bhowanipore. But this time, most seemed to be less apprehensive about the novel coronavirus. Kalighat Road residents Ankur and Molly Mukherjee, in their 40s, recollected how scared they were when they went to vote on April 26. “We went in the morning that day, but came away on seeing the long queues. But we didn’t want to skip voting. So when the crowd thinned later in the day, we returned to the booth and voted. Compared to that day, we felt much more confident on Thursday. Both of us have been vaccinated and so were most in the queue with us,” said Molly, who works in a private firm, along with her husband. Swapan Mukherjee and his wife, Madhabi, had recovered from Covid before the April 26 polls. “As a citizen it is our duty to cast our votes. They are checking temperature at the entry and providing sanitiser and gloves. So, we voted more confidently this time,” he said. Octogenarian Paritosh Kumar Sengupta, a retired FCI employee, along with his wife Bharati, cast his votes at the Mitra Institution booth for the second time in five months. Sengupta, who had cardiac ailments, said, “When we had voted last time , we had taken only the first vaccine dose. Now we are fully vaccinated. So, we were not too scared to go out and vote.” Kuldip Singh and his wife, Amrita, said the Covid-safety measures that they had seen at the booths on April 26 voting made them confident that visiting the polling stations were not unsafe. “We never felt any fear,” Kuldip said. Septuagenarian Indrani Devi Sau, a resident of Girish Mukherjee Road, voted at a Ramesh Mitra Street school with her daughter, Priya. “She voted on April 26 and insisted on voting again,” said Priya. Kidderpore resident Sahid Khan (67) also voted for the second time in five months. He, however, chose the afternoon to visit the booth with his family as fewer people were expected in the queue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/for-some-getting-inked-twice-in-five-months-is-not-once-too-many/articleshow/86663172.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Hyderabad||Enforcement Directorate seizes Rs 131 crore from Chinese loan app company for violating FEMA||HYDERABAD: Enforcement Directorate (ED) has seized Rs 131 crore lying in bank accounts and virtual accounts with payment gateways belonging to loan app company PC Financial Services (PCFS) Private Limited under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). With the latest action, ED has so far seized Rs 237 crore belonging to the company. ED had found FEMA violations while probing money laundering allegations against the loan app company and seized Rs 106 crore earlier. The company provides instant personal micro loans through its mobile application ‘Cashbean’. It was found to have suspicious foreign outward remittances. PCFS has allegedly illegally remitted huge funds outside India in the guise of imports of nonexistent software and marketing services to park funds abroad and hold them in the accounts of related foreign companies. PCFS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Oplay Digital Services, SA de CV of Mexico, which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tenspot Pesa Limited of Hong Kong.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt moves Supreme Court against stay on ‘love jihad law’||AHMEDABAD: The state government on Thursday informed the Gujarat high court that it has moved the Supreme Court and challenged the order passed by the high court last month, by which it stayed provisions which prohibited forcible conversion by marriage in the recently amended Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act. On petitions filed by the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind and an activist, Mujahid Nafees, the HC in August had stayed six amended provisions of the anti-conversion law covering interfaith marriages, popularly known as the anti-love jihad law. The court clarified that the amended sections will not apply in cases of inter-religious marriages which take place without force, allurement or fraudulent means. The court said that the interim order is to protect parties in interfaith marriages from being unnecessarily harassed. Meanwhile, the high court reserved its verdict on Thursday after hearings concluded on a petition filed by the victim-complainant in the state’s first FIR registered under the amended anti-conversion law. She along with seven accused persons, including her husband and the person who solemnized their marriage, sought HC directions to quash the FIR registered at Gotri police station in Vadodara in June. The state government vehemently opposed the quashing petition and asserted that this is a fit case for trial. The investigating officer raised a preliminary objection to the complainant-victim filing the quashing petition herself as a petitioner. It was contended that it is against the practice and procedure followed in filing a quashing petition. She approached the high court for quashing of charges by “entering into the shoes of the accused”. She has adopted a novel method of seeking quashing of charges. Objection to the victim’s petition was also raised on the ground that she challenged a lower court’s order refusing bail to the accused. By doing so, the complainant has urged the HC to exercise its powers under Section 439 of CrPC for granting bail. The legal provisions for quashing of charges and grant of bail are different. The investigator termed the victim’s claims that police acted in an overzealous manner under influence of certain political-religious outfits to give an angle of love jihad to her simple complaint of domestic violence as “meaningless and baseless contentions”. The government submitted that the complainant did not come to the HC with clean hands and her prayers should be viewed with “serious circumspection”. Serious and heinous offences were made out in this case and the complainant now tries to canvas them as a mere matrimonial dispute. On behalf of the complainant, it was submitted that the cops had registered exaggerated accusations in the FIR and now since the husband and wife want to live a married life, the FIR should be quashed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-moves-sc-against-stay-on-love-jihad-law/articleshow/86663117.cms||---

Speaking at the event, vice-chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar said that over the past year, the varsity had handled all medical exigencies through different measures, including organising vaccination camps and testing centres. Following the New Education Policy (NEP) implementation, the varsity will be introducing several multidisciplinary programmes, Kumar said. “I strongly believe that JNU should play a leading role in offering skill oriented programmes to our students. JNU has decided to establish a school of medical sciences and an attached hospital with superspeciality departments, including non-conventional ones with an emphasis on modern medicine integrated with traditional medicine,” Kumar said. The vice-chancellor added that the varsity was in dialogue with the Indian Council for Medical Research to establish a state of the art research centre for rare diseases. “The university has formed special interest groups to carry out multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research,” Kumar said while adding that the research output from the varsity was on the rise compared with previous years. NCC will also be offered as an elective course from the upcoming academic year. “JNU will be offering NCC as an elective credit course with theory, practical and training camps. NCC was considered an extracurricular activity in the past, but now this curriculum will provide all-round education and personality development for the cadets,” Kumar said. Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who was the chief guest at the event, said that while the government was working towards the smooth implementation of the NEP, scholars who were graduating from the varsity were expected to contribute towards nation-building. Pradhan also added that the country’s education system was at the cusp of a “massive transformation” due to the NEP. “Our educational institutions like JNU have a fundamental role in disseminating quality education and empower the masses and youth to contribute to nation-building,” Pradhan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-500-get-their-phds-at-jnus-5th-convocation/articleshow/86663151.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, only eight surgeries had been performed at the hospital. A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that can help with hearing and cochlear implant surgeries are done to aid a child with severe or total hearing loss. “At GRH, since its inception, total 158 cochlear implant surgeries have been performed. On average, around 35 cochlear implant surgeries were being done per year. However, in 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the number dropped. But, now, we are picking up and despite being flooded with mucormycosis cases as well, we managed to perform 17 cochlear implant surgeries already this year,” said Dr Dr N Dhinakaran, professor and head, ENT department. First cochlear implant surgery was done at GRH in 2016. In 2021 alone, data shows that at GRH, 3,348 newborns underwent otoacoustic emissions (OAE) screening tests to detect hearing loss from birth. Meanwhile, 1,840 patients underwent pure tone audiometry tests, 227 underwent Immitance Audiometry tests and 77 underwent Brain Evoked Response Auditory (BERA) tests. A total of 1,009 patients took up speech therapy while 1,047 underwent Auditory Verbal Therapy (AVT). For the ‘International Week of Deaf People’ observed between September 20 and 26, at GRH, special programmes were organized to create awareness about hearing loss and special screening camps were also held. “At GRH, we are well-equipped to provide screening and treatment for all those suffering from any partial or severe hearing loss,” said Dr Dhinakaran. Around 250 patients took part at the screening camps alone. A special event was organised on Friday and GRH dean Dr A Rathinavel presented hearing aids to patients. A total of 150 hearing aids were distributed to beneficiaries in 2021 at GRH. Children who previously underwent cochlear implant surgeries also took part in the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/17-cochlear-implant-surgeries-performed-so-far-in-2021-at-grh/articleshow/86663105.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Funded by Rekha Menon from Bengaluru and her sister Dr Seema Mehrotra in collaboration with the United Way Chennai, the five-bed ICU was set up at a cost of Rs25 lakh. The siblings funded the facility in memory of their father Dr Mehrotra, who was the principal of Shimla Medical College. The ICU is equipped with two ventilator beds, a transport ventilator, multipara monitors, a defibrillator, infusion and syringe pumps, and suction apparatus, among other medical equipment. Thanking the donors and stakeholders involved in the project, Divya said, “In times of need, the people of Coonoor have come together with a vision of strengthening the healthcare infrastructure in the district. The ICU will make critical health services accessible to the patients, who had to travel to Coimbatore for the same until now.” Meenakshi Ramesh, executive director, United Way Chennai, said it was while distributing oxygen concentrators during the peak of second Covid-19 wave that they realized that Coonoor badly needed an ICU. “We are extremely grateful to our sponsors for the support.” The century-old government hospital had seen new additions of a dialysis section, casualty unit and an oxygen generation plant in the past six months. All the facilities were sponsored by private parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coonoor-govt-lawley-hospital-gets-new-icu/articleshow/86663177.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

When asked about his plans, Masood told TOI, “Politics is all about permutations and combinations. And, possibilities are numerous. There is nothing wrong about it (joining the other party)..." Masood, who lost some recent elections by a whisker, said had he been associated with “SP or BSP, my victory would have been 100% certain. Now my supporters are also becoming restless. They are saying enough is enough”. He never won any election after 2007, his first win. Although Masood shrugged off questions about his future plans and said that he was still a Congressman, SP leaders felt that his entry would boost the party's prospects in western UP pockets. “The Masood family has always had close ties with Samajwadi Party leaders. Imran Masood’s uncle and his mentor Rasheed Masood were close to both Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav. So, if Masood joins SP, it will not be a surprise because Congress has lost its base. I think it will be a homecoming for Imran,” said Rajpal Singh, a senior SP leader and former minister in the Akhilesh Yadav government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/only-samajwadi-party-can-stop-bjp-in-up-says-congress-leader-imraan-masood/articleshow/86660573.cms||Sandeep Rai

The association made this demand at a conference held in Madurai. Madurai MP Su Venkatesan, who inaugurated a conference, appealed to the state government and chief minister M K Stalin to immediately take notice of the issue and act. “This year, the National Co-operative Sugar Mills at Alanganallur must resume the crushing operations for the welfare of farmers. The Madurai district collector and administration must take efforts to ensure it. Further, the state government must also provide a loan of Rs 10 crore to the mill to start functioning again,” he said. The MP also slammed the central government for not considering the welfare of farmers and repealing the farm laws. Viju Krishnan, vice-secretary, All India Kisan Sabha, New Delhi urged both the state and central government to consider the demands of all farmers. “The Prime Minister promised to increase farmers’ incomes, procurement prices of crops and various other welfare schemes and benefits. However, since the BJP came to power, over one lakh farmer suicides have occurred in the past seven years across the country.

It is being conducted across all the cities that are part of smart city developments in the country,” said assistant commissioner Chandrashekhar Salunke. He said every food vendor, including those selling street food to any big restaurant or parcels services, have to register with the FDA as part of the food safety campaign. “The vendors, whose business turnover is less than Rs 12 lakh per year need to register, while those who cross the limit need to have a licence for their business. All this has to be carried out through an online process by submitting respective details,” he said. This is aimed to ensure safe food for the people in the urban areas. The officer warned that failure of the registration or licence could invite criminal proceedings against the person.

With a mandate of including people with disabilities in higher education, 28 undergraduate students were given devices, including laptops, electronic (refreshable) braille display, daisy players (digital recorders) and tablets. According to the college survey, it has 40 students with disabilities, of which 30 are undergraduate students. The centre has collaborated with an NGO, Saksham, and launched “Aarohan” — an initiative towards creating opportunities for inclusion of students with blindness and low vision in higher education. A college official said the objective of this programme was to create a level playing field for such students by providing reasonable accommodation based on their needs. Meanwhile, the college also felicitated its alumnus, Yogesh Kathuniya, who won a silver medal in the recently concluded Tokyo Paralympics. Through a video message, Kathuniya wished the students luck and complimented the college for setting up a one-of-a-kind centre for disability studies. Someshwar Sati, coordinator of the centre, said, “The centre has been established with an intention to enable students and faculty alike to promote disability as a legitimate field of academic inquiry and work towards creating an inclusive society. It provides a unique opportunity to deepen understanding of disability and partake in the process of spreading social awareness to bring about an attitudinal change in the society.” In 2019, KMC had also set up a QR-coded guidance system under its digital vision programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kmc-starts-new-centre-for-disability-research/articleshow/86663197.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||‘Involve all citizens to revive river’||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Thursday called for a public movement to clean and rejuvenate the Sabarmati river and said each of the citizens living in its catchment area needs to be involved. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati issued a slew of directions to authorities and asked the Joint Task Force (JTF), which had been formed to curb river pollution, to take assistance of experts and institutes to revive and rejuvenate the Sabarmati. The issue HC had taken suo motu cognizance of improperly treated sewerage being discharged into the river from the Sewage Treatment Plant near Pirana. The amicus curiae Hemang Shah inspected the places and came up with a report on basis of which the HC constituted the JTF. Terming the litigation for cleaning of the river as very important, the HC said, “It should be a people’s movement. Each and every district in the river’s catchment area and every citizen should be involved in this movement. A decentralized approach involving every citizen is needed to save Gujarat’s rivers from pollution… We have to use the ‘Public Trust Doctrine’ to apply stringent provisions against permitting municipal bodies or industries from polluting rivers.” The high court ordered the authorities including the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation to immediately stop discharge of trade effluents in city’s sewage pipes leading the water to STPs for treatment. This affects STP and, as a result, sewage water is not treated in proper manner. This pollutes the river. The court has ordered that such units be identified and action taken against them by disconnecting water and electricity supply. The power companies have been ordered not to restore connections without nod from agencies tasked to take action against erring units.

---||Jaipur||4 held for posing as Delhi cops to abduct bizman||Jaipur: An engineering student was among four accused arrested for kidnapping a businessman by posing as members of New Delhi police in Chanwaji in Jaipur rural. Chandwaji SHO Jitendra Gangwani said that an FIR was filed by one Rajesh Singh on September 23. Singh alleged three persons in a car came to his restaurant where he was one of the partners. They introduced themselves as personnel of Delhi police operating in civil dress and pushed him into the car. “The accused told Rajesh Singh that a woman had filed a complaint against him and they had come to take him away and they would release him for Rs 50,000. Rajesh Singh called up his former business partner Surendra Singh who came to help,” Gangwani said. Singh arrived at the spot and spoke to the accused impersonating Delhi cops. “We found that the accused had skirted the Manhorpur toll plaza and took the car through dirt roads to avoid CCTVs surveillance at the toll. This raised the suspicion. that why would anyone from Delhi, who is unknown to local routes take a dirt road. We questioned Surendra and the entire conspiracy unravelled,” he said. As per the police, Surendra Singh had set up a restaurant in partnership with Madan and Rajesh Singh. Both Rajesh and Surendra had moved out of their joint ventures, leaving Madan as sole proprietor of the business. But Surendra claimed that some of his money from the joint venture was pending with Madan and hatched a plan with his friends to abduct Surendra. As per plans, Surendra sent three of his friends to abduct Madan from the restaurant. But they accidentally caught Rajesh. “Surendra was miffed that his aides had caught the wrong person. His plans had gone awry,” Gangwani said. Police arrested four accused including Surendra Singh. Three other accused were idenitfied as Khitiz Gautam, Praveen Vishwas and Ishwar Singh. Police said that Ishwar was an engineering student. TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/4-held-for-posing-as-delhi-cops-to-abduct-bizman/articleshow/86665344.cms||---

---||Dehradun||HC quashes lower court’s order on lodging FIR against IIT Roorkee prof||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday quashed the order of a lower court in Haridwar directing registration of an FIR naming IIT Roorkee director Ajit Chaturvedi and several others. The FIR was filed on the complaint of an employee of IIT Roorkee, in which he had alleged that these officials were complicit in siphoning off over Rs 1 crore from the IIT fund. The allegation was that Dheeraj Upadhyay was posted as senior superintendent with the institute and siphoned off around Rs 1.05 crore. On August 25, 2020, he confessed to the wrongdoing and after inquiry, he was suspended on December 7. Within a few days, the FIR was registered at Kotwali Roorkee. But a retired professor, Manpal Sharma, approached the lower court, alleging that senior officials including the director, dean and registrar, of the institution were involved in the matter. The court then passed an order, directing the police to register another FIR naming the institute’s senior officials. The bench of Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe has now said two FIRs cannot be registered in the same case. The court has also allowed the police to increase the scope of the existing FIR if needed. "We had approached the court arguing that it was the institute which had approached the police to get the FIR registered. We told the court that all the allegations by the former professor were baseless and two FIRs cannot be registered in one case," said Vipul Sharma, advocate appearing for the IIT Roorkee director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-quashes-lower-courts-order-on-lodging-fir-against-iit-roorkee-prof/articleshow/86660589.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Nagpur||District 2 weeks away, 2 lakh short of 100% 1st jab coverage||NAGPUR: At the current pace, the district — with an estimated population of over 52 lakh — can complete the first dose for all eligible beneficiaries of Covid vaccine in next two weeks. However, vacancy hesitancy poses a hurdle in the last mile achievement. As on date, over 37 lakh beneficiaries have been jabbed with at least one dose. As per the state government, a little over 39 lakh of the projected population is eligible for vaccination, as they are in the 18+ group. The government is targeting vaccination of 75% population. Hence, the gap has reduced to just 4% between the vaccinated and unvaccinated in the district. In the week of September 18 to 24, the district saw 1.73 lakh inoculations including over 85,000 first doses. Thus, the remaining estimated 2 lakh beneficiaries can easily be jabbed with the first dose in two weeks. With civic and district officials taking special efforts, it remains to be seen in how many days the district covers the unvaccinated people. Interestingly, the break up of age-wise achievement shows the district surpassed the target for 45+ group by over 3 lakh jabs. As per the official estimate, nearly 16 lakh were to be jabbed in the 45+ group. As per Co-Win system, the achievement is 19.22 lakh as on Thursday. Thus, it is evident that mainly the 18 to 44 years group remain to be jabbed. This group was the last to be included in the vaccination programme. Though it started last, this group has the highest vaccination at 17.81 lakh as compared to the 45 to 59 years, and 60+ groups. The overachievement of 45+ group has been attributed to floating population and non-natives getting vaccinated here. Similarly, many youngsters in the 18 to 44 group took their jab outside the district during the vaccine shortage period. A couple of days back, the district crossed 10 lakh second jabs while the 84-day gap between Covishield doses seems to be prolonging the complete vaccination coverage. The gender gap still persists though, with 19.27 lakh men getting jabbed against 17.75 lakh women. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said special drives and initiatives are being undertaken to fulfil the last mile achievement. “Our teams are reaching out to all eligible beneficiaries daily. We are trying to remove hesitancy among those remaining,” he said. Dr Anup Marar, VHA convenor, said it would be imperative to reach out and ensure that the presently disinclined, small percentage of non-vaccinated citizens are brought to mainstream and vaccinated. “Moreover, the decision of prolonging the dosage gap may need to be reconsidered in view of their inclination and need of community to get their second dose in larger interests, and in view of vaccine availability,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/district-2-weeks-away-2-lakh-short-of-100-1st-jab-coverage/articleshow/86665362.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

As per the plan, only doctors registered with the Regional Transport Office (RTO) would be able to provide certificates. But now, unable to get the requisite number of doctors on board, the deadline was pushed. Transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne admitted to TOI, “There has not been much of a response from doctors, forcing us to extend the time limit for the plan’s implementation.” RTO is also developing a new Aadhaar-based system, which would free doctors from visiting transport offices to register.

Doctors will be able to link their Aadhaar numbers to an online system to get immediately registered.” Sanjay Patil, chairman of Pune Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) hospital wing, said they had met with RTO officials on the issue last week. “They convinced us about the new online plan.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Relaxation on circle rates extended by three months||NEW DELHI: Delhi government on Thursday extended the relaxation of 20% in the circle rates for three more months, till December 3, through a notification. The government had slashed the circle rates, or minimum rates for valuation of land and immovable property in the capital, by 20% for all categories for six months earlier this year. The aim was to bring relief to homebuyers and provide a much-needed boost to the real estate sector. The reduced rates, which came into effect from April 1, this year, were valid till September 30. “The discount of 20% in circle rate will continue. In this time of the pandemic, people of Delhi will not be allowed to face any problem. Will stand with them on every front,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi on Thursday evening. “With the city slowly recovering from the aftermath of Covid, here’s another good news for Delhiites!!! We have further extended the 20% slash in Circle rates till 31st Dec 21. Under CM Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi govt will support public in all times of need,” revenue minister Kailash Gahlot tweeted. Earlier this year, the government had said a reduction of 20% in the circle rate would have an impact close to a reduction by 1% in the stamp duty or registration charges. The circle rate is the minimum rate at which a sale or transfer of a plot, house, flat or commercial property can take place. At the time of registration of a property, the stamp duty is calculated based on consideration amount or circle rate, whichever is higher. In Delhi, the stamp duty is 6% of the consideration amount or the circle rate of the property, if the property is registered in the name of a man and 4% in case of women. The decision was taken with the belief that it would make it substantially cheaper for people to do property transactions, revive the real estate sector, which has been hit severely by the pandemic, and create new jobs. Although the reduced rates came into effect from April, the devastating Covid second wave also meant that, for at least two months, all business transactions in the city took a hit and the extension of reduced prices might be used by fence sitters to buy a property.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/relaxation-on-circle-rates-extended-by-three-months/articleshow/86663260.cms||---

Mayor Mukesh Suryan said that people would not face any difficulty paying parking charges as it will be automatically deducted from the tag pasted over the vehicles through the RFID system. “We have implemented the system to encourage online payment of fees and authorised National Highway Authority of India’s IHMCL to collect parking charges from Dwarka Sector-14 Metro Station parking lot and will remit the same with the civic agency. The SDMC will reimburse the agency charge at the rate of 1% of the transaction value to the IHMCL,” said the mayor. Considering there is a plan to set up the system at other places, the IHMCL will incur expenses related to setting up structures for toll collection, and the SDMC will not bear any cost. Commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said that the system would also reduce time while parking the vehicles. The SDMC presently has 140 surface parking lots for non-commercial vehicles, and of them, 113 are fully operational through contractors. Besides, there are six underground multi-level and two-stack parking lots operational right now. “Considering the FASTag will only read the sticker pasted on four wheelers, for two-wheelers and remaining surface parking lots with no proper entry points, the civic agency aims to launch its mobile app by this Navratri,” said Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner, remunerative and project cell, SDMC. “The app will also help in locating total vacant space available for vehicles, location of parking, booking, end disputes/complaints about overcharging as exact timings will be recorded, the contractor can't do cash collection and no excess parking beyond permissible limit as all information will be fed on online system monitored by the call centre. To attract people to download apps being made by a government organisation, we will also offer cashback or free parking facility on certain transactions,” added Jha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/south-corporation-gets-first-rfid-based-parking-rolling/articleshow/86663294.cms||Vibha Sharma

The bench of Justice A Rajasheker Reddy and Justice T Vinod Kumar was hearing a petition filed by the hospital charging the NCLT with reserving its judgment without hearing its case. The bench directed the tribunal not to pronounce its judgment without hearing the version of the hospital. Aruva Raghuram Mahadev, the counsel for the hospital, said that the NCLT bench had heard the argument of the lender, Omkara Assets Reconstruction firm, which is seeking initiation of insolvency process against the hospital and reserved its orders. “They should have heard us before reserving the judgment,” the counsel said. Asked why he had come to the high court now since there was a chance of the tribunal ruling in favour of the hospital, the hospital counsel replied that they will be rendered without a remedy if the tribunal ruled against the hospital. “An admission of insolvency petition will have many irrevocable damages to a firm,” the counsel said. The bench issued notice to the lender and stayed all further proceedings before the NCLT.

A short ceremony was held at the CISF Complex in Meghaninagar to felicitate the dogs by the Central Industrial Security Force Ahmedabad Zone Unit on Thursday evening. “Gracy and Molly are labradors while Candy is a cocker spaniel. These dogs have a sharp sense of smell. Each of them are around two and a half years old and were trained at the Dog Training Centre in Ranchi,” said a CISF official. Candy, Gracy and Molly were inducted as BDDS sniffer dogs at SVPI airportOfficials said they usually bring in different breeds of sniffer dogs. “The dogs have undergone rigorous training for six months. Their diet is prescribed by the veterinary doctor. The trio will be kept at the office of the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad at SVPI airport. The dogs will be kept on stand-by and called whenever there are suspected containers or unattended baggage. These dogs are brought in to sniff for the presence of narcotic substances and explosives,” said the official. Such bags are first checked using a metal detector and later sniffer dogs are brought in. Usually, BDDS officials also tend to get it sniffed by another breed of dog for double confirmation. The three Labradors which had been deployed at the city airport had crossed 10 years of age. Each of them were taken in by families in Ahmedabad. Sanjay Lodhi, a Meghaninagar resident, said, “I used to cook food for CISF personnel and the dogs. I am attached to them so I decided to adopt.” Devika Rana, a Class 10 student from Shahibaug, said, “I had a dog but it died. When I learnt about these dogs retiring, I decided to bring one home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/three-sniffers-retire-three-more-inducted/articleshow/86663333.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Dehradun||No univ affiliation, PhD & MSc courses suspended, WII 'may turn training centre or pvt institute’||Dehradun: The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has suspended its PhD and MSc courses while it resolves its recognition status. The Centre has been gradually pulling funds, a source said, and the institute may soon have to become a training centre or a private institute. The WII was set up as an autonomous institution under the Union environment ministry in 1982 and recognised by the Saurashtra University in Gujarat in 1988, preparing wildlife experts from India and 15 other countries. But the Centre has reportedly been asking the institute to become self-dependent for funds. “Disengagement by the government with a three-year timeline and a gradual reduction of 25% each year is recommended,” a report by the Centre’s finance section had said after an audit report on WII for 2016-18 by the DG (scientific department) in 2019. The audit report, on the basis of which the courses have been suspended, had referred to a 2009 UGC circular to say that “all the state governments were clearly instructed to stop their state universities (public as well as private) from operations beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the state.” It added, “A policy in this regard was also notified by UGC in 2013 which was required to be followed by all university established or incorporated by or under a State Act should operate only within the territorial jurisdiction allotted to it under its Act and in no case beyond the territory of the state of its location.” Citing these, WII director Dhananjai Mohan said, “UGC rules are very clear, so we can’t be affiliated to Saurashtra University. We would not want to risk the degrees of young students, so we have delayed the courses and not stopped them. PhD scholars will continue their courses at Forest Research Institute (FRI), a deemed university.” He added, “We had approached Doon University for affiliation but despite several meetings and consultations, it didn’t work out. So, we are exploring other options.” But can FRI hand out degrees? In April this year, while hearing a discrimination case filed by IFS officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi, the DOPT had said that his degree from FRI was not “from a recognised university or institution”. WII has nearly 160 PhD scholars registered at the moment. The dean of Saurashtra University, GC Bhimani, meanwhile, said WII was not affiliated to the university but recognised by it. “We recognise WII by virtue of our Saurashtra University Act, 1965, which says we can recognise an institution of excellence anywhere … We have not withdrawn the recognition.” WII alumnus and academics said they hope the government doesn’t abandon the premier institute. “Without the PhD and MSc courses, the place will lose its significance and not survive further. There are dime a dozen training institutions in the country,” said a professor at WII. A founding member of WII, who worked for WII in the early ‘80s, added, “The mandate of the institute is to create a pool of trained wildlife biologists with its Masters and PhD courses … The government should help it with affiliation. India’s best wildlife biologists come from WII.” Rajat Rastogi, an alumnus, further said, “The MSc in Wildlife Sciences has been a backbone of wildlife training and conservation education in the country. I hope we get to see more batches of wildlife professionals.” A senior IFS official added, “We will not be surprised if this institution is run by a private organisation soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-univ-affiliation-phd-msc-courses-suspended-wii-may-turn-training-centre-or-pvt-institute/articleshow/86660665.cms||Shivani Azad

It was said that Lovejot Singh was forced to apply for immigration, refugee and citizenship facility in Canada on getting life threats from the gangsters.The case will now come up for hearing on October 5 in the court of additional district and session judge Sandeep Kumar Singla in Mohali. Counsel CS Bakshi said in the case of contract killing by gangsters, the petitioner, who was the complainant and the eyewitness, was being repeatedly threatened and had to go to Canada. He had moved representations to the higher authorities and also filed a writ petition before the high court, he said. He added that there were many guidelines of the Supreme Court and the high court about recording of evidence through videoconferencing, which may be allowed to the complainant, who, in light of threat to his life, had applied for the immigration, refugee and citizenship in Canada.Asserting that the case has already been delayed, the court said, “In the facts and circumstances of the case, there would be no reason to deny the complainant right to be examined through videoconferencing. The rights of the accused can be taken care of and the court may pass appropriate order at the time of examination of this witness…the application filed by complainant Lovejot Singh for his examination through videoconferencing is allowed.”The family members of accused Amrit and Simrat had allegedly barged into Lovejot’s house and threatened of dire consequences if he deposed against them, so he fled to Canada. Lovejot had witnessed the killing of his uncle and husband of a Congress councillor from Banur Daljit Singh Walia, alias Princi, by unidentified men around 9.30pm on September 6, 2017. The murder took place when Daljit was taking a walk on Rajomajra Road in Banur, while the assailants came in a Ford Endeavour and pumped six bullets into his body. Banur’s police booked town’s municipal council president Nirmaljit Singh, alias Nimma, for murder after Daljit, husband of Congress councillor Preeti Walia, died. Sources said rivalry between Nimma and Daljit dated back to their school days, resulting in police cases. In 2015, Nimma became MC president with the SAD-BJP’s backing, but after the Congress wrested power in the state, attempts were allegedly made to unseat him. Nimma was booked along with Amrit, Simrat, Sukhjeet Singh, Deepu, Gurkeerat and three others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/eyewitness-to-depose-through-videoconferencing-from-canada/articleshow/86663233.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Orders were issued to regularise colonies that did not follow the 60:40 ratio of development. An official said, “The layout plan of colonies which are developed as per 70:30 ratio will also be approved by the civic body in PRN.” Experts said if such colonies are regularised, they would be more like slums as there would be no facility and open areas. Abhishek Sharma, who lives in the colony said, “Residents of PRN scheme will still remain deprived of facilities even after regularisation due to unequal development and as no land is left to develop the facility area. Though, they will procure the lease deeds, but hope for parks and other facility area will be finished.” According to Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) officials, 80% houses are already constructed in the 11,600 bigha scheme as per the last survey. The announcement to regularise the PRN scheme during the Prashasan Shero ke Sang has been made to benefit the residents starving of basic amenities such as roads, water, and electricity since long. However, if official sources are to be believed, the remaining land is not sufficient to develop facilities such as parks, community centres and hospitals among others. “In a colony, 30% land is required to develop the roads, drainage etc. In the current situation, the land is not even sufficient for construction of road and thinking of parks and a community centre is difficult,” an official said. In the Master Plan 2011, the scheme was marked as a special zone and the JDA had drafted a plan to regularise the scheme. In first draft, around 8,000 prepared constructed houses and shops were expected to get affected if the scheme is regularized, according to an official. In the proposal, the state government had divided the scheme into north and south zones where it was proposed that the south zone would have three 200-ft-wide sector roads, including an east-west road joining B-2 bypass with the Ring Road, another east-west road joining New Sanganer Road at Mansarovar’s VT Road to the Ring Road and a north-south road joining Sanganer town to the Gopalpura bypass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-prepares-to-regularise-undeveloped-prn-colonies/articleshow/86665434.cms||---

The AMC will have to enact rules that should cater to the city water balance plan, city water action plan and the city aquifer management. Another important component of the new mission plan will be compulsory segregation of waste at your homes as wet and dry, explains a senior AMC official. “The AMC has already begun bioremediation of waste at Pirana dumping site, which was part of the phase 2 of the Swachh Bharat mission,” added the AMC official. regarding waste water use the AMC has been asked to evolve a policy to differentiate between ‘black water’ and grey water—which can be mainly provided for alternative use. “Around 10% of Swachh Bharat projects will be implemented on PPP mode in million plus cities and Ahmedabad is among one of these cities,” adds the AMC official.

Police, meanwhile, claimed that the man was caught for theft and killed himself. Last month, the SC/ST court hearing the case had ordered that 12 men, including seven policemen, be booked under relevant sections of the IPC, including 302 (murder), and those of the SC/ST Act. The father of the deceased, Jaipal Singh, however, said he was unsatisfied with the investigation and had approached the high court earlier this month, demanding that the case be handed over to an independent agency for investigation. On July 12, a clash had taken place between Singh’s son, Neetu, and some men in his village. Later that night, some men allegedly accompanied by police had landed on their doorstep and picked up Neetu to take him to the police station. There was no news of him after that. Five days later, on July 17, Jaipal was called to Bijnor barrage where he saw Neetu’s body even as 25 cops were present on the spot. Jaipal alleged that he was forced to put thumb impressions on blank papers and his son was cremated without the family’s consent. The court on September 25 summoned Noorpur SHO, under whose jurisdiction the incident occurred, with a detailed investigation report and the autopsy on October 18. On Wednesday, Bijnor superintendent of police circulated copies of Constitutional provisions that protect citizens against illegal detention among local cops. The copies also detailed the extent of punishment that can be meted out to policemen guilty of such an act. Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh told TOI that he circulated them so that local police as well as people are aware of the rights of a citizen against Illegal detention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/allahabad-hc-seeks-report-on-custodial-death-of-dalit-man/articleshow/86660735.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Delhi||Delhi HC sets aside order of preventive detention||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Thursday said an order of preventive detention could not be sustained on “stale or illusory grounds”, which had no real nexus with past prejudicial activity. “Preventive detention being drastic state action based only upon suspicion arising from a person’s past activity, can be allowed, as the settled legal position mandates, only if there is a live, causal link between a person's past activities and the need for passing of a preventive detention order,” said a bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhami. The bench made the observations while setting aside an order of preventive detention passed against a person under the anti-smuggling law. In the present case, the petitioner was put under preventive detention under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange & Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 after a detention order was issued in January 2021 on the ground that he was allegedly “controlling a syndicate involved in effecting fraudulent exports and imports to evade Customs duty and earn undue export benefits, including IGST refunds through 33 non-existent and/or dummy firms”. Considering the material on record, the court observed that, while the detention order was passed in January, the last act which the petitioner undertook, and which may amount to prejudicial activity, was two years ago i.e. in December 2018. The court said it was evident that the live-link or causal connection between the petitioner’s preventive detention, meant to forestall him from indulging in any prejudicial activity, had snapped. “Delay in the passing and execution of a preventive detention order not only defeats the very purpose of such order, but more importantly, creates a doubt as to the necessity of adopting such a harsh measure against an individual, whereby the individual’s liberty is curtailed on suspicion alone,” it said. “We accordingly quash and set-aside order dated 15.01.2021, and direct that the petitioner be released from custody forthwith unless his custody is required in any other matter,” the court ordered. The Centre defended the detention order on the ground that the petitioner was operating under two identities which indicated his malafide approach towards the law. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-sets-aside-order-of-preventive-detention/articleshow/86663314.cms||---
---||Kolkata||After North Kolkata crash, KMC to implement eviction policy||KOLKATA: After the house collapse tragedy at Ahiritolla Lane, a section of Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s building department officials are advocating for the effective application of a building rule that empowers the civic body to demolish highly dilapidated portions of an insecure building to save its occupants. According to a civic official, the section 411 (4) of the building rules gives an executive or an assistant engineer of the KMC building department the right to demolish the parts of a building listed as “dangerous” that may endanger the lives of its occupants or inmates of the adjacent buildings. However, a KMC building department official said “restricted” use of the special rule had stood in the way of ensuring safety to those who have chosen to stay in the dilapidated buildings, risking their lives. “Taking a lesson from the house collapse tragedy at Ahiritolla, we should make the best use of the rule that allows us to demolish the dilapidated portions of an insecure building. Otherwise, we can’t prevent the loss of lives,” said a KMC building department executive engineer. “Whenever we seek approval from higher-ups for demolishing the dangerous portions of buildings without giving notice to their occupants, our proposals are turned down, fearing a public unrest. But time has come for us need to take the advantage of the rule and implement it for public safety,” said a KMC building department official. Without “forced demolition” of the extremely dangerous parts of a listed insecure building, there is hardly any other option left with the civic body to ensure the safety of the occupants, said several KMC engineers. The KMC had tweaked building rules, giving the owners of the dilapidated buildings 100% additional FAR (Floor area ratio) and relaxation of building rules so that they might feel encouraged to reconstruct the old buildings, keeping the interest of the tenants intact. Some KMC building department engineers said the formation of a demolition squad is needed to raze insecure buildings. “We need to look after 3,000 insecure buildings mostly in north and central Kolkata. Of these, 100 have been marked as extremely dilapidated. We need a dedicated building demolition squad for pulling down the vulnerable portions,” said an official. Deceased child got toys for her sibling:Priyanka Ghorui, who lost her three-year-old daughter Sreejita alias Sundori when a section of her paternal residence in north Kolkata’s Ahiritola Street collapsed on Wednesday morning following incessant rain, was scheduled to be admitted to hospital two days ago and her daughter was set to return to her father’s residence in the same neighbourhood. A mandatory Covid test had delayed it. The deceased had bought some toys for her newborn sibling the day her mother returned home. The woman, whose mother was also killed in the collapse, was rescued from the rubble and rushed to RG Kar Hospital where she gave birth to a baby girl in the afternoon. Two more cases of partial collapse:Large chunks of a four-storied building at Clive Row collapsed on Thursday. In a separate incident, a wall caved in at Burrabazar. No injuries were reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-n-kol-crash-kmc-to-implement-eviction-policy/articleshow/86663309.cms||Saikat Ray

The HC also told the state to explain its reasons for the amendment. A bench of Justice A Rajasheker Reddy and Justice T Vinod Kumar was hearing a PIL filed by bar council member Dr Sirikonda Sanjeeva Rao which dubbed the amendment as detrimental to the interests of advocates and demanded that authorities take up welfare activities for advocates as per the original trust deed registered on March 27, 2015. According to senior counsel S Ashok Anand Kumar representing the petitioner, the amendments by the state in May and October 2020 changed the objectives of the trust to serve all economically weaker sections instead of only advocates as was originally conceived. “Advocate general (AG) used to be the chairman of the trust. Now the AG has been replaced with state law secretary and the post’s name too changed as managing trustee. Some attempts are also being made to create two classes of advocates and divide them,” he alleged. The bench posted the case to next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trust-row-hc-notice-to-tbar-council/articleshow/86663321.cms||---

Bhujbal told the media that he has already directed the city police to probe Kande’s claims about getting threat calls. Bhujbal too has apprised NCP chief Sharad Pawar about the entire issue. Kande has given an written complaint with details to the Nashik city police, which is being probed. The police have not yet registered a case in connection to his complaint. Addressing reporters, Kande said that he had met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and two Sena ministers, Eknath Shinde and Subhash Desai, at Mumbai on Wednesday and apprised the trio about the threat call that he had received. “All three of them have assured me that they would look into the issues raised by me, which not only pertains to the threat call but also how Bhujbal has been denying development funds to my constituency,” he added. The district guardian minister is the ex-officio chairman of the district planning committee. Kande questioned how Bhujbal’s own constituency (Yeola) could be allotted Rs 80 crore and his constitnuecy only Rs 2 crore in the current financial year. Bhujbal’s son lost to Kande, a first-time legislator, in the last assembly elections. Bhujbal claimed that so far the district has received Rs 750 crore for the development work. “As the district guardian minister, the disbursement of funds to MLAs in the district is done in a non-partisan manner. The bulk of the funds that the district has got so far was meant for utilisation on the Covid-19 pandemic. My feedback is that Nandgaon has received Rs 45 crore of developmental works so far. More funds would be allocated to Kande’s constituency in due course of time once the district gets fresh funds from the state government,” Bhujbal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/kande-again-fires-threat-salvo-bhujbal-counters/articleshow/86660738.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Fly menace: 16 poultry farm owners receive notices||Panchkula: A special task force committee formed by the Panchkula deputy commissioner on Thursday issued notices to 16 poultry farms after various anomalies were found in the wake of a complaint by the animal husbandry team. With swarms of flies disrupting lives of village residents, Panchkula administration is taking action against poultry farm owners on Barwala-Raipur Rani belt flouting norms issued by them. Deputy commissioner (DC) Vinay Pratap Singh formed a special task force committee to take up the issue of the fly menace on the Barwala-Raipur Rani belt. The committee comprises poultry farm association members, animal husbandry department, Pollution Control Board officials and representatives of affected villages. During the meeting, the DC asked poultry farm owners present to adhere to guidelines issued strictly, failing which they would be liable to strict punitive action. Representatives of affected villages in Barwala-Raipur Rani had told the DC that while regulations had brought a measure of relief, the problem was far from solved.

In his inaugural address, Thackeray stressed on balanced development keeping in harmony with nature and hoped the newly-raised training centre in the premises of Maharashtra Environmental Engineering Training and Research Academy (MEETRA) at Nashik will prove to be real ‘Mitra’ (friend) of sustainable development. “In today’s world, it seems that development and environment are antonyms. Our stress is that development should never be at the cost of environment and hence, this centre at MEETRA will help us change the picture,” said Thackeray. Minister of food, civil supplies and consumer protection and Nashik district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse, water supply and sanitation minister Gulabrao Patil were present at the centre. The Centre has three green buildings, a fully computerised R&D facility, training centres, administrative block and hostel that can accommodate over 200 trainees at a time. The R&D set will carry out extensive research related to clean drinking water supply and sanitation. Pawar said that Nashik will also have Krishi Bhavan soon. In addition to building institutions, they should also be run in a quality manner and the government should make every effort to ensure that they are used in the long run. The result of those efforts is ‘Mitra’, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cm-opens-centre-for-excellence-in-water-supply/articleshow/86660788.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi high court seeks views of govts, cops, bar body on security in courts||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Thursday took suo motu cognizance of the Rohini court shootout last week, and said there was a need for proper and effective deployment of a sufficient number of police personnel in courts. A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh also issued notice to Delhi Police, Delhi government, central government as well as Delhi High Court Bar Association and directed that suggestions in the form of an affidavit or a report be filed on the issue of maintaining security in courts. “We have taken suo motu cognizance of the incident that took place in Rohini court. This court wants valuable suggestions from respondents for security at all court complexes in Delhi,” the chief justice said, adding these will then be shared with the city police commissioner. The bench said that there was a need for a fool-proof entry system in courts, installation of metal detectors, under-vehicle surveillance system and proper training of police personnel. It noted that “because of the incident on September 24, there is a need for effective deployment of sufficient number of cops and more CCTV cameras.” While taking cognizance the bench made it clear that other petitions relating to the incident and security of court complexes will be tagged with the suo motu case to avoid multiple litigation. Jailed gangster Jitendra Gogi and his two assailants, posing as lawyers, were killed inside the Rohini courtroom on September 24 in a dramatic shootout that also saw cops fire in retaliation. Video footage of the incident showed policemen and lawyers rushing out in panic as gunshots rang out inside courtroom number 207. The two gunmen are suspected to be members of rival Tillu gang, an official had said, adding that over 30 shots were fired. On September 24, chief justice of India N V Ramana had expressed deep concern over the shootout inside the crowded Rohini courtroom and spoke to chief justice Patel in this regard, reportedly advising him to talk to both police and the bar association to ensure that the functioning of the court is not affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-views-of-govts-cops-bar-body-on-security-in-courts/articleshow/86663370.cms||---

During the separate statehood movement, TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao had on several occasions openly stated that “the agenda of Maoists is my agenda”. He had promised to implement the agenda of Naxalites as the rebels were struggling to provide food to the poor, house to the homeless and land to weaker sections. Revanth’s public meeting drew a huge crowd in BhupalpallyAccording to Revanth, the Naxal agenda does not call for the murdering of youth, looting of thousands of crores of rupees. He accused CM K Chandrasekar Rao of betraying Sonia Gandhi, saying, “He (KCR) was simply a TRS MP in parliament when the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill was approved, and after the goal was fulfilled, he ditched Congress party.” Revanth went on to say that the chief minister and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were inseparably linked. “TRS never talks about proposed new farm rules, only posturing as if it opposes the Centre and proposed laws,” he stated. The TPCC chief stated that the victory race will begin from the Bhupalpally constituency, expressing confidence that Congress will win 100 assembly constituencies in the next state polls. Revanth slammed local MLA G Venkataramana Reddy who was elected on a Congress ticket but moved to TRS. “With the help of the ruling party, the MLA maintained his unlawful businesses of sand transportation, fuel mixing, illegal coal carrying, and real estate,” Revnath alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-questions-trs-govts-naxal-agenda-in-bhupalpally/articleshow/86663364.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

Amid the chaos, the members of the family safely managed to get out of the house and lock the leopard inside. They also informed the forest department about the big cat following which a team was sent to the spot. However, taking advantage of the darkness, the leopard successfully managed to escape from h a window in the back of the house. P A Awale, range forest officer for Patne in Chandgad, said, “Raju Bhagu Lambor lives in Chandgad taluka along with his wife, one son, three daughters and two grandchildren. On Tuesday night, the Lambor family had dinner following which one of Lambor’s daughters went outside to feed the dog. However, before she could come back and close the main door, the dog ran inside as it was being chased by the leopard.” He added, “The leopard first jumped on the children lying on the bed and then jumped towards the dog. Lambor, however, showed presence of mind and started shouting due to which the big cat got confused and climbed on the kitchen loft. This gave the family members enough time to get out of the house and lock the leopard inside.” Later, the family went to their neighbour’s home and called the forest department. “ No member of the Lambor family got injured in the incident. The leopard also has safely gone into the forest. We are monitoring the situation closely,” Awale said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/close-shave-for-kolhapur-family-of-eight-after-leopard-enters-house-while-chasing-pet-dog/articleshow/86660278.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Around four other victims approached the same address which the accused used to prepare the fake identity.The victim, Mohit Dhiman, a resident of Pinjore, said he gives his camera on rent when not in use to earn extra money. He said he put his Cannon 200 Mark D camera with charger and extra lens, all worth Rs 80,000, for rent on OLX website. He said he was contacted by a person who identified himself as Sumit Grewal, supposedly working for Tech Mahindra on September 23. The accused said he wanted the camera to cover an event at a private university in Chandigarh. Mohit gave his house address to collect the camera. The accused reached his home on September 24 and gave driving license and registration certificate of a Safari car issued in Mohali. He also signed the rent agreement. After completion of formalities, he gave the camera to him. However, he said that the accused did not return the camera and when he called his mobile phone, it was switched off.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Few pre-schools stayed afloat by going online||AHMEDABAD: Nutan Patel, the owner of two pre-schools in Vastral, says they had 600-odd students before the pandemic. This number has been reduced to 100 at present. “We run online classes but parents are not willing to supervise. Also, these children are unable to even hold pencils on their own and need the constant physical presence of teachers,” she says. While pandemic has resulted in the closure of the majority of preschools in the city, there are a few that have managed to remain afloat by switching to online classes. The shift, however, comes with its own set of challenges, given the tender age of the children involved and the financial crisis many parents are facing due to the pandemic. Swati Popat Vats, president of Early Childhood Association and Association for Primary Education and Research, says the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a toll on pre-school education, with the majority of such facilities closing down in the past one and a half years. “About 85% of a child’s brain develops at this time and it’s a no-brainer to gauge the impact of the closure of pre-schools can have on these children,” she says. That a 30-year-old playschool in Satellite recently shut down as it could not find enough takers amid the pandemic is testimony of the challenges these institutions face. “It’s next to impossible to run online classes for pre-school children. There is a huge risk to the health of the kids by calling them to school. The lives of these children are more important than their education at this stage,” said the owner of a school, who spoke on condition of anonymity. As far as online learning goes, it is not very effective for children of these age who require a personal touch and in-person human communication, he adds. There are people like Firdosh Lalkaka, who runs one of the oldest pre-schools in the city located in Navrangpura along with few others who have managed to keep their schools running by switching to online classes. A manager of a playgroup in Bopal says there were at least eight playgroups in Bopal of which only a couple of them are functioning today. One of the main reasons for their closure is that with parents at home due to pandemic, they did not prefer to send their children to playgroups. These playgroups were incurring a monthly loss of over Rs 1.5 lakh per month, resulting in their closure. Those in the rented premises were the first to shut down and it now the turn of those who are running from their residential premises, he says. As per estimates by some playschool authorities, more than 30,000 teachers and other staff members have become unemployed in the last one and half year. “Most of the playschools employ women in large numbers and they are the ones who are worst affected in this period,” said Popat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/few-preschools-stayed-afloat-by-going-online/articleshow/86663397.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Delhi||Late stutter: Delhi misses rain record||NEW DELHI: With the city recording 18 rainy days in September, the highest number of days in at least 10 years, Delhi’s base station recorded 230% excess rainfall this month. With the monsoon season ending on Thursday, Safdarjung saw the wettest monsoon in 57 years this time with 1,169.7mm rainfall. India Meteorological Department’s data shows Safdarjung received 413.3mm rainfall in September as opposed to the normal 125.1mm rainfall. It was the second-highest rainfall to be recorded in the month in 121 years. However, due to the break in the showers in the last week of the month, the city failed to break the all-time record of 417.3mm rainfall by just 4mm. The highest ever rainfall over Safdarjung in September was witnessed in 1944. The month saw three heavy rain days, including one very heavy rain day. Over 200mm rainfall was recorded in the first two days of September, but as rain eluded Delhi in the past five days, the city could not beat the 1944 mark. The monsoon period between June 1 and September 30 also recorded excess rainfall, with rainfall at Safdarjung measuring 1,169.7mm, while the normal mark of the monsoon period is 653.6mm rainfall. It was way back in 1964 that Delhi had a wetter monsoon season with 1,190.9 mm of rainfall. Despite the late arrival of the monsoon on July 13, the city received 507.1mm rainfall in July, a surplus rain of 141%. With just 34.8 mm rainfall, June saw a deficit of 47%. Though August was in a deficit of 13%, it still recorded 214.5mm rainfall. September again received excess rain. “Except Cyclone Gulab, all monsoon systems affected the north-west region leading to good rainfall,” said a Met official. After the late arrival of monsoon, its withdrawal is likely to be delayed. “Delhi has already surpassed its normal withdrawal date of the monsoon of September 24,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. IMD has predicted the withdrawal of monsoon from some parts of north-west India from around October 6. However, a Met official said the monsoon is expected to withdraw from Delhi after October 6. The Met department has predicted very light rain over the next four days. The maximum temperature was 35.2 degrees Celsius on Thursday, while the minimum settled at 26.4 degrees Celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/late-stutter-rain-record-missed/articleshow/86663432.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||HC: Scholar’s plaint against research guide ought to be dealt with by grievance panel||Aurangabad: The Bombay high court at Aurangabad has held that a complaint by a research scholar against a research guide would not fall within the ambit of an inquiry committee set up under the Maharashtra Public Universities (MPU) Act provisions, but ought to be dealt by a grievance redressal mechanism provided by an Ordinance of the university concerned. “The powers of the Vice Chancellor or any authority constituted under Section 47 and 48 of the Universities Act would not allow the university to proceed on the report submitted by a such inquiry as its constitution is illegal,” the high court bench of Justice Ravindra Ghuge and Justice S G Mehare ruled on September 27 while quashing and setting aside an order of October 3 last year by the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (BAMU). The impugned (under challenge) order had removed Prof Prashant Amrutkar from the post of dean of faculty of humanities department, besides cancelling his recognition as a research guide and his post as a professor with the university’s department of political science. Apart from setting aside the order, the HC also ordered Amrutkar’s reinstatement “to the post from which he was removed.” In August last year, a research student under Amrutkar had lodged a written complaint with BAMU accusing the research guide of seeking an illegal gratification. Acting on the same, the BAMU vice chancellor had set up an inquiry committee under Section 48 (5) (a), which completed the inquiry and recommended the three actions against Amrutkar. This formed the basis of the impugned order and a subsequent challenge to the same by Amrutkar in the high court. At an extensive hearing of the matter, BAMU’s lawyer placed before the court a September 24 letter by the university registrar that the university would follow the procedure laid under its Ordinance 1009 (F) (14) which provides for a grievance redressal mechanism. However, senior lawyer Rajendra Deshmukh, representing Amrutikar, submitted that the university’s inclination to follow the procedure laid under the Ordinance was one thing and an illegal inquiry having been conducted against the petitioner was another thing. The bench said, “In our view, considering the complaint against the petitioner, it is obvious that the committee formed by the Vice Chancellor of the University is non-est (legal term meaning does not exist). A complaint by a research scholar against a research guide would not fall within the ambit of the constitution of a committee for conducting an inquiry under Section 48(5)(a).” It went on to add that any recommendation by such committee cannot be acted upon as its constitution itself was illegal.  When contacted, BAMU’s lawyer Siddheshwar Thombre said, “The University will conduct an inquiry in accordance to the Ordinance and based on the findings, appropriate action will be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-scholars-plaint-against-research-guide-ought-to-be-dealt-with-by-grievance-panel/articleshow/86660855.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Every day, 400 metric tonnes of waste is generated in Dehradun but no segregation takes place on the ground level’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/awareness-drive-in-doon-get-food-discount-coupons-in-return-for-plastic-waste/articleshow/86660813.cms||Sukanta Mukherjee

In a statement on pending issues involving BC communities, he stated that the TRS government uses the votes of these communities but never looks after their well-being. While PM Narendra Modi has offered opportunities to 27 BC ministers in the union cabinet, Sanjay pointed out that in the state, eight BC ministers would have had opportunities, but it did not occur. He claimed that the state administration made a big deal about forming a committee with BC ministers, MPs, and MLAs as members, but then did nothing. “Rs 5,522 crore was allocated in the current budget for BCs, but funds are not released,” he said. Sanjay observed that self-employment loans for BC communities had been issued only twice since the founding of the state. “Nearly 5 lakh persons applied for loans but, because 2018 was an election year, only 50,000 people received loans,” he claimed. He went on to say that the state government established BC commission only due to Huzurabad by-polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-wants-bc-votes-not-their-welfare-bandi/articleshow/86663399.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Six turncoat MLAs put Congress in a spot in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The Congress is yet to settle its problems in Punjab and fresh trouble has surfaced for it in Rajasthan. Four of the six BSP-turned-Congress legislators from the state have reached New Delhi to seek ‘legal and political’ support to save their assembly memberships challenged before the Supreme Court under the anti-defection law. The BSP and the BJP challenged the six MLAs’ memberships before the apex court and the Rajasthan high court soon after Sachin Pilot revolted against CM Ashok Gehlot’s leadership last year. The apex court on September 21 directed the six MLAs to submit their defence within four weeks, which has prompted them to scamper for support. If the six lose their memberships, Congress would be reduced to 100 seats in the 200-member house. Pilot camp’s support would become even more crucial for the stability of the Ashok Gehlot-government in that eventuality. There are 71 BJP MLAs and 13 independents, besides others, in the state assembly. Two seats are vacant, for which bypolls are scheduled on October 30. The legislators, whose merger into Congress was orchestrated by Gehlot in 2019, are said to be miffed with the Congress central and state leaderships for providing neither a “strong legal support” in courts nor accommodating them in the government. There were news reports that they were now ready to seek political support outside Congress too. Wajib Ali, one of the four MLAs camping in Delhi, however, refuted reports about seeking political support elsewhere. MLA Joginder Singh Awana, who along with MLA Deepchand Kharia, has stayed back in Rajasthan, told the media in Jaipur that he was unaware of his four colleagues planning to meet BSP supremo Mayawati or BJP leader Amit Shah. “We again received a SC notice asking for a reply in four weeks recently, so maybe my colleagues got disturbed a bit. We joined Congress after following all legal procedures and will stay with it. Congress has a strong legal team to defend our case in the apex court,” Awana said, after meeting Gehlot. Awana is likely to join the four MLAs—Wajib Ali, Rajendra Singh Gudha, Lakhan Singh and Sandeep Yadav—in Delhi soon. The four MLAs met senior lawyer Devdutt Kamat in Delhi on Thursday. BSP state president Bhagwan Singh Baba, who moved the petition before the top court, told TOI, “We will not accept them back in the party at any cost. They have cheated us twice. All six will lose their memberships; we have faith in the court.” Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas dismissed reports that the six MLAs were seeking political support outside Congress as they were disappointed in being ‘ignored’ for long. “All six are now an integral part of the Congress and there is no threat to their memberships. We will not let any injustice happen to them,” the minister said. Khachariyawas claimed there was no threat to the stability of the Congress government in Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bsp-turned-cong-mlas-fear-losing-seat-turn-up-in-delhi/articleshow/86665536.cms||---

The accused had initially claimed that their friend had stabbed himself to death. The 35-year-old victim Suresh Bhuriya, a native of Madhya Pradesh, was rushed to hospital on September 28 by the three accused — Rajesh Hariprasad, Hari Om Sakshi and Munna Prasad Hariprasad. Bhuriya had gone to meet the trio at Sakshi’s room at Varsamedi village. At the hospital, Bhuriya’s wife Rajju was threatened by the accused trio to tell police that Bhuriya had stabbed himself to death in an inebriated condition. Police were suspicious about the death and the postmortem report on Wednesday confirmed that Bhuriya had not stabbed himself but was stabbed by someone else. There were other knife injuries found on his body. Based on suspicion, Munna was picked up for questioning and he admitted that he and the two others had killed Bhuriya. Investigation revealed that Rajesh had borrowed Rs 1,300 from Bhuriya but was repaying it. During the tiff on September 28 over the money, Bhuriya was allegedly killed by the trio. Police registered a murder case and also included various sections of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act based on a complaint given by Rajju. While Munna was formally arrested, the other two accused are on run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/three-stab-friend-to-death-over-rs-1300-loan-one-arrested/articleshow/86660443.cms||---

Police on Thursday said accused Irfan Haider (29) and his mother had brought the girl from Muzaffarpur in Bihar two months ago to do domestic work. The police received a video, in which the girl was seen cleaning the staircase and removing garbage from the man’s two-storey house at Netaji Nagar in suburban Santacruz, said a police officer. “The girl was made to work for a family of six. We tried to contact the child’s mother in Bihar, but couldn’t get through to her,” said inspector Manoj Shinde from Vakola police station. Haider mother’s told the police that the girl’s mother had willingly handed her over to them as the child’s father was an alcoholic and would beat her up.

---||Agra||Two years after girl's death, blood samples of 200, including Uttar Pradesh minister’s son, taken for DNA test||AGRA: In 2019, a Class XI student, 16, was found hanging in the prayer room of her residential school at Mainpuri. Initially written off as a suicide, the injury marks on her body and the postmortem report led to another disturbing finding — she had possibly been raped. Two years on, a new SIT investigating the case has in its fresh investigation collected blood samples of suspects, including that of the son of a UP cabinet minister. “Blood samples of nearly 200, including that of a cabinet minister’s son, have been collected for DNA tests so far. The girl’s friends and classmates are also being questioned,” Mainpuri SP Ashok Kumar Rai said. The cabinet minister told TOI that the allegations against his son, 32, are “politically motivated” but he had his son, 32, cooperate with the investigation. “We have nothing to hide,” he said. “Opposition parties are trying to tarnish my image and that of the party.” Police said forensic experts from Lucknow, Delhi and Hyderabad have been engaged to help with the case and map DNA samples of the girl. The girl’s mother’s statement has also been recorded. “A reward of Rs 1 lakh has been announced for leads in the case,” ADG (Kanpur zone) Bhanu Bhaskar, who is heading the SIT, told TOI. The previous SIT had recorded statements of about 300 people, taken blood samples of over 100 and conducted polygraph tests on 12. There was little headway, however. Two weeks ago, the Allahabad high court had pulled up UP Police for its investigation, following which DGP Mukul Goel admitted to “serious lapses in investigation” and said three police officials have been suspended. In December 2019, CM Yogi Adityanath had removed then-Mainpuri SP Ajay Shankar Rai for “inordinate delay” in investigation. When the girl’s body was found, it was believed to be a case of suicide. “But her hair was messy, there were nail scratches on her nose, arms and chest. Her legs had blue spots, like someone had pressed hard,” the girl’s mother told TOI. “These details were not in the postmortem report.” The court order said that the postmortem report had found clotted blood in the vagina and a torn hymen. An FIR was lodged on the basis of her father’s complaint against the school principal, warden, a student and an unidentified person on charges of rape, murder, offences punishable with imprisonment for life, acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention, and under the Pocso Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/2-yrs-after-girls-death-blood-samples-of-200-including-up-cabinet-mins-son-taken-for-dna-test/articleshow/86660919.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Speaking at an event organised by Rajasthan Solar Association and National Solar Energy Federation of India where Union minister of state for new and renewable energy Bhagwant Khuba attended, Kalla said economic zones dedicated to solar equipment manufacturing is the key to reduce import and create large scale economic opportunities in solar sector. Kalla said Rajasthan government would be willing to extend tax sops if the Centre decided to offer incentives on its part. Reacting the minister’s comments, the industry representatives said if the state and Centre decide a policy mechanism to push manufacturing, the industry would be keen to build a vibrant manufacturing sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/energy-min-urges-centre-to-set-up-sezs-for-solar-mfg/articleshow/86665573.cms||---

While the number of new cases registered every day may hint at this, the number of active cases suggests otherwise. The number of active cases in the city and district has nearly doubled in two weeks. From 12 active cases on September 16, the number increased to 26 on Thursday. There is no significant change in the hospitalisation number too. On Thursday, only four Covid-19 patients were admitted to hospitals of the city. Out of 4,984 beds in the city, 4,980 were vacant. Sources said that the four patients would include those from the Vadodara city and district as well as from other places too. Sources said that it was usually patients in ICUs that remained admitted for a long period. But if Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) data was an indication, only one person from the city and district was on oxygen support and none on BiPAP machines or ventilators. Hospital data revealed that only one patient was in a ICU in city hospitals. VMC’s medical officer health Dr Devesh Patel said that there were hardly any new cases and hospitalisation was very low. “Covid-19 patients should ideally get discharged in a two-week cycle,” he said. He added that the data will have to be looked into. Sources added that there was no explanation for the increase in active cases when most patients were being treated at home and had mild symptoms. Negative tests are also not required if the patients undergo the stipulated period of isolation and recover completely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodaras-active-corona-cases-tally-double-in-fortnight/articleshow/86659701.cms||Sachin Sharma

The state government has alleged that AP was modifying the scope of the project by adding new components without taking approval from Apex council and KRMB. The TRS government said it was against the provisions of the AP Reorganization Act, 2014. The Telangana wrote half a dozen letters in the past couple of weeks on various issues like stopping the AP government against construction of Pinnapuram hydro-electricity project, rectification of vents on Nagarjuna Sagar left and right canals to draw water from its designed capacity, complaining KRMB on alleged unauthorized construction of Pothireddypadu head regulator, SRMC, Bankacherla regulator and diversion of 34 tmcft from Srisailam and diversion of Godavari water to Krishna by AP and it cannot claim additional share as per Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)-1. In the latest letter on Wednesday, the Telangana irrigation engineer-in-chief C Muralidhar complained to KRMB on GNSS saying that the AP government had given administrative approval for improvements like widening and providing lining to GNSS main canal to increase the discharge to meet the requirement of lift scheme with about Rs 305 crore. In another order, the AP government gave approval for construction of a lift irrigation scheme to lift 150 cusecs of water from GNSS main canal to fill the tanks.AP did not request for allocation of water out of dependable flows to GNSS under section 89 proceedings before KWDT II, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-urges-krmb-to-restrain-ap-from-expansion-of-gnss/articleshow/86663449.cms||Koride Mahesh

He asked the agencies to provide heaters to guards and staff and added that suggestions for the Winter Action Plan could be sent to greenwarroom@gmail.com within two days. “All the studies regarding pollution in Delhi are pointing at two factors— first, the vehicular, dust and biomass pollution within Delhi, and second, pollution coming from outside. We discussed with RWAs, eco clubs and other environmental and social groups that, though the government is bringing in rules, regulations, and policies to curb pollution, it continues to rise. We have discussed steps to curb pollution in Delhi," Rai said. He added that a basic example was how people took multiple trips to markets to buy groceries and household items. “The solution is to go once a week and get all the stuff. We discussed how people react to such ideas and how social groups are working to curb pollution." The minister said, as most of the people supported “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaign, another suggestion was that RWAs should organise carpooling. “We will also work on issuing guidelines to RWAs, NGOs and construction and other agencies that employ workers, especially ones working at night, like security guards, to provide them with heaters. RWAs are showing interest in organising workshops for increasing awareness as well," said Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/working-with-rwas-to-curb-pollution-rai/articleshow/86663482.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Monthly tally in Mumbai up 42% but caseload in Maharashtra dips||MUMBAI: Monthly tally of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai rose 42% from August to September, while the statewide caseload dipped 33%.Mumbai: Monthly tally of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai rose 42% from August to September, while the statewide caseload dipped 33%. BMC officials attributed the rise in September to easing of restrictions on the travel and entertainment sectors. “Train travel was possible for vaccinated individuals from August 15, eateries opened up and social mingling increased due to the Ganpati festival,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. The September tally (12,994) is closer to July (12,557) cases than August (9,166). Fatalities in Mumbai dipped from 157 in August to 133 in September. “Although cases increased in September, the rise wasn’t as steep or severe as feared,” said a civic hospital doctor. And while number of active cases in the city has increased, hospital admissions haven’t shot up. The city added 451 cases and seven deaths on Thursday taking the total cases to 7.42 lakh and 16,110 deaths. “The number of critical patients on September 1 was 413 while it’s 273 on September 29,” the doctor added. ICU patients in the same period dropped from 602 to 495. Officials said despite opening up sectors, cases across the state have stayed low, which is a sign of the second wave ebbing. Also fatalities in the state dropped to 1,754 this month from 2,809 in August. September's death toll is, in fact, lowest since February. Officials said the Ganpati season which saw an increase in outings and social inter-mingling too didn't lead to a sharp increase in cases. "It is nearly 1.5 months since we opened up most sectors and there is no significant surge in many areas. The state has also aggressively vaccinated people in the last two months,” said an official. The case fatality rate too has dropped to 1.3% in September from 1.76% in August. “Cities like Mumbai and Pune are still reporting significant number of cases, but number of critical patients have dropped and so most of the patients are getting treated at home or are in the hospital for lesser number of days,” said the official. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force on Covid-19, said the state’s monthly tally is the lowest in eight months (the January tally was 94,123). “Vaccination has played a role in keeping the numbers low, but people shouldn’t throw caution to the wind and continue wearing masks,” said Dr Joshi. He said the third wave, if at all, wouldn’t occur before December or January. “The second dose vaccination has to pick up in order to blunt the severity of any future Covid peak,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/monthly-tally-in-mumbai-up-42-but-caseload-in-the-state-dips/articleshow/86663546.cms||Malathy Iyer

SP (City) Vikas Kumar told TOI that the tourists were unaware of any such restrictions in the area and were released. The use of drones is strictly prohibited in and around Taj due to "security reasons”. In February 2017, the district administration of Agra had issued an order in this regard. Hotel owners near Taj were tasked with apprising tourists, particularly foreigners, of the restrictions. Despite the order, over such 25 incidents have been reported in the past three years in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/drone-spotted-near-taj-mahal-tourists-let-off-after-warning/articleshow/86660978.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The BMC’s education department on Thursday held meetings with educational institutions to take stock of their preparedness to welcome back students on October 4. The BMC on Wednesday gave the nod to reopen classes 8 to 12. Schools and colleges will have to follow the standard operating procedure (SOP) laid down by the state. The civic education department has clarified that if teachers are not fully vaccinated, they can be allowed for physical teaching provided they have done a negative RT-PCR test 48 hours prior to being in schools and colleges. Only teachers teaching classes 8 to 12 have to be called for physical classes. The remaining teachers will continue to take online classes, the department has stated. Terming it as too short a notice to put in place all SOP laid down by the state, schools and junior colleges said they will need around two weeks to get started with in-person teaching. State education department officials told TOI for physical learning to start, schools and colleges have to first get parents’ consent. “All schools have been told to have PTA meetings to help decide how may students are willing to attend,” said an official. Between Friday and Saturday, several schools have called for PTA meetings. Educational institutions have also started sending out consent forms to parents. A survey of Class XII by St Xavier’s College showed 53.3% of 647 parents who participated are in favour of physical classes. Details of students who are away from the city since the pandemic but are attending online classes have also been sought by the education department. Teachers said many who returned to their villages managed to buy devices for online classes and are now reluctant to attend physical classes. Parents have also expressed concerns about uniforms. “If a student has to return to school, he/she will need uniform,” said a teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-schools-jr-colleges-to-hold-pta-meets-register-at-med-centres/articleshow/86665650.cms||Sandhya Nair

The bench comprising Justice Sabina and Justice Manoj Vyas gave the order while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Gitesh Khanna. Counsel Neerja Khanna told the court that the campaign was being organised by the state government in all districts of the state from October 2. Under the campaign, a target had been set to give land leases to lakhs of people. The petition mentioned that the master plan had been ignored. A drafted parallel master plan had been prepared by the state government to do away with the provisions of the initial master plan. "At the same time, it is being implemented without approval. Also, to facilitate the beneficiaries, the government has also amended other related laws and thus relaxed multi-storey buildings and kutcha settlements," Khanna said in the court. "Thus, it is not only contrary to the present master plan, but also against the decision of the chief bench of the high court in a PIL," Khanna said. He added that under the campaign, there was a plan to regularise the encroachers, who had illegally occupied kutcha settlements, by giving them lease deeds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-seeks-reply-from-raj-on-planned-land-deed-campaign/articleshow/86665660.cms||---

However, on Thursday morning, his body was found in the jungle near his house. His face and head were crushed. “The post-mortem report reveals that the boy died almost 24 hours earlier, which means around 2 -2:30 pm,” said Singh, adding that ante-mortem injuries were reported in the autopsy report. His mobile phone was also missing and police are trying to locate it. His elder brother, a class XI student, said uncle called on his mobile around 7:40 pm and someone answered it but immediately disconnected. The SP added that Harsh was last spotted in CCTV footage of the area around 12:41 pm carrying food in a polythene bag. When asked about it, a local shopkeeper confirmed that the boy had bought four packs of chowmein and two pastries from his shop. Harsh, whose father works in a private firm, got a mobile phone just a few months ago and started his Instagram account as a video creator. “He was very active on Instagram and made several videos,” said his brother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/missing-boy-14-found-murdered-in-mathura/articleshow/86661024.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Doctors are getting tests done for other diseases too, such as dengue, scrub typhus, malaria and even swine flu, but these are also testing negative. “In two days of fever, some patients are developing acute respiratory distress syndrome,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, RUHS Hospital. Doctors are repeating RTPCR covid test of admitted patients, but they are showing Covid negative. Since they are tested negative for dengue, the doctors are calling these cases of dengue-like illness. “The symptoms are similar to dengue but they are not getting tested positive for dengue. All such cases are categorised as dengue-like illness,” said Dr Singh. The ICUs in some of the private hospitals are running with full capacity. “We are receiving patients with high requirement of oxygen along with atypical pneumonia and viral pneumonia. But, the good thing is that they all are responding well to the medication,” said Dr Sheetu Singh, consultant pulmonology, at a private hospital. From different parts of the city, such cases are being reported including a retired government employee from Shastri Nagar area, who had involvement of lungs and his platelet count was low. “At the time when he was brought to me, his platelet count was below one lakh per microliter of blood and his lungs had infection.

The minor, who would have turned 16 in November, had been arrested on drug possession charges He was produced in court as an adult, not a juvenile justice board, and sent to jail, not a juvenile detention centre, on Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act charges in March.  He was released on bail after three months because police could not file a chargesheet but, humiliated and harassed, he killed himself at home, TOI had reported. The NHRC took cognizance of a complaint with which the TOI report was attached. The Etah SSP has been asked to submit the report answering three questions — “under what circumstances the juvenile was treated as an adult”, why the matriculation certificate as date of birth proof was not considered, and “what protocol is followed to assess the age and date of birth of the accused by police.” The NHRC has also asked its investigation division to “conduct an on-the-spot inquiry, analyze the case and suggest the institutional measures, which could be recommended the government to ensure that the children are not being treated as adult for prosecution.” It added, “The investigation division has also been directed to look into the role played by all the concerned stakeholders in this case, including the judge, before whom the child was produced within 24 hours of the arrest, and the role of the doctor who examined the child. The inquiry report is to be submitted within six weeks.” ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna had ordered an FIR against the cops based on a complaint by the boy’s father. Four policemen — sub-inspectors Mohit Rana and Shiv Kumar, head constable Upendra Kumar and constable Ravish Kumar — posted at Kotwali Nagar police station of Etah district were booked under IPC section 306 (abetment of suicide). Etah SSP Udai Shanker Singh said, “The case against the four policemen has been transferred to the crime branch for detailed investigation."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/toi-impact-nhrc-orders-probe-into-role-of-judge-doc-cops-in-suicide-of-minor-jailed-as-adult/articleshow/86661081.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Delhi||Delhi court clears AAP MLA in suicide abetment case||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday discharged AAP MLA Sharad Chauhan in a 2016 case of alleged abetment of suicide committed by a woman party member, saying simply because he was the local MLA it cannot be considered as incriminating circumstances against him. The court, however, directed to frame charges of abetment of suicide against Chauhan’s associate Ramesh Bhardwaj, and said there was sufficient prima facie evidence to hold him responsible. The woman had filed a complaint against Bhardwaj for alleged sexual harassment a month before her death. Special Judge MK Nagpal said there was no prima facie evidence or material on record to show the existence of any criminal conspiracy between Bhardwaj and the other accused people for abetting the suicide by the deceased. “Simply because A-2 (Chauhan) was the local MLA and A-1 (Bhardwaj) or any other accused was close to him or his name is there in above two messages, these cannot be considered as incriminating circumstances against him so as to hold him prima facie responsible for the offence of abetment of suicide by the deceased, either in pursuance of said criminal conspiracy or individually,” the court said in the order. It also discharged Mohan Lal Verma, Sanjay, Amit Bhardwaj, Rajnikant and Mukhtiyar Singh. The court said there was sufficient prima facie evidence to hold Ramesh Bhardwaj responsible for commission of suicide by deceased and framed charges under Section 306 of the IPC. “So far as the role of A-1 is concerned, it can be seen that by his repeated acts and conduct, he had left no other option open for the deceased, except to take her life because even after the incident of sexual harassment, he remained continuously harassing and threatening the deceased in various ways and was trying to force her to come to a compromising term with him,” it said. “There is sufficient prima facie evidence on record to show that threats were extended by him during his visits at her parlour and school, telephonically through one Mangal Singh and also by dropping of a threat letter at her parlour,” the court said. According to the prosecution, the woman had consumed a poisonous substance at her home in North-West Delhi’s Narela and died during treatment at LNJP Hospital. In her complaint, the woman had also alleged that the accused was being protected by Chauhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-clears-aap-mla-in-suicide-abetment-case/articleshow/86663582.cms||Usha Das

The 40-year-old accused woman first lured the girl to her house in Indiranagar under Ghazipur police station where she tied her up after which her 45-year-old husband raped her several times in seven days. “To hide their crime, the couple chopped the survivor’s tongue to ensure she is unable to speak and tell anyone about her sufferings. Somehow, the girl fled from the clutches of the husband-wife duo and reached home. When her wounds started healing, she told her family about her ordeal through signs and a case was lodged,” said ADCP, North, Prachi Singh. “A 19-year-old girl of another locality lost her way while searching for an address on September 21.

---||Ahmedabad||Cyclone Gulab turns into Shaheen||AHMEDABAD: It was all textbook for Cyclone Gulab, that started as a depression in Bay of Bengal on September 24. The system got intensified as a deep depression and later a cyclone that made a landfall on Odisha and Andhra Pradesh coasts two days later. A tropical cyclone, it became the third cyclone in 2021 to hit India after Tauktae and Yaas. But something unusual happened when it ran the course of the Indian peninsula. The cyclone got weakened gradually after wreaking havoc on the eastern coast of India and bringing heavy rains to central states. The depression moved westwards to Vidarbha in Maharashtra and some districts of south Gujarat. “It started getting stronger. The primary reason was availability of monsoon trough – a system that was already giving good rainfall to Gujarat. The depression got moisture from the system and continued its westward journey,” said a senior Met department official. “As it reached Arabian Sea, the depression got intensified into deep depression. By late Thursday or early Friday, it would be a full-fledged cyclone, which would be named Shaheen.” The cyclone is likely to travel as far as Middle East after traversing Pakistan coast. “The phenomenon (of a cyclone from Bay of Bengal to again emerge as cyclone in Arabian Sea), though recorded earlier, is rare. The simple reason is loss of intensity once the landfall takes place. It would not have happened if it were not in the ongoing monsoon season,” said the official. The system has resulted in heavy to very heavy rainfall in several parts of Gujarat since Tuesday, which is likely to continue on Friday. Due to active monsoon in September, the state came back from the brink of a deficient year. September alone accounted for 54% (426mm of 789mm) of seasonal rainfall. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said that the deep depression has resulted in widespread rainfall on western coast of Saurashtra and Kutch. Kalyanpur and Khambhalia got 113 mm and 65 mm rainfall in Devbhoomi Dwarka district, followed by 56mm and 52mm in Chotila and Thangadh in Surendranagar, and 47mm each in Mandvi and Lakhpat in Kutch district. “The rain intensity would reduce from Friday onwards with the cyclone moving away from Gujarat coast. The parts of Saurashtra and Kutch may receive rains on Friday, whereas other parts may get light showers. From Saturday onwards, the state may record reduction in rain activities,” said Manorama Mohanty, head of IMD Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gulab-shaheen-when-a-rose-turns-into-a-falcon/articleshow/86663596.cms||Parth Shastri

This too can happen here, if we are not vigilant,” he said. Raising the Hindutva pitch to a crescendo after offering prayers at Ramjanmabhoomi and Hanumangarhi, the Bengaluru South MP called on Hindus to unite against satanic forces trying to lay siege to the country, alluding to the epic war of Mahabharata. He credited PM Narendra Modi for the construction of the Ram temple. “Modi Ji has fulfilled his oath to the people on building the temple at Ramjanmabhoomi. Today, Ayodhya is liberated,” he said. “I come from Karnataka, the land of Bajrangbali Hanuman and I have got the opportunity to serve Lord Ram in Uttar Pradesh. Hindus have to be strong to defeat satanic forces, which are uniting against PM Modi, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and BJP. Lord Ram chose us to eliminate these satanic forces. Karnataka has its own relationship with UP. Many youths from UP work in my parliamentary constituency and I work for them,” he told reporters. Lauding Yogi Adityanath for the makeover of UP, he said, “Yogiji's work is mentioned in every newspaper in Karnataka. Today, people like Mukhtar Ansari and Azam Khan are behind bars. Development is making giant strides in Uttar Pradesh.” The BJYM president, who was given a rousing welcome by party activists and leaders, performed aarti on the Saryu banks. Later, he tweeted — “Countless generations of our ancestors sacrificed their lives to reclaim our civilisational right. We are a lucky generation which sees culmination of a 500-year struggle against Islamic imperialism.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-ayodhya-tejasvi-warns-against-talibanisation/articleshow/86665701.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Lucknow||Cops with criminal background should be dismissed, says UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said that policemen engaged in “criminal offences” should be identified and dismissed from the service. His announcement came amid controversy over the death of a Kanpur businessman at a Gorakhpur hotel during police verification drive. His family and friends claimed Gupta was assaulted by the cops. The CM’s stern direction came during a high-level meeting of team-9 in Lucknow. He said that there have been complaints about police officers/personnel indulging in illegal activities in the recent past. “This is not acceptable at all. There should be no place for such people in the police,” the CM said, asking authorities to identify such people “with proof and provide a list”. “Action will be taken against all of them as per rules,” he said, categorically maintaining that police officials involved in criminal offences should be dismissed from service. “Tainted officials should not be given important posting in the field,” Yogi said. The development came a day after Yogi announced Rs 10 lakh as ex gratia for Gupta’s family and suspended six cops, including the station house officer of Ramgarh Tal police station. All the six were booked for murder. On Thursday, the CM met Gupta family during his Kanpur visit and accepted most of their demands. Yogi’s hardened stance came against the backdrop of opposition upping the ante over the incident to needle the ruling BJP in UP. Even as SP chief Akhilesh Yadav reached Kanpur to meet Gupta’s family, BSP chief Mayawati demanded a CBI probe into the incident. The BSP president said that it was “grossly unfair” to save the policemen who were prima facie guilty of vandalism resulting in the death of a businessman. She said that the police first did not register a case of murder on the accused police man. “When a case was registered following a public outrage no arrest was made. All this raises a question,” she tweeted, demanding “proper financial help” and a government job for the victim’s family. A day ago, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had alleged that UP was “soft” on criminals and “brutal” on common people.  “The government is also being trusted by the relatives of the deceased,” BJP said in a tweet. The ruling party specifically hit out at SP, accusing it of looking for an opportunity to do politics on unfortunate incidents. “The SP is doing cheap politics over a dead body. The BJP government is committed to take hard action in the case,” UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cops-with-criminal-background-should-be-dismissed-says-yogi/articleshow/86665731.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Delhi||SDMC mayor goes to cops over graft charge||NEW DELHI: A day after AAP councillor and leader of Opposition in South Delhi Municipal Corporation Prem Chauhan made graft allegations against mayor Mukesh Suryan, the latter filed a complaint at Kamla Market police station for maligning his image. Chauhan claimed that the mayor had taken bribes from advertisers, which is why no action has been taken against the illegal unipoles on the DND flyway. In the letter, the mayor requested police to investigate the matter and take appropriate action against the AAP councillor for making baseless allegations in the media and on social media. In a press statement, SDMC said that in an interview with a social media news channel, Chauhan had claimed that the mayor takes bribes of Rs 5 lakh per month to keep up illegal unipoles and gantries on DND flyway. “In addition, the AAP councillor is also circulating the audio clip of the accusations against the mayor without any base and substance,” the statement said. The complaint claimed that the allegations were made to malign the mayor's image and gain political mileage for the forthcoming civic body elections. “He has committed an offence of defamation by making false allegations against the mayor within the meaning of Section 499 of the IPC and is liable to be punished for the offence of defamation,” stated the complaint. In response to the complaint, Chauhan stated that he stands by his statement that unipoles and gantries are installed illegally at places. “Filing a complaint by the mayor is an attempt to distract from the issue of illegal poles. I am ready to face action but would have appreciated it if he had also ordered an inquiry in the matter of illegal unipoles. The civic body has no money to regularly pay the arrears, pensions and salaries of staff, but is still not ready to take action against illegal operations,” said the AAP member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-mayor-goes-to-cops-over-graft-charge/articleshow/86663625.cms||---

September 2021 was 99.8% less fatal than 2020||NAGPUR: With just 779 new cases and only six deaths due to Covid, September 2021 has confirmed that the pandemic is moving towards becoming an endemic now. In September 2020, the 11 districts of Vidarbha region had reported more than 90,000 cases in 30 days which means average 3,000 new cases per day. In comparison, 28 cases per day were reported in September this year. Death toll last year was 2,428 and this year only six patients died. According to experts, all these are the positive signs. “There were strict restrictions in September 2020. Still, more than 3,000 cases per day were reported in Vidarbha. Now, we have almost opened up fully. Even schools are functioning in rural areas since more than six weeks now. Cases are still under control which means we are on a right path,” said epidemiologist Anand Thatte. Almost a week after Ganeshotsav and other festivities, the case graph in Vidarbha is firmly stuck to the baseline. Nagpur district, where a hasty announcement of ‘third wave’ was made earlier this month, reported zero new cases for the first time in pandemic – on September 29. Out of near 4,500 tests per day on an average, 12-14 new cases are being detected in the district. Conditions in other parts of Vidarbha are even better. There was no Covid death in Bhandara, Gondia, Yavatmal, Buldhana, and Washim districts in entire September month. The only death reported in Nagpur was of a patient referred from other state in serious condition. In Akola, a man who was brought dead from Katol found Covid positive. In Gadchiroli, a 70-year-old man died. Chandrapur, Amravati and Wardha also reported one death each in this month, which is lowest-ever since April 2020 – when even the first wave was to set in. Vaccine is also playing its part. Death toll has gone down significantly. Serious cases have become rare. Even if tested positive, patients are not in need of oxygen or ventilators. Covid wards are almost empty as less than 200 patients are under treatment. The number of patients is so less for the first time since May 2020. Most patients are still in home isolation. Now, more than 10,000 tests are being conducted daily on an average and less than 30 of them are tested positive which means the test positivity rate is less than even half percent. A member of Covid-19 task force told TOI that October is going to witness three major steps of unlock. “Temples, schools and cinema halls will open in October. It would be interesting to see the outcome. If conditions remain the same, we can confirm in November that the pandemic will become endemic,” said the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-endemic-now-sept-21-was-99-8-less-fatal-than-20/articleshow/86658167.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||Industrial units seek emergency credit||AHMEDABAD: Shortfalls in revenue, decline in demand, production shortfalls, surge in raw material prices and stretched payment cycles were among the worst after-effects that plagued industries post the lockdown of 2020. To meet overhead costs and other operating expenditures, several industries, particularly, MSMEs availed emergency credit to battle the disruptions caused due to the pandemic. Clearly, the number of loans sanctioned under emergency credit line guarantee scheme (ECLGS) surged by a whopping 140% in a year, according to the latest report by State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC).  The 170th SLBC meeting was held earlier this week, during which the report was released. It states that the number of industries seeking loans under ECLGS surged from 1.5 lakh in the first quarter of 2021-22 to 3.6 lakh in the corresponding quarter this year. During the same period, the amount of loans sanctioned too surged from Rs 7,480.29 crore to Rs 23,424 crore. The cumulative disbursals at the end of the first quarter of 2021-22 stood at Rs 20,434 crore in Gujarat under ECLGS. “To meet piling overhead costs amid revenue shortfalls and stretched payment cycles, a number of industrial units took loans. Since the interest rate of loans extended under ECLGS was 7.5% which is lower than what is extended to industries otherwise, certain units also availed these loans to repay other loans so that they can save on interest money,” said MM Bansal, convener, SLBC – Gujarat. “The definition of MSME was changed by the Union Ministry of Finance last year by including service sector units under MSMEs and increasing the turnover limit upto Rs 100 crore for a unit to be classified under MSME. As a result, more companies availed the benefit of emergency credit, made available as part of the relief package under Atmanirbhar Bharat,” Bansal added. Sectors such as apparel, garments and textiles, hospitality and tourism, among others witnessed a relatively slow revival, suggest industry estimates, and therefore, brought in more takers for emergency credit. Industry players said that while demand revived slowly, piling raw material costs since October 2020, also one of the reasons for surge in industrial units availing emergency credit. “Raw material prices have doubled across all sectors including real estate, chemicals, textiles, among others. After the lockdown, demand began reviving and export orders began to pour in. To meet the production requirements amid surging costs, many industries have opted for emergency credit,” said Hemant Shah, president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/industrial-units-seek-emergency-credit/articleshow/86663655.cms||Niyati Parikh

NMC superintending engineer (PWD) Ajay Pohekar said the civic body has decided to recarpet these tar roads, which have not been carpeted for almost a decade. TOI has been constantly highlighting the bad condition of tar roads across the city. According to a NMC public works department survey, most of the major tar roads are 12 meters wide and 20km long. NMC will require approximately Rs16 crore to recarpet these 20 roads. Pohekar said most of the roads are major thoroughfares and are in a shambles. “Though 20 roads have been identified, NMC may take up more roads, or replace those in the list with other roads. The list is not final yet,” he said. The city has 3,642.08km of roads, of which NMC owns 2,482.94km, NHAI (29.80km), NIT (965.32km) and state PWD (107.02km). Besides, PWD also owns the 41-km inner ring road. A senior official from the NMC public works department claimed that the condition of NMC owned roads is not bad as compared to roads owned by other agencies like NHAI, NIT and state PWD. Most of the roads which are in bad shape are in Laxmi Nagar, Dharampeth and Ashi Nagar zones, the survey revealed. Corporators told TOI that most of the tar roads in the city have not been re-laid for years. “The civic body had been repairing only potholes and doing patchwork,” pointed out senior Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe, who also endorsed NMC’s survey about major tar roads in Laxmi Nagar zone being in a bad shape. They need to be re-laid urgently, he said. “Since last two terms I have been watching that the NMC public works department is only interested in doing patchwork and pothole repair work,” he claimed. He pointed out that there is no system in NMC for re-carpeting tar roads. It should be done automatically without waiting for anyone’s demand, he said, and cited the example of NMC’s property tax collection system, which generates tax invoices every year to the taxpayers. According to him, it is mandatory for NMC to provide pothole free roads to the taxpayers. NIT’s help sought for repairing potholesThe Nagpur Municipal Corporation has sought Nagpur Improvement Trust’s help to repair pothole riddled roads in the city. “We will pay the civic agency if it repairs potholes on NMC owned city roads,” said Pohekar. Besides, NMC has also asked it to repair or recarpet bad roads in its jurisdiction in the city, the SE claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-wakes-up-from-10-yr-slumber-to-recarpet-20-potholed-roads/articleshow/86658143.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Ahmedabad||Mudra loan NPAs balloon 54% in a year in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Plagued by disrupted cash flow cycles and a slow recovery post pandemic, micro entreprises, vendors, small traders and seasonal businesses were among the adversely hit over the past one year.  As small businesses failed to recover post pandemic, their loan repayment capacities weakened, pushing bad loan burden under Pradhan Mantri Mundra Yojana (PMMY) up. While fresh disbursal of loans under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) increased merely by 10% from Rs 1,920.29 crore in the April to June quarter of 2020-21 to Rs 2,089.22 crore in the corresponding quarter this year, NPAs swelled from Rs 555.54 crore to Rs 856.52 crore – up 54.17%, during the same period According to experts, micro enterprises which typically avail Mudra Yojana were the worst affected due to the pandemic-induced lockdown. MM Bansal, convener, SLBC – Gujarat said, “Post lockdown, small businesses were adversely hit as they do not have adequate capital or contingency funds. As demand failed to revive and income was impacted, loan repayment capacity weakened and due to this, more accounts were classified as NPA.” Echoing a similar view, Pathik Patwari, senior vice president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) said, “Cashflow cycles of micro enterprises were adversely affected and many were out of the ambit of emergency credit line guarantee scheme due to the turnover limit. In some cases, adequate credit was also not available to these units as a consequence of which their bad loan burden increased.” Industry players said that several small units and traders had shut down their businesses post lockdown. Majority of the borrowers under PMMY include small traders and people from lower income groups. Explaining their situation, Jayshree Vyas, managing director, SEWA Bank, said, “During the lockdown, many people lost their jobs or source of income due to a slowdown-like situation as a result of which family incomes were impacted. While businesses barely began resuming normalcy, the second wave hit, during which medical expenditures eroded savings and contingency funds. People lost earning members of their families and consequently, their loan repayment capacities weakened.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mudra-loan-npas-balloon-54-in-a-year-in-gujarat/articleshow/86663693.cms||Niyati Parikh

Another Rs 25 lakh was committed by Dr Gautam Bhansali Golden Hour Foundation. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said Ajanta Pharma and WTC have tied up with private hospitals, which will procure the vaccines and provide them to the BMC. “We will provide the infrastructure and manpower while they will give the doses,” he said. Dr Bhansali said their aim was to add momentum to the city’s vaccination rate. “We will target areas where there is hesitancy too by roping in students as well as young medical graduates,” he said. Bombay Hospital will procure vaccines using the CSR funds and hand them to the BMC for administration. Since funds have come in, CSR vaccination may start in 3-4 days, he said.

They had issued a final notice to the minister of medical education Amit Deshmukh on Tuesday. TOI had reported last week that the resident doctors are planning to go on strike as they are feeling ditched by the state government. The letter addressed to Amit Deshmukh, signed by the office-bearers of the central committee of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) stated that doctors of MD, MS, Diploma, CPS, DNB, DM and MCH qualifications will participate in the strike. “We are not going to call off this strike unless we get the written and time-bound assurance from the state government on our just demands of tuition fee waiver, Covid allowance and better hostels,” said Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale Patil, president of central MARD. He added that verbal assurance by any minister will not be accepted henceforth. “We had two meetings with the medical education minister and he assured the fee waiver to us, both the times. But as soon as the Covid-19 conditions started improving, the verbal assurances were forgotten,” said Dr Dhobale. Resident doctors have said that despite strike, they will continue serving in intensive care and critical care units. They will also attend casualty duties and provide all types of emergency services as they don’t want patients to suffer due to their strike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/resident-docs-to-go-on-strike-from-today/articleshow/86658223.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Nagpur Municipal Corporation to start MS-CIT course for IX, XI backward class students||NAGPUR: In yet another positive move, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to provide Maharashtra state certification in information technology (MS-CIT) course training to backward class students of standard IX and XI from this academic session. The NMC’s education department has decided to offer MS-CIT course, which will equip students of NMC-run schools more employable with necessary job and digital skills. The NMC will spend around Rs15 lakh per annum for providing the professional course. The proposal will come up at the general body meeting to be held on October 4. A senior official from the NMC’s education department said that the government provides various scholarship schemes for students. There is no fund or scheme for professional courses like MS-CIT, which may help the students in NMC-run schools become self-reliant. As the civic body too is facing a financial crisis, it has decided to fund the project from economic weaker section committee. The committee has already allocated Rs19 lakh fund as scholarship for backward class students in the current financial year. The education department has also shortlisted 337 students from class IX and 50 students from class XI for the certificate course. The estimated fees for each student is around Rs4,000. For providing the MS-CIT course to 377 students, the NMC will spend Rs15.08 lakh. Every year, the fund for the MS-CIT course will be made available through the economic weaker section committee, said the official. “However, students will have to pay the fees for the course which will be later reimbursed by the education department,” the proposal submitted before the general body meeting stated. The GB will also discuss other proposals including sanctioning of an additional fund of Rs78.65 crore for strengthening water supply system in the city, distribution of land rights in Borkar Nagar and demolition of dilapidated public toilets in Khalasi Line. The amount will be utilized for various works including rehabilitation of 20 elevated storage reservoirs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-start-ms-cit-course-for-ix-xi-backward-class-students/articleshow/86658206.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Lucknow||Multi organ donation fulfils farmer’s wish to ‘live forever’||Lucknow: Ranjeet Singh, 56, would often say to his family members, “Hazaron aaye or gaye, par duniya bahut kum logon ko yaad rakhti hai” (There have been so many but only a few are remembered) After the demise of this Shahjahanpur resident last week, the heartening gesture by his kin giving consent for multi-organ cadaveric donation (MOCD) will now ensure that Singh lives forever. Singh, a farmer, was referred to KGMU from Shahjahanpur on September 18 after being critically injured in a road accident and unfortunately could not survive despite best efforts by doctors. After Singh was declared brain dead on Tuesday, his family decided to donate his organs to those in wait for transplant. “We are a poor agricultural family from Himmatpur village. We all agreed to donate organs because nothing is greater than service of humanity in our religion. We are happy that my father has now become immortal,” said Singh’s son Udham. The decision to give nod for MOCD wasn’t easy, but counselling by organ donation cell in surgical gastroenterology department motivated Udham. “The family agreed after two rounds of counselling in which we explained how their decision will save several lives,” said Peeyush Srivastava, a member of the MOSD counselling team. After getting the family’s consent, KGMU informed various organ transplant organisations for allocation of heart, lungs and intestine, but no recipient was found. Liver and kidneys were found unfit. Corneas were retrieved by KGMU Eye bank. “The family’s endeavour to serve humanity is an example for the society,” said vice-chancellor Lt Gen Prof Bipin Puri. “The act would inspire many other and help in saving lives,” said Lt Gen Prof BNBM Prasad, faculty, critical care medicine department. In MOCD, after a patient is declared brain dead, organs are retrieved for transplant in other needy patients. Pair of kidneys and lungs, liver, heart, pancreas, intestines, corneas and skin tissues among others can be retrieved. At least 100 cases of brain deaths are reported in KGMU in a year, of which 20% can be used for MOCD. The annual requirement of kidney for transplant in UP is 31,000, liver about 25,000 and cornea about 20,000, but only about 5% of these demands are met.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/multi-organ-donation-fulfils-farmers-wish-to-live-forever/articleshow/86665825.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 30 medical students at KEM test Covid +ve||MUMBAI: Thirty medical students from Seth GS Medical College (attached to KEM hospital), Parel have tested positive for coronavirus, one of the biggest clusters of breakthrough infections seen in public hospitals in Mumbai since vaccination started. Barring two, all are fully vaccinated and most have mild or no symptoms, authorities said. Dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said 23 of them are second year MBBS students and seven from first year. Thursday evening 16 were admitted to SevenHills Hospital, Andheri; their condition was described as stable. First and second year MBBS students don’t treat patients and hence it is unlikely to have spread through contact with them. “These are all breakthrough infections, which are routinely seen now, as the primary role of vaccines is not to cut transmission but to prevent severe disease and deaths,” said Dr Deshmukh. The first student to test positive early this week was from the second year, who had symptoms. Subsequently, 3-4 more came positive. A contact tracing exercise was then started at the hostels. In all, of 120 students tested, 30 came positive. Dr Deshmukh said all 900 MBBS students will be gradually tested. Those who came positive were residing in hostels at three locations. The college has decided to suspend physical classes and return to online teaching. Dr Gajanan Velhal, head of the preventive social medicine wing which is tasked with contact tracing on campus, said they are trying to find the source of infection for the index case. “While Covid protocols are strictly followed in classrooms, there is no control over their lives during post college hours,” he said. Early in the day, mayor Kishori Pednekar had said the infection may have spread at a cultural or sports event in the college. Authorities, however, said no events had taken place recently. The second-year students had exams two weeks ago. Some were in dance and drama rehearsals for their upcoming college fest, Aavishkaar. Dr Deshmukh said the college does 400-450 tests daily, in which one or two breakthrough infections are routinely seen in health workers. Earlier, BMC had followed up 20lakh vaccinated Mumbaikars and found barely 7,057 (0.35%) had got Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-thirty-medical-students-at-kem-test-covid-ve/articleshow/86663742.cms||---

He alleged religious bias claiming he was attacked after he revealed his name and religious identity. The cops however, refuted this, claiming the youth was attacked after he flouted rules and failed to make an entry at the gate. The youth stated that he along with his supervisor had gone to the society for a delivery on Sunday. “When we entered the society, the guard began abusing us for not entering our details at the gate. Other guards began attacking my supervisor with sticks so I ran. However, two men caught me and asked me my name. When I revealed it, they began hitting me. When I called out my god’s name, they asked me not to make such utterings. Then all four began thrashing me,” he said, adding that other society members came to his rescue. After being treated at LG Hospital, he lodged a complaint under IPC section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 294 (b) (utters any obscene words, in or near any public place) and 114 (Abettor present when offence is committed). However, Amraiwadi inspector D B Maheta said, “There is no evidence that the youth was targeted on grounds of religious bias. We checked CCTV footage and found that the youth had entered the society without giving his details at the gate. This led to the attack.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-thrashed-by-guard-alleges-religious-bias/articleshow/86663719.cms||---

More than 750 samples have been collected in the first phase and 5,000 more will be tested from October 5 onwards, said Prajakta Lawangare-Varma, divisional commissioner of Nagpur division. The results of this serosurvey are expected by October end.“The survey got delayed because we were short of kits required for it. We started with initial 800 kits. But, the survey size this time is 6,000. So, the community medicine department of GMCH Nagpur has to procure more than 5,000 kits, which will reach by October 5. The collection and testing in full swing will start from October 5,” said Varma.The first full-fledged serosurvey was conducted in October 2020, in which nearly 50% prevalence of Covid-19 was found in the people of the city. The sample size of the earlier survey was 4,000.“There are total 80 clusters — 40 each in Nagpur rural and city. Samples will be collected age-wise from these clusters. We have been told by the GMCH that they will include the paediatric population too,” she said.Divisional health officials told TOI that vaccination which is underway in full swing will play a crucial role in seroprevalence of Nagpurians. “Most likely, we will get better and promising results as compared to the 1st survey. If more than 70% of participants have natural antibodies, its a big step towards herd immunity,” said a senior official.Serosurvey is generally conducted once the case graph hits the baseline. For Nagpur district, the case graph is stuck to the baseline since more than a month now.‘No home isolation is good for Nagpur’The divisional commissioner supported municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B’s decision of making institutional isolation mandatory for all Covid-19 positive patients in Nagpur. “It’s a good decision. NMC is also providing good isolation facilities at MLA hostel. In case they require hospitalization, they are being taken to AIIMS. It’s a good decision for a crowded city like Nagpur. There is no need to implement the same measures in places like Bhandara and Gondia where we focus mainly on Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Varma.Bigger and better 6,000 samples to be collected and tested for Covid-19 antibodies from city and ruralSamples of healthy people who never contacted Covid-19 in the last 2 years will be collectedPaediatric population (0-19 years) to be included this time, unlike the 18-65 age group in 1st surveyThe community medicine department of GMCH Nagpur will conduct tests and prepare a reportResult expected by October-end; vaccination to play a crucial role in developing antibodiesMay bring good data about seroprevalence and herd immunity in Nagpurians||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2nd-serosurvey-results-by-oct-end-divn-commr/articleshow/86658261.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Business||T rolls out draft space-tech policy to attract investments||Hyderabad: In a bid to attract investments from space players, the Telangana government on Thursday released its draft ‘SpaceTech Framework’ and called for comments from stakeholders by October 25. The policy framework aims to propel Telangana as a one-stop destination in the space-tech segment by becoming an end-to-end manufacturing hub from design to testing as well as launch activities. It said that there is a huge dependency on ISRO’s capabilities for availing testing services. While certain infrastructure would only be available with ISRO, a set of sector agnostic infrastructure would be available in national research institutions across the state such as ARCI, NRSC, Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), among others. The state government will facilitate and establish a system where under-utilised infrastructure of such institutions can be leveraged for testing of space tech systems. The draft policy noted that manufacturing of satellites and launchers utilises various materials that require very specific characteristics. To support the industry in this procurement process, state agencies like T-Works will leverage their network of suppliers. Further, to reduce the dependence on imports, the state government will partner with institutions such as Hyderabad-based ARCI to undertake material research, standardization and development efforts in partnership with the space tech industry. The state will also support the development of any commercial ground stations with strategic land allocations and facilitating approvals. It also states that space-tech players will be provided land at competitive prices, access to data, IP advisory, co-working space, skilling support and tailor-made incentives. The state government will also set up a space-tech accelerator center in partnership with T-Works, RICH, T-Hub and We-Hub to provide the required incubation, infrastructure, authorisation support, market insights, investor connect and mentorship support for space-tech startups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/t-rolls-out-draft-space-tech-policy-to-attract-investments/articleshow/86663744.cms||---

The villagers pointed out that they had to travel an additional two to five kilometres to reach their farms that were on the opposite side of the expressway.Pointing out that the expressway, slated to be completed in 2022, had added to their woes, residents of the Mandya villages alleged that it had been designed for the benefit of the rich, who could cruise along the thoroughfare at breakneck speeds. Induvalu Basavaraju, a leader of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS), said that the engineers had constructed many bridges and underbridges, which would prove useful only to the motorists. “The residents, on the other hand, will have to take a circuitous route to reach the opposite side of the expressway. The government must have considered the problems that designing the expressway in such a manner might pose to the ordinary people,” Basavaraju said.Mandya MP Sumalatha Ambareesh, who has expressed reservations about the design of the expressway, reiterated her stance on the project. “Many residents lost their farms and houses to this project. But the expressway has been designed in such a way that it has made their life harder. The service roads are too narrow and not safe for use. The overbridges and underbridges must have been built, taking into account their convenience,” Sumalatha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mandya-villagers-protest-poor-design-of-expressway/articleshow/86658347.cms||---

Though WCD and its task force had already opened bank accounts for 69 Covid orphans and another around 1,965 children having lost one of their parents, state government’s Rs 5 lakh and central’s Rs 10 lakh are yet to be deposited whose interest would have helped them meet expenses especially of the education for many of them.Divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavanghare-Verma, who was present along with divisional deputy commissioner, WCD, Ravindra Patil and district women and child development officer Aparna Kolhe, sounded concerned about the education of the children of the affected families and insisted upon taking up the issue with the collectors during her speech. She said that education of the girl child faces maximum threats when any family faces any precarious situations. Verma also urged NGO Sahyadri to contemplate helping the beneficial with some skill development and investment plans to make them self sufficient. “Government agencies would need to find and reach out to families who are yet to be covered under some or other beneficial schemes,” said Verma.Verma’s concerns reflected in the voice of a 16-year-old girl from Parseoni whose father died in Covid this year and mother had passed away in the past. Even as her wait for the proposed government grant is yet to arrive, the teenager girl’s education is in jeopardy because she do not have a cellphone to attend classes and appear for online examinations.Second among the three sisters, the girl stated that only their eldest sister has a phone which she uses for her own education. She and her two sisters stay with her widow aunt whose elder son is the only breadwinner for a family of seven. “With the Rs 30,000 I got today, my sisters and I would first deposit our fees and purchase books,” she said.A 17-year-old boy, whose father died of Covid in December last year and mother of cancer a few years back, said the Rs30,000 would help him deposit fees in his NEET tutorial class. “We have no clue when the government grant would come,” said the teenager whose two elder sisters are also in vocational training.District child protection officer Mushtak Pathan said 1,250 beneficiaries would receive Rs30,000 in the first phase followed by others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/awaiting-govts-proposed-rs15-lakh-grant-covid-orphans-get-relief-from-ngo/articleshow/86658391.cms||Soumitra Bose

Petitioner Prashant Mehta submitted that he is a grandson of Kirtilal Mehta, who founded the Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust. Kirtilal had built a vault in the basement of Mani Bhavan in Palanpur. He had entrusted keys of the vault to his son and daughter, which are still in their possession. The vault contained jewellery and other valuables including diamonds and jewellery of Vadodara’s erstwhile ruler. There were gold ornaments weighing 3.5 kg. Mehta said that he received photographs on August 20 showing that the vault was broken and empty. Upon inquiry, he was informed that renovation work had begun and those who had come to undertake renovation allegedly decamped with the valuables by breaking the vault. When he visited Palanpur on September 8, he gave a complaint to local police and mentioned names of the accused. Mehta further said that the police undertook an inquiry, visited the site, but did not register an FIR. A police team visited Mumbai the next day and called the accused person to Lilavati Hospital. The cops found that the stolen valuables were in possession of the accused persons, but the policemen did not take custody of the stolen valuables. Mehta has urged the HC to direct the Palanpur police to register an FIR for theft, cheating and criminal conspiracy for the alleged theft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lilavati-hospital-trustee-moves-hc-seeks-fir-for-theft/articleshow/86663851.cms||---

The action on Thursday, followed the damning report by the two-member committee comprising Police Recruitment & Promotion Board chairman, R K Vishwakarma, and additional director general of women power Line (1090) Neera Rawat, which indicted Tripathi. Earlier, ASP Tripathi was slapped with a notice for his role in the probe. The woman, who had lodged a rape case against BSP MP Atul Rai, had also accused several police and judicial officers of harassing her at behest of the accused. A home department official said, the male companion of the woman had given a complaint to then SSP Varanasi on August 27, 2020, expressing apprehension of being killed by the MP’s aide. The investigation was handed over to then ASP Vikas Chandra Tripathi, who registered a case on December 2. The probe panel found the delay shocking. On June 19, Varanasi police commissioner entrusted ASP Tripathi with another probe on an email sent by the woman, but no report was filed. Then SSP Varanasi also asked Tripathi to probe into the complaint by the rape victim’s companion, but the ASP filed two conflicting reports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ex-kashi-asp-suspended-for-laxity-in-probe/articleshow/86665957.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: No Chhath Puja celebrations in public places for second year||NEW DELHI: Delhi Disaster Management Authority has banned Chhath Puja celebrations in public places, including at riverbanks, ponds, temples and public grounds in view of the pandemic. In an order on Thursday, DDMA, however, allowed public performances for Ramlila and the celebrations of Durga Puja and Dussehra subject to Covid-appropriate behaviour. Chhath puja is celebrated by people from Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh. This year, the festival will span four days from November 8 to 11. Last year, Chhath and all festivals were banned due to Covid. With the pandemic at a low at present, DDMA has relaxed the ban on gatherings in public till November 15. Delhi government has issued a detailed standard operating procedure, which prohibits fairs, food stalls and other crowd-pulling activities to prevent crowds and to facilitate social distancing. DDMA has instructed district magistrates and the deputy commissioners of police to permit festival events only after ascertaining that the venues are suitable for the conduct of the event while following Covid safety norms. The authorities have also been asked to revoke the permission if they detect violations of the norms. TimesViewThe government should strictly implement social distancing and other protocols for those festivals which have been allowed limited public celebration. This is also imperative to signal clearly that the differential treatment of festivals is not because of any arbitrariness or discrimination but because of good public health reasons.The norms are very strict. No fairs, melas, food stalls (inside or outside the venues), rides, rallies or processions will be permitted. No standing will be allowed, only seated attendance. District authorities have been asked to appoint nodal officers for each Ramlila or Durga Puja venue and they will be responsible for strict compliance with DDMA’s order. The organisers have been asked to ensure video-recording of the event every day and submit a soft copy of the unedited video recording to the nodal officers along with a certificate that no norms were violated within three hours of the closing of event each day. Nodal officers are to view the video recording daily to ensure no Covid norms were violated. The DMs and DCPs have to submit a certificate of compliance at all events under their jurisdiction to the chief secretary. As for capacity at each venue, in a closed space a maximum of 50% of that space can be used, with a ceiling of 200 persons. In open areas, the size of the ground and observance of social distancing norms will decide the crowd capacity. “This is a critical period because of the possibility of people ignoring Covid behaviour amid large gatherings, events, fairs, etc,” DDMA said in its order. “It is critical to enforce adherence to guidelines to allow festivities in a cautious, safe and Covid-appropriate manner. Any laxity in implementation of Covid-appropriate behaviour could lead to serious consequences and result in a surge in cases.” Arjun Kumar, secretary Lav Kush Ramlila Committee, one of the oldest Ramayana re-enactment organisers in Delhi, said they would follow all the norms laid down by the government. “The preparations for our Ramlila performance on the Red Fort grounds are in full swing,” added Kumar In case, any violation of the DDMA order is detected, the organiser of the event as well as other people responsible for it will face proceeding under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and other provisions of relevant laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-chhath-puja-celebrations-in-public-places-for-second-year/articleshow/86661553.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Delhi||Delhi faces ‘dry run’ as new excise regime takes shape||NEW DELHI: An alcohol shortage stares the capital in the face with 260 private liquor shops shutting down for good from Thursday. Only the 600-odd government liquor shops will operate till November 16 when the licensed shops under the new excise policy open for business. With the state government itself exiting the liquor business, the new excise policy has awarded all licences to private parties to run 850 alcohol stores in 32 zones. Each zone will comprise 8-10 wards and will have around 27 liquor selling points each. The new vends are mandated to be spacious and modern. Read AlsoDiscount offer: All you need to know about Delhi's new liquor shopsPrivate liquor shops will be closed in Delhi from October 1 for 45 days as per the Delhi government's new excise policy.The 45-day transition period is going to be challenging for both customers and the government due to the gap that will arise between supply and demand. The 600 govt liquor shops will have to manage the entire burden and they don’t appear ready to do this. The government said that the officially run liquor stores have been instructed to ensure sufficient stocks to meet the demand during the 45-day transition period. They have been directed to release payments on time to suppliers so that the supply chains don’t get choked. “We expect that in a situation where sufficient supply is maintained, crowding or any other incidents will not take place. We want to reassure the public that they do not need to hoard or rush to stores in this situation as all government owned shops will continue to function,” said a government statement on Thursday. “Delhi government is putting its best foot forward to ensure that the residents do not face much of a problem.” Many people who had gathered at the private liquor stores at J Block Market in Saket and Lado Sarai market found they had run out of stocks. “The government outlets near my residence did not have the brands I asked for,” said Praveen Kashyap at Saket. Naresh Goel, president, Delhi Liquor Traders’ Association, said, “There were huge crowds at many government liquor stores on Thursday and they will only increase in the days to come.” People engaged in the liquor business believe the shortage, both of alcohol overall and of particular brands, will affect celebrations during the festive season. The liquor crisis is likely to propel Delhiites to the neighbouring Noida and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh and Gurugram and Faridabad in Haryana for purchases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-faces-dry-run-as-new-excise-regime-takes-shape/articleshow/86661526.cms||AlokKNMishra

Anyone looking for help can now avail confidential support by calling 08046983383 from anywhere in the country and talk to a team of counsellors, breast cancer conquerors and dieticians. The helpline launched on the eve of the beginning of International Breast Cancer Awareness month aims at spreading awareness about breast cancer and reassure the ‘worried well’ with benign breast disease. Appreciating the new initiative for one-to-one confidential support, Naidu said that counselling was an inseparable part of cancer treatment protocol or any other life-threatening medical condition. He said that cancer not only affects the physical health, but takes a big toll on the mental health too. “Counsellors can help in keeping patients motivated to fight the illness spiritedly,” he said. Dr P Raghu Ram, founder, CEO and director of Ushalakshmi Breast Cancer Foundation said, “There is robust evidence from the West to suggest that a dedicated breast cancer helpline providing emotional support and evidence-based information would ensure patients finish their treatment schedule and experience less distress. What makes this initiative unique is a group of passionate breast cancer ‘conquerors’, who have been through the gruelling grind of treatment, would also be providing help alongside a team of trained counsellors.” The resource section of website for the helpline is in English and 11 other Indian languages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/first-of-its-kind-natl-helpline-for-breast-cancer-launched/articleshow/86661585.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Forensic experts grilled on bullet wounds, GSR||Hyderabad: Forensic experts from Gandhi Hospital and AIIMS, New Delhi, who had conducted post-mortem examination (PME) on the bodies of the four accused in the Disha rape and murder case, deposed before the SC-appointed commission on Thursday. The four accused were killed in an alleged encounter during scene reconstruction at Chattanpally on December 6, 2019. The commission grilled Gandhi Hospital forensic team head whether NHRC guidelines were followed while conducting PME and posed a query on the PME report of their AIIMS counterpart. Professor of forensic medicine and toxicology, Gandhi Hospital, Dr T Kripal Singh, who headed the three-member team which conducted PME on the bodies of the four accused at the Mahbubnagar government hospital, appeared before the commission after the deposition of Professor Sudhir Gupta, head of forensic medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi. As Singh stated that he was aware of NHRC guidelines pertaining to conducting PME of those who die in police custody, the commission’s advocate K Paramaeshwar asked him if the bodies were subjected to X-ray before the PME and the Gandhi forensic expert stated that the superintendent of Mahbubnagar hospital had orally informed him that the machine was not available, however, the same was not mentioned in the PME report. The commission’s advocate then asked if Singh had ruled out all indices of detention and custodial torture mentioned in NHRC guidelines and he stated that only piercing fire arm injuries were found on the bodies. The commission’s advocate then drew the attention of the Gandhi doctor to the PME report of Md Arif prepared by AIIMS team where it was mentioned that a grazing abrasion consistent with grazing bullet was found on his body, and Singh stated that it could be an artifact (change in the body after the death) as AIIMS team conducted a repostmortem 17 days after the first was conducted on December 6, 2019. In his deposition, Professor Sudhir Gupta stated that abrasion collar (in and around bullet entry wounds) were seen on bodies of all the four victims, which was suggestive of “death due to ante-mortem fire arm missile”. Answering questions about collection of gun shot residue (GSR) from the palms of Md Arif and C Chennakeshavulu, who had allegedly snatched fire arms from police and opened fire at them at Chattanpally, Singh stated that GSR was collected using cotton swabs from the web of the fingers and the same was sealed in plastic covers and sent to FSL through Shadnagar police. Singh subsequently added that he did not exactly remember it, but the evidence was sealed and sent. Singh also said that GSR swabs were collected before the beginning of PME, but it was not mentioned in the PME report and the process of collecting GSR swabs was not photographed or videographed. Singh also said that the palms of Arif and Chennakeshavulu were not protected (covered in a paper or a bag) before collection of GSR. He also stated that rigor mortis had set in all the four victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/forensic-experts-grilled-on-bullet-wounds-gsr/articleshow/86661616.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Yadagiri also stated that he does not know why the vehicle entry time was not mentioned in the log register at CAR headquarters on the day of the alleged encounter. When the commission’s advocate pointed out Yadagiri’s statement before the NHRC where he mentioned that he heard firing sounds for five minutes, Yadagiri responded saying that he only mentioned about hearing sound and did not say five minutes. He also said that he never heard a gun firing sound and when he heard a sound on the day of the encounter, he thought it was of a tyre going flat and continued to sleep in the vehicle parked at Chattanpally till an ambulance arrived.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/driver-thought-sounds-were-of-tyres-going-flat/articleshow/86661596.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Why new system for GOs, HC asks Andhra Pradesh govt||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Thursday asked the state government what was the need to introduce a new system to publish government orders (GOs) online. It also wanted to know why all GOs are not published online. The bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya also directed the government to explain the basis for not publishing GOs pertaining to auctions and those having news value. Three petitions were filed before the court challenging the government order in which it was stated that online publication of GOs will be done on AP E-Gazette website instead of GOIR website. The government also stated that secret, top secret and confidential GOs will not be published online. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, advocate Y Balaji said the conditions are in contrary to the provisions of Right To Information (RTI) Act. VVSS Srikanth, another counsel for the petitioners, said though the government is claiming that all GOs other than the classified ones were being published, a comparison with GOIR website revealed that 72% of the GOs were not published on E-Gazette. Special government pleader C Sumon submitted that all GOs that can be revealed were being made public. He further told the court that the government has not altered the system other than moving to a new website, and that all rules pertaining to secret, top secret and confidential GOs are the same as they were framed in 2005. The bench asked the government to submit details on the contentions raised by the petitioners. Further hearing on the issue will be held on October 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/why-new-system-for-gos-hc-asks-govt/articleshow/86661634.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The global health body updated the decision date for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin to October 2021 late on Wednesday night, as per its latest EUL guidance document for Covid-19 vaccines dated September 29, from the earlier “yet to be confirmed”. The WHO confirmation on the decision timeline comes even as there has been intense speculation on the status of Covaxin’s EUL application and when it would be taken up for approval. While the WHO website shows Covaxin’s assessment status as “ongoing”, WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) will be meeting on October 5 to discuss and consider for recommendation the EUL for Covaxin. As per the draft agenda of the SAGE meeting uploaded on WHO’s website, SAGE will discuss the Covaxin phase 1, 2, 3 clinical trials data and post marketing studies on safety, immunogenicity, efficacy and effectiveness as well as the outline of ongoing and planned studies on its safety and effectiveness along with update on global, regional and country level plans for vaccine safety monitoring. “Based on the presented evidences, the expert panel will present its draft recommendations on the use of Bharat Biotech’s vaccine in priority populations,” said the SAGE agenda. SAGE is the principal advisory group to WHO for vaccines and immunization. Covaxin’s EUL has been under WHO review since July 6 when the rolling data submission started. Many of those who have taken the two-dose inactivated virus vaccine have been awaiting a WHO approval as it would make international travel smoother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/decision-on-bbs-covaxin-eul-in-october-who/articleshow/86661673.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP to hold 200 caste-specific rallies||LUCKNOW: Giving two hoots to the opposition cry that the appointment of 29 ministers from the other backward castes (OBCs) and scheduled castes (SCs) in the Yogi Adityanath cabinet is symbolic, the Bharatiya Janata Party thinktank has designed an ‘OBC outreach package’ to woo the crucial castes ahead of assembly elections in 2022. As per the strategy, to woo voters from a particular caste, the party would not only reach out to BJP workers from the specific OBC community but also the community leaders who may not be affiliated to any political party. In what is being seen as the biggest OBC outreach exercise, the BJP will hold over 200 rallies throughout the state to woo voters from the OBC category belonging to different communities. The rallies will begin from Navaratri and continue till November end, UP BJP OBC Morcha incharge and party’s state vice-president Dayashanker Singh said. They would be addressed by leaders of the community from the state, and if need arises, central leaders belonging to the particular caste would also be roped in. Two Vidhan Sabhas would hold one rally, thereby covering 403 constituencies in the state, Singh further said. Prior to the rally of specific community (say Nishad), the BJP will hold a meeting of leaders of the particular community, who will be invited to address the rally, Singh said, claiming the meeting of leaders of each caste would be held separately. The venue of each meeting will be fixed keeping in mind the presence of a particular caste residing in the area. For example, since Mallahs (Nishads) mostly reside on the banks of river Ganga from Prayagraj to Varanasi region, the sammelan of Nishad leaders would be held either at Prayagraj or Varanasi. The castes and sub castes have been broadly divided into 22 main categories, a BJP leader said. The castes which would be in focus include Nishads, which also include Kevat, Mallah, Maanjhi and Kashyaps. Similarly, sammelans of Prajapati and Teli, Saini, Kushwaha, Shakya and Maurya, Kasodhan and Shivhare, Rabhar, Kurmi, Patel and Gangwar, Bhurji, Chaurasia, Sahu, Darji, Pal, Viswakarma, Dheeman, Jaangid and Maithil, Lodhi, Naayi, Sain and Savita and Swarnkar would also be held. Interestingly, the party is also focusing on Yadavs through these sammelans. The OBC leaders from other states like Raghubar Das, Sushil Modi, Ramesh Teli, Bhupendra Yadav would be invited to address the people of particular castes. UP BJP election in charge Dharmendra Pradhan would also be addressing a few of the sammelans, sources said. From the state, other than chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh would also be addressing the meetings. Singh, however, said that names of leaders who would address the meetings are yet to be decided. Around 75 sammelans to mobilise OBC workers and office-bearers would also be organised simultaneously, as part of the OBC outreach package, Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-to-hold-200-caste-specific-rallies/articleshow/86666043.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Delhi||HC not satisfied with govt’s reply on hookah usage||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Thursday expressed unhappiness over Delhi government’s stock response on its ban on the sale of herbal flavoured hookahs, saying it is silent if the Delhi Disaster Management Authority has examined the aspect. “Unfortunately, even though Delhi government has filed an affidavit trying to justify why the sale of flavoured hookah is not permissible, there is no whisper if the decision has been reconsidered by DDMA or not,” Justice Rekha Palli said.The court highlighted that on September 17, it had specifically directed the the Delhi government to ask the DDMA to reconsider its August 3, 2020 order prohibiting the use of herbal hookah in public places to contain the spread of Covid-19.It said the AAP government was directed to file an affidavit why last year’s order was not reconsidered in light of the change of situation of the Covid-19 pandemic, but the affidavit doesn’t mention anything. It granted one week’s time to the government, asking it to clarify if DDMA reconsidered the August 2020 order and also reasons for continuing with the decision, pointing out that authority has to apply its mind at least.During the hearing, the bench also underlined to the restaurant owners that in Covid times, the authorities are not permitting many activities and it needs to be seen if the court should force them to allow this activity. It said nobody was stopping the petitioners from running their restaurants, and only hookah activity was not permissible.The Delhi government’s standing counsel, Santosh Kumar Tripathi, said he has apprised the DDMA about the court’s order, but he was yet to get instructions from them and sought some time for it.The court had asked DDMA to examine the ban since breath analyser tests were being allowed now. It is hearing petitions by restaurants and bars seeking to direct the state and police not to interfere with the sale of herbal flavoured hookahs or take coercive steps against them. They said the petitioners are serving herbal hookahs for which no licence is required as they do not have any tobacco, but the police are still conducting raids, seizing equipment, and issuing challans.The petitioners’ had said as long as the restaurants undertake not to use nicotine in hookah, they cannot be prohibited from carrying out their businesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-not-satisfied-with-govts-reply-on-hookah-usage/articleshow/86661659.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC frowns on trial judge over quizzing of rape survivor||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has upheld the life term handed to three men for a 2010 gang rape of a young woman who “innocently took a lift from a man in a car’’ in Pune. However, it frowned on the trial court judge and public prosecutor for allowing the defence to put unnecessary questions to her involving graphic details during cross-examination. The trial court judge conducted and concluded the trial with sincere efforts, but failed in his duty to protect the dignity of the woman, held the HC. An accused has the right to cross-examination to prove his innocence, but the court under the evidence Act is duty-bound to forbid any question that appears intended to insult, annoy or is offensive. The court is also empowered to forbid questions it considers “indecent or scandalous’’, it pointed out. After being convicted in October 2011, the trio appealed to the HC the next year. Turning it down on Tuesday, the HC said the prime accused, Subhash Bhosale, who was the autorickshaw union chief of a rickshaw stand, had bragged about the rape to a friend, which helped nail him. On April 1, 2010, the well-educated woman, who was new to Pune, was running late for a seminar and waiting at a bus stand around 4.30pm. Bhosale, with another man in the car, drove up and offered a drop, saying they were going the same way. She thought it is one of the call centre cabbies trying to make a quick buck and got in. The driver stopped at a garage, got his mobile phone charged at a shop, and drove for an hour but her destination was not in sight. She was initially calm as she had been told the seminar was about one and a half hour’s journey away. But she started feeling uncomfortable and called and texted a friend expressing suspicions about the driver. She later called another friend, who spoke to Bhosale on her phone and gave him directions. It was 6.30pm by then, and the woman asked the driver to drop him at the nearest bus stop. Bhosale agreed, but drove on to a highway, where a third man joined them. As she protested, she was slapped, gagged and threatened with a knife. She was pinned in the backseat between two men and when her mother called, she was not allowed to take it. The trio picked up food, beer and drove to a secluded place. As they ate and drank, they asked her to call her mother inform that she would be late. She called her mother, but addressed her as aunt. Suspicious, her mother called her real aunt in Pune, who started searching for her. In the secluded spot, the trio took turns to rape her, and then dropped her near her house around 12.45am. Within 10 minutes, the police arrived. She lodged an FIR and was taken for medical examination, which confirmed “forceful sexual intercourse”. “Medical evidence establishes commission of offence,” said the HC, and upheld the other evidence presented too. Ranjeed Gade and Ganesh Kamble were arrested on April 2. Alerted, Bhosale went missing, but was trapped in a hotel by the police the next day. Bhosale had tried to suggest that the woman had also had beer, developed close intimacy and love for him and the sex had been consensual. She filed a false complaint at the behest of the police. The woman vehemently denied all these suggestions. The HC pointed out that once she had denied the defence suggestion, further questions of a graphic nature were put to her during the trial. At one point, she even broke down. “We strongly disapprove of all these suggestions put to the witness. We are more pained because of the passive approach adopted by the learned judge in allowing these questions,” said the HC and reminded the trial court and the prosecutor that they owe a duty to a witness, too. It made it clear that the special public prosecutor had failed to protect her from the “torture’’ during cross-examination. Advocates Anjali Patil and P G Sarda, appearing for the three accused, sought at least leniency in the HC. Additional public prosecutor S V Sonawane said they deserved none, and the HC agreed. “The dishonest intention on the part of accused No. 1 was clear right from inception as he claimed that he was going towards the same direction… and yet he did not take her to that place and made a show that he did not find that place… A third man later joined them and they took advantage of her helpless condition. They committed rape on her. She was threatened at knife point. Gagged. She has suffered extreme trauma and the manner of commission of offence was cruel,’’ said the HC, indicating it was not inclined to reduce the sentence.  • The Bombay HC also in its judgment reminded the trial court of its duty under sections 148, 151, 152 of the Indian Evidence Act to decide when the witness shall be compelled to answer. • The Court is duty bound to decide if a witness must answer a question and also expected to warn the witness that s/he is not obliged to answer such improper questions or if disproportionate between the importance of the imputation made against the witness’s character and the importance of his evidence. • Under the Criminal Procedure Code, Prosecutors are in-charge of the conduct of the prosecution. They are supposed to perform their duties responsibly and render sincere assistance to the Court. • Prosecutors have a responsibility to protect the victims’ and witnesses’ interest, while maintaining a balance by not being unfair to the defence. • They cannot only focus on getting a conviction, conduct of proper trial is also their duty (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-upholds-life-term-for-rape-criticises-crude-questions-to-woman/articleshow/86663989.cms||Swati Deshpande

Presiding over a high-level meeting, the CM directed to prepare a list of corrupt policemen by constituting two separate committees under the chairmanship of director general of police, intelligence Devendra Singh Chauhan, and additional DG, law and order, Prashant Kumar. Based on the report submitted by the two committees, the government will take stringent action against the erring policemen. The committee constituted under the chairmanship of DG Intelligence will have ADG Law and Order and secretary, home as a member. This committee will screen the officers in the rank of additional superintendent of police and deputy superintendent of police. Likewise, the second committee headed by ADG (L&O) will screen policemen of inspector and sub-inspector level. In this committee, the ADG establishment and home secretary will be the members. These committees will give their report after examining the policemen posted in the same district for three years and if they have any kind of allegations against them. Yogi instructed the police to improve its working style. “UP Police is the largest civilian police force in the country and has also given splendid examples of its efficiency on several occasions," Yogi observed.

During the same period, the overall number of cases in the state went up from 3,324 to 4,128, increasing by nearly 800 cases, as per official records. While the dengue menace continues unabated in the state and all measures put in by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and the state health department seem to have paid no dividends, experts now suggest that ELISA (a commonly used laboratory test to detect antibodies in the blood) should be made mandatory for people exhibiting dengue symptoms. It is learnt that the state health department has sought suggestions from a cross section of experts on how to control the dengue menace, which is already touching the numbers of dengue epidemic in the year 2019. Apart from mandating ELISA tests which are considered a gold standard for diagnosing dengue, it has been suggested that diagnostic centers and hospitals be mandated to report the test results on a daily basis to the government. “Also, filling up the vacant posts of entomologists and district malaria officers has been suggested. There are around 50 vacant posts currently in the state. Also, penal charges or fines on those who, after receiving notice from the authorities, do not clean the environment in their area, which is likely to aid the breeding of mosquitoes, has been suggested,” said a source from the state health department. “Since many patients from other districts and sometimes even other states come to Hyderabad for treatment and hospitalization, there is a need to put a mechanism in place for the government to track such an influx from other districts and plan upgrading hospital infrastructure in those places,” said one of the experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/experts-for-elisa-to-detect-dengue/articleshow/86661691.cms||Amrita Didyala

The court had on September 25 also imposed a fine of the same amount on Delhi Police for failing to appear before it and seeking adjournment despite repeated orders. The court directed the fine to be deposited to the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund. In two cases, chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 as the special public prosecutor, representing the cops, sought an adjournment for arguments on charge. The court directed lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to order an enquiry for fixing the responsibility for imposition of the cost and to order its deduction from the salary of the responsible officer. “Adjournment allowed subject to cost of Rs 5,000 to be deposited by the State with Prime Minister’s Relief Fund. This court is not oblivious of the fact that the burden of the aforesaid cost shall ultimately fall on public exchequer and hence I deem it appropriate to request the LG to order an enquiry for fixing the responsibility for imposition of the aforesaid cost and to order deduction of the said cost from the salary of the responsible officer,” the judge noted in his order. In another case, the court imposed a cost of Rs 5,000 on the investigating officer for failing to supply the copy of CCTV footage of the alleged incident to the accused despite the passing of more than six months. It directed the IO to supply the copy of the footage to all the accused within seven days against proper acknowledgment. The directions came after the investigating officer submitted that he had not yet supplied the footage to the accused and sought adjournment for a week for the same. “Perusal of the record reveals that an application u/s 207 (supply of police report to accused) CrPC had been moved on behalf of the accused Shahzad seeking supply of CCTV footage and IO had sought time to file reply of the said application. It is submitted by the investigating officer that the SHO, as well as the ACP concerned, had filed a reply to the aforesaid application seeking some more time to supply the copy of CCTV footage,” the court said in the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/riots-cases-court-imposes-fine-on-police-prosecutors/articleshow/86661761.cms||Usha Das
---||Chandigarh||Fly menace: 16 poultry farm owners receive notices||Panchkula: A special task force committee formed by the Panchkula deputy commissioner on Thursday issued notices to 16 poultry farms after various anomalies were found in the wake of a complaint by the animal husbandry team. With swarms of flies disrupting lives of village residents, Panchkula administration is taking action against poultry farm owners on Barwala-Raipur Rani belt flouting norms issued by them. Deputy commissioner (DC) Vinay Pratap Singh formed a special task force committee to take up the issue of the fly menace on the Barwala-Raipur Rani belt. The committee comprises poultry farm association members, animal husbandry department, Pollution Control Board officials and representatives of affected villages. During the meeting, the DC asked poultry farm owners present to adhere to guidelines issued strictly, failing which they would be liable to strict punitive action. Representatives of affected villages in Barwala-Raipur Rani had told the DC that while regulations had brought a measure of relief, the problem was far from solved. Acting on this, a team of the animal husbandry department conducted surprise inspections and found anomalies at 16 poultry farms. Notices have been served on farm owners. The department also forwarded a detailed report to Pollution Control Board officials for further action. The DC asked them to issue challan this time and strict action next time against those violating guidelines.

---||Mumbai||UP gangster on the run for 12 years nabbed by Gujarat cops in Vasai||A hardened criminal who wriggled out of the UP Police’s dragnet 12 years ago and was on the run since then, was nabbed by Ahmedabad crime branch late on Tuesday from Vasai. The fugitive, Manish Singh, was a member of the dreaded Subhash Singh Thakur gang with criminal records in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Better known as Raju alias Chhotu in the Mumbai underworld, he carried a bounty of Rs 50,000. In 2009, he escaped from UP Police’s custody while being taken to court and fled to Mumbai, where he expanded his criminal activities, targeting bar owners in Santacruz and Vakola. Ahmedabad deputy commissioner of police, crime, Chaitanya Ravindra Mandalik, told TOI it took 20 days to zero in and ambush Chhotu in his den after a definite tip-off. A Gujarat crime branch team disguised as watchmen and sweepers infiltrated the staff deployed at Rashmi Garden at Evershine City, Vasai, where Chhotu lived. “Chhotu had a well-oiled network and would flee within minutes of getting a whiff of police movement. This time we were determined. So, we trained select cops for several weeks to work in disguise, before dispatching the team to Vasai. On September 28, Chhotu came out of his apartment for a stroll and was immediately nabbed,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-up-gangster-on-the-run-for-12-yrs-nabbed-by-gujarat-cops-in-vasai/articleshow/86666179.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

---||Delhi||Delhi: Virus halts most local passenger trains, those running are Covid risks||NEW DELHI: Sarvan Kumar has been travelling from Karnal in Haryana to Delhi and back every day on passenger trains for five years, having realised this was the cheapest and fastest way to reach the capital. However, with only one daily electric multiple unit (EMU) train now covering the route, the commute isn’t as easy as it was earlier. Others share the problem with Kumar. In the pandemic era, more than half the local passenger trains aren’t in service and thousands jostle to get a toehold in the crowded compartments. Daily commuters wish for normalising of the services without which social distancing is well-nigh impossible. “Northern Railway says it is not running local passenger trains due to the pandemic, but things are returning to normal and the services have to be restored,” said Krishan Sharma, who commutes to Delhi daily on the Mathura-Ghaziabad 04419 EMU. “Quite often, there are over 500 people in a single coach because the train I catch is the only one from Mathura to Delhi. It is a problem not only because there is room even to stand with ease, but also because people often take off their masks in the train.” Asked for a response, a railway official told TOI that the trains were suspended due to the Covid pandemic, but added that passenger and express train services were now being restored in phases. “It is true Northern Railway hasn’t restored the train services. Around 50% of the passenger trains and 85% of reserved trains are currently running. But gradually, more and more are being run again,” the official said. “Northern Railway is restoring the services as and when directives and approval are received from the Railway Board.” Restricted schedules have put Sukhwinder Singh, who used to travel to Delhi from Fazilka in Punjab on the Fazilka-Delhi Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) train, to some inconvenience. He now has to board another daily train from Bathinda instead since none is running from Delhi up to Fazilka. “The limited frequency of daily trains has added to my commute problems,” said Singh. “There is no train to and from Fazilka that runs daily and my only option is to get on one from Bathinda, which is two hours from Fazilka.” According to Yogender Chauhan, president of the Dainik Rail Yatri Sangh, the Rewari-Delhi route also has only one daily passenger train running — one that leaves the Haryana town as early as 5.30am. “The Sri Ganganagar-Delhi train used to carry daily passengers but has now been converted into a reserved train. Why would an office goer board a train at 5.30am? But there is no alternative,” said Chauhan. Balkrishan Ambarsariya, another commuter on the route, revealed that owing to the odd timings of the train, he takes a bus home in the evenings. “By the time office is over, the only passenger train has already left for Rewari,” he said ruefully. Because of the limited services, overcrowding has become a bane for commuters. Lakshay Nahriya travels daily on the Delhi-Panipat EMU. “People have to hang on to the doors,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/virus-halts-most-local-passenger-trains-those-running-are-covid-risks/articleshow/86661747.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Gurgaon||Session half done, but many students yet to get textbooks||Gurgaon: For the last year, Priya (name changed), a class 6 student at a government school in Pataudi, has been studying without any textbook. She is among the many students in the city who failed to find a partner in the book-exchange programme rolled out by the state as a stop-gap arrangement to address the issue of non-availability of textbooks in the government schools across Haryana. “I didn’t receive any book last year as well as this year. Teachers say that the government hasn’t released books. So, they dictate notes and we rely on them for our studies. At times, teachers send pictures of the pages from their books and I study from that,” the class 6 student said. A total of 85,000 students from classes 1 to 8 in the city have been studying without books ever since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out last year. With half of the current academic session (2021-22) over, most of these students in the government schools are also waiting for the direct benefit transfer (DBT) announced by the state education department earlier. In June this year, the state education minister Kanwar Pal had expressed the inability of the education department to provide free-of-cost textbooks to the students of classes 1 to 8 — as mandated under the Right to Education (RTE) Act — due to a delay in the tendering process and the Covid-19 hurdles for getting books printing. To compensate for the unavailability of the books, the minister had announced that the government will directly transfer a sum of Rs 250 each to student from classes 1 to 5 and Rs 400 each to students from classes 6 to 8 directly. The sum would be credited to the bank accounts of students through direct benefit transfer. During the Assembly session in August, Pal had reiterated his commitment. While the education department claims that funds were transferred to a majority of the students last week, school teachers and parents, TOI spoke to, said otherwise. “I have my two children studying in Kadipur school and neither of them has received books or money. Last year, too, my kids studied without textbooks. In fact, they haven’t received money for midday meals or getting cooked meals at schools even when schools have started to call students,” Ratan Kumar, a parent, said. The education department said fund transfer was underway and they were preparing a database of the students who have been left out. “There’s no need to panic. Each child will get the money promised by the government. Due to some data mismatch, a few students have not received the money. We are making a list of all such students and will transfer money to them after addressing the issues. Additionally, we had started the concept of book banks last year when the printing of the textbooks stopped. We are continuing it this year, too.Students may reach out to their school heads for the same,” a district education department official said. Teachers and the school heads, however, have pointed out that since there was a huge influx of students in government schools, uploading bank account and other details were still underway. They also claimed that several banks were not cooperating to open bank accounts for the students. Dushyant Thakran, district head of Haryana Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, said, “Due to unprecedented spike in admissions this year there was a lot of students’ data to be processed and uploaded on MIS. In many cases, there’s serious inconsistency in data and that is one of the hurdles for DBT. Moreover, the admission process remains incomplete unless banks open zero-balance accounts. This year, banks aren’t cooperating. A significant number of students are still without bank accounts. Unless this is fixed, the money transfer will just be an eyewash and many will remain excluded.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/session-half-done-but-many-students-yet-to-get-textbooks/articleshow/86666105.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Mumbai||Andheri senior inspector suspended after bar raid||MUMBAI: Andheri police station senior inspector Vijay Belge was suspended by the police department on Thursday. Sources said a raid on an orchestra bar in his jurisdiction by another police station spurred the move. The raid was on August 23 and a probe followed. Belge’s superiors recommended a transfer in their report, but the top brass reportedly decided to suspend him. “The department is taking bar violations seriously. The suspension is a warning to other police station in-charges to keep a check on bars in their jurisdictions. If a bar is found operating, it gives the department a bad name,” said a senior official. In July, two Thane senior inspectors were suspended and two assistant commissioners were shunted after a TV news channel telecast a sting operation showing bars operational during Covid in Naupada and Vartak Nagar. “If dance bars are found operational, officers will be punished,” state home minister Dilip Walse Patil had said. A criminal offence was registered against the bars and licences were being cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-andheri-sr-inspector-suspended-after-bar-raid/articleshow/86664097.cms||---
---||Delhi||Chargesheet running into 17,000 pages draws court ire||New Delhi: A city court on Thursday expressed frustration in holding a speedy trial in northeast Delhi riots as the accused put forward their difficulties in scrutiny of the voluminous chargesheet that runs into more than 17,000 pages.More than a year later, the trial in the case, in which the accused have been booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, is stuck at the stage of Section 207 (supply of police report and other documents) of the CrPC.The court said 2-3 more applications seeking deficient documents had been filed by other accused. “If all the accused file such applications separately and on different dates. And if the prosecution files replies to each one of them and then arguments are heard on it…This will take years. It will become very difficult,” said additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat.During the hearing, advocate Rizwan, appearing for Tahir Hussain, claimed that this was the “only trial in the country where the prosecution has objection to Section 207 CrPC and they are filing replies”.Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, objected to this and asked Rizwan if he had filed any such application yet. To this, Rizwan said, “I (Hussain) am the accused. I have the right to evidence that they (prosecution) are not relying upon. It has been more than a year now. If it is still stuck at this stage, the trial will take ages.”Concurring with his views, the judge told the public prosecutor, “Instead of filing a reply, supply the accused the documents. Only file replies for those documents which can’t be given...This is to expedite the trial.”Meanwhile, it also came to light that accused Tasleem Ahmed and Gulfisha Fatima have not yet received a hard copy of the chargesheet. “I have filed five applications regarding this,” said Ahmed.Accused Saleem Khan broke down before the court, saying even if he gets justice, his life will be destroyed by that time. “It’s been more than a year since we are confined in prisons. I am innocent. My children’s education has stopped because of financial difficulties. My discharge application is also not being heard,” he told the judge.He further said that he was not financially sound to be able to afford a renowned lawyer and he had not been able to get interim bail too. During this, accused Ishrat Jahan and Fatima, produced through videoconferencing, could also be seen wiping their tears.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chargesheet-running-into-17000-pages-draws-court-ire/articleshow/86661770.cms||Usha Das

---||Hyderabad||Vegetable prices go up in Telangana after incessant rains damage crops||HYDERABAD: Excess rains in Telangana for the past few weeks has led to massive crop damage in the state triggering a rise of 20-50 per cent in vegetable prices. With a majority of the vegetables arriving from neighbouring states, rise in fuel and transportation charges has also added to the vegetable cost. As per records of agriculture marketing committee (AMC), Bowenpally vegetable market is receiving more than 20,000 quintals of vegetables per day. Although the quantity of vegetable arriving at the Bowenpally market is stable this year, 68 per cent of it is arriving from states such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Price for vegetables such as lady finger, brinjal, cauliflower, Dondakai, capsicum, carrots has jumped to almost Rs 50-60/kg against Rs 30-40 about 10 days back. However, the prices for staple vegetables such as onion, tomato and potato is stable. “While the rainfall has had a major impact on the vegetable crops in Telangana, high fuel prices are also being attributed to increased transportation costs among farmers,” said L Srinivas, secretary, AMC, Bowenpally market. Consumers rue that while the vegetable cost has gone up, quality of vegetables is very poor. “Some vegetables don’t stay even for three days. I am buying vegetables from a vendor who comes near my house on a daily basis to ensure that vegetables are not spoilt,” said Veena Nandan, a resident of West Marredpally. Vegetable vendors expect the price to drop by Diwali following t he onset of winter seaeon. “Every year, the prices shoot up by the end of monsoon and drop only by Diwali time. This year too, we are expecting the same trend,” said N Seenu, a vegetable vendor in Sainikpuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/veggie-prices-go-up-in-t-after-incessant-rains-damage-crops/articleshow/86661815.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bandra tailor is third to be held by ATS in terror case||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) probing the terror case in which two persons were held earlier arrested 50-year-old tailor Irfan Rehmat Shaikh on Thursday on charges of conspiracy and harbouring an accused. The ATS has recovered Rs 49,000 from Shaikh, and the money was routed through the US to avoid suspicion, officials said. This is the third arrest in this case. “Money was sent to one of the accused through a financial services company. It appears the transaction was routed through the US to avoid suspicion,” said Vineet Agarwal, ATS chief and additional director general of police. “We have been questioning Shaikh for the last one week. He was summoned for questioning again on Wednesday and during interrogation, he was placed under arrest,” said ACP Sunil Tambe, chief investigating officer in this case. Shaikh, who studied upto class XII, stays in a chawl in Kherwadi, Bandra (E) along with his wife, daughter and three sons. Last week, police had arrested two persons: auto driver Zakir Shaikh (52) from Jogeshwari and tuition teacher Rizwan Momin (40), a Mumbra resident. Police said prima facie it appears Zakir was the key person in this group. “Shaikh received Rs 50,000 in his account. He gave money to Zakir, who used Rs 1,000 to book a ticket for Lucknow and returned Rs 49,000 to Shaikh, asking him to keep it with him as of now. We have also recovered a SIM card from Shaikh’s residence. Some documents have also been seized and we are scrutinizing them,” said an officer. Shaikh was on Thursday produced before a special sessions court, which sent him to ATS custody till October 4. Police are also trying to establish if Zakir’s brother, Sagir Shaikh, played any role in sending the money. Sagir and Zakir, along with six others, were booked in a case of conspiring to assassinate a senior political leader in 2001. While Zakir was arrested in this case, Sagir fled the country. Zakir was released on bail in 2008. The ATS has earlier indicated about ‘allotment of budget’ in the case. A senior ATS officer said they were scanning financial transaction records of all arrested accused. On September 17, the ATS had registered an FIR against Shaikh and his alleged foreign handler Anthony alias Anas alias Anwar alias Annu under Section 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for criminal conspiracy to commit a terrorist act. Police suspect Anthony contacted the two accused using a Malaysian SIM card. Zakir had given his phone to Momin and asked him to destroy it. Momin broke it into three pieces and threw it. The phone was recovered and sent for cyber analysis. Police also added a section of destruction of evidence under the IPC. Zakir stayed at Momin’s house for two days, police said. Shaikh allegedly had also kepy Zakil at his home for a day, they said. Last week, ATS arrested Zakir from Shaikh’s Kherwadi residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bandra-tailor-is-third-to-be-held-by-ats-in-terror-case/articleshow/86664138.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Man gets death for raping, killing 5-month-old cousin||LUCKNOW: A Pocso court on Thursday awarded capital punishment to a man for brutally raping and murdering his five-month-old real cousin. Pronouncing the verdict, Judge Arvind Mishra said that the convict be hanged till death after confirmation of the death penalty from the HC. In its order, the judge also imposed Rs 70,000 fine on the convict, identified as Prem Chandra alias Pappu Dixit, who is also father of a child. The judge said that the amount of fine be given to father of the minor victim. Earlier, the judge declined to grant any punishment less than death penalty to the convict. “The matter falls in rarest of the rare category, warranting nothing less than death sentence for the convict, who not only raped five month and 13 days old girl but also committed her murder also,” observed the judge. The judge also cited Nirbhaya and Hyderabad cases in his judgment and said that in those cases the victim was major even then the culprits were sentenced to death. However, in the current case, the victim was a minor and close relative of the deceased and hence the society would also support such kind of deterrent punishment. “Even animals would not do such an act as the convict did with the minor victim,” observed the judge.“In our country, little girls are considered to be incarnations of goddesses and people worship them as incarnations of Goddess Durga and in Navratri devotees break nine days fasting after offering meals to little girls. In such circumstances, raping and murdering a five-month-and-a-13-day-old girl brings the matter in the rarest of the rare cases,” observed the judge, declining to show any leniency to the convict. The judge also observed, “The manner in which the convict committed the offence, people would stop believing in any relation and this would destroy the social fabric.” The father of the minor deceased had lodged an FIR in the matter with the Madion police station on February 17, 2020. He said that his daughter had gone along with her mother and others to attend a function nearby on the previous day. The convict there asked her mother to allow him to take the girl for playing. When he did not return for long her mother and others started searching for the daughter and the convict. Later, the girl was found in a bush and the convict was seen running away from there. The girl had serious injuries on her private parts and all over her body. She was rushed to a hospital but could not be saved.

---||Mumbai||Sakinaka rape: Guard lied about 2 involved in crime||MUMBAI: The 346-page chargesheet filed by Mumbai Police in connection with the brutal rape and murder of a woman at Sakinaka said that the first informant, a security guard, had initially lied about two people being involved in the crime. He later clarified that he was scared of being questioned why he did not go to help the woman. The police have dropped the charge of ‘common intention’ from the case. On September 10, a 32-year-old woman had been brutally assaulted with a blunt object by a 45-year-old man inside a tempo at Khairani Road. Police said the accused was allegedly angry with the woman for refusing sex. The chargesheet said the accused claimed to have known the victim and she had avoided meeting him for 25 days before he managed to track her down. According to the chargesheet, when the accused saw her after 25 days, he attacked her in anger and even used a rod-like weapon in the crime, which was not pre-planned. The chargesheet mentioned that the guard, who was seated inside a tempo around 3am, said he felt something brush against the vehicle. He looked outside and saw the woman being assaulted in another tempo nearby. The guard immediately dialled the ‘100’ helpline. The woman was bleeding profusely with lacerations to her private parts when the cops found her. She was rushed to a public hospital where she died 36 hours later. She was first assaulted by the accused on the pavement and then inside the tempo which was captured on CCTV camera. The accused was nabbed the same day. He later tested positive for Covid-19 and was briefly hospitalised. Currently, he is lodged at Arthur Road prison. A supplementary statement of the guard stated that the tempo’s registration number had been incorrectly recorded by the police owing to a misunderstanding as he had given it in Hindi. The correct registration number has been taken on record. Among the 25 key witnesses whose statements police are banking on, the first is the victim’s mother.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Quthbullapur man died in open canal on September 25, say cops||HYDERABAD: On a day a techie fell into an open nala in Manikonda, another man slipped on a slush-filled road and fell into a canal amid blinding rain on September 25. Police said 54-year-old man named Mohan Reddy of Quthbullapur, but it remained undisclosed until CCTV footage, which was part of the police investigation, of the man falling into the nala went viral on social media on Thursday morning. Jeedimetla SHO, K Balaraj said they started scouring through the CCTV footage, following a missing complaint filed by the family members of the victim on September 26. “The missing person is employed in the MTR company. We started our investigation after the family filed a missing complaint. We informed the GHMC immediately after we found in the CCTV footage that the man fell into the drain,” said Balaraj. However, since it has been raining continuously over the past two-three days, the police said that a lot of water must have entered the nala which is making the search operation even difficult for the rescue teams. The open nala, which is about 14 meters long passes through Jeeditmetla, Balanagar, Begumpet, and Ramgopalpet before it meets at Hussainsagar, GHMC officials said. The CCTV footage showed that the people who saw the man slip into an open nala rushed to rescue him but the GHMC deputy commissioner of Qutbullapur claims that the department was not informed about the incident by the family of friends, until the police checked the CCTV footage until almost three days later September 28. “The victim and one of his friends live in the same area. After having a few drinks, Mohan Reddy went near the nala to smoke a cigarette and while he was standing there, he slipped and fell into the nala,” said GHMC’s Qutbullahpur deputy commissioner Manga Tayaru. The deputy commissioner further said that even the friends who were with him when the incident took place did not inform the police of the family members. “We have deployed 20 search teams as soon as we were informed about the incident, but we were not able to trace the body. The state disaster response force (SDRF) teams have also been pressed into service on Thursday morning to conduct a more thorough search operation,” said Tayaru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/quthbullapur-man-died-in-open-canal-on-sept-25-cops/articleshow/86661871.cms||Moulika.KV

It also passed similar directions for installing grilles in two other adjoining flats in response to complaints from Carvalho’s brother, Savio, and another former tenant, Hemlata Jain. “We have seen the colour photographs of the said glass frontage...No doubt, a 22-storey building looks beautiful, attractive and impressive because of the full height glass frontage provided to it...But looked from the angle of the persons residing in the said flat, nothing is more dangerous than the said full height sliding glass shutters without any metal cover or grille or any other safety features,” said the commission in a September 3 order by president Justice P R Bora and member S K Kakade. The order was made available on September 29. Carvalho’s advocate Shashank Thatte pointed to the “unprotected balcony” making it unsafe for her to reside. The builder, through advocate Akhil Rao, contested her right to be heard as a “consumer” as it was a redevelopment project. He said theirs was a “tenant-landlord relationship”. He denied any lapses and allegations and said “full sliding shutter windows provided to the flat” are “sufficiently safe, secure and in compliance with the law’’ adding there was no rule stipulating a “parapet” or a “metal enclosure” is required for a balcony. He said she is entitled to install the grille at her own cost, a submission the commission did not accept. It held since she handed over rights to the tenant premises to the builder, she qualified as his “consumer” under Consumer Protection Act as her actions are a “consideration towards the new flat in the new building”. The commission said it was “quite evident that a slight sliding of the said glass shutters would signal a risk for the person opening it or viewing the outside scene by standing’’ next to the window and a fall would be fatal. “It is more dangerous if the aged persons are residing in the said flat or there are small babies in the family.” It ordered the builder to pay her Rs 1 lakh towards mental agony in two months, else it will carry 9% interest per annum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bldr-to-install-safety-grilles-in-3-flats-state-consumer-body/articleshow/86664162.cms||Swati Deshpande

The court, which was hearing a PIL filed by one Dasari Emmanuel from Chirala in Prakasam district seeking directions to introduce digital payments in government-run liquor retail outlets and to link Aadhaar to liquor sales so as to keep track on who is purchasing the liquor, asked the petitioner’s advocate if he was trying to question the morality of liquor consumers. The government pleader for excise department told the court that linking Aadhaar to liquor sales is not possible as it would amount to encroachment of personal privacy. The court then asked the petitioner’s counsel, V Naga Praveen, as to why his client wanted to know personal details like Aadhaar numbers.

BKU (Lakhhowal) leader Karam Singh said, “Party workers of MLA used unparliamentary language against us during the Bharat Bandh protest. Tony Rana and his accomplice made remarks on woman farmers in Mubarakpur. We demand an unconditional apology from them or we will not allow public gatherings of the MLA in Derabassi constituency in future.” Farmers seized the entry and exit points of the office for over four hours and did not allow movement of traffic.

Civic authorities will make inspections to find out the causes for low water pressure in these households and to sort out the issue. BMC board of administrators’ member Tulshi Sinha Roy met the residents to listen to their complaint at the ward 31 office along with senior BMC supply department officials on Thursday that was arranged by ward 31 coordinator Supriyo Chakraborty. Civic officials said residents of about 50 households came with complaints of shortage of water supply. “There is no shortage of water. Apparently there could be problems with the ferrule lines or there might be a problem in the main line. Our officers will make inspections of the households in the next few days to find out the reasons and sort out the issue,” BMC BOA member Tulshi Sinha Roy said. Civic officials said that apparently the possible reasons why the households were receiving low pressure of water could be due to the chocked ferrule lines or sediment formation inside the pipelines which have not been mechanically scrubbed for a long time in these part of the township. “At some places the water supply lines have not been back washed for a long time,” officials said. BMC officials said Salt Lake was presently receiving about 11 million gallon of filtered water per day, four MGD from the New Town treatment plant and the other about seven MGD from Tallah. Civic authorities said that they will periodically visit different wards on intervals on the basis of complaints that it would receive. BMC will start supplying water on four intervals throughout the day in Salt Lake from Mahalaya onwards. Presently, Salt Lake receives water in three intervals in early morning, mid morning and late afternoon. Water will also be supplied for another round in late evening from Mahalaya,” said a civic official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bmc-to-look-into-water-shortage-issue/articleshow/86661912.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt launches ‘massive search’ to find Param Bir Singh, buzz is he has fled India||MUMBAI: A week after the CID failed to serve a bailable warrant against Param Bir Singh as they could not find him at his address, state home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Thursday said the MVA government had launched a massive search to trace the former Mumbai police chief for his alleged involvement in serious crimes. When asked if Singh had gone to London or Russia, as alleged in certain quarters, Walse Patil said he had no such information. A week ago, the Chandiwal commission probing Singh’s letter to the CM which made allegations against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh had issued a bailable warrant to secure his presence before the commission, but the state CID failed to trace him. Walse Patil told TOI, “We have launched a search to trace Param Bir Singh. We are also taking the assistance of the Central government for the purpose. Our officers are coordinating with the Centre. We do not know his whereabouts, if he has fled India. We do not have concrete information. As per rules, it is mandatory for any employee or even the CM to secure permission of the government before leaving the country. In case of Singh, it has been found he never applied for permission to travel abroad. In fact, the CID has issued a lookout notice against him.” Read AlsoMaharashtra ACB gets go-ahead for 2nd open inquiry against Param Bir SinghMaharashtra Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Monday received sanction to initiate an open inquiry again-st former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on the complaint of inspector Bhimrao Ghadge alleging criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and corruption.Further, Walse Patil said as per rules, whenever an employee proceeds on medical leave, as Singh had, he has to inform government of his whereabouts during the leave period. But Singh did not inform the government about his place of residence. “We will take action as per provisions of law,” he said. Meanwhile, state Congress president Nana Patole on Thursday obliquely blamed the NCP-controlled home department for its failure to arrest Singh “for his alleged involvement in planting explosives outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani.” Patole said when it emerged that dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze had been directly involved in planting the explosives, the Mumbai police should have arrested Singh and the state home department should have suspended him immediately. “In police circles, the link between Singh and Waze was well known, and Mumbai police and home department should have acted swiftly. Subsequently, both police and home department were helpless as the probe into the episode was taken over by NIA,” Patole said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCB arrests director of Bandra hotel in drug case||Mumbai: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Thursday arrested hotelier Kunal Jani in the alleged drug- peddling case linked to the arrest of Kshitij Prasad and actor Arjun Rampal’s girlfriend’s brother-in-law Agisilaos Demetriades. Kunal Jaani (33) is the director of Bandra-based Bastian restaurant, with actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband Raj Kundra and Ranjit Singh Bindra. Bindra was earlier arrested in the money laundering case involving Iqbal Mirchi investigated by the ED. In the fresh case, the NCB produced Jani before the 8th Esplanade metropolitan magistrate court and he was remanded in two days custody. NCB officials said though no drugs have been found from Jani’s possession, investigations suggest Jani allegedly acted as a mediator for drug peddlers and clients. His name cropped up during questioning of some of the accused arrested in the case which is linked to late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case. In October last year, the NCB had arrested one Nigerian national by the name of Uka Emeka alias Godwin and recovered 4 grams of cocaine from him. The seized drug had originated from a South American country and Godwin was suspected to have delivered the contraband to the peddlers in Pali Hill area, Bandra, Andheri, Juhu and Khar. Godwin’s interrogations led them to Kshitij Prasad and Agisilaos Demetriades. Demetriades, who is the brother of actor Arjun Rampal’s girlfriend, was arrested by the NCB in another case on September 25 from Goa with alleged possession of a small quantity of charas. “Jaani’s name has also cropped up in chats with Rhea Chakraborty, where they are seen discussing drugs and buds. We had earlier questioned Jani as he was a good friend of Rajput,” said an official. Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik were arrested by NCB last year in the drug case which was discovered during probe into Rajput’s death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-arrests-director-of-bandra-hotel-in-drug-case/articleshow/86664217.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Lucknow||An unconventional CM with focus on development, good governance||No chief minister in Uttar Pradesh has arrived at a moment of greater urgency than Yogi Adityanath, at least in recent decades. The man who took that oath of office seemed cut from his predecessors— a math Mahant, a firebrand young man who became a politician and subsequently named as the chief minister, a prodigious orator from Gorakhpur whose unconventional persona can hardly go unnoticed, is either deeply revered or disliked. My own first and the only encounter with him as the CM was no less unconventional and fiery. Soon after assuming the reins, he started pursuing the “skeletons” of previous regimes. Sale of sugar mills seven years back was referred to the CBI for investigation. Peeved at the politics, rather than facts, driving his decision, I protested at an audience I had sought from him. His blunt response drew equally blunt responses from me. I told him on his face that as none in the Government had checked the facts before referring it to the CBI, my team would come out spotless in the agni-pariksha. This brush with Yogi notwithstanding, his focussed and resolute approach to root out corruption, particularly in government employment and, to check high-profile crimes and criminals has been most impressive. Crime and Justice At the outset of his term, Yogi Adityanath had declared his intention to make criminal justice reform a substantial part of his legacy. He reiterated his “zero tolerance” mantra towards corruption, criminals and gangsters. Crackdown on gangsters has been relentless, booking a record number of criminals under the Gangster Act and attaching record value of property. At the same time, as many as 139 hardened criminals were killed in exchange of fire with police. Economy Handling of the state’s economy speaks for itself. The Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Uttar Pradesh grew at a CAGR of around 8.43% between 2015-16 and 2020-21 to reach Rs 17.06 trillion (US$ 234.96 billion). The Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) grew at a CAGR of around 8.42% between 2015-16 and 2020-21 to reach Rs 15.12 trillion (US$ 208.34 billion). It is Yogi’s ambition of powering UP into a $1 trillion economy state, behind organising one of India’s biggest ‘Investors Summit’ in 2018 which attracted 1045 intents with investments worth Rs 4.28 lakh crore. Four and a half years after occupying office, the unemployment rate of UP reached 4.4% which was the lowest it has been in a decade. The current unemployment rate in UP stands at 7.0 %. Prior to 2017, unemployment was above 18% and with the Yogi’s resolute style of functioning, the figures have remained well below 10%. Meanwhile, UP has emerged as the top investment destination and has received 98 investment proposals worth Rs 13,408.19 crore in the manufacturing sector during the past four years. The state, ranked number 2 in the country for ‘Ease of Doing Business’, has become the hotspot for foreign investors as well. Women Empowerment Women’s empowerment has been a quintessential subject in Yogi’s development agenda. Women are seen as the catalysts for development and it is for the same reason the state government launched its ‘Mission Shakti’ programme last year with the aim to create awareness about women empowerment and rights and to ensure their safety, dignity, and self-reliance. The Yogi government started ‘Kanya Sumangala Yojana’ as part of which a sum of Rs 15,000 is deposited at the time of the birth of a girl child under this programme. The initiative has benefited over 9.91 lakh girls through direct benefit transfer (DBT). Employment The Yogi-led government has so far given jobs to over 4.5 lakh and by the end of the government’s present term, the number will cross five lakh. These government jobs are free from any corruption charges. Building a world-class transportation system (expressways, metros) is part of what has made UP such a formidable force. Yogi has tasked UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) to build four expressways — 340-km Purvanchal, 296-km Bundelkhand, 91-km Gorakhpur Link and 594-km Ganga expressway. These will bring production centres within a few hours’ distance of major consumption centres or industrial hubs; paving way for cascading economic development of even remote areas. Transparency Transparency is central to good governance and the Yogi government has made it a cardinal rule. The state government has set a record in timely procurement of cane and payment to sugarcane farmers besides taking a big step in giving slips to the farmers from the information technology centres. This was possible because the government had decided to set up IT centres at all the 145 sugarcane cooperative societies of the state to provide sugarcane slips to sugarcane farmers in a timely and systematic manner which has given a big relief to 4.5 crore sugarcane farmers. The state government also implemented an online single window system ‘Nivesh Mitra’ in February 2018 to facilitate digital clearances to start and operate a business in the state. The government has performed admirably in all spheres because Yogi led from the front. He has toured the state most intensively and his visits have not been ceremonial.

---||Lucknow||Kanpur businessman death: Autopsy shows deep injuries on forehead & hand, blood clots in eye||LUCKNOW: Kanpur businessman Manish Gupta’s body bore abrasions and contusions on the forehead, lacerations on his right hand and blood clots on the eye, as per the autopsy report accessed by TOI. The cause of death was attributed to ante-mortem injuries. Police said, injuries were caused by a fall towards the right, triggering a swelling on the forehead. Gorakhpur police said, they will rope in forensic experts to establish the sequence of events that led to the businessman’s death. A court-qualified forensic expert and graphologist, Anurag Srivastava, with whom TOI shared the autopsy report, said injuries on the elbow seem to have been caused by a blow from a blunt object. “When the body is at rest, it cannot generate such force,” said Srivastava. “Hematoma was also detected on forehead along with swelling, which again points to external force,” he said.On September 28, a friend who shared the room with the Kanpur businessman, alleged police had brutally thrashed Gupta, before he was repeatedly slapped and whisked away from the room. He said, police began assaulting them when they questioned the reason for waking them up in the middle of the night. Police, however, claim that a sozzled Gupta slipped and fell, causing injuries which proved fatal. He died during treatment at a local hospital, they added. A police official disclosed that during a routine verification drive, police got suspicious when they found the trio of Manish Gupta, Pradeep Chauhan and Hardeep Singh Chauhan of Gurugram had checked in at a hotel room on Monday morning after submitting a single identity card at the reception.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/autopsy-shows-deep-injuries-on-forehead-hand-blood-clots-in-eye/articleshow/86666272.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Shimla||In Himachal Pradesh, Yol locals fighting the same battle as Secunderabad Cantonment Board||SHIMLA: About 2,000 km away from the Secunderabad Cantonment residents of Yol in Himachal Pradesh are fighting a similar battle: to break away from the Cantonment’s control. Dejected by the lack of development within the Khaysol Cantonment area -- not too far from Dharamshala -- roughly 15,000 locals here are demanding a merger with the local administration, but to no avail. While after years of struggle, the ministry of defence (MoD) in December 2019 finally agreed to abolish the Cantonment, the state government’s failure to pay compensation, in lieu of assets and liabilities, put a spanner in the works. “For over 30 years we have been urging the authorities to include us in the panchayat as the Cantonment board has failed miserably in ensuring development of the area,” said Gian Chand, president, Gram Panchayat Nirman Sudhar Sangarsh Samiti, Yol. He claimed that the area has fallen back in growth, despite paying all taxes. Incidentally, the concerns of Yol residents are very similar to those living in the civilian pockets of SCB – stringent building by-laws, erratic water supply and damaged roads. In both places, residents rue how they can make no modifications to their properties, and have to live with regular sewage overflow on the roads and limited water in their homes. In fact, Yol residents claim that 98% families there are poor, and their development can happen only if it is brought under the ambit of the panchayat. Members of the Sangarsh Committee, created to spearhead this movement for merger, also feel that people can avail of facilities like the Mahatama Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and National Rural Health Mission, if the cantonment board is abolished. “The issue is now between the state and central governments. The fate of residents rests in their hands and the final decision that they take,” said Col J S Jarial (retd), member of the Sangarsh Samiti. He added: “The High Court of Himachal Pradesh had also ordered winding up of the cantonment from Yol. Yet, nothing has happened till date.” A similar cry for an early decision on the SCB-GHMC merger was raised by residents back home. “Yol is close to realising its dream and the authorities must act on it soon, to turn it into reality. In the case of SCB areas too, the local legislator must raise the issue in Assembly and mount pressure on the state government and MoD to give people what they want,” said S V Raghu, president, Paigah Colony Residents' Association, Secunderabad Cantonment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/in-himachal-pradesh-yol-locals-fighting-the-same-battle-as-scb/articleshow/86661966.cms||Anand Bodh

State transport and housing minister Firhad Hakim is scheduled to inaugurate the carnival. Several motor companies as well as other stakeholders will demonstrate different kinds of electric vehicles and their usage in the three-day event to conclude on Sunday. The carnival was earlier scheduled to be held from September 24 to 26 but was deferred and rescheduled due to bad weather. Officials said that the objective behind organising the event was to generate awareness on electric vehicles. “Since electric vehicles are a new concept, there is a need to generate awareness and to have a platform where people can see and experience electric vehicles for ensuring higher use of such vehicles,” an official said. NKDA is also planning to organize an electric vehicle rally in December. NKDA has been taking up several initiatives to promote and develop the use of electric vehicles in New Town which is being developed as a green smart city. Presently, there are eight charging stations in the township. Also e-bikes have been introduced and presently Hidco is operating three electric run buses in the township with plans to procure more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suman-three-day-electric-vehicle-carnival-in-new-town-30-09-21/articleshow/86661986.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Don’t project Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan as villain for votes, kin writes to PM Narendra Modi||HYDERABAD: The great grandson of erstwhile Nizam VII, Mir Osman Ali Khan, has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to restrain BJP leaders from dragging the name of the last ruler of the princely state of Hyderabad in the mud during elections. Ahead of Huzurabad bypoll on October 30, Nizam's great grandson Himayat Ali Mirza has also written to the Election Commission to issue instructions to political parties against the alleged misuse of the Nizam's name for political and electoral benefits. He said he will approach the high court as the Nizam's name is "maligned during every election" in Telangana for votes. He found fault with some leaders for using the name, Nizam, as a generic term for villain-hood to denigrate political opponents. Mirza, who is the grandson of Moazzam Jah, the second son of Mir Osman Ali Khan, told TOI that he had also sent representation to Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda requesting them to advise party leaders to not drag the Nizam’s name in public meetings and election rallies. My great grandfather died long ago. He was not part of any political party. The Huzurabad byelection is a fight among BJP, TRS, Congress and others. Let them fight the poll on public issues and win it. Why should one drag the name of the Nizam, who has nothing to do with present-day politics?” he wondered. Mirza’s appeal comes in the wake of increasing efforts by some politicians to project the Nizam as a villain. He feared that the Nizam’s vilification will continue well into the campaign for Telangana state assembly polls in 2023 and the general elections in 2024. "When India became the Republic on January 26, 1950, the Government of India appointed him as the Raj Pramukh or governor of Hyderabad state. The Nizam held a constitutional post and no political party or politician can talk bad about him," Mirza said. He said there was not a single criminal case against the Nizam. He added that while former rulers are held in high esteem in other states, some politicians in Telangana are spreading falsehood about the Nizam, who is credited with banning capital punishment and separating the judiciary from the executive. "The Nizam saw Hindus and Muslims as his two eyes. He was the largest donor of grants to places of worship of all faiths. The Nizam gave special paid leave for employees visiting pilgrim centres like Banaras," Mirza said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dont-project-nizam-as-villain-for-votes-kin-writes-to-pm/articleshow/86667014.cms||Syed Akbar

Several mango orchard owners from rural Thane recently approached the state agriculture department to get the geographical indicator (GI) tag for Thane mangoes along the lines of the Ratnagiri haapus, said officials from the agriculture department. The officials said that GI tagging will ensure quality assurance to customers and give them priority to export to Europe and the US, thus maximising profits for cultivators. “This is the first time Thane mango farmers have evinced interest in getting their product geo-tagged. Konkan Alphonso is in high demand due to its flavour and aroma and has secured GI tag for last few years. Thane district, also part of Konkan region, was left behind and so we thought of giving it a push as the produce here is exactly the same as in the coastal belt,” said Ankush Mane, agriculture officer. In all, 118 cultivators recently approached the district agriculture department. Once registered, all farm produce will carry a unique code that will give details of the fruit, said officials. The farmers said they were reeling under losses due to the pandemic and drop in sales due to influx of the mango variants from Karnataka and Gujarat. “Our market is presently largely restricted only till Kalyan or Mumbai and is affected by lookalikes that are sold cheaper. We usually earn around Rs 350-400 a dozen but we are told that the same product, once GI tagged, can sell for higher value in the global market. Also, buyers will also get genuine products as every crop would undergo stringent protocol,” said Eknath Tarmale, a cultivator from Shahpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-in-a-first-thane-haapus-to-get-gi-tag-will-vie-for-slice-of-global-mkt/articleshow/86664287.cms||Manoj Badgeri

The state has also decided to give priority to clear the dues of cane farmers from the revenues generated from the sale of sugar stocks. The Group of Ministers (GoM) on the debt-ridden sugar factories held virtual meeting with senior officials on Thursday and resolved to clear the sugar stocks to take advantage of the increase in the prices.  Industries minister Mekapati Gautham Reddy, municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana, and agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu held discussions on the grievances of the farmers and the workers. Botcha Satyanarayana asked the industries minister to appoint a three-member committee also comprising sugar commissioner and director to auction the stocks piled up in the factories. Agriculture minister said Chodavaram, Tandava and Etikoppaka factories owed dues to the tune of Rs 70 crore. He suggested VRS to lessen the burden on the mills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/sugar-factory-workers-to-get-arrears-before-dasara/articleshow/86662009.cms||Samdani MN

A few suspects have been rounded up for questioning, and officers said they were likely to achieve a breakthrough in the case soon. Deepak Khambit, 49, an officer with the Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation (MBMC), was returning home from work on Wednesday evening when two men on a bike fired shots at his official vehicle. The windowpanes were shattered and the broken glass shards left Khambit injured on the face and neck.“Khambit said that he had not received any threats or extortion calls from anyone,” said a police officer. Investigators believe that while discharging his official duties, Khambit may have antagonised someone, and the incident could be its fallout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-attack-on-civic-officials-car-meant-to-scare-him-say-police/articleshow/86666432.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Busy actress can still look after kid, says Bombay HC, upholds custody||MUMBAI: Upholding actor Shweta Tiwari’s custody of her minor son, the Bombay high court on Thursday said just because she is busy does not mean she cannot look after him. “In our view, the issue of welfare of the minor cannot be determined on the sole parameter of the work commitment of one parent and availability of ample time with another. The fact that the respondent is a busy actress cannot be construed to unfavourably judge her suitability to have the custody of Master R,” said a bench of Justices S S Shinde and Nijamoodin Jamadar. They, however, allowed Kohli virtual access for minimum 30 minutes on weekdays and 2 hours physical access on weekends. “Before parting, we hope and trust the petitioner and respondent, who claim to be adept at playing characters in reel life, act in the best interest of Master R in real life,” Justice Jamadar wrote for the bench. The verdict was passed in a habeas petition by Tiwari’s estranged husband Abhinav Kohli (39) to produce the child she has “absconded” with since October 2020 and to transfer custody to him. Both live in different wings of the same apartment. They married in July 2013 and their son was born in November 2016. Kohli’s petition said Tiwari is extremely busy with her professional commitments and has no time for parenting. In contrast, in 2019 he decided not to take up professional work and devote his entire time, effort and attention to bringing up his son. Tiwari’s reply referred to police complaints that Kohli has proven to be a threat to her, her family members and, particularly, the child. Kohli’s advocate Swapana Kode argued that the child’s welfare can be improved by a change in custody. Tiwari’s advocate Hrishikesh Mundargi countered that only custody of a mother can be said to be proper custody during tender age. The judges said in determining custody, the paramount consideration is the welfare of the minor and not the legal rights of the parents. Also, considering the child’s age, the tender years rule, which has statutory recognition, is brought into play. They noted that while allegations of neglect and lack of care attributed to Tiwari are in the realm of disputed questions of facts, there is an equal body of counter allegations against Kohli. They also said the issue of Tiwari’s work commitments putting hindrance in the development of the child is again an argument that needs to be adjudicated. “In the light of the material on record, we are of the view that there are no exceptional circumstances which would warrant departure from the tender years rule. Nor is there such material which prima facie indicates that custody with respondent (Tiwari) is detrimental to the welfare and development of Master R,” said the judges, declining to direct a change in custody. Kohli has been allowed to move the family court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-busy-actress-can-still-look-after-kid-says-hc-upholds-custody/articleshow/86664378.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Hyderabad||Telangana holds breath as Covid triggers spike in lung transplants||HYDERABAD: Worried health authorities in Telangana on Thursday said they are staring at a record number of lung transplant cases, underscoring the devastating impact of the coronavirus on the human body. Before the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, only 25 transplants were recorded under the flagship Jeevandan programme in earlier seven years. The last 18 months have already seen over 100 transplants and it is for the first time that the number of recipients is more than the number of donors with a waiting list of around 50 in the state, said Dr G Swarnalatha, in-charge of Jeevandan, adding that earlier there were always more donors than takers and there never was a waitlist. “With Covid-19 infecting the lungs, we are seeing good number of patients requiring lung transplantation and a lot of people are registered and getting the transplantation done. Also, hospitals have onboarded experts and lung transplantation teams have improvised their strategies and expertise,” she said. Dr Swarnalatha said people are also coming forward for transplant, if they have complications. A lot of discussion has been there around the subject and people have seen patient outcomes which created certain positive vibes among the public,” she added. While lung transplantations have seen a jump during the pandemic, primarily due to severe damage to the lungs from the Covid-19 , the awareness about lung transplant has increased rapidly and doctors say patients are now requesting for a transplant all by themselves too. “Lung transplantation came into prominence in the eyes of the public and they started expecting lung transplantation especially after a report from the US about an Indian doctor doing a lung transplant for a Covid-19 patient in the University of Chicago, becoming viral,” said Dr Jnanesh Thacker, senior cardio-thoracic heart-lung transplantation surgeon, Yashoda Hospitals, Secunderabad. Dr Thacker, who has completed 500 heart and lung transplants globally and entered the world registry said: “I have had lot of patients who are asking one on their own. People have realised it can save them from death.” Among the selfdeclared transplant patient is a 39-year-old businessman from Musheerabad. “I was weaned off the ventilator after 15 days but even after that I continued to have breathlessness. That is when I sought a transplantation,” he said. But, not all are suitable for transplantation. “While most of the Covid-19 patients are recovering within 2-3 months but a subset of patients who were affected with severe Covid-19, who were oxygen dependent have remained the same even after 3-4 months. This group might require transplantation,” said Dr A Raghukanth, senior consultant pulmonologist, Medicover Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-holds-breath-as-covid-triggers-spike-in-lung-transplants/articleshow/86667028.cms||Amrita Didyala

After 1998, talks of merging civil areas of Secunderabad Cantonment have sprung up again. What are your plans to take up this issue with the chief minister? A. Though MLAs have been elected and served people in Cantonment constituency, I am the first MLA to raise the SCB merger with GHMC (erstwhile MCH). Former united AP chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had responded positively and took it to the MoD’s notice but it did not materialise. I will raise the issue again in this ongoing Assembly session Q. How are you approaching the CM to take this issue to the MoD? A. A fresh letter urging to merge Cantonment’s civil areas with GHMC will be represented to the chief minister K Chandrsekhara Rao either by meeting him directly or taking help from TRS working president KT Rama Rao Q. Will the CM agree to this proposal and how will he convince the MoD? A. I will convince him and explain to him about the people’s problems. We will discuss issues being faced by locals such as regularisation of defence land, where people have been staying for over five decades, road closures, improper implementation of Union and even state government schemes Q. What are some hurdles en route to the merger? A. First, the chief minister has to accept it. Then, bring it to the MoD’s notice. Only based on the CM’s decision, can I chalk out a plan of action Q. Are you confident the CM will accept your plea? If not, what are the alternative plans? A. I have confidence that the CM will accept it. It is too early to come to a conclusion Q. Are the residents of Secunderabad Cantonment really willing to merge with GHMC? A. People are fed up with military authorities’ attitude and are ready for a merger. In fact, the chief minister had even announced he would adopt Annanagar in Rasoolpura during his first poll campaign in 2014. He had taken this call after locals flooded him with complaints over civic issues and restrictions being imposed by airport authorities to build new structures||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scb-locals-fed-up-with-military-control/articleshow/86662157.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 19-year-old attacked by leopard even as traps set up to cage her||MUMBAI: A 19-year-old man, Rajesh Rawat, was attacked by a leopard near Film City in Goregaon around 9pm on Thursday The teenager, who had to be administered sutures on the head, has been admitted to Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma Care Centre, Jogeshwari. He had gone there to drop his friend when the attack took place. The attack is the fifth in a month which comes at a time when forest officials claimed that they have identified the wild cat as a female leopard, about two years old, who they said is responsible for the spate of recent attacks on humans at Aarey Colony. Principal chief conservator of forests Sunil Limaye has permitted trapping of the leopard and, if needed, for it to be tranquillised. After permission was received, three cages were set up at Aarey Colony on Thursday evening in a zone identified by researchers where she is likely to roam. Limaye said a team of researchers and volunteers doing camera-trapping at Aarey zeroed in on an animal suspected of attacks on people. There are multiple leopards that roam Aarey forest. In the last census done using camera traps nearly three years ago, nine leopards had been identified in Aarey. Limaye said it was difficult to pinpoint the suspect leopard. To get an idea of leopards roaming around the conflict site, camera trapping was done by forest department with biologist Nikit Surve and others. “On Monday, the team was returning after installing cameras when they saw a leopard charging at at least two people in Aarey around 8.15pm. The team waited there for some time, and were able to click the picture of the leopard. The picture clicked was matched with past pictures from Aarey and it matched that of one leopard. Based on these findings, permission has been given to capture/tranquillise the leopard,” said Limaye. “Leopards can be trapped with cages and, in this case, as it is a young adult, it should not be difficult. But if there is need for it to be tranquillised, we have a team at Sanjay Gandhi National Park that can carry out the tranquillisation,” he said. Naturalist Shardul Bajikar said it is vital to trap the leopard and take it to the rescue centre. “In 2004, there was a similar man-animal conflict which led to the killing of 14 people. The outcry that followed led to 28 leopards of SGNP being put in the rescue centre. It is better that one leopard is captured than the entire ecosystem being harmed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-19-year-old-attacked-by-leopard-even-as-traps-set-up-to-cage-her/articleshow/86664403.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Nagpur||Local body bypolls: Keenly contested but unlikely to impact political equations||Nagpur: Even as political campaigning in Nagpur district for the October 5 local body bypolls is going on full throttle, the result itself is unlikely to have any major impact on the political scenario in Zilla Parishad. With the Congress-NCP led alliance already in the driver’s seat, holding around 30 out of 58 seats, these bypolls may only help opposition parties score brownie points if they are able to make some inroads in the remaining ZP seats. Bypolls are being held for 16 ZP and 32 Panchayat Samiti (PS) seats. Ashish Jaiswal, independent MLA from Ramtek, whose allegiance is with the Shiv Sena, said, “While ZP polls won’t make an impact, in PS we can can change the trend. A win in ZP will also boost party morale.” Sudhir Suryawanshi, Shiv Sena leader and coordinator for the polls, said that though these bypolls won’t result in change of power in the ZP, there are still a lot of things worth fighting for. “We will play an important role in the opposition as it’s important in a democratic set up,” said Suryawanshi. The party has a pre-poll arrangement with the Prahar Janshakti Party. Surywanshi ruled out any post-poll arrangement with the BJP. “I can guarantee you that we will never go with the BJP in these polls,” he said. The BJP is trying to make a dent into the Congress-NCP numbers and has fielded candidates at all places. BJP’s Nagpur (rural) chief Arvind Gajbhiye said, “We have support from (Ramdas) Athawale and the Sulekha Kumbhare group, but candidates are from our party. The BJP is fighting these bypolls on issues related to farmers because the state government has not done enough for them. Apart from this, there is a lot of corruption going on at the ZP level which we will expose.” Even though NCP is in a safe position, there are questions being raised about Katol tehsil where the incumbent MLA Anil Deshmukh is facing heat from central agencies. Shivraj Gujar, NCP’s Nagpur (rural) chief, said, “Even though Deshmukh is not part of the campaign, all his supporters and our party workers are on the ground 24/7. The response we are getting is extremely positive and there is no doubt in our mind that NCP shall win all the five seats that we are contesting.” Rajendra Mulak, former minister and Congress’ Nagpur (rural) chief, said, “We are contesting the polls with our allies. Out of 16 ZP seats, we are fielding candidates in 10.” These bypolls have also come as a chance for political parties to show their committment to ultimately implementing political reservation for OBCs, by giving tickets to candidates from the community. What kind of polls are these? These are bypolls for a specific number of seats, not the general polls that are held for every seat. It’s being held for ZP and panchayat samitis (PS) in total six districts of Maharashtra. On how many seats being contested in Nagpur district: 16 in ZP and 31 for PS. How many candidates are in the fray:  79 in ZP and 125 in PS How many eligible voters: 2,96,721 (female) 3,19,292 (male Date of poll: October 5 Counting to begin: October 6 Results: October 8||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/local-body-bypolls-keenly-contested-but-unlikely-to-impact-political-equations/articleshow/86664421.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

But, East Godavari police have denied permission to hold the ‘srama danam.’ Irrigation authorities said the bridge is the sole property of the department and they are permitting commuters to use it on humanitarian grounds. However, Pawan is keen on starting the programme from Godavari bridge as he had successfully conducted a huge meeting there eralier.

---||Mumbai||In a first, BMC to auction 2 seized choppers over property tax dues||MUMBAI: Facing a stiff challenge to meet its target of property tax collections, the BMC, in the first such instance, is set to auction two helicopters that it had seized in 2020 from a private company to recover its Rs 4.1 crore dues. The BMC will soon appoint a consultant to calculate the value and then sell the helicopters. Civic officials said the BMC had seized two helicopters from a company which had not paid property tax to the tune of Rs 4.1 crore. “We had seized the two helicopters from a private company and sealed them at the Juhu airport. We have floated tenders to appoint a consultant to value the flying machines and then auction them. We will recover the dues from the sale proceeds,” said Vishwas Mote, assistant municipal commissioner, assessment and collection. The BMC has only managed to collect Rs 627 crore in property tax so far. The property tax department has kept a modest target of Rs 5,000 crore this year. At Rs 5,135 crore, the BMC managed to collect its highest-ever property tax in financial year 2020-21. This came in a year when the BMC had taken an internal loan of Rs 5,876 crore to meet its expenses. “Recovery of property tax was a major challenge this year in the wake of the Covid-19-induced lockdown. However, due to proper planning and effective implementation of that plan, 98% of the target of Rs 5,200 crore was been achieved,” an official said.  BMC officials said it had seized the helicopters of a Delhi-based aviation company. The BMC had given the company operating from Vile Parle 21 days to pay the dues but it did not. In 2019-20, the property tax collection was Rs 4,161 crore. Facing a dip in revenue collection, in 2019, BMC had decided to go after big defaulters. It began to seize movable properties, including air-conditioners, television sets and furniture. A civic official said based on its 2016 policy, the BMC sent notices to the defaulters and then began to disconnect their water connection for three weeks besides sealing lifts and entrance to the properties.

---||Chennai||Job scam: CMDA likely to terminate 18 employees||CHENNAI: The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has decided to terminate the services of at least 18 employees who were illegally recruited and issued appointment orders just a day before the model code of conduct for TN assembly polls kicked in on February 25. The candidates did not possess either the required educational qualification or the age criterion prescribed in the notification. Sources told TOI that notices calling upon the employees to explain why their services should not be terminated were served to them on Monday. They have been given 15 days to reply to the notice. A chief planner of the agency who played a key role in the recruitment drive and was in charge of the administration at that time, and another administrative officer who was part of the (recruitment) drive have been chargesheeted by the CMDA for irregularities. “The two officials overlooked prescribed qualifications in appointing the 18 candidates,” a senior CMDA official told TOI. Sixty-thousand applications were received by the CMDA for 131 junior assistant, steno-typist grade III, typist, field man and messenger job vacancies. Of the selected employees, 18 who were absorbed for Grade IV and III level postings were found ineligible even to apply for the posts. Yet, they were appointed by the previous AIADMK government just a day before the commencement of the poll code. Though the employment notification mentioned 30 years as upper age limit, one person aged 39 years was recruited. Another candidate, selected as junior assistant, did not possess a degree at the time of appointment even though a degree was the mandatory educational qualification for the post. A written test was conducted for the positions of junior assistant, steno-typist grade III and typist, followed by physical interviews for 275 candidates who were shortlisted from out of the 44,000 applicants. About 16,000 individuals applied for 53 vacant fieldman and messenger posts for which interviews alone were conducted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/job-scam-cmda-likely-to-terminate-18-employees/articleshow/86664427.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

He backed the victim’s family demand for a CBI probe, and said the government should help the family with Rs 2 crore as ex-gratia besides a government job to Manish’s wife. Akhilesh demanded immediate suspension of district magistrate (DM) and senior superintendent of police (SSP) Gorakhpur for “trying to dissuade the family not to push for FIR against the accused policemen”. He said that it is the responsibility of the police to protect the victim’s family. After meeting the bereaved family, Yadav while addressing media persons said that “in the BJP government, the police instead of protecting, are killing people”. “Earlier, such behaviour of the police was not seen in anyone’s government. Such incidents are happening continuously under BJP rule. In the BJP government, the police are constantly involved in murder and loot,” said Yadav. He added, “The intention of this government is not clear. Deaths are happening in police custody. The human rights commission has given the maximum number of notices to the BJP led state government.” He said that when BJP makes police and DM do wrong things, then the result will be the same. “Action is not being taken against the police and officers because the government has made them do wrong things. Those who have done this incident are not ordinary people. It has been learned that similar incidents have taken place in Unnao and in Gorakhpur. It is difficult to get justice unless there is a judicial inquiry. Justice cannot be expected in BJP rule,” he said. SP chief said that the BJP government does the work of killing the truth. “The officer involved in the businessman murder case is such that the booths were looted under his supervision in Amroha. A fair investigation is not possible in Gorakhpur. So the investigation should be done in Kanpur,” he demanded. Yadav said that no one can imagine what had happened to Manish Gupta. “This incident is sad and unimaginable. The level of police in the BJP government has gone below the zero level of sensitivity. After the murder of the deceased Manish Gupta, the police did not even have mercy on his child. The child continuously cried due to hunger throughout the way but the policemen did not stop the car. What could be more shameful than this. The BJP government has crossed all limits of atrocities,” said Akhilesh further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/akhilesh-meets-manish-guptasfamily-seeks-rs-2cr-ex-gratia/articleshow/86662203.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

He also gave development plans to the residents and inaugurated projects of Rs 550 crore of various government departments. “The public should beware of crocodile tears of these people. These are the same people who criminalized politics and politicised criminals and brought them to power. UP’s name got spoiled because of these criminals. These people do not waste any opportunity to defame the state and spread anarchy,” the CM said while addressing a public meeting at DAV Sports College ground near Phool Bagh here on Thursday. On the death of the city-based businessman Manish Gupta in Gorakhpur, the CM said that the accused involved in the tragic incident will not be spared. “We will remain connected with the pain of the family for the rest of our life.” He said, “Two days ago a tragic incident happened in Gorakhpur and on the same day I had asked to register a case immediately. Whoever is guilty in the case will not be spared. The government has a policy of zero tolerance to crime and criminals, the government has done what it said. I had already told the Kanpur administration that I have to meet the victim’s family.” The CM, who arrived at the DAV College ground near Phoolbagh to address a public meeting, first inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of projects worth Rs 550 crore. After this, he fed ‘kheer’ to five children, did ‘annaprashan’ and handed symbolic keys to the beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Along with this, symbolic cheques of grant money were given to the beneficiaries of various schemes. Before addressing the crowd, he chanted ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and ‘Vande Mataram’, and congratulated the sitting MP, MLA and all the BJP leaders associated with the organization and all the people present in the pandal. He said, “Not only Uttar Pradesh but the first industrial city of the country is related with the ‘aviralta’ and purity of Mother Ganga. Today, this platform has brought projects of Rs 550 crore for Kanpur city. Kanpur is once again being established with its new aura. Kanpur was once the main industrial city of UP and the country. But, after independence, due to continuous neglect of this area, no concrete model of development and no special attachment in the mind of the governments for the citizens was there.” “As a result, the industries were closed. Not only did industries shut down, but if any city was to be blamed for spoiling Mother Ganga, it was Kanpur,” said CM and added, “But, today we are indebted to the Prime Minister, because of his Namami Gange project, the Sismau drain of Kanpur, which once used to pour 14 crore liters of sewage water into Ganga Maiya every day has been completely closed. With the purity and aviralta of Maa Ganga, now the all-round development of Kanpur has to be taken to a new height,” he added. The CM said that the Centre and the state government together have given many schemes to Kanpur. “One such project is Kanpur Metro, which is going at full speed. Now, Metro trains are also coming here. Metro operation is also going to get here by the end of November... This is the emerging map of Kanpur. This is the same Kanpur, where there was apathy due to the inaction, redundancy and corruption of the previous governments. But today, a new airport is being built in Kanpur where three planes can land simultaneously and park. Five hundred people will be able to come together in the terminal and see the development,” he said. He said that this is a changing Kanpur and in this sequence all the projects are being inaugurated and foundation stone is being laid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/cm-targets-oppn-says-it-does-not-miss-opportunity-to-defame-state/articleshow/86662256.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The senior citizen couple moved the HC seeking directions to the Raigad collector and Panvel tehsildar for recovery of the money they paid for the flat in the promoter’s Sunflower project. The builder is yet to be traced. The MahaRERA had earlier issued a recovery warrant for the same and had also imposed a penalty of Rs 10 lakh on the builder. The couple had booked a 2 BHK for Rs 25 lakh in January 2012, and possession of the flat was to be given in 2014. They had paid over Rs 15 lakh to the promoters. The builder, however, allegedly sold the flat to a third party, who then allegedly resold it to another party. The HC’s September 14 direction for a non-bailable warrant against Sapan Naskar — a resident of Panvel and one of the promoters of the Sunflower project — came after he failed to appear in the court and the Khandeshwar police official informed that a bailable warrant of arrest could not be executed as Naskar appeared to be absconding. However, Vijay Nagpal, a partner in the project, was present in the court. Home buyers Rosary and Joseph Chettiar, who were represented by advocate Manish Gala, approached the HC alleging dereliction of statutory duty and failure to exercise powers vested in the Raigad collector and Panvel tehsildar, and sought directions to the revenue authorities to take steps for immediate recovery of all amounts due and payable by the promoters. According to the petitioners, the promoters not only failed to execute a registered agreement for sale but also delayed construction of the project, while possession of the flat was not given till 2019. Subsequently, the homebuyers filed a complaint with MahaRERA. Later, they also learnt that the promoters had illegally and fraudulently sold the said flat to a third party in 2014. Thereafter, the third-party purchaser had resold the flat. In November 2019, MahaRERA passed an order against the promoter for violations and directed the promoters to refund the amount to the homebuyers along with interest. It also levied a penalty of Rs 10 lakh on the promoters for violation of Section 7 of RERA. When the promoters failed to comply with the final order, the MahaRERA issued recovery warrants for around Rs 39 lakh for the same in November 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/navi-mumbai-bldr-fails-to-appear-hc-orders-nbw/articleshow/86664463.cms||Sanjeev Devasia

In his complaint, Rupinder Singh, a resident of Sector 70 , Mohali, alleged that his father, DSP Daljit Singh of the UT police had rented out his house to the accused cop Nazar Singh and his wife Balwinder Kaur on rent of Rs 1,500 per month.

---||Nagpur||Day before change in identity, OF Chanda delivers first Indian smart mine||Nagpur: On the eve of becoming a defence public sector undertaking (DPSU), Ordnance Factory Chanda (OFC) handed over the first batch of electronic intelligent anti-tank mine MK11 to the Army. This is the first fully indigenous product of its kind delivered to the land forces, said sources. The project was conceived nearly a decade ago but progressed slowly till last year. With disturbances on the Chinese front as a reason, the factory focused its efforts on making the mines. It finally delivered the first batch of a few hundred mines on Thursday. It has a bulk production order to deliver around 20,000 mines over a period. With all the hurdles cleared, the factory is confident of meeting the commitment in time. From Friday, OFC will be part of Munition India Limited (MIL), one of the seven DPSUs carved out of the erstwhile Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), which has been dissolved. The MIL, which is based in Pune, marks the development as well as beginning of new era, with stress on innovation research and competitiveness. Conventional mines operate on pressure, and go off only when a tank’s wheel passes over it. The electronic mines, named Adrushya, can sense the tank and explode. A conventional mine may not explode if the tank passes over without the wheels touching it. Sometimes, the pressure is not enough for the mine to go off. Adrushya can sense the presence of a tank from around 1.5 meters away. So, even if the tank passes close by, it can explode. The mines also have a mechanism to beat mine clearance systems, said an OFC official. The mines are based on designs by DRDOs labs — Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) and High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL). The Army has been using these types of mines but procured from a foreign source. This will now be a totally indigenous item, said an official. However, the journey from design to production had its own hurdles. A number of teething troubles affected the project. The designs had to be also made compatible to the production process. The project was given an impetus after IOFS officer Rajeev Puri took over the project in June 2020, leading to the first batch getting delivered. Puri trained at UK’s Cranefield University in explosive ordnance, and has now taken over as chairman of Yantra India Limited (YIL), a DPSU headquartered at Nagpur, which has eight factories under it. He is also an alumni of National Defence College, New Delhi. Ravikant Maheshwari will be now heading MIL, which now owns OFC. The technical details of the mine were presented during the handing over ceremony by additional general manager at Chanda, Sanjeev Bhola Nagpur’s Economic Explosives Limited (EEL), a subsidiary of Solar Group, has also got the transfer of technology (ToT) of the mine to explore its manufacturing.

A conman contacted the victim on WhatsApp on June 16 this year and introduced him to the trading website, said cops. “The victim was also told to connect his account to streamline the transfer of money,” said Mamta Dsouza, senior inspector at Kopri police station. The victim initially invested a small sum, on which a minimal withdrawal was allowed to convince him that he is eligible to earn profit. Following this, he invested Rs 11.5 lakh over the course of the next five days, and kept checking the website to see how much interest he had earned. In five days, he was satisfied with his earnings and tried to withdraw his money, only to realise that the website had already shut down and his money was gone. The Kopri police registered his complaint under the IPC and IT Act. The police have cautioned citizens against falling prey to such fake schemes and investing huge amounts online without verification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-man-duped-of-rs-rs-11-5l-in-5-days-on-fake-trading-site/articleshow/86664499.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

The ruling party won the seat by nearly 45,000 majority in the 2019 assembly elections, and party leaders are keen to repeat the success with an even bigger majority. The party’s recent success in the ZPTC elections has furthered the confidence of district-level leaders. YSRC bagged six out of seven ZPTCs in the constituency — winning Badvel and Porumamilla, while pocketing Kalasapadu, Sri Avadhuta Kasi Nayana, Atlur and B Kodur uncontested. Its nominees won Badvel ZPTC by a majority of over 4,500 votes, and Porumamilla by 13,380 votes. In the two mandals where elections were held, YSRC gained a majority of nearly 17,700 votes. Opposition TDP, too, is hoping to put up a good show in Badvel. Despite YSRC’s near-clean sweep in the ZPTC elections across the district, TDP put up a brave fight and won Gopavaram ZPTC in Badvel constituency. Though the party won the seat by a narrow margin of just 99 votes, the victory has energised its cadres across the constituency. TDP is said to be putting up its best efforts to give a tough fight to the ruling party as the area has traditionally been its stronghold. The family members of six-time legislator, the late Bijivemula Veera Reddy, have been with the TDP for long and their stronghold over several mandals will work to their benefit. Though Badvel is reserved for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Reddy leaders call the shots in all seven mandals.  While Kadapa MP Avinash Reddy and MLC D C Govinda Reddy will be the poll managers of the ruling party, former MLA K Vijayamma and her son Ritesh Reddy are channelising their energies for TDP candidate Dr Rajasekhar..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ysrc-aims-to-retain-badvel-seat-with-bigger-win-margin/articleshow/86662260.cms||Samdani MN

The racketeers were found selling Rs 300 special entry tickets at highly inflated rates. Seven persons including a TTD staffer, a middleman and two taxi drivers have been arrested. Tirumala Two Town inspector K Chandrasekhar told TOI that TTD vigilance and security wing caught taxi driver Sudarshan while he was selling the Rs 300 special entry darshan tickets to two groups of devotees from Raichur and Telangana for Rs 5,000 per ticket. For seven tickets which actually cost Rs 2,100, Sudarshan had collected Rs 35,000 from the devotees. During questioning, he confessed that he obtained the tickets from another taxi driver Sai Kumar. Sai Kumar was taken into custody and during interrogation told cops he had purchased the tickets from one Mohan Kumar, who in turn pointed the finger at Kiran Kumar, a junior assistant at TTD, and another person identified as Prasad. Kiran confessed to the police that he had sold Rs 300 tickets at Rs 1,000 each to the middlemen.

But their service came to an abrupt halt during the lockdown. While the government began relaxing curbs, trains and buses were off the tracks and roads for a long time. Meanwhile, cab-aggregators like Ola and Uber too suspended ride-sharing options. So, office-goers who could not afford to take a cab solo or buy vehicles turned to carpooling. With few buses, no trains and unregulated auto rickshaw services, Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) has emerged the most popular route for carpooling in Chennai. Other top areas include Guindy, Ashok Nagar, Kodambakkam and Adyar. In the suburbs, such apps are mostly used by people travelling to Ambattur and Perambur. “With more IT companies opening up now, we expect the numbers to go up in the coming days,” said K N M Rao, founder and CEO of Quick Ride, a leading carpooling app. These apps are very user-friendly. Any user who owns a car can offer a ride from point A to B. Other users in the vicinity get a notification and can accept the ride offer in case they too are travelling on the same route. At the end of the trip, the app generates the rate based on distance travelled. “Carpooling definitely helps in reducing traffic congestion, pollution levels and helps save on fuel cost,” said J Sivasubramaniam from Institute of Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP). A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that a car owner can save at least Rs 50,000 every year should they opt for carpooling. Besides mobile apps, there are hundreds of social media pages and WhatsApp groups where users regularly post messages on ride offers and seat availability. Most posts are put up the previous evening so interested people can confirm bookings at the earliest. Over a period of time, trends show that commuters choose the same set of co-riders with whom they feel comfortable and safe, say carpooling operators. Naveen Pandiarajan, a Renault Nissan employee, is a part of a WhastApp group named ‘RN Carpool’. This group has been helping him and his friends, residing in and around Perumbakkam and Sembakkam, travel to their offices for nearly two years. “We take turns driving our cars so there is no fatigue. By carpooling, we end up saving at least Rs 2,000 every month,” said Naveen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/your-ride-is-here-chennai-turns-to-carpooling-to-save-a-few-rupees/articleshow/86662342.cms||Ram Sundaram

With the inauguration of the Chatra-Itkhori transmission line, the entire district of Chatra, along with parts of Hazaribag and Koderma, would no longer have to remain dependent on DVC as these areas would now receive power directly from Jharkhand Bijli Vitaran Nigam Ltd (JBVNL), the state-owned power distribution company,” K K Verma, who is the managing director Jharkhand Urja Sancharan Nigam Ltd (JUSNL), the state-owned power transmission company and the nodal agency to lay power transmission lines in the state, told TOI. He said that the new power line will lead to rapid industrialisation of an otherwise backward region. “Around Rs 200 crore has been spent in laying the transmission lines and setting up of the grid sub-stations,” he added. “The project was conceptualised more than a decade ago, though it was only in 2019 when the Hemant Soren-led government took over the reins that work on the project picked up pace. The Chatra-Itkhori transmission line passes through the reserved forested areas for which clearances had to be sought from the forest department and the delays in obtaining the required clearances had created hurdles in speedy implementation,” he said. “A thermal power plant of 1,980MW capacity of National Thermal Power Corporation is coming up at Tandwa in Chatra district. Phase 1 of the project with an installed capacity of 660MW is expected to be completed soon. Once this project is commissioned, the newly laid Chatra-Itkhori transmission line would enable evacuation of power from the NTPC thermal power plant and enable Jharkhand to become a power surplus state,” he added. “Work is also on to free Jharkhand’s dependence on DVC completely. The erection of transmission towers and laying of transmission lines are underway through Purulia in West Bengal to Chandankyari in Bokaro district. Following initiatives from Soren, the West Bengal government has granted us permission to set up transmission towers. Once this project is done, the state’s dependence of DVC would stand greatly reduced,” he added. The state has been purchasing power at the rate of Rs 4.75 per unit from DVC whereas JBVNL power comes cheap at Rs 3 per unit. This would entail considerable savings for the state exchequer. Besides once the 660 MW NTPC Phase 1 Tandwa thermal power plant comes alive, Jharkhand would be able to sell surplus power at Indian Energy Exchange Ltd. or the country's power exchanges, at hefty profits thereby increasing money flows to the state exchequer, the JUSNL managing director stressed. “DVC power lines are also completely overloaded. The newly laid JUSNL transmission lines would not only ensure quality power supplies to power starved districts, but would also help attract a host of heavy industries from steel, to IT, food processing, cold storage, air conditioning plants etc., and boost rapid economic development of the predominately backward regions of the state,” Verma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cm-to-inaugurate-chatra-itkhori-transmission-line-today/articleshow/86662960.cms||Tapas Biswas

---||Ranchi||CM asks agri dept to finish kisan card distribution by Mar||Ranchi: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Thursday expressed displeasure over the slow-paced distribution of Kisan Credit Cards to the state’s farmers and directed the agriculture department to ensure 100% coverage by March 2022. Soren made the statements during the review of various government departments in a marathon meeting held at the Project Building and attended by chief secretary Sukhdev Singh, secretaries of department and deputy commissioners of all 24 districts. During the meeting, the chief minister also directed all concerned officials to expedite the implementation of various social security schemes. Apart from the speedy distribution of the cards to the farmers, Soren also said construction of cold storage in the districts must be completed within the timelines set. He asked the deputy commissioners to think out of the box to get the work done and specially asked Dhanbad DC to ensure that the water stored in abandoned coal mines in the district be diverted for irrigation. While reviewing the PDS schemes, Soren directed the officials to ensure that the quality of garments, which are to be distributed under the Sona-Sobhran Dhoti Saree Scheme, are of good quality. Under the scheme, 57 lakh BPL families will provide the garments at Rs 10 apiece twice a year. The chief minister also asked officials of the rural development department to use products owned and marketed under the state’s Palash brand in government buildings and premises. Besides, women, who are being provided under the Phulo Jhano Ashirwad Yojana, be associated with new livelihood programmes. Soren also emphasized on ramping up the state-sponsored scholarship programmes for students. “Last year, over 16.35 lakh students had enrolled for pre-matric scholarships while only eight lakh entries have come this year. The CM also directed that the last date for pre-matric scholarship entries be extended till October 25 while post-matric scholarship entries are extended till November 16,” a government statement issued after the meeting said. Soren also directed the mining department to ensure that illegal mining is completely stopped in the state. The government, in another statement, said necessary clearances have been issued to divert the DMFT funds for medical purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cm-asks-agri-dept-to-finish-kisan-card-distribution-by-mar/articleshow/86663163.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Hazaribag and Ramgarh were declared joint winners for 2020-21. On Thursday, state health minister Banna Gupta handed over the awards to representatives of the healthcare units at the Institute of Public Health Namkum. Kayakalp Awards are given every year. However, the awards could not given away in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. During the 2021 ceremony, the awards for 2020 were also distributed. The awards, which were handed out for four different fields — improving hygiene, sanitation, infection control and creating sustainable practices related to improving cleanliness in public healthcare facilities — carry cash prizes of Rs 50 lakh for winners in the district hospital category, Rs 15 lakh for community health centres, Rs 2 lakh for primary health centres (PHC) and Rs 1 lakh for health sub-centres (HSC). As per the provisions, 25% of the total award money is distributed among the staff as token of appreciation while the remaining 75% is used for augmenting services and infrastructure of the winning healthcare facility. Of the 65 awards handed out on Thursday, 29 were for 2019-20 and the remaining 36 were for the 2020-21 financial year. Addressing the gathering, Gupta said he will write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to increase the cash prizes. “Moreover, I will also speak to chief minister Hemant Soren to run a similar state government programme,” he said. Apart from being adjudged the best district hospital for 2019-2020, Pakur also won three other awards in 2019-2020. In 2020-21 category, too, Pakur bagged two awards in PHC and HSC categories. After receiving the award, Pakur civil surgeon Dr R D Paswan said, “I dedicate this award to the citizens of Pakur. Without their participation, it wouldn’t have been possible for us to win half-a-dozen awards.” He added, “Soon after I took charge, I saw that there were demonstrations by the locals over the cleanliness and services provided at the district hospital and I accepted there were shortcomings. So, I consulted all the staff and told them that we need to upgrade the services with their support. The locals also supported me when I started weekly cleaning on Sundays. Besides, I ensured that the maximum amount of the prize money was distributed to the sweepers. Hence, I gave the sweepers Rs 12,000 each and I allotted Rs 8,000 each to doctors from the prize money to keep their morale high.” The awards were launched by the Union ministry in 2015 to recognize and felicitate state-run healthcare centres that show exemplary performance in adhering to standard protocols. To win the prize, the healthcare facilities were evaluated on sustainable practices related to improving cleanliness in public health which lead to positive health outcomes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pakur-bags-6-kayakalp-awards-for-2019-20-hbag-ramgarh-joints-winners-for-2020-21/articleshow/86662841.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Life came to a standstill in Dhanbad which recorded highest 309mm rainfall in the past 36 hours. Water entered mines, low-lying areas, powerlines got snapped resulting in complete darkness and disruption in mobile communication. Though no mishap was reported, BCCL closed all mining activities and evacuated the workforce from the mines as a precautionary measure. Director, technical, BCCL, Chanchal Goswami said they had taken all necessary preventive measures. “Once the water started gushing into the low-lying areas, including the open-cast mines, we evacuated all the machinery and workforce, even from the underground to prevent loss of life and property,” Goswami said. The mining activity in BCCL mines is not likely to resume unless the water level recedes. Very heavy rainfall of 135.5mm and 130.5mm respectively was recorded in Giridih and Deoghar districts paralysing normal life. Despite an alert issued by the IMD, people could not prevent damage to kuchcha houses and overhead powerlines due to uprooting of trees and branches falling off under high-speed winds. Head, Ranchi IMD, Abhishek Anand, said the well-marked low-pressure area that was spotted on the Bengal-Jharkhand border on Wednesday evening shifted eastwards to cover Jharkhand and lay centred over north Jharkhand and neighbouring Bihar on Thursday around 7.6km above the mean sea level. “Under the impact of the well-marked low pressure area some parts of the state received heavy to extremely heavy rainfall, with the maximum rain of 309mm being reported from Putki in Dhanbad followed by Giridih and Deoghar. Very heavy rainfall was also reported from Bokaro while the rest of the districts received light to moderate rainfall,” he said. The system moving towards Bihar is expected to cause heavy to very heavy rainfall in northern Jharkhand during the next 24 hours with chances of extremely heavy falls at a few isolated places. It is likely to shift to Himalayan foothills, north Bihar and Sikkim in the next four to five days. “Palamu, Chatra, Koderma and Hazaribag have been categorised in red zone with a prediction of extremely heavy rainfall while Latehar, Lohardaga, Giridih and Deoghar are expected to receive very heavy rainfall till 8.30am on Friday. The rainfall activity is going to reduce during the day on Friday, though north Jharkhand districts are still expected to receive heavy rainfall,” the IMD bulletin said. The rainfall under the impact of well-marked low pressure which followed the rain under impact of cyclone Gulab last week has successfully mitigated the seasonal shortfall. As on Thursday — the last day of monsoon season —Jharkhand recorded 1,043.4mm rainfall as against the seasonal normal of 1,054.7mm indicating a negative departure of 1%. During the past two weeks, the state has received 59mm rainfall which was 24% higher than normal. Out of the 24 districts, 16 have received normal rain, three are in the excess category while five have recorded deficient rainfall.

---||Ranchi||Heavy rain cripples life in Bokaro and Deoghar||Bokaro/Dumka: Heavy downpour paralysed life in Bokaro and Deoghar districts as houses, bridges were inundated and water levels in the rivers neared danger mark. Water levels in the dams in Bokaro district rose as Damodar, Garga and Konar rivers swelled. Gusty winds uprooted trees and resulted in traffic snarls. Houses in Chira Chas, Basera and Kunj Vihar were flooded. Several portions of NH 32, which connects Dhanbad with Purulia in West Bengal, were waterlogged. A blacktop road connecting Khutri and Bhutkuru in Jaridih block was swept away on Thursday. Bokaro Steel Limited’s perimeter fence in Solagadih collapsed in heavy downpour while uprooting of trees led to snapping of power lines in many parts of the district. Waterlogging was reported in several portions of BSL’s Bokaro Township. District disaster management authority official Shakti Kumar said: “All blocks have been directed to furnish reports of damages which have been caused by the rain.” Waterlogging was reported from various parts of Deoghar as well. Localities around Baidyanath Dham temple, namely Harihar Badi, Hardakunda and Gandhinagar reported water logging up to four feet. "I woke up in the morning just like any other day but was alarmed to witness the entire colony being completely waterlogged," Shyamsundar Mishra, a resident of Harihar Badi, said. Godda MP Nishikant Dubey and Deoghar MLA Narayan Das took a tour of the rain-affected areas of the temple town on Thursday. “The municipal corporation has not removed the encroachments which affected the construction of drains and roads,” Dubey claimed. He also blamed the state government for being ignorant towards improving civic amenities of the town. "Deoghar has recorded 100 mm of rain in the last 15 to 18 hours resulting in overflowing of local rivers, including Dadhwa and Patro, with water overflowing from above the roads since today morning," a Deoghar municipal body said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/heavy-rain-cripples-life-in-bokaro-and-deoghar/articleshow/86662901.cms||Divy Khare

Operating on her was a challenge as the patient had a host of cardiac ailments, besides having other co-morbidities. Speaking to TOI on Thursday, the head of department of orthopaedics at Rims, Dr L B Manjhi, said, “It was a difficult case and I am happy that doctors gave their best. The patient is currently stable and is under observation.” Hazaribag resident Rasula Khatun came to the hospital with a broken femur on August 23 and was admitted at the orthopaedics department. After an initial diagnosis, she was referred to the cardiology department and a thorough examination revealed that she had dilated cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease and clot in left apex. The cardiology department declared the patient unfit for an immediate surgery and said that she needs to be stabilise before the surgery is performed. Dr Manjhi said, “We had thought of referring the patient to a higher centre but her family could not afford that, following which I decided to perform the surgery at our unit and explained the risks of the operation to the family members.” An inter-departmental team of doctors started treating her to improve her vitals. A week later, a few of her vitals, like blood pressure, stabilized but the doctors from the anaesthesia department during their pre-anaesthesia check found that her Left Ventricular (LV) function was below the standard level. She was declared unfit for surgery. “In these type of cases, we give spine anaesthesia but there were chances of acute fall of blood pressure. We didn’t allow the patient for surgery but after two attempts we cleared her for surgery on September 18,” assistant professor of anaesthesia department Dr Tushar Kumar said. He added, “Not only administering anaesthesia was risky but resuscitation for this kind of patient is difficult as removing the patient from ventilator becomes a challenge. However, after stabilizing the patient, we administered her anaesthesia through graded epidural catheter which allows us to sedate the patient in steps.” The assistant professor at cardiology department, Dr Prashant Kumar, said: “Any patient with a poor LV function can lose sense and it is very difficult to resuscitate such patients post-surgery, which why the surgery had to be delayed. Besides, the patient was obese and had many co-morbidities, so the risk factor was always high. But I am happy that the doctors pulled it off.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rims-conducts-high-risk-surgery-on-elderly-woman/articleshow/86663361.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||DLSA rehabilitates 97 orphans in 4 mths in East Singhbhum||Jamshedpur: The District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) has rehabilitated 97 children, who have lost either one or both their parents during the pandemic, under project Shishu which was launched on May 31. "Count of orphan children will increase as some cases are in the process of identification," said secretary, DLSA, Jamshedpur, Nitish Neilesh Sanga. Run under the supervision of Principal District Judge-cum-Chairman, DLSA, Nalin Kumar, the aim of project Shishu is to take care of children who lost their legal guardian or adoptive parents and those who lost parents who were the sole breadwinner for the family. The Special Task Force (STF), constituted in every block of the district to implement the project, includes paralegal volunteers of DLSA. "Initiated during the second wave of Covid-19, the project achieved success due to the unflinching support of the district administration, especially DC Suraj Kumar," said DLSA secretary. The beneficiaries of the project received benefits under eight government sponsored welfare schemes. Not limiting its role merely to the rehabilitation of the orphan children, DLSA has entrusted paralegal volunteers with the responsibility of regular monitoring of the beneficiaries aiming to ensure they are not deprived of the benefits at any stage. "DLSA is maintaining the data of the beneficiary children and regular monitoring is being done," said Sanga. Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh of the Jharkhand high court who is also executive chairman of the Jharkhand Legal Services Authority (JHALSA) launched the project on May 31. While implementing the project, DLSA volunteers came across a primitive Sabar family in Khadiyadih, Dighi in Patamda block. Three orphan children, who had lost both their parents, did not have a permanent place to stay. Taking initiative, DLSA, in coordination with the district administration, helped the orphan children. “Admission in the residential school, providing benefits of sponsorship scheme, Ayushman Bharat card, linkage with Antyodaya yojna, besides Rs 15,000 as funeral grant and death benefit, sports and school kits and food packets were provided to the three orphan children," DLSA secretary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dlsa-rehabilitates-97-orphans-in-4-mths-in-east-singhbhum/articleshow/86663328.cms||---

A meeting of the core committee of the high court judges was held here on Thursday and it ordered resumption of work in the physical mode in the high court from October 4 and in the district courts from October 1. In a letter issued by Jharkhand High Court registrar general Gautam Choudhary, it has been ordered that all district courts shall resume hearing cases physically from October 1. As many as 35,000 advocates in the state will be benefited by the move. The courts in the state, including the high court, had shut its doors in March 2020 when the first wave of the pandemic hit the state. The high court and the district courts then adopted virtual hearing of cases and have continued to do so. The high court has constantly been monitoring the Covid-19 situation and had recently ordered 50 per cent of the district courts to work in the hybrid (physical and virtual) mode. Secretary of Advocates Association Navin Kumar said that the meeting of the core committee has also included advocate Ritu Kumar, the president of the association, through video conferencing. It has been decided that certain standard operating procedures such as social distancing and wearing of masks have to be maintained, Kumar said. “The Association has also requested the high court to intimate the SOP to the advocates and suggestions of the bar will also be communicated to the judges for more effective implementation of the Covid-19 norms,” Kumar told the TOI. The legal fraternity is upbeat with the resumption of normal working of courts in the physical mode. “It has been a long time since advocates have been to court. Covid has affected everyone and lawyers have not been spared either. Resumption of work after more than one and a half years is what advocates have been waiting for,” said Jharkhand State Bar Council member Hemant Kumar Shikarwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/district-courts-to-reopen-today-hc-on-monday/articleshow/86662765.cms||---

---||Goa||IIT Goa, pollution board to develop forecasting tools for state’s air quality||PANAJI: Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Goa along with Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) will be undertaking a study that will continuously monitor the air quality in the state with the aim of developing a forecasting tool. The study will also help in planning for improvement in air quality by suggesting appropriate interventions. In the first six months, IIT Goa will lay emphasis on analysis of available data for which it plans to use various data science and machine learning methods to develop a forecasting tool that will predict air quality. Various techniques would be used to study the possible correlation between the measured quantities and relevant machine learning techniques will be explored for creating a forecasting model. The institute will also carry out comprehensive understanding of the air quality data across the state by deploying a low-cost sensor network for more efficient data collection and analysis. The IIT Goa proposal states that for this initial emphasis will be on finding apt sensors and developing methods for real-time air quality monitoring. These sensors will be employed closer to one of the hotspots. “It is envisaged to have data collected for the course of one year so that the sensor response to seasonal variation can also be captured. The last six months of the project will be predominantly for data analysis and finalising the forecast model for the sensor-based network,” the IIT Goa proposal states. The institute said that the collaboration with GSPCB can be extended in the future to various topics including, understanding of hotspots and relevant source apportionment. This will involve a detailed analysis of the PM which will be collected using in house techniques for future analysis. “Finding the source of various emissions and their effect on air quality is required to cause a sustainable impact on air quality and comprehensive study on the concentration of ultrafine PM in urban environments. Current measurements do not emphasise on ultrafine PM due to difficulties in measurements. Although ultrafine PM is among the primary causes for premature deaths due to pollution,” the proposal stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iit-goa-pollution-board-to-develop-forecasting-tools-for-states-air-quality/articleshow/86664584.cms||Murari Shetye
