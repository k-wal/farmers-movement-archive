One person was feared to be trapped under the debris. A control room officer of Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) said that three vehicles comprising nearly 30 fire brigade personnel have been rushed to the spot for rescue operation. An ambulance has also been deployed at the site to deal with any eventuality. A team of local police has been deployed at the spot to control the crowd. A fire briage officer said that the building was around 50 years old and it was in a dilapidated condition. Locals alleged that there are various such old structures in the walled city which are likely to collapse any time. In past two months, four such residential buildings have collapsed in the walled city area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-storey-building-collapses-in-ahmedabads-lal-darwaza-area-one-feared-trapped/articleshow/86793386.cms||Ashish Chauhan

While electronics and communication engineering (ECE), information technology (IT) were the next preferred courses, top colleges could not fill their seats in core branches such as mechanical, civil and electrical and electronics engineering (EEE) this year. The Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) on Tuesday released the provisional allotment in the first round of online engineering counselling for the general stream. Of 10,187 students who got seats, 2,868 students (28%) selected computer science engineering, 1,766 (17%) chose ECE and 1,255 (12%) preferred information technology this year. Surprisingly, the number of students opting for AI and data science was low, with only 397 students opting for the course. Engineering colleges have doubled their intake in BTech AI and data science this year. Among the core branches, 773 chose EEE while 478 preferred mechanical and 245 students opted for civil engineering. Career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi said out of 440 engineering colleges, only 14 colleges were able to fill more than 50% of seats in the first round. "More than 400 colleges were able to fill only less than 10% of their seats while 223 colleges could not fill a single seat," he said. He further said only 15 seats in Tamil medium engineering courses in civil and mechanical were filled in the first round against 1,281 seats available in the counselling. Except top colleges like College of Engineering, Guindy, PSG College of Technology and SSN College of Engineering, other colleges could not fill seats in mechanical, civil and electrical and electronics engineering. "We do not know whether the demand for software engineers will remain the same even after four years when the current batch graduates. Students are not aware of the value of core branches like mechanical and civil engineering," said K Maran, director of Sri Sairam Engineering College in Chennai. In the past few years, campus placements by core companies have come down due to multiple reasons. The pay packages are also not attractive for core branch students. Next in the pecking order after computers, students opted for electronics and communication engineering (ECE). "During the management quota admissions, students opted only for computer science and IT branches. In the counselling, many students have preferred ECE as a second choice," said B Chidambararajan, principal of SRM Valliammai Engineering College. Of 14,842 students eligible to take part in the first round, only 11,765 participated in the counselling and 3,077 skipped it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/comp-science-ece-top-choice-in-counselling/articleshow/86793855.cms||A Ragu Raman

The lapses include use of MSand for plastering. CUBE, a body raised jointly by IIT Madras and the state government, studied the dwelling units for more than a month and submitted a report to the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board (TNUHDB) on Monday. TNUHDB sources said the 441-page report has found several lapses in the construction, including plastering. The contractor, P S T Engineering Construction, was responsible to repair the damage as per the agreement. "We are initiating action against the contractor for the lapses in executing the project. Moreover, CUBE will also conduct a similar inspection in another ongoing project of the P S T Engineering Construction with the TNUHDB," an official said. The first phase of the K P Park Scheme, comprising a total number of 864 dwelling units, is spread over four blocks each with stilt + 9 floors. Two months ago, residents complained about plaster peeling off and damages in the common area, following which the TNUHDB appointed the CUBE panel to inspect the structure. Moreover, the board has appointed 10 educational institutions, including IIT Madras and NIT Trichy, to inspect about 20 ongoing projects across Tamil Nadu. This will be over and above the third party monitors appointed to examine the structures, official sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/iit-m-team-finds-lapses-in-k-p-park-tenements/articleshow/86793858.cms||---

The district-level committee will comprise of the additional district magistrate, chief district medical and public health officer, principal or head of the department of medicine of a medical college (if a medical college exists in the district) and a subject expert. “The committee will be responsible for issuance of official document for Covid-19 death. The committee will follow the procedure as outlined in the guideline of Union ministry of health and family welfare (dated September 3),” additional chief secretary (health) R K Sharma wrote to the district collectors and municipal commissioners. Asking for immediate action, the ACS (health) sought a copy of the collector’s orders forming the committees within three days. A government officer said compensation of Rs 50,000 each would be soon paid by the office of the special relief commissioner to the next of kin of the deceased. The family member of the deceased has to apply in a designated format. The compensation would be paid from the state disaster response fund for Covid deaths — starting with the first fatality in the country and till Covid-19 is de-notified as a disaster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/dists-told-to-form-panels-to-issue-cov-death-docu-for-compensation/articleshow/86794439.cms||Ashok Pradhan

The Bengali community will celebrate its biggest festival from October 11-15 by broadcasting rituals and entertainment shows via online platforms. From Shashti October 11 to Vijayadashami October 15, all pujas from bodhan to sindoor khela and visarjan will be telecast live through the pandals' web sites or apps, and YouTube and Facebook channels. The Bombay Durga Bari Samiti of Tejpal Hall, which hosts one of the oldest puja events in the city dating back to 1930, will telecast its 'ghoroa puja' through digital media. "We have engaged artisans through organisations like Artisan Soul and Haath ka Bana to display their talent at our Anand Mela which will last for a whole month. A special interview with Satyajit Ray's son Sandip Ray will mark the legendary film maker's birth centenary. Popular Bengal-based band Kolkatar Gaanwala will perform," said president Susmita Mitra. Another big puja pandal, the 100-year-old Bengal Club of Shivaji Park, is organising its 86th Durgotsav in the club house. "No gatherings will be permitted. Prasad will not be distributed in the premises. We have allocated more budget to our charity project 'Sampoorna' which provides free lunch on Saturdays to students of nearby schools," said president Dilip Das. Bengal Club's idol, as most others at Durga Puja, is made from clay. The venue will be sanitised frequently. "Though we ensure that all persons involved in puja activities are fully vaccinated, RT- PCR tests will be done as and when required," said secretary Mrinal Purkayastha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/durga-puja-goes-digital-for-second-consecutive-year/articleshow/86794088.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

But on Tuesday, a day before this year’s occasion, the appointed spot at the famous temple was filled with goons forcing people to buy their ‘packages’, each of them way above the actual rate.  When contacted, minister for Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR and CE) P K Sekar Babu promised stern action against such activities. A visit to the famous temple dedicated to Lord Murugan on Tuesday found the ‘kariya mandapam’ belonging to Greater Chennai Corporation busy. Neatly attired in white see-through shirts, the pockets containing photos of the chief minister, and black trousers, these ‘officials’ were found negotiating deals ranging from 300 to 500. Before the takeover of the government facility a few months ago, sources say, the whole process cost just 30.  Now, people say, they have little choice. A person who visited the temple a couple of days ago to have the rituals done said the situation was now in complete control of these ‘officials’. During TOI’s visit, one of them, apparently the leader, was seen dictating the proceedings in an arrogant voice, the others followed. One signboard at the mandapam warned members of the public against approaching touts for the rituals, while another board, brazenly placed cheek by jowl, prominently featured the name and the phone number of the person that should be contacted to get the rituals conducted. To make matters worse, a portion of the mandapam has also been encroached upon by vendors selling flowers to be sold for those visiting the temple and leaving very little space for the rituals. Officials in zone 10 of the corporation said that the mandapam had been handed over to the authorities of the temple. When contacted, minister Sekar Babu said any such activity was completely illegal and that strict action would be initiated against anyone found resorting to such activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/at-vadapalani-temple-officials-force-people-to-buy-mahalaya-packages/articleshow/86794823.cms||---

The commission held that there was human rights violation and also recommended disciplinary action against the personnel of Maduravoyal police station. Petition M Chokki said on March 31, 2013, her son, Yesuraj, left home after he received a phone call. She later learnt that the personnel at Maduravoyal police station took her son away. Later in the day, Chokki received a call from the local ward councillor that her son was admitted to KMCH after which she rushed there and learnt about her son’s death. Chokki, in her petition stated that her son died due to the torture at Maduravoyal police station. In response, the police personnel denied the allegations and said that Kathiravan had an extra marital relationship with a woman who was deserted by her husband and they had frequent quarrels. On March 30, 2013, the woman attempted to immolate self after a quarrel with Kathiravan and a patrol team warned the man not to disturb the woman. The next day, the duo fought again and after the neighbours informed, they were taken to the police station. Since Kathiravan was under the influence of alcohol, he was taken to the hospital and he died on the way, police said. “Police tortured the victim and if they had not taken him to the police station in an inebriated condition, he would not have died and they failed to arrange treatment in time,” SHRC member D Jayachandran stated and recommended that a compensation of 5 lakh be paid to the mother of the deceased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/govt-told-to-pay-5l-to-kin-of-man-who-died-in-police-custody/articleshow/86794829.cms||---

The state, he said, is working to increase the first dose coverage to at least 75% as per WHO recommendation, he added. "Weekly mega vaccination drives have been extremely helpful in doing this. So far, we have vaccinated more than 75lakh people in the four weekend drives,” he said. The fifth edition of the mega vaccination camp will be held on October 10, he told reporters at the Institute of Child Health, where he visited children who were undergoing treatment for dengue. At least 41 children including five of them from a slum in Perungudi were undergoing treatment at the hospital for dengue, he said. On Tuesday morning, the state had a stock of 20 lakh vaccination doses. “We are expected to receive 9 lakh additional doses today and a few more batches by the weekend. We are hoping to have a stock of at least 25 lakh doses for vaccination this weekend,” he said. Special initiatives are being undertaken to get people to come for the second doses of the vaccine during these weekend camps. “Two doses of the vaccine prevent disease and death due to viral infection. As we unlock and festive period nears, vaccinations will help us prevent hospitalizations and deaths,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. On Tuesday, the state vaccinated 1.7 lakh people pushing the dosage tally to 4.7 crore.

Officials said work is under way in many divisions including Tambaram, Perumbur, Adyar, IT corridor and Avadi. The cables are being laid using trenchless technology to minimise damage to the roads, save cost and time. A Tangedco official said 70% of the work is completed in Tambaram and Perambur divisions, while work has either started or is underway in the other areas. Areas like Perumbur, Villivakkam, Taramani, Thiruvanmiyur and Velachery will also be covered. All exposed cables and poles are making way for prefabricated cement pillars and pillar boxes to provide individual electricity connection. “Work in most of these areas started last year. It will take one more year to complete,” the official said. “Underground cable installation costs five times more than overhead cable besides high cost for maintenance and more time for rectification. But cables underground can avoid accidents, reduce power interruption during rain, which often happens with overhead cables that trips, and faults happen very rarely. When installed using good quality material, they last for a minimum 25 years,” the official added. Satish, a resident of Sholinganallur said the underground cable laying has finally commenced in Semmenchery, after the project was announced by the state government in 2019, last month and would bring a huge relief for residents from frequent power cuts that occur due to the power lines' exposure to elements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tangedco-takes-up-work-to-send-all-power-cables-underground/articleshow/86795027.cms||---

In an effort to correct this situation and also to remove the fear about these reptiles, the Chennai Snake Park has, as part of its golden jubilee celebrations, decided to use its Irula snake catchers to hold handling and rescue classes for people of 50 villages in Kancheepuram, Chengalpet and Tiruvallur districts. Park executive chairman S Paulraj told TOI that villagers would be educated about the four venomous snakes in the region. Indian Oil Corporation, which is sponsoring this programme, had agreed to provide a vehicle for transporting live snake specimens along with Irula snake catchers. “The vehicle is expected to arrive soon. Once it is handed over, the programme will start,” Paulraj said. The Irulas employed by the park will teach the villagers how to identify the various snakes and handle them. “We plan to train at least 50 people who will become rescuers and snake handlers in the future,” he said. The park also announced the launch of WhatsApp helpline number 9444748914. Using this, people coming across a snake can post its picture along with its location and get details about the species along with advice on how to treat it from the park authorities. On most occasions, Paulraj said, people encountering a snake try to beat it to death irrespective of whether it is venomous or not. Now, he said, experts manning the helpline will guide people on how to react in such situations. As part of the celebrations, a new enclosure for baby gharials (Ghavialis gangeticus) was inaugurated at the park on Monday and 23 gharials released into it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/irulas-to-educate-rural-folk-on-handling-snakes/articleshow/86795090.cms||P Oppili
---||India||Lakhimpur violence: Farmers' kin dispute autopsy, agree to cremate three after mediation||BAREILLY: For hours on Tuesday morning, families of farmers who died in Sunday’s violence at Banbirpur in Lakhimpur Kheri refused to cremate the bodies after the autopsy reports "did not mention bullet injuries". Over the day, with Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait stepping in and holding talks with the administration, the bodies of three of them were finally cremated and a second autopsy ordered for the fourth. Police, meanwhile, have set up an SIT to investigate charges from both sides. Sources told TOI that the autopsy reports of the four farmers who died on Sunday — Lovepreet Singh, 20, Nachattar Singh, 60, Daljeet Singh, 35, and Gurwinder Singh, 19 — said they had antemortem injuries and did not mention bullet injuries, indicating they died in an accident. The journalist who died, Raman Kashyap, 32, had similar injuries and died of one on his head, the report said.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin, BJP’s Khushbu Sundar slam UP's Lakhimpur incident||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin, BJP’s Khushbu Sundar and VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan on Tuesday condemned Lakhimpur Kheri incident in Uttar Pradesh, which claimed the lives of nine people including a journalist. Stalin demanded “an impartial, high-level investigation” into the death of the farmers and also condemned the arrest of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi when she went to meet the victims’ families. He tweeted, “The attack on the farmers protesting against the farm laws is highly condemnable and I demand an impartial, high-level investigation into the death of farmers. Perpetrators of this cruel act must be punished legally.” The incident took place on October 3 when a couple of SUVs in Union minister of state Ajay Mishra’s convoy ploughed through protesting farmers. They had gathered to show black flags to the Union minister as part of the anti-farm-law protest. “Opposition leaders including @priyankagandhi (Priyanka Gandhi Vadra), who tried to meet the farmers, are detained. They shall be freed and allowed to exercise their democratic rights,” he said and added that the Union government should not remain apathetic to the concerns of the farmers. It should not allow such untoward incidents to happen. It should realise that repealing three farm laws is the only way to restore normalcy and peace, he tweeted. When her party functionaries maintained silence over the incident, BJP’s Khushbu Sundar registered her protest. She tweeted, “A vehicle mowing down eight protesters in UP is unacceptable and a grave crime. Whoever is responsible for this must be booked and taken to task, irrespective of who this person is. Nothing matters more than human lives. Humanity is the essence of this country.” Thirumavalavan came down heavily on the UP government for “illegal arrest” of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi, who was on her way to meet the victims’ families and the protesting farmers. The VCK leader has also posted the video of the SUVs ploughing through the protesting farmers and termed it as BJP’s ruthlessness. He also tweeted that the Modi government should take responsibility for the incident and demanded that the farm laws be withdrawn. The VCK would organise a protest in Chennai on October 8 to condemn the killings of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stalin-khushbu-slam-lakhimpur-incident-in-up/articleshow/86796127.cms||---

According to official data, over 40 shops, which encroached public space, were demolished in the last one and half years. Even then, traffic congestion continued to get worse because the road width gets narrow near Kaliamman Koil Street-Jawaharlal Nehru Street junction. A commercial building at the said junction, which was the primary cause for the traffic bottleneck, was finally demolished on Monday as stay got vacated at the Madras high court. This will increase the road width to about 14 metres. Highway engineers have planned to remove the construction debris from this site and complete the road widening works before next weekend. This stretch would function as the service lane for the flyover. "Even before the flyover is open, this move will reduce traffic congestion. Vehicles can move even more smoothly once all the construction works are complete," said a senior highway official. The flyover is expected to be opened for public use by the end of this month. The 1.3-km bidirectional flyover, which was proposed in 2015, was supposed to be inaugurated in 2018. After facing several delays due to land acquisition issues, the last phase of construction proved to be very tricky because of the lockdown. The total construction cost of the project escalated to 93 crore. A Deepak, a resident of Chinmaya Nagar said, "We expect the police to do away with the traffic diversions (introduced during the construction phase) soon after the flyover was opened". Traffic police said that vehicles, coming from Chinmaya Nagar, can once again start travelling along Kaliamman Koil Street, take a U-turn underneath the bridge in order to reach Vadapalani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/relief-for-motorists-as-govt-starts-to-widen-koyambedu-service-lane/articleshow/86796486.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Chennai||Why some people live longer with type-1 diabetes||Chennai: City doctors are now planning genetic studies to find out how some people who were diagnosed with type-1 diabetes more than 40 years ago managed to survive despite inadequate treatment. The clues they get will help them come up with treatment protocols that will increase life span and offer quality life to people with the disorder. The city-based Dr Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre compared case sheets of 76 patients with type-1 diabetes who had survived for at least 40 years with medical records of 51 others who died sooner. At the end of the study, scientists concluded "survivors had better glycemic and blood pressure control, lower levels of cholesterol compared to non-survivors".  Complications such as vision loss (retinopathy), kidney failure (chronic renal disease), blocks in blood vessels (peripheral vascular disease), ailments of heart (coronary artery disease) and the nervous system (neuropathy) were fewer in survivors according to the results published in a scientific journal, Diabetes Technology and Therapeutics. “These results were not surprising”, said senior diabetologist Dr V Mohan, first and corresponding author of the pan-India study. But it left him, and his team, baffled. “Forty or fifty years ago, diagnosis was delayed, and disease was undertreated. There were no insulin pens or pumps. People used syringes to draw animal insulin from vials and pricked themselves once of twice a day. Yet, many patients managed to survive and live healthy,” he said. Mohan admits that they did not have an answer to how this happened, but they suspect that these people may have had some “protective” gene that kept sugar levels under control and prevented complications. “This needs a larger study,” he said. Among the 76 survivors, 58 people had survived 40-49 years with diabetes, 12 others lived for 50-59 years and 6 of them lived for more than 60 years with diabetes. “We also have two people who have lived with this for 70 years now,” he said. Most survivors had good control of blood sugar and pressure. According to the study, 50% of non-survivors had HBA1C levels above 10.5 (untreated diabetes for a long duration) compared to 8.6% among survivors. There were just 4.3% of non-survivors who managed to keep their sugar levels below 7.8 compared to 38.5% in the survivors group. It was not just sugar levels. The cholesterol levels were above 113 (very high) in 39.5% of non-survivors compared to 16.7% of survivors and blood pressure (systolic) was above 150 (normal is 120) in 31.1% of non-survivors compared to 16.3% of survivors. The survivors also had better height and weight parameters compared to the other group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/why-some-people-live-longer-with-type-1-diabetes/articleshow/86796491.cms||---

---||India||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Chilling clips from ground zero trigger war of words||BAREILLY: Shocking videos have started emerging from Lakhimpur Kheri after Sunday’s violence, in which four farmers, two BJP workers, a driver and a journalist were killed during a farm protest. While farmers - and later thousands of others - shared a video of a car crushing protesters in its path, those opposed to them posted videos of BJP men being beaten up. Farmer leaders who had congregated in the western Uttar Pradesh district soon after the mayhem have conceded that “there was retaliation” after a convoy of SUVs plowed through a marching band of cultivators. One of them had told TOI on record that it was “two BJP men and not three that had been killed”. TOI hasn’t been able to independently establish the veracity of any of the videos. In the 29-second video first shared by farmers from the site of the clash, a group of men walks slowly with black flags and banners on a road next to green fields as a siren draws near. A few men turn back and jump aside — a ‘VIP’ car is speeding ahead into the group of protesters — but most don’t realise what’s coming from behind. An elderly man, later said to be one Nachattar Singh, 63, and a few others are thrown up and then run over by the speeding vehicle, while another follows closely. “We have video evidence that clearly shows this was deliberate. That is what happened. I was there,” Gurpej Singh, a farmer, told TOI. The video, purported to be from Lakhimpur Kheri, was seen by lakhs on Twitter and shared by thousands, including BJP MP Varun Gandhi and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. “This video of Lakhimpur Kheri farmers being crushed deliberately shakes one to the core. Police should take cognizance and arrest those seen in the car and those associated with them,” Varun Gandhi tweeted on Tuesday. Priyanka, while sharing the video, tweeted, “The individuals killing those who provide us with food have not been arrested. Why?” In another video the farmers shared, a man gets out of a Thar and starts running while a flurry of men, purportedly farmers, are scrambling in the background. Farmers said that was after the cars had run some of them over. To counter Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni’s repeated statements that his son Ashish was not at the site where the killings took place and he would resign if anyone pro₹ved otherwise, the farmers shared a video in which a man is seen loading a pistol and walking ahead, surrounded by a group of men. That, farmers said, was Ashish leaving the venue. TOI could not verify the claim. In a video from the other side, a few men, purportedly farmers, are seen trying to turn a vehicle over as others beat up a man on his head while he's lying on the ground, unable to move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chilling-clips-from-ground-zero-trigger-war-of-words/articleshow/86796468.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

In a proposal similar to that of the previous Samajwadi Party government’s popular scheme under which it gave laptops and smart phones to meritorious students of classes 10 and 12 and to those above the age of 18 who were not government employees, the state government on Tuesday said the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic forced education and several other processes to move online necessitating the need to digitially empower the youth. The cabinet has approved Rs 3,000 crore for the project. Under the scheme, free tablets and smart phones will be given to youths enrolled in graduate, postgraduate, diploma, skill development, paramedical, nursing and other programmes under the state government. The devices will also be given to skilled workers who are enrolled on the government’s Sewa Mitra portal. “The portal of skill development department is an important initiative by the government through which skilled workers are registered with the government and placed with agencies to work as plumbers, carpenters, nurses, electricians, mechanics etc. It has been proposed that they will also be given tablets and smart phones,” a government official said. Under the scheme, persons from certain other categories not identified immediately could also be given benefits as deemed suitable by the CM. He will also decide at a later stage as to which students will get smart phones and who will get tablets. “Tablets and smart phone distribution scheme has been given approval so that the youth can be technically empowered. The CM has been authorised to take any future decisions with respect to the scheme. During the Covid-19 pandemic, various education institutes held online classes to continue with the sessions. The government felt that digital empowerment of students and youth was absolutely essential at all levels,” a government spokesperson said. He added that for the youth, submitting job applications, attending coaching classes and other kinds of training, required digital means. Technical and education institutes are also distributing study material, taking tutorial lectures etc online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cabinet-nod-to-mobile-tablet-distribution-to-students-skilled-youth/articleshow/86796639.cms||---

---||India||Congress protests against detention; Rahul Gandhi to visit Lakhimpur on Wednesday||NEW DELHI: Congress on Tuesday mobilised its own and opposition leaders from across India to protest against the farmer deaths in Lakhimpur Kheri and the “illegal detention” and subsequent arrest of its leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Sitapur district of UP. Upping the ante against Priyanka’s arrest, Congress said its former party chief Rahul Gandhi will head to Kheri on Wednesday to meet with the family of the deceased farmers. Meanwhile on Tuesday, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel staged a sit-in inside the Lucknow airport after he was denied permission to exit into the city, while Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi met Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi and demanded the repeal of the three contentious farm laws. “I also told him (Shah) that we'll not tolerate barbaric killings in UP (Lakhimpur Kheri). This system of arresting our leaders should stop,” Channi said. While Priyanka issued a statement saying she was only informed of her arrest over phone, was not served a copy of the FIR, not allowed to meet her legal counsel and not even presented before a magistrate, former Union minister P Chidambaram underlined that no woman can be arrested after sunset or before sunrise and Gandhi was arrested at 4.30 am, by a male police officer, “which is illegal”. The facts and circumstances concerning Gandhi's detention in Sitapur “conclusively establish that there is no rule of law in UP”, Chidambaram said. Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and former law minister Ashwini Kumar criticised the Adityanath-led BJP government in UP for disallowing opposition leaders to visit Kheri. Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, on the other hand, threatened to march towards Kheri if Priyanka is not released by Wednesday and MoS Ajay Mishra’s son not held for the murder of farmers. With Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut meeting Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday with a plan to cobble together a joint opposition over the Kheri violence, Congress also appeared to make the massacre the next big plank against BJP. “Lakhimpur Kheri violence has shaken the nation, Priyanka Gandhi has been arrested by the UP government, opposition leaders are being restricted from meeting farmers. There is a need for joint opposition action against oppression by the Government in UP,” Raut said on Twitter. NCP chief Sharad Pawar, meanwhile, drew a parallel between the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and said BJP will have to pay a heavy price for the violence in UP. “Whether it is government at the Centre or in Uttar Pradesh, they are not sensitive at all. The kind of situation that was created in Jallianwala Bagh, we are witnessing a similar situation in Uttar Pradesh. Today or tomorrow, they will have to pay a heavy price for it,” he said demanding a probe by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court. Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin also said revoking the three farm laws in toto is the only way to restore harmony even as he condemned the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh and demanded a judicial enquiry against those responsible for it. “A judicial enquiry should be ordered against those responsible for the violence. The Central government must realise that complete repeal of the three farm laws alone will lead to normalcy and total peace,” Stalin said. Former J&K CM and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti also tweeted in defense of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Alleging that India is a democracy only on paper and its “grim descent into a banana republic has begun”, Mufti demanded that Priyanka be released. “GOI first gets a docile media to berate Congress and lament lack of a viable opposition but systematically ensures they don't discharge their duties by illegal arrests. We are a democracy on paper but clearly the grim descent into a banana republic has begun. Release @priyankagandhi,” she said on Twitter. Priyanka Gandhi was detained on Monday in Sitapur while on her way to Lakhimpur where eight people were killed in violence on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-protests-against-detention-rahul-gandhi-to-visit-lakhimpur-on-wednesday/articleshow/86797053.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||India||Show us data to justify quota in promotion: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Observing that reservation in promotion for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes cannot go on indefinitely but only till they are adequately represented, the Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the Centre to place data before it to justify continuance of the quota. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Sanjiv Khanna and BR Gavai, which is examining the validity of the Centre’s decision to continue with the policy of reservation in promotion, asked attorney general KK Venugopal and additional solicitor general Balbir Singh repeatedly whether any exercise has been undertaken by the Centre after 1997 to find out the proportion of SC and ST employees in central government jobs. “Where is the data which say that there is deficiency in representation to justify reservation in promotion? Show us the data,” the bench told the government. The bench is hearing a plea of the Centre challenging the Delhi high court order quashing its notification granting reservation in promotion for SC/ST employees beyond the five-year period the Supreme Court had stipulated in the Indra Sawhney case. “What exercise has the government done after 1997 to find out adequacy or inadequacy of their representation to continue with reservation in promotion... After a particular period of time, representation of SCs/STs is bound to to be more than 15 and 7.5%. We want to find out whether any exercise was undertaken by the government to get quantifiable data. Where is the data which say that there is deficiency in representation to justify reservation in promotion. Show us the data,” said the bench. “How would you justify reservation in promotion? You are talking only about principles but not about data. There must be some justification for continuing with reservation in promotion,” the bench told the ASG. As the court insisted, the AG said he would get back on Wednesday on whether there was quantifiable data of SC/ST representation. However, Venugopal told the court that in 1965, the percentage of SC and ST staff in central government jobs was 3.34% and 0.62% respectively which has risen to 17.5% and 6.82%. He said the SC-ST representation was more in Group C and Group D categories of jobs and less in A and B categories. The AG also contended that adequate representation means that their share in the government jobs should be proportionate to their share in the population. In 2017, the Delhi high court had quashed the notification on a batch of pleas filed by general category government employees who approached the court through their lawyer Kumar Parimal. The HC accepted his submission that such a move made under Article 16 (4A) was not permissible without adequate data to prove inadequacy of representation and backwardness. The HC quashed the department of personnel and training’s Office Memorandum dated August 13, 1997.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/show-us-data-to-justify-quota-in-promotion-supreme-court/articleshow/86797146.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and BV Nagarathna sent out a loud warning: “You can’t be causing prejudice to students. If there is a sense of obduracy (on the part of authorities in not reverting to the old pattern of examination), the arms of law are long enough to deal with the obduracy. We have given you time till Wednesday to reform. NMC and NBE are not doing any favour to the students. We are giving you an opportunity to correct yourself.” Pointing out NEET-SS is unlike other examinations, Justice Chandrachud said, “Students prepare for years, right from their postgraduation in medicine days to get admission into super speciality courses after doing their masters. We know the private sector has invested money in offering super speciality courses and their interest has to be factored in while doing the balancing act. However, the interest of students, who will be the torch bearers of advanced healthcare in India in future, can’t be sidelined.” The bench said, “Our education system is so botched up. We do not have either a plan or vision. What is the great hurry in bringing into force the new pattern of examination? Heavens would not have fallen except for a few seats in private medical colleges going vacant. Why not postpone the new examination pattern to the next year to give sufficient time to the doctors aspiring to acquire a degree in super speciality enough time to prepare?” Repeatedly expressing doubts whether the change of exam pattern was meant to benefit only private medical colleges which demand a high capitation fee, it said, “The medical education, profession and the regulatory mechanism has become a business.” The bench tore into the decision terming it an attempt only aimed at filling seats in private colleges. There are a total of 414 medical colleges that offer super speciality courses of which 118 were run by the governments while 296 are private institutions. A group of 41 doctors, preparing for NEET-SS examination scheduled for November 10-11, had complained that the authorities had arbitrarily changed the earlier pattern of examination (40% questions from general medicine and 60% from the super speciality course applied for) to a new pattern (100% questions from general medicine) more than a month after notifying the exam dates. The Centre and NBE had filed an affidavit stating that the change of pattern was necessitated as many super speciality course seats have been going vacant because of the earlier pattern of exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/revert-to-old-neet-ss-pattern-in-24-hours-supreme-court-says/articleshow/86797203.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

S&P and Moody’s have a stable outlook on India’s ratings while another agency Fitch has a negative outlook but all three agencies have the lowest investment rating for the country. The upgrade in the outlook by Moody’s will add to the positive sentiment and assure investors about the strength of the economic recovery underway as well the state of public finances. The sharp acceleration in vaccination across the country has also lent comfort and added to hopes for a sustained recovery in the months ahead. “With higher capital cushions and greater liquidity, banks and non-bank financial institutions pose much lesser risk to the sovereign than Moody’s previously anticipated. And while risks stemming from a high debt burden and weak debt affordability remain, Moody’s expects that the economic environment will allow for a gradual reduction of the general government fiscal deficit over the next few years, preventing further deterioration of the sovereign credit profile,” the agency said in a statement. Economic growth has rebounded after the lifting of restrictions and revenues have stabilised, and the fiscal deficit at the end of August was at an 18-year low for the first five-month period. It said that bank provisioning has allowed for the gradual write-off of legacy problem assets over the past few years. In addition, banks have strengthened their capital positions, pointing to a stronger outlook for credit growth to support the economy. An economic recovery is underway with activity picking up and broadening across sectors, the ratings agency said. “Following a deep contraction of 7.3% in fiscal 2020 (ending March 2021), Moody’s expects India’s real GDP to surpass 2019 levels this fiscal year, rebounding to a growth rate of 9.3%, followed by 7.9% in fiscal 2022,” according to Moody’s. It said that downside risks to growth from subsequent coronavirus infection waves are mitigated by rising vaccination rates and more selective use of restrictions on economic activity, as seen during the second wave. “Looking ahead, Moody’s expects real GDP growth to average around 6% over the medium term, reflecting a rebound in activity to levels at potential as conditions normalise,” the ratings agency said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/moodys-changes-indias-outlook-to-stable/articleshow/86797241.cms||---

With his plans in jeopardy on Capitol Hill, Biden visited a union training center in Michigan, declaring that he wanted to "set some things straight" about his agenda and cut through what he dismissed as "noise" in Washington.  "America's still the largest economy in the world, we still have the most productive workers and the most innovative minds in the world, but we're at risk of losing our edge as a nation," he said.  Biden went on to spell out his plans in greater detail than he has in some time, after spending the past week deep in the details of negotiations on Capitol Hill. He highlighted popular individual parts of the plan, including funding for early childhood education and investments to combat climate change, rather than the expensive topline. And he emphasized that the trillions in spending would be drawn out over a decade and paid for by tax increases on corporations and the wealthiest Americans.  Polling suggests that elements in the bill such as expanded child care opportunities and infrastructure projects are popular with large parts of the public. But even some of the White House's closest allies have worried that the West Wing has not done enough to sell the spending. That brought Biden back on the road Tuesday, hitting the red-leaning district of Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin to sell his policies.  "These bills are not about left versus right or moderate vs progressive," Biden said. "These bills are about competitiveness versus complacency."  Back in Washington, negotiations continue on a pair of bills to boost spending on safety net, health and environmental programs and infrastructure projects.  While there is cautious optimism about recent progress, no deal has been struck to bridge stark divides between moderates and progressives in the Democratic Party on the size and scope of the social spending package. In recent weeks, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi worked unsuccessfully to secure passage of the bills, Biden stayed in Washington to cajole lawmakers and work phones.  Now, he's trying to put the public focus on popular components of the bills rather than the inside-the-Beltway debate over their price tag. While progressives and moderates grapple over the contours and the topline number for the $3.5 trillion social spending package, Biden has sought to reframe the debate around the eye-popping number. He contends that because the spending is to be paid for with tax hikes on corporations and the wealthy - those earning beyond $400,000 a year, or $450,000 for couples - the price tag of the bill is actually "zero."  Speaking briefly to reporters after his remarks Tuesday, Biden acknowledged that the overall $3.5 trillion number will decline, but insisted he'll "get it done."  The president was joined by Slotkin during a visit to a union training center in Howell, Michigan, a reflection of the importance of securing moderates' votes.  Biden, she said, understands "that if we're going to make these investments we have to be able to pay for them."  "We talked a lot about the fact that we are not going to take this bill and pass on more debt to our kids, and we are not going to pay for this bill on the back of working families," she said.  Next to Biden, the Democrats with the most on the line over the shape and success of his spending plans are House members from swing districts whose reelections are essential if his party is to retain control of Congress.  Many of those targeted moderates - including Arizona Rep. Tom O'Halleran, Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger and nine other vulnerable Democrats - joined Biden for a virtual meeting on Tuesday. He held a similar session the previous day with a dozen progressives.  Democratic legislators have warned that Biden's bold ideas are getting lost in the party's infighting and procedural skirmishes over the legislation.  "We must communicate to the country the transformative nature of the initiatives in the legislation," Pelosi said in a letter to lawmakers ahead of Biden's trip.  The visit to Slotkin's district, narrowly carried by Republican Donald Trump in 2020, is part of the sales effort.  Biden was met by hundreds of flag-waving, sign-toting protesters as he arrived at the union training center in Howell.  "I think this is very reflective of how residents, not only here in Livingston County, but real Americans, when you leave the Washington, D.C., bubble, feel about the out-of-control spending between our president and Congress," said Meghan Reckling, chair of the county Republican Party.  Reckling said 800 people signed up to attend a "Stop the Spending Rally."  The president is trying to give moderates like Slotkin cover for their support for his spending package.  While Slotkin backs the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill that has passed the Senate, she prefers passing it in the House before negotiating the broader $3.5 trillion package of social programs. She has indicated that she may vote to approve the broader bill sooner if it is fiscally responsible and can make a difference for families, her aides said, but she is not a guaranteed yes - which she planned to tell Biden on Tuesday.  "To be honest, it was hard for me to understand why leadership decided in the first place to tie the two bills together," Slotkin recently told The Detroit News. "That's not how we normally operate. It's not my preference."  Washington was gripped with the drama last week as lawmakers grappled with the massive Democrats-only social spending bill that has been linked with the infrastructure bill. Progressives have balked at paring down the size of $3.5 trillion social package and have refused to vote for the infrastructure bill if the other bill shrinks. Moderate Democrats, meanwhile, are pushing for the bipartisan infrastructure bill to get a House vote first and some are wary about the size of the far larger social spending bill.  That leaves Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress at a crossroads, trying to move past the tangle of legislating and remind voters what they are trying to accomplish.  With considerable attention focused on winning over two key Democratic senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, rank-and-file lawmakers could benefit from the high-profile backup that comes from Biden making the case for his vision to the public.  House members are fanning out to their home districts this week as public views of Biden's agenda are being shaped. Senators remain in Washington but are working on another tangle, the legislation needed to raise the nation's debt limit by midmonth to avert a devastating credit default.  Pelosi, Schumer and White House officials huddled late Monday in a room off the Senate floor to discuss the next steps for passing Biden's agenda.  Those behind-the-scenes talks are intense as Biden lowers the size and scope of the $3.5 trillion social spending package to win over Manchin, Sinema and a small band of conservative Democrats in the House without alienating progressives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/opponents-of-social-spending-plans-complicit-in-americas-decline-biden-in-michigan/articleshow/86797325.cms||---
---||India||Disciplining a student not abetment to suicide: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that a teacher reprimanding students for indiscipline or bunking of classes would not amount to abetment of suicide if an emotional and sentimental student takes the extreme step after being admonished as it is a solemn duty of a teacher to instil discipline in students. A bench of Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari quashed the criminal proceedings against a teacher of a private school who was booked for abetment after a class IX student died by suicide after being reprimanded for bunking classes. FIR was filed against the teacher as he had reprimanded the student who also named him in suicide note. The bench, after examining the note, said a reading of it suggests the hypersensitive temperament of the deceased which led him to take such a step and which would not ordinarily induce a similarly circumstanced student to die by suicide. “It is a solemn duty of a teacher to instil discipline in students. It is not uncommon that teachers reprimand a student for not being attentive or not being upto the mark in studies or for bunking classes or not attending the school. The disciplinary measures adopted by a teacher or other authorities of a school, reprimanding a student for his indiscipline, in our considered opinion, would not tantamount to provoking a student to commit suicide, unless there are repeated specific allegations of harassment and insult deliberately without any justifiable cause or reason,” Justice Murari said. The court said a simple act of reprimand of a student for his behaviour or indiscipline by a teacher, who is under moral obligations to inculcate the good qualities of a human being in a student would definitely not amount to instigation or intentionally aid to the commission of a suicide by a student. It said there must be an allegation of either direct or indirect act of incitement to the commission of offence of suicide and mere allegations of harassment of the deceased by another person would not be sufficient in itself, unless, there are allegations of such actions on the part of the accused which compelled the commission of suicide. “Further, if the person committing suicide is hypersensitive and the allegations attributed to the accused is otherwise not ordinarily expected to induce a similarly situated person to take the extreme step of committing suicide, it would be unsafe to hold the accused guilty of abetment of suicide,” the bench further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/disciplining-a-student-not-abetment-to-suicide-sc/articleshow/86797335.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Business||Facebook's products harm children, stoke division: Ex-employee seeks more govt oversight||WASHINGTON: While accusing the social network giant of pursuing profits over safety, a former Facebook data scientist told Congress Tuesday she believes stricter government oversight could alleviate the dangers the company poses, from harming children to inciting political violence to fueling misinformation. Frances Haugen, testifying to the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, presented a wide-ranging condemnation of Facebook. She accused the company of failing to make changes to Instagram after internal research showed apparent harm to some teens and being dishonest in its public fight against hate and misinformation. Haugen's accusations were buttressed by tens of thousands of pages of internal research documents she secretly copied before leaving her job in the company's civic integrity unit.  But she also offered thoughtful ideas about how Facebook's social media platforms could be made safer. Haugen laid responsibility for the company's profits-over-safety strategy right at the top, with chief executive officer (CEO) Mark Zuckerberg, but she also expressed empathy for Facebook's dilemma.  Haugen, who says she joined the company in 2019 because "Facebook has the potential to bring out the best in us" said she didn't leak internal documents to a newspaper and then come before Congress in order to destroy the company or call for its breakup, as many consumer advocates and lawmakers of both parties have called for.  Instead, Haugen is asking for tighter government regulation and stricter accountability. "Facebook's products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy," Haugen said. "The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people."  "Congressional action is needed," she said. "They won't solve this crisis without your help," said the 37-year-old data expert from Iowa. Prior to being recruited by Facebook, Haugen, who has a degree in computer engineering and a master's degree in business from Harvard, worked for 15 years at tech companies including Google, Pinterest and Yelp.  Democrats and Republicans have shown a rare unity around the revelations of Facebook's handling of potential risks to teens from Instagram, and bipartisan bills have proliferated to address social media and data-privacy problems. But getting legislation through Congress is a heavy slog. The Federal Trade Commission has taken a stricter stance toward Facebook and other tech giants in recent years.  "Whenever you have Republicans and Democrats on the same page, you're probably more likely to see something," said Gautam Hans, a technology law and free-speech expert at Vanderbilt University. "Protecting children is something that many people agree with, and I think it's easier to find consensus there."  Haugen suggested, for example, that the minimum age for Facebook's popular Instagram photo-sharing platform could be increased from the current 13 to 16 or 18.  She also acknowledged the limitations of possible remedies. Facebook, like other social media companies, uses algorithms to rank and recommend content to users' news feeds. When the ranking is based on engagement - likes, shares and comments - as it is now with Facebook, users can be vulnerable to manipulation and misinformation. Haugen would prefer the ranking to be chronological. But, she testified, "People will choose the more addictive option even if it is leading their daughters to eating disorders."  Haugen said a 2018 change to the content flow contributed to more divisiveness and ill will in a network ostensibly created to bring people closer together.  Despite the enmity that the new algorithms were feeding, she said Facebook found that they helped keep people coming back - a pattern that helped the social media giant sell more of the digital ads that generate the vast majority of its revenue.  Haugen said she believed Facebook didn't set out to build a destructive platform. "I have a huge amount of empathy for Facebook," she said. "These are really hard questions, and I think they feel a little trapped and isolated."  But "in the end, the buck stops with Mark," Haugen said, referring to Zuckerberg, who controls more than 50% of Facebook's voting shares. "There is no one currently holding Mark accountable but himself."  Haugen said she believed that Zuckerberg was familiar with some of the internal research showing concerns for potential negative impacts of Instagram.  The subcommittee is examining Facebook's use of information its own researchers compiled about Instagram. Those findings could indicate potential harm for some of its young users, especially girls, although Facebook publicly downplayed possible negative impacts. For some of the teens devoted to Facebook's popular photo-sharing platform, the peer pressure generated by the visually focused Instagram led to mental health and body-image problems, and in some cases, eating disorders and suicidal thoughts, the research leaked by Haugen showed.  One internal study cited 13.5 per cent of teen girls saying Instagram makes thoughts of suicide worse and 17 per cent of teen girls saying it makes eating disorders worse.  She also has filed complaints with federal authorities alleging that Facebook's own research shows that it amplifies hate, misinformation and political unrest, but that the company hides what it knows.  After recent reports in The Wall Street Journal based on documents she leaked to the newspaper raised a public outcry, Haugen revealed her identity in a CBS "60 Minutes" interview aired Sunday night.  As the public relations debacle over the Instagram research grew last week, Facebook put on hold its work on a kids' version of Instagram, which the company says is meant mainly for tweens aged 10 to 12.  Haugen said that Facebook prematurely turned off safeguards designed to thwart misinformation and incitement to violence after Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in last year's presidential election, alleging that doing so contributed to the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the US Capitol.  After the November election, Facebook dissolved the civic integrity unit where Haugen had been working. That was the moment, she said, when she realized that "I don't trust that they're willing to actually invest what needs to be invested to keep Facebook from being dangerous."  Haugen says she told Facebook executives when they recruited her that she wanted to work in an area of the company that fights misinformation, because she had lost a friend to online conspiracy theories.  Facebook maintains that Haugen's allegations are misleading and insists there is no evidence to support the premise that it is the primary cause of social polarization.  "Today, a Senate Commerce subcommittee held a hearing with a former product manager at Facebook who worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, never attended a decision-point meeting with (top) executives - and testified more than six times to not working on the subject matter in question. We don't agree with her characterisation of the many issues she testified about," the company said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/facebooks-products-harm-children-stoke-division-ex-employee-seeks-more-govt-oversight/articleshow/86797336.cms||---

She thought she had more time. “I didn’t think I was going to be evicted because I applied for rental assistance money,” Dobbs said a few days later. “But they didn’t want to wait the four to six weeks. So now we’re homeless - me, my 16-year-old son, my daughter and my grandchild, a toddler.” Her confusion is a common theme across America at a time when the federal government has ended renter protections while doling out billions of dollars in rental assistance. Instead of the expected surge in evictions, many landlords are holding off, waiting for the federal money to come through. But while a few jurisdictions bar landlords from evicting renters who have applied for the money, most do not. Court records show the eviction judgment against Dobbs was for $3,837, which included $2,700 in rent plus late fees and court and legal costs. Encore Management LLC, which filed for the eviction, did not respond to a request for comment about its side of the case. Dobbs, who was laid off from her job as an exotic dancer during the pandemic, said her family is staying temporarily with friends while working with a nonprofit to find a new home and get money for a rent deposit. After a slow start, the pace to distribute the first $25 billion installment of $46.5 billion in rental assistance is picking up. Treasury Department officials said the program had served 420,000 households in August — up from 340,000 in July — and distributed $7.7 billion since January. Treasury officials said the strong signs of progress came from New Jersey, New York and South Carolina, which at first struggled to get their programs going. New Jersey, for example, sent out no money in the first quarter but now has distributed 78 per cent of its first-installment money and doubled the number of households served in August compared with July. Spending in Florida increased from $60.9 million in July to $141.4 million in August while South Carolina went from $10.6 million to $25.3 million. New York saw a jump from $8.5 million to $307 million. “These numbers are still early, uncertain and there is likely additional pain and hardship not showing up in these reports,” said Gene Sperling, who is charged with overseeing implementation of Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package. “But what is out so far is certainly better than anyone’s previous best case scenario for the month after the moratorium.” Sterling credited an increase in eviction diversion programs as a key reason the tidal wave predictions didn’t come through, adding that it was important to keep speeding relief money to landlords. On Wednesday, the Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a new rule barring landlords from evicting tenants in HUD-subsidized public housing without providing them 30 days’ notice and information about available federal emergency rental assistance. Some tenants have benefited from remaining eviction moratoriums including in California which ended last month, New York's which runs through the end of the year and Boston's which is ongoing. Others have taken advantage of newly created programs from Washington to Texas to Philadelphia to New Hampshire that aimed at keeping eviction cases out of the courts and keeping renters in their homes. Some court systems have also put in place policies staying evictions if a tenant has applied for rental assistance while at least three states and 10 cities have approved measures providing tenants with free legal counsel in eviction proceedings. Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the low income coalition, said the nonprofit has encouraged leaders of state and local governments to maintain the few local eviction bans still remaining after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention moratorium ended in late August. Landlord advocacy groups have encouraged members not to evict tenants who have applied for government funds to pay their back rent, but owners don’t always follow that suggestion. Smaller property owners in particular have struggled for months to pay their own mortgages and taxes with many tenants not paying rent. “The vast majority of property owners have worked with their residents for nearly two years to keep people in their homes,” said Courtney Gilstrap LeVinus, president of the Arizona Multihousing Association. She has defended landlords throughout the pandemic, noting that many have been pushed to the brink of bankruptcy. Many property owners were more willing to offer concessions during the pandemic, waiving late fees and sometimes reducing or forgiving rent, according to a synthesis of two recent studies of mostly small landlords carried out by the Terner Center of Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. The findings also highlighted the financial hardships landlords have faced, with some opting to sell their properties, a move that could could lead to a loss of affordable housing stock in some communities. U.S. Marine veteran Paul Wunder, who was also on Constable Kristen Randall's schedule the following week for eviction from his Tucson apartment, said all landlords should wait to receive federal money set aside for rental assistance so they can get the rent money they are owed. “If they just wait one month, they’ll get all their money,” said Wunder, cradling his small dog Missy, a shaggy terrier mix, inside his apartment a few days before he was locked out. The 66-year-old was laid off early in the pandemic, then laid off again after getting another job as an air conditioner technician. “If they throw us into the street," he said, “they’ll get nothing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/eviction-confusion-again-no-us-ban-but-no-spike-either/articleshow/86797368.cms||---

Appearing before a bench of Justices M R Shah and A S Bopanna, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that department of telecommunication is reconsidering its decision to proceed with an appeal filed against a tribunal order on the issue of recovery of one-time spectrum user charges from companies and sought three weeks to take a final call. He said the government may not press for hearing the appeal challenging the TDSAT order of 2019 passed in favour of telecom companies. While adjourning the case, the court, which has not been receptive to such suggestions in the past, said that any decision taken by the Centre will be tested by it on the touchstone of public interest as thousands of crores of public money is involved. "We have to consider the larger public interest," the bench said. The Centre recently announced measures for the stressed sector such as relief on computing dues relating to AGR and adjusted gross revenue. A four-year moratorium on dues, the Centre having leeway to convert dues into equity post moratorium period and easier foreign investment rules are some of the key features of the prospective package. Seeking more relief for the sector, the Centre said, "It is required to be pointed out that the telecom sector is passing through financial stress since some time due to various circumstances . It is respectfully submitted that despite certain measures taken by the government in public interest, most of the TSPs, providing for mobile phones and broadband, have been making losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dot-hints-at-spectrum-charge-relief-for-telecommunication-sector/articleshow/86797363.cms||---

In our country, there is a rule of law and everyone has a right to file a complaint. During the evidence collection, everything will become clear. Investigators can check our call detail record, mobile location etc. It will become crystal clear that my son was not at the spot when the incident happened,” he said. Regarding the purported video of a van running over the protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri, Teni said, “In that video, one can clearly see that the driver who mowed down farmers was beaten to death on the spot. So, (by that logic) my son would have been killed if he had run over the farmers”. He also said, “All the victims will get compensation of Rs 45 lakh and the injured people will receive Rs 10 lakh”. Earlier, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha issued a statement claiming the death of four farmers and alleged that one of the four farmers was shot by Teni’s son, while the others were allegedly run over by the vehicles of his convoy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/son-ready-to-depose-before-probe-agencies-says-ajay-mishra-teni/articleshow/86797399.cms||---

The Covishield maker aims to scale the paediatric trial further by including kids in the two to six years age-bracket in the trial’s immediate next phase. The phase 2 and 3 paediatric trials of Covovax that kicked off in August would have a total of 920 children — 460 in 12 to 17 years, 230 in 7 to 11 years and another 230 in 2 to 6 years age groups. “According to the trial design, we expand the trial after ensuring the vaccine safety in 100 children from each group in the reverse order of age. We aim to include kids in the 2-6 years age bracket within a month, once the vaccine safety is confirmed in 100 kids in the 7 to 11 years age group,” said a trial investigator. The recombinant nanoparticle protein-based vaccine — NVX-CoV2373 — developed by the American biotechnology firm Novavax has been branded Covovax in India. The Serum Institute of India (SII), partnering with Novavax, is expected to launch Covovax for adults in India by November this year and for children early next year. Bharati Hospital and KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch in Pune are among the 10 sites where the children are undergoing advanced trials. They would be followed up for six months after being inoculated with two doses of Covovax, given 21 days apart.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sii-now-aims-to-include-kids-aged-2-to-6-in-vaccination-trials-in-a-month/articleshow/86797497.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The man, who married at a church in Chennai, returned to the village nearly a year after the marriage, and then went missing. When police probed his wife’s man-missing complaint, the man’s family said he had committed suicide and that they had cremated him without informing police. The deceased Gowthaman's wife Amul had raised suspicion about her husband's death since theirs was an inter-caste marriage against Gowthaman's family wish and that the family did not even inform her about his death and cremated his body without her knowledge. On September 17, Gowthaman went to Karani village after he received information about his grandfather’s death in the village. As he did not return home even after two days, she sent her brother Praveen to Karani village. Her brother was shocked to notice obituary posters of Gowthaman all over the village. Following this, Amulu lodged a man-missing complaint at Ponneri police station, alleging that her husband might have been killed by his kin as he had married a Dalit woman. Karani police had registered a case of suspicious death and launched a hunt for Gowthaman's absconding parents and siblings. On Tuesday morning, police secured Gowthaman's father Annamalai, 62, and brother Srinivasan, 33. After investigation, police said Gowthaman allegedly demanded money from his parents to settle some loans and they refused citing his intercaste marriage. Dejected over this, Gowthaman hanged himself at their house. His body was, however, cremated without informing police. The duo was remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kin-booked-for-abetting-mans-suicide-after-his-wifes-complaint/articleshow/86794833.cms||A Selvaraj

Pangi, who has called a meeting on Sunday to give shape to his plan, wants the UT to be named Dandakaranya Parbatamala Autonomous Region comprising parts of Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. Pangi (65), a former minister in Odisha (1990-1995), said a UT can only can bring prosperity to the region caught up in inter-state dispute whose solution is nowhere in sight even after more than five decades. “I will resign from the BJP soon to devote more time to work on the demand for an independent forum,” Pangi said. The tribal leader said he had talked to many leaders, including current and former elected representatives in the area over past six months. “People in general feel a UT would be an excellent idea for the development of the region, gifted with natural mineral resources (mainly bauxite and gemstones) and huge untapped potential for eco-tourism and water resources,” he said. ‘An attempt by some to hog the limelight’  While a core group meeting was held on Monday, more people from the region are expected to attend the open house on Sunday to further streamline the strategy,” he added. Pangi, who is a native of Turia village under Kotia panchayat and was an elected MLA of Pottangi four times, said the region has similar socio-cultural situation and largely speak Odia. “Most parts of the proposed UT comprising Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangour and Rayagada districts in Odisha, Araku, Paderu and parts of Salur district in Andhra Pradesh and Sukma in Chhattisgarh were once part of the erstwhile Jeypore princely state. “Population in the area would be around one crore. The area has majority of Kondha and Paraja tribes besides Christians. While demand for a separate state may lead to too much politics, a UT would ensure less politics and better fund flow from the Centre,” he said, adding, “It would also end left-wing extremism in the area.” Political analysts feel such demands would put unnecessary strain on the country’s federal system. “Demand for a UT is not justified. This may at best be a political move by some people to hog the limelight,” said Jayant Mohapatra, a former political science professor of Berhampur University, who did his schooling in Koraput.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/bjp-leader-demands-ut-with-parts-of-odisha-ap-cgarh/articleshow/86798002.cms||Ashok Pradhan

The money can be returned to the central government without any interest after 50 years. The Centre has always helped in providing ration and health facilities to the poor. The Union government is doing better work for all the states,” added the finance minister. More than Rs 3,000 crore has been transferred in the accounts of 34 lakh farmers of Chhattisgarh under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme and bank accounts were opened for 86 lakh women under Jan Dhan Yojana, Sitharaman said, adding that over 6 lakh people of Chhattisgarh are beneficiaries of PM Mudra Yojana. Congress disputed this. ‘Sitharaman’s claims of investment figures false’PCC spokesman Surendra Verma said, “Union finance minister Sitaharaman has made false claims of investment figures in Chhattisgarh under central schemes, and even counted the one that has not been issued to state. Sitharaman should explain why Kisan Samman amount is not being given to 21% eligible beneficiaries of Chhattisgarh? Why is Chhattisgarh not included in PM Mazdoor Kalyan Rozgar Yojana?”Sitharaman listed out the central initiatives rolled out to tackle the economic crisis triggered by the Covid pandemic. “An Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme was initiated last year under which MSMEs and other businesses were disbursed loans of Rs 3,000 crore. No additional collateral was required to be submitted by businessmen and banks couldn’t refuse to issue loans under this scheme,” Sitharaman said, adding that under Stand Up India scheme banks can issue loans to at least one person each from SC, ST communities and a woman from every branch.Acknowledging inflation and rise in petrol and diesel prices, the Union finance minister said that the Centre and state government have to jointly fight inflation. “Inclusion of petrol in GST was raised at the GST Council meeting in Lucknow, but it could not be done due to lack of consensus. We are trying for this,” she said Taking a dig at Congress, Sitharaman said, “Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel has a post to serve the public but he is more concerned about his position. He is praying to God that his post be saved, for which MLAs of Chhattisgarh are visiting Delhi in a show of strength. People had voted for him to work for them, but the only work being done here is saving the post.” Congress spokesman Surendra Verma hit back by saying: “India’s GDP has crashed. The Modi government at the Centre has failed miserably on all fronts. The condition of banks has deteriorated by issuing loans to capitalist friends of Modi government and bank frauds of associates.“The imposition of cess on petrol and diesel by reducing central excise is a blow to the financial rights of states against the federal structure. Increasing GST on items of common consumption like clothes and pens, ice cream is proof of the anti-people policies of the Modi government,” Verma added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/cg-lags-in-implementing-devpt-projects-despite-central-loan-nirmala/articleshow/86787772.cms||---

The court also asked why Monson was granted police protection, which led to the public mocking the police. Justice Devan Ramachandran asked the state police chief to file a detailed counter affidavit on the possibility of a fair investigation while considering a petition (WP-C No. 16674/21) filed by Monson’s driver Ajith EV of Idukki seeking police protection after being allegedly harassed by circle inspectors of Ernakulam North and Cherthala since he gave statement against Monson before crime branch. In an interim order, the court said on Tuesday, “Evidently, this Court also requires the State Police Chief to inform whether, in his view, the investigation would be effective by police when allegations appear to be made against Police Officers of several ranks. “I am only indicating the prima facie mind of this Court because the intent is only to ensure that a proper investigation is conducted particularly because the petitioner in this case may have some role to play or otherwise depending upon the enquiries to be carried forward,” the order stated while directing the state police chief to file an affidavit on the issue. The government pleader had placed on record a memo filed by Kochi city police commissioner averring that Ajith has been afforded necessary protection. But the court said in the order that the petitioner has not sought protection but to be protected from police. As various allegations have been raised against high-ranking police officials, the state police chief should be a party in the case, the court said while allowing the petitioner’s plea for doing so. Through the interim order, the court also raised the query as to why Monson was afforded police protection and even a beat book was kept in front of his house. The court remarked that such an action would give credibility to his claims before the public and would enable him to scam the public. There are allegations against police officials in the petition as well as otherwise, the court noted while asking whether the police officials named are still continuing in service. In the order, the court said, “The state police chief should certainly, therefore, inform this court how and why no suspicion was raised against the 5th respondent (Monson) until now, even though it is stated that his house was under Police protection, when articles like elephant tusk (which is now stated to be not genuine) were reported to be in his possession.” The court also said when it is claimed that artefacts that were not found elsewhere in the world are in Monson’s possession, international links should be suspected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sr-police-officers-in-kerala-antiques-scam-will-police-probe-be-fair-asks-hc/articleshow/86792417.cms||Mahir Haneef
---||India||Govt eyes green law tweaks to boost strategic projects||NEW DELHI: Seeking to streamline green clearance processes to speed up key projects, environment ministry has released a consultation paper on proposed amendments to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 which, if accepted, may pave the way for sweeping changes in certain sectors, including the strategic ones, and also in the way people use forests on private lands. The ministry, however, at the same time, emphasised on considering introducing an enabling provision in the Act to “keep certain pristine forests showcasing rich ecological values intact” (no-go zone) even as there is a need to address dynamic changes in ecological, socio and economic environment in the country over the last four decades. The paper, released on Monday, seeking stakeholders’ suggestions on it within 15 days, proposes exempting projects related to strategic importance including those of defence and security needs from obtaining prior green approval, and allow setting up zoos and safari parks in forest areas. It also proposes to exempt landholding agencies including railways, NHAI, PWD from seeking permission for linear infrastructure projects - such as railway track, communication line or roads - if the land was acquired before October, 1980. At present, a landholding agency is required to take approval under the Act for use of such land which was originally acquired for non-forest purposes. Though experts flagged their concerns over certain aspects of these proposals, the ministry in its note justified the move saying the changes are needed to effectively fit into the present circumstances, particularly for “accelerated integration of conservation and development” while factoring in the considerable changes in the past 40 years. “Exemption of projects for strategic and defence needs to be reviewed. The process can be streamlined but blanket exemption will have serious ecological consequences,” said Ritwick Dutta of Legal Initiative for Forests and Environment (LIFE) that last week received the prestigious 2021 Right Livelihood Award, an international honour known as Sweden’s alternative Nobel Prize. Referring to use of forests on private land, Dutta said, “Allowing one time exemption for private residence in private forest will lead to fragmentation of forest areas besides deforestation. This will open areas such as the Aravalli’s mountains to private real estate development.” The ministry in its proposal, however, noted that considering any private area as forest would restrict the right of an individual to use his/her own land for any non-forestry activity. "This further leads to the development of a tendency to keep most of the private lands devoid of vegetation even if the land has scope for planting activities," said the paper. Objecting to the provisions of allowing zoos, safari parks in forest areas, Dutta said, “Zoo and safaris are non-site-specific activities and do not need forest land. These are essentially commercial activities and revenue generating activities and can be located in non-forest land.” Though the LIFE in its analysis appreciated the point where the ministry’s paper emphasised on the need to keep certain forest ‘intact’, it said the overall thrust of the proposed amendment was to facilitate the diversion of forest and this is the most problematic part of the proposal. “There is also a case of missing the forest for the trees. The emphasis of the proposed Amendment besides facilitating diversion is to promote growing of trees in private land. There is no doubt that tree plantation outside forest areas needs to be encourages, but these cannot be regarded as forest and should not be adjusted against India’s Nationally Determined Contribution,” said the LIFE in its initial comments on the proposed amendments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-eyes-green-law-tweaks-to-boost-strategic-projects/articleshow/86798136.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Around 14% of 15 to 24-year-olds in India are reporting often feeling depressed or having little interest in doing things, a new report by Unicef shows. “There is wide concern about the impact of the pandemic on mental health. Research indicates some increases in stress and anxiety among children and adolescents. The mental health of caregivers, especially young mothers, is also a concern,” the report said. Only 41% of young people in India said it is good to seek support for mental health problems, compared to an average of 83% across 21 countries surveyed. Globally, it is estimated that over 13% of adolescents aged 10-19 live with a diagnosed mental disorder as defined by the World Health Organisation. This represents 86 million adolescents aged 15-19 years and 80 million adolescents aged 10-14 years with mental disorder. Anxiety and depression make up about 40% of these diagnosed mental disorders. Other disorders include attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, intellectual disability, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, autism, schizophrenia and a group of personality disorders. The report — “The State of the World’s Children 2021; On My Mind: promoting, protecting and caring for children’s mental health”, — released by health minister Mansukh Mandaviya underlined the role of parenting and family support along with need for higher investments and workforce development to minimise risk of mental health disorders. However, the report highlights that not all children were affected equally. “Children and adolescents who faced the greatest mental health risks came from disadvantaged families, had pre-existing mental health conditions or a history of adverse childhood experiences,” it said. There was a difference in response between boys and girls also. While girls were at greater risk of depressive symptoms, anxiety and behaviour issues, boys were at greater risk of substance abuse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/14-of-adolescents-getting-the-pandemic-blues-poll/articleshow/86798160.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Meerut||‘Fake encounter’ of B.Tech student: UP Police announces Rs 25k on absconding DSP (retd)||Meerut: Police in Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr district on Tuesday announced a reward of Rs 25,000 on any information on the whereabouts of a retired deputy SP-rank officer, who is on the run for over two years in connection with the killing of an engineering student in 2002, which he had allegedly tried to pass off as encounter. Pradeep Kumar (19), a B.Tech student from Secunderabad, Bulandshahr was going to Delhi to meet his aunt, when he was shot dead in an alleged staged encounter after a robbery in a roadway bus on August 3, 2002. The police team led by the then inspector of Secunderabad, Randhir Singh, was booked for murder on the direction of a local court,which had rejected a CB-CID report giving clean chit to the cops. In 2019, a non-bailable warrant was issued against Singh, who had by then retired as deputy superintendent of police (DSP), after he didn’t appear before the court despite several summons. Bulandshahr police had been on the lookout for him since then. Kumar’s father who had been pursuing this case all this while, for over 19 years now, approached the Supreme Court recently alleging tardy progress in the case. The apex court on September 30 slammed the UP government for its laxity and imposed a fine of Rs 7 lakh, which it said has to be deposited within a week. The top court said, “The laxity with which the state has proceeded in the present case speaks volumes of how state machinery is defending or protecting its own police officers … Normally, we are slow in entertaining petitions directly filed in this court but in the extraordinary circumstances of this case, we have entertained this petition to ensure that justice be given to the petitioner, which has been denied for about two decades.” Just five days later, on Tuesday, the local police announced a reward on the main accused. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Bulandshahr, Santosh Singh, said, “We have announced a reward on retired deputy SP Randhir Singh, for whom several arrest warrants have already been issued by court starting 2017. He is hiding.” “The CB-CID had submitted its closure report in the court after a probe. But, after the father of the deceased protested, the court had rejected the closure report and directed police to book all the accused for a trial. The court later issued summons and then warrants against all. Four policemen involved in the matter got bail from the court, but another four didn’t appear. We had arrested three of them. But Randhir Singh was never caught,” added the SSP. Now 61 and frail, Pradeep’s father, Yashpal Singh, pursued the case in lower court, then in high court and now in the apex court. All he wanted was to prove the innocence of his son and bring his “killers” to justice. “I have no idea what made them think that he is a robber. Why did they kill him? All I want is justice for my son,” said Singh. The apex court will announce its verdict in the case on October 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/fake-encounter-of-b-tech-student-up-police-announces-rs-25k-on-absconding-dsp-retd/articleshow/86790688.cms||Ishita Mishra

The company’s board accepted the resignation in their meeting held on October 5, 2021. Last month NFRA found gaps in the appointment and continuation of the audit firm as statutory auditor of ITNL. SRBC uses the EY brand and trademark for audit services. The NFRA had noted improprieties in the valuation of ITNLs exposure to group companies. The authority found that ITNLs losses for FY18 were underreported by over Rs 2,000 crore. “With respect to the report issued by the NFRA on our audit of the financial statement of ITNL for the year ended March 2018, we are examining remedies/options available to us and given the circumstances, it may be appropriate for us to avoid continuing as auditors of the company. As a result of such evaluation we offered our resignation as the auditor of the company to allow the board to continue the ongoing auditing work without any impediments,” the firm said in a statement to the exchanges. ITNL is expected to announce a new auditor within a month. Earlier, the NFRA had found lapses in the statutory of IL&FS Financial Services done by BSR Associates. The authority’s Audit Quality Review Report found significant lapses in compliance with standards of auditing. The NFRA had pointed out deficiencies n the IT processes and platform used by BSR which were systemic and structural in nature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/srbc-quits-as-auditor-of-ilfs-co-over-charges/articleshow/86793624.cms||---
---||Business||ICICI Bank 2nd in card spends, ahead of SBI||Mumbai: ICICI Bank has overtaken SBI in credit card spends in August taking the number two spot after HDFC Bank. According to RBI data, ICICI Bank had a market share of 19.6% in August 2020 up from 15.8% in August 2020. SBI Card’s market share in spends, slipped to 18.7% in August 2021 from 20% in the previous year. In absolute terms, total spending through credit cards in August 2021 was Rs 77,733 crore, up 54% from Rs 50,319 crore in August 2020. The overall number of cards in force has increased from 5.8 crore to 6.4 crore in the same period. “Looking at total spends, since November 2020, ICICI has gained around 510 basis points market share, while HDFC Bank and SBI cards have lost around 285bps and 90bps market share, respectively. ICICI Bank’s total spends for July 2021 was equal to that of SBI cards despite ICICI Bank’s market share (based on outstanding cards) being lower than that of SBI Cards. We believe, ICICI’s co-branded card with Amazon (1.6 millon as of March 2021), which forms more than 50% of incremental card additions, has helped it to scale up its credit card business in a significant way,” said Suresh Ganapathy, an analyst with Macquarie research. To boost credit card spending, HDFC Bank on Tuesday launched its Festive Treats 3.0 campaign, which will provide offers on cards, loans and EMIs. The bank has partnered with over 10,000 merchants across 100 locations as it expects customers to return to offline shopping following a dip in Covid cases and increased pace of vaccinations. “This year we have come out with more offline offers including hyperlocal merchants. We will use our ATM platform to inform customers about the offers around their location,” said Parag Rao, group head (payments, consumer finance, digital banking and IT). HDFC Bank continues to be the market leader with 26.5% of total credit card spending in India. However, the bank’s share has fallen from August 2021, when it accounted for 28.7% of the total spend. Sequentially, HDFC Bank had seen a dip in credit cards in force as the RBI ban was still in force for most of the month. Since the ban was lifted the bank had added four lakh credit cards to its base of 1.47 crore cards as of August 2021. The biggest loser in terms of share of spending is Citibank, which led the ranking in terms of card spend for many years. The multinational, which had a 7.8% share of spends in 2020 now accounts for 4.9% of spending. IDFC First Bank, a relatively late entrant, has managed to make a dent by increasing its share of card spend to over 1%. American Express is the only multinational bank to grow its share of spending from a year-ago period. However, the US issuer also faces an embargo on issuing new cards until it complies with data localization norms, which is likely to hit growth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/icici-bank-2nd-in-card-spends-ahead-of-sbi/articleshow/86793488.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||Conserve dolphins for a healthy river ecosystem: Experts||PATNA: Environmentalists and life scientists on Tuesday called for conservation of dolphins for maintaining a healthy river ecosystem. Participating in an international symposium on ‘Conservation of fresh water dolphins of Asia’, they said all the stakeholders – from fishermen to policymakers – should strive hard to protect endangered species which are so vital for the sustenance of aquatic life and also for the survival of human beings. The symposium was organised jointly by the state environment, forest and climate change department and the city-based National Dolphin Research Centre on the occasion of ‘Gangetic Dolphin Day’. Patna University vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary presided. Celebrated as part of Wildlife Week in Bihar, the day focuses on creating public awareness to save the endangered species that has been declared India’s national aquatic animal. The Gangetic dolphins are included under the First Schedule of Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. They have been declared “endangered” under IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). The Vikramshila Ganges Dolphin Sanctuary was established in Bihar under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Inaugurating the symposium, environment, forest and climate change minister Neeraj Kumar Singh pleaded for intensifying research for conservation of the dolphin. He opined that environmentalists should also think of linking this endangered species with some religious tradition so that common people vouch for its protection. “People should be motivated to treat the dolphin with the same religious fervour as they treat peepal and tulsi plants,” he said. The minister also released a souvenir on the occasion. A feature film – ‘Dolphin and its habitat in Kosi-Mahananda basin’ – was also screened. ‘Dolphin man’ Ravindra Kumar Sinha, who is currently the vice-chancellor of Mata Vaishno Devi University, Jammu, state environment, forest and climate change department secretary Deepak Kumar Singh, Bihar State Pollution Control Board chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh, director general of Clean Ganga Mission Raiv Ranjan Mishra and director of Zoological Survey of India, Dhuti Banerjee, shared their experiences and stressed the importance of dolphins in maintaining the quality of river water. Scientists from different institutions across the country and abroad presented their papers in the technical sessions of the symposium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/conserve-dolphins-for-a-healthy-river-ecosystem-experts/articleshow/86791338.cms||B K Mishra

Do you believe Covid-19 cases will see a new spike once we reopen schools and religious places? I think there will not be any remarkable spurt in new cases. The experience of the last two months is enough to show that the virus is not multiplying the way it used to in April-May. Schools are already open in rural areas and no surge has been reported in cases. Several unofficial gatherings and religious events are underway and yet, no surge has been reported. As there is no more multiplication of virus, we are not going to see any major spike in cases on reopening schools and religious places. There will hardly be anything like a super-spreader event now. Which types of cases will we see in the next phase? The cases will mostly be asymptomatic. They will get identified because of the provisions of random testing at religious places and periodic testing in schools. Secondly, the virus will infect unvaccinated people in the coming days. The authorities must have a mechanism to know how many of the newly-detected cases are from the unvaccinated population. This will give us the exact idea of how vaccination is working. Which should be the worrying metric in case we witness a spike? Number of cases should not be the panic criteria any more. Hospitalization, oxygen requirement, ventilators should be the criteria. Covid wards are vacant. Enough oxygen and beds are available. Some cases will continue to surface all the time. Zero Covid is practically not possible. So, lockdown or restrictions should not be our strategy now. What should be our strategy to stay protected? Power of protecting individuals should be given to individuals. This power is masks, good ventilation, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Restrictions are of no use now. Schools should shift their focus from surface cleaning to better ventilation. Physical distancing should be followed in schools wherever possible. The important point here is that kids aged less than 7 are hardly infectious. So, there is no harm in reopening primary schools also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/masks-antibodies-vax-to-work-now-not-lockdowns/articleshow/86795490.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The by-election was necessitated following the death of Dasari Sudha’s husband, Dr G Venkata Subbaiah, after a protracted illness in March this year. The YSRC candidate stated in her affidavit that she has 350 grams of gold, agricultural land at Gopavaram and Chintakommadinne mandals and non-agricultural lands in Kadapa town. A comparison with the affidavit filed for the 2019 general elections with this affidavit shows that Dasari Sudha’s liquid assets have grown from Rs 44.67 lakh to Rs 1.11 crore in the last two years. The value of her fixed assets have also increased from Rs 35 lakh to Rs 48 lakh. Meanwhile, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has told senior party functionaries to ensure a resounding win in the Badvel bypoll by securing a majority of not less than 45,000 votes. The ruling party seems to have the upper hand with the TDP and the Jana Sena declaring they will not contest the bypoll out of respect to the convention of not contesting an election necessitated by the death of a sitting MLA, especially when the kin of the deceased is fielded as the candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ysrc-candidate-dasari-sudha-files-nomination/articleshow/86789995.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The proposal was first tabled in July this year, and figured in subsequent meetings of the committee. Each time, a decision on this issue was postponed. Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee, confirmed, “The proposal was tabled ... but, no final call has been taken. Some committee members wanted more information about this proposal.” The administration has been given a week to share more information with the panel. PMC had planned to take 38 e-cars on rent for eight years, to be used by civic officials and various committees for their day-to-day work. Though the aim of promoting e-vehicles is being supported, the civic body’s idea of getting them on rent has raised eyebrows. Over Rs 23 crore is to be spent over the next eight years on renting these cars. The opposition and the workers' union of PMC have opposed the move, stating it will result in job losses for PMC’s existing drivers. In other decisions, the committee approved setting up a plant for disposal of sanitary napkins. Development works at police quarters have also been approved. Further, funds have been approved for a ‘Bal Shivba and Rajmata Jijau’ statue at Shivneri fort in Junnar. Approval was also given to offer transfer of development rights (TDR) as compensation for people affected by the Pune-Mumbai road expansion project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-panel-postpones-e-car-rental-proposal/articleshow/86792975.cms||---
---||Patna||HC asks rlys to share project cost for connecting Patliputra Junction||PATNA The Patna high court on Tuesday was left fuming after the railways submitted that its manual doesn’t permit to share half the project cost to connect the Patliputra Junction with the Digha-AIIMS elevated road via a flyover across the railway tracks. The project cost is estimated to be around Rs96 crore. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, while hearing the PIL filed by Bharat Prasad Singh over poor road connectivity to the Patliputra Junction for common people, didn’t accept the railways’ counter affidavit submitted on the matter during the Tuesday’s hearing. Counsel Siddhartha Prasad, appearing for the railways, sought the bench permission to withdraw the counter affidavit. The bench fixed the matter for next hearing on October 27 and asked the railways to come up with a fresh affidavit considering to share the cost of the project with the state government. The bench observed that its authorities had earlier assured of sharing the project cost. Counsel Prasad submitted that railways, as per its manual, can share the cost of a construction project of an overbridge if it is being built over a railway crossing, but not in other conditions. However, the bench was not pacified and observed that railways should bear the complete cost of the connectivity project as the railway station belongs to it. The court orally observed that it would, otherwise, order for shutting down the railway station with poor connectivity. Counsel Saytam Shivam Sundaram, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that the track below the tracks on the eastern side of the canal was earlier actually a road used for common people and thus the railways should bear the project cost. It was while hearing this PIL five years ago that the high court ordered for increasing connectivity after which the state government had connected the station with Bailey Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-asks-rlys-to-share-project-cost-for-connecting-patliputra-junction/articleshow/86793796.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Business||Meat e-tailer Licious 29th unicorn in 2021||CHENNAI/ NEW DELHI: Fresh animal protein direct-to-consumer (D2C) startup Licious is India’s 29th unicorn this year after raising a series-G funding of $52 million from new investors — IIFL AMC’s tech fund and Avendus FLF (Future Leaders Fund). The company said its valuation has crossed $1 billion after this round. With over 95% of Licious’ sales happening via their own app and site and given that startups like FirstCry and Nykaa operate more as marketplaces, Licious is the first unicorn in the growing D2C segment. Earlier in July, Licious raised $192 million in a series-F funding round led by Temasek & Multiples, making it the highest funded company in the fresh animal protein business category then. “Even though the funding for the D2C sector has grown significantly, FMCG is still not considered the most attractive category. We expect that Licious’ unicorn status will change that,” Licious co-founders Vivek Gupta and Abhay Hanjura said. The founders added that they will use the funds to double down on tier-2 and -3 markets, which are growing fast in recent years and also strengthen product and tech teams. Spread across 14 cities, the company said its annual revenue run rate is around Rs 1,000 crore, and it recorded over 500% growth during the last year. Licious has delivered to more than 2 million unique customers till date with over 90% repeat customers. Meat delivery sector in India is gaining global investor attention. From being fairly unorganised and largely dependent on local vendors, D2C startups that control the supply chain from procurement to delivery are being looked at with keen interest. Fresh To Home, a meat delivery platform had raised $121 million last year, while Zappfresh is also looking to close a $10-million fund raise soon. What makes this fund-raise and valuation significant for many food players in the country is that while the D2C sector saw a rapid growth and investments since last year, food-related categories were not considered the most attractive. Licious entry into the unicorn club will boost chances of other D2C startups to be able to raise funds and most importantly at right valuations. The company’s statement forecasts the D2C market size in India to be $25 billion by 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/meat-e-tailer-licious-29th-unicorn-in-2021/articleshow/86794131.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Vijayawada||Pay NREGS dues in four weeks with 12% interest, Andhra Pradesh HC tells govt||VIJAYAWADA: The AP high court on Tuesday directed the state government to clear all bills for works done under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) within four weeks with 12% annualised interest. The court, while disposing over 1,000 petitions, also observed that the state government resorted to “unjust enrichment” by withholding the payments of the petitioners to which they are legitimately entitled. After a marathon hearing on the petitions moved in the high court for the last few months, Justice Battu Devanand gave the verdict in favour of the petitioners. From the records submitted by the state government, the central government and the petitioners, he said state government officials tried to mislead the court by submitting false information. The judge further observed that the government withheld the payments by citing pending vigilance inquiry which concluded way back in October 2020. The affidavit filed by the Union government and the statement given by the chief secretary before the court, saying that no inquiry is pending against the petitioners, it is evident that the state government illegally withheld the payments which amounts to unjust enrichment as it has enjoyed the funds that are supposed to be given to the petitioners, the court said. Justice Devanand also found fault with the government for deducting 21% of the payments by taking a random inquiry conducted by the vigilance department over alleged misappropriations. The court observed that based on findings of the random inquiry, the government cannot decline to pay full amount to the petitioners. Citing several judgements of the Supreme Court, Justice Devanand said unjust enrichment is liable for payment of compensation. He directed the state government to pay 12% interest to the petitioners from one month after submission of bills to the government till the day payment is made. He further directed the state government to pay the entire amount in cases where no payment was received by the petitioners, and part payments in which some amount was received, within four weeks. If any panchayat withheld payments even after it was released by the government, the matter will be looked into seriously if the petitioners bring it to the notice of the court, Justice Devanand warned. The court observed that the state government resorted to “unjust enrichment” by withholding the payments of the petitioners to which they are legitimately entitled...

He assessed the damages caused by the heavy and excessive rain in the last few days in these districts. Soon after returning to the state capital after conducting the aerial survey, Nitish held a meeting with senior officials of the disaster management department (DMD), water resources department (WRD) and the DMs of 11 rain-affected districts to review the situation. The meeting was held at ‘Sankalp’ hall of the CM residence. The CM asked the DMs to ensure immediate relief and other assistance to the people living in the affected areas in the 11 districts – Nawada, Nalanda, Patna, Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, East Champaran, West Champaran, Gopalganj and Saran. “We have to provide necessary assistance to all affected people. You must ensure that no person is left out,” he told the DMs. Nitish further asked all 11 DMs to make a proper assessment of the crops damaged by the recent excessive rain and submit a report to the government within three days. “Also make an assessment of crop loss where sidling could not be planted due to waterlogging caused by the excessive rain,” he asked the DMs. Nitish further advised the DMs to ensure a continuous communication with the people affected by the excessive rain, and also pay attention to the suggestions given by them. “We have to help all affected families with all sensitivity,” Nitish told the DMs. He also asked the officials to ensure immediate repair of the roads and culverts which were damaged by the floodwaters. He asked the DMD officials to ensure immediate distribution of gratuitous relief (GR) funds among the remaining flood-affected families. Earlier, DMD secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal informed the CM about the relief works being done in the rain-hit areas. WRD secretary Sanjeev Hans gave a detailed information on the current status of water level in different rivers and flood protection works being executed in different parts of the state. Earlier in the day, the CM conducted an aerial survey of rain-affected areas in seven districts – Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, East Champaran, Gopalganj and Saran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/provide-relief-to-people-in-11-rain-hit-districts-nitish/articleshow/86791727.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Pujas let go of pomp to support Covid orphans||KOLKATA: This festive season, multiple Puja organizers are cutting short their lavish budgets to support children who have lost their one or both parents. As per government data in Bengal, there are 308 recorded orphans whose both parents had died of Covid-19 till August 26, two of whom were abandoned and are now growing up in a government-sponsored home. There are 6,270 more children whose father or mother has died of the infection during this period. “My sister had oral cancer and she was struck by Covid-19 during the first wave and died in September 2020 when my nephew was just 2-year-old. In July this year, my brother-in-law also died, leaving the kid orphaned. I have two young kids and have no clue how to sustain this three-year-old’s education and vaccination needs. But a Puja organizer in Ballygunge has promised to fund his education and medical needs till he becomes an adult,” said Prasenjit Das, the child’s uncle and a resident of Lansdowne. Another eight-year-old boy in Behala, who lost his father, an auto rickshaw driver, to Covid-19 in May this year, is also seeking funds to support his education as his mother, a former homemaker, has taken up the helms of the family now and is supporting the family by doing odd jobs in the neighbourhood. “This year, we have decided to avoid any grandeur or pomp during our Durga Puja celebration and will use the fund for something more worthy — which is to support little kids who have lost their parents to Covid. We will start with 10 children and will extend the programme to others based on the number of applications we receive,” said Arijit Maitra, secretary of Ballygunge Samajsebi Durgapuja committee. The Ballygunge club officials said they will pay for education, nutrition and all medical needs of the orphans till they become adults. Young Mens’ Association in Sahapur off New Alipore, who have picked life during and after Covid as their theme, has also taken up a similar initiative. “This is not a puja to show off the amount of money we can spend but it is the kind of puja where we have the duty to give back to society when it needs us most,” said Sourav Roy, the club secretary. Sociologist Prasanta Roy said the move was extremely praiseworthy as it can influence other Puja committees as well to let go of unnecessary spending and spend the money in something worthwhile. “However, the Puja committees need to it is not just a one-time publicity gimmick,” said Roy. Psychologist Devika De Ghosh added: “This initiative is not only going to make these kids direct beneficiaries but it will also take off the burden off the immediate caretakers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pujas-let-go-of-pomp-to-support-covid-orphans/articleshow/86790683.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The HC bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya also directed the NMC to submit an action taken report on the representations submitted by the students. The high court had earlier dismissed the petitions moved by the students seeking directions to the NMC and Dr NTR University of Health Sciences to give relaxation to those who could not clear the first year subjects, to sit for the second year classes. As per the NMC’s amended norms, a medical student with backlogs in the first year is not eligible to be promoted to second year. The single judge bench, while dismissing the petitions, observed that the plea is not in consonance with the rules and the purpose of the amended rules will get defeated if their petitions are allowed. Challenging the single judge order, the students moved appeal petitions. They contended the single judge did not consider difficulties the students faced during the pandemic. As their future is involved, the issue needs to be considered sympathetically, they said. However, the division bench of the court said it is not inclined to stay the single judge order at this stage without hearing out all parties. At the request of the counsel for the petitioners, the high court agreed to allow the students to submit a fresh representation to the NMC and asked NMC to file an action taken report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-allows-first-year-mbbs-students-to-appeal-before-nmc/articleshow/86789745.cms||---

Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh and SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma, who held a meeting on Tuesday, asked the Puja organisers and people to follow Covid protocols and maintain social harmony during the 10-day festivities beginning from October 7. The DM said no fair would be organised at any place and DJ would also not be allowed around the Puja venues. Since the immersion of idols in the Ganga was banned following the guidelines of the National Green Tribunal, all SDOs and SDPOs were asked to develop artificial ponds with adequate light, medical and ambulance facilities. They have also been asked to depute magistrates and police personnel at the artificial ponds. “There will be no cultural functions and use of fireworks during the Puja. Use of loudspeakers is permitted within the permissible sound limit. However, play of vulnerable songs and display of objectionable slogans will not be allowed at the Puja pandals,” the DM said. The Ravan Vadh programme will be organised in a simple way at Kalidas Rangalaya with the facility of live webcast. There will also be a ban on plying of boats in all rivers in Patna district during the Puja. The DM said all volunteers of Puja pandals would be issued identify cards. The administration has asked police to intensity night patrolling, especially in the rural areas. “Stern action will be taken against the anti-social elements and those trying to create troubles during the Puja,” the DM added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-district-admn-bans-immersion-of-durga-idols-in-ganga/articleshow/86790623.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Dandia-making hub Godhra upbeat over Sheri garbas||VADODARA: With barely a day to go before Navratri begins, the dandia capital of the nation too is trying to adjust its steps to the rhythm it had lost during the pandemic. Welcome to Godhra that very few would know is the hub of manufacturing dandia sticks without which nine nights of garba revelry would be lacklustre. Since decades, artisans and factory owners from the minority community have been involved in making dandias that widely used across the country. The industry that was hard hit from the global pandemic is slowly coming back to life with Navratri set to kick off later this week. Artisans in Godhra are ensuring that their products reach the locations across the country in time. It is said that 90 per cent of the dandia supply in the country takes place from Godhra. Dandias are also made in Saharanpur, Jalgaon and Bhuj, but in small numbers. One of the bigger players in dandia manufacturing, Shoaib Boda said that the situation is better than last year. “Many started manufacturing dandias early in the town. These are people who had stocks with them since last year. We have been able to clear some amount of such stock as small dandia events are being allowed at many places,” said Boda. However, manufacturers also made losses as some of their stock were damaged by pests. “We have destroyed the damaged stock and worked on the usable lot to cater to the orders that have been trickling in. We manufacture dandias for around five months. The remaining time of the year is spent in making other wooden articles like rolling pins,” said another unit owner Ashraf Hathila. Some of the Covid-hit units rue that there is no scheme or relief for them. “Smaller units need help from the government. People have struggled a lot. It would be good if some relief in power tariff or some other form is given to us,” said Abdulrazzak Hajiya, a small manufacturer in the town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/dandia-making-hub-godhra-upbeat-over-sheri-garbas/articleshow/86791423.cms||Sachin Sharma

---||Patna||Land to be acquired soon for expansion of Darbhaga airport: Govt||PATNA: The land acquisition for the civil enclave and other development and expansion works at Darbhanga airport is likely to begin after the next state cabinet meeting. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has sought 78 acres of land in Darbhanga, including 54 acres for the new civil enclave which will have terminal building, cargo, multi-level car parking, fire station and other auxiliary buildings, and 24 acres for installation of category I (CAT I) approach light. Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary of state cabinet secretariat department, said the AAI had initially sought 31 acres of land and the state government had sanctioned it besides sending Rs 121 crore to the district administration for the land acquisition. “The land could not be acquired as the AAI officials inspected Darbhanga airport in January this year and made another proposal for 78 acres of land. The new proposal will hopefully be tabled in the next cabinet meeting,” Kumar said. Union civil aviation minister had earlier written to CM Nitish Kumar in August this year, urging him to instruct the officials concerned to expedite work on land acquisition for Darbhanga and other airports in Bihar, including Patna, Muzaffarpur and Raxual. Around 49.5 acres of land Patna airport is required for runway extension at Patna airport, parallel taxi track, doppler very high frequency omni Range (DVOR) equipment, isolation bay and glide path. The additional chief secretary said the state government has already given permission for construction of isolation bay on 12 acres of land and installation of DVOR on 4.5 acres of land. “For parallel taxi track, the AAI has sought 22 acres of land. Around 19 acres of land is of ICAR and 3 acres of transport department. The process to acquire land is on for the taxi track. As far as extension of runway is concerned, there is no scope for it right now,” Kumar said. He added, “An old land of AAI is there in Raxaul, but it has to decide whether the airport is commercially viable there. We already have an airport in Darbhnaga. Another airport in Muzaffarpur will not be technically and commercially feasible. It takes precisely one hour to reach Muzaffarpur from Darbhanga via NH-57.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/land-to-be-acquired-soon-for-expansion-of-darbhaga-airport-govt/articleshow/86791266.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Business||Shareholder activism puts focus on governance in cos||MUMBAI: With governance in sharp focus at India Inc, corporate boards and top management may find it tougher to push their agenda if not aligned with wider interests of all shareholders. Empowered investors are increasingly voicing concerns on a spate of controversial issues, ranging from compensation, appointments and related party transactions, ending the era when AGMs were considered just a regulatory tick-box item, and most resolutions sailed through. Recently, Zee Entertainment has been making headlines due to its intense boardroom tussle with its institutional investors seeking the ouster of the company’s CEO & MD Punit Goenka. In August, Eicher MD Siddhartha Lal’s reappointment was shot down over a hike in compensation at the AGM. It was cleared by the company’s board after a pay revision capped it at 1.5%, as against the higher limit at 3% of its profits, for which shareholder approval will be taken. While in July, there was shareholder pushback on the remuneration of Hero MotoCorp MD Pawan Munjal, with an ESOP (employee stock option plan) resolution getting defeated. The former proposal was, however, approved. Similarly, companies across sectors, including Vedanta and Lupin, faced shareholders’ ire over the appointment of directors, and grant of ESOPs, respectively. Also, in August, an ESOP resolution at V-Mart Retail was defeated, and so was the alteration to the articles of Burger King, pertaining to promoter’s nomination rights to appoint directors on the board. Balaji Telefilms resolutions for the approval of remuneration of MD Shobha Kapoor and joint MD Ekta Kapoor also failed to pass muster at the AGM in September. Typically, resolutions do not get the green light in 20-25 companies of the BSE 500 every year. The figure is up this year with several prominent names, industry watchers said. KPMG India partner Sai Venkateshwaran said, “The uptrend is due to a combination of factors, whether it be more active institutional investors, empowered with better information to ask the tough questions, or the current economic environment and related uncertainties. Institutional investors, including mutual funds, pension funds and insurers, have also become more vocal in voicing concerns, and the regulatory mandate on the implementation of the Stewardship Code by Sebi, PFRDA and IRDA seems to be having a positive impact.” Under the code, they are required to have a clear policy on voting and disclose the voting activity, in addition to their role in engaging with, and monitoring their investee companies. The code also requires them to be willing to act collectively or collaborate with other investors where appropriate, which would also result in collective actions by groups of investors, whenever required. Institutional investors also have access to researched voting recommendations put out by proxy advisory firms, which enable them to take more informed calls, experts said. “The resolutions we have seen getting shot down by investors over the last two years are across categories — compensation, appointment, related party transactions, change in company’s articles. It is an indication that investors are looking at companies in a holistic manner and not focussing on just one aspect of the business. This year what has changed is that many high profile companies have come under the investors lens,’’ said Amit Tandon, founder and MD at IiAS, a proxy advisory firm. Further, from shareholders’ standpoint, there is an expectation that compensation to KMP (key managerial personnel) and promoters, should be in sync with the performance of the company. While there has been a growing demand to link variable pay with the company’s performance, these calls get accentuated in an economic environment that’s showing either degrowth or slow growth in companies. “Increasingly, it is evident that promoters may no longer find it easy to get resolutions passed through at AGMs, etc, especially when the minority shareholder votes are more relevant. Even in instances when the resolution is approved, but a vast majority of the institutions have voted against it, it sends a signal to markets on investor sentiment, and is a soft indicator to boards to sit back and rethink some of those decisions,” Venkateshwaran added. With ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues taking centre stage at global companies, governance would be a key framework to focus on for India Inc to manage both performance as well as goodwill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/shareholder-activism-puts-focus-on-governance-in-cos/articleshow/86793696.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||Patna||Submit report on infra in 27 law colleges, HC tells BCI||PATNA: The Patna high court on Tuesday asked the Bar Council of India (BCI) to submit the report of its inspection of 27 law colleges across the state by three weeks. The inspection was conducted to evaluate the available infrastructure at the law colleges which are necessary to run legal education courses before they are granted affiliation for taking fresh admissions. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar was hearing a batch of writ petitions filed Kunal Kaushal, Syed Arif Quli and Prashant Kumar Rai when it granted three-week time to the BCI to submit its inspection report. The affiliation for session 2021-2022 was not granted to these colleges by the council’s governing body earlier this year for severe lack of infrastructure. The inspection was carried out in September by the experts of BCI. Only two institutions – Chanakya National Law University and Central University of South Bihar – were found fulfilling the basic infrastructure requirement to run law courses in the state. These two institutions have affiliation and permission to enrol students. After coming to know about the severe infrastructure and teacher shortages in 27 law colleges, the high court had barred them from taking fresh admissions. Vishwajeet Kumar Mishra, who appeared for the BCI, had earlier apprised the bench that the BCI regulatory body had recommended conditional affiliation to 10 colleges, denied the same for 11 others and for rest, matter of granting affiliation is under consideration. Counsel Dinu Kumar, who appeared for Kaushal, apprised the court that BCI Education Rules, 2008, has specific details about infrastructure which should be there in law colleges along with qualification of principals and teaching staff. Senior lawyers are appearing for various colleges and universities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/submit-report-on-infra-in-27-law-colleges-hc-tells-bci/articleshow/86793726.cms||Debashish Karmakar

All pandals will be open on three sides and barricades are being put up so that residents stop there to see the pandal and the idols from a distance. Complexes say that though they had not been given the “baroari” tag, they were in spirit community pujas since they happen with the contributions from the residents and subscriptions collected from advertisements. At most complexes, there will be no community dining for the second time in a row. Prasad would be packed and sent home, like last year. There will also be no cultural events on stage and virtual performances will be live streamed on social media pages. No performers from outside are being invited. In almost every complex, only priests and a team of committee members will be allowed to enter pandals. All of them would mandatorily be vaccinated and would have to test negative just before the Puja starts. In some complexes, pushpanjali would be virtually organised like last time where residents follow the priest on social media and do the anjali at home. In many complexes again, sindur khela has been suspended. Sanitising of pandals twice daily has been arranged in most pandals. “No physical cultural events are being organized and events will be shown on our FB page,” said Siddha Pines president Manav Mehra. At Greenfield City, a takeaway parcel system has been brought in against coupons, said president Saurav Chandra. Take away arrangements have been done at Upohar housing complex too, said Sudeep Ganguly, a resident. Ruchira Residency has restricted prasad only to dry items. “We have cancelled sindur khela and will have only seven people for immersion,” said spokesperson Kaushik Mitra. Residents of New Town AK Block will do away with community lunch. “There will be sweets and fruits only,” said Raja Banik, executive member of the committee.“The pandemic is still here and being irresponsible might prove costly,” said Samir Gupta, secretary of New Town Citizens’ Welfare Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/gated-community-pujas-to-follow-last-yrs-cov-template/articleshow/86790657.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Krishna district collector J Nivas and other officials on Tuesday expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements and pace of work by the engineering wing of the Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devasthanams (Kanaka Durga temple). Inspecting tonsuring counters set up by the Krishna river ghats, the collector directed officials to arrange benches for devotees at the counters. He inspected the showers arranged at Krishnaveni Ghat and Seethammavari Padalu and directed Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials to break the traffic wall to permit devotees. The collector also directed the temple authorities and police to take strict measures to prohibit bathing in the Krishna river. Officials have prohibited taking a holy dip in the river as a preventive measure against Covid-19. Nivas also expressed dissatisfaction over the barricades arranged to regulate queues. He directed the VMC officials to help temple authorities in completing barricades at a fast pace. City police commissioner B Srinivasulu said 3,000 policemen have been deployed at the Kanaka Durga temple on festival duty. He added that CCTV cameras were arranged at multiple locations and strict monitoring will be carried out. Eight helpline counters have also been arranged by the city police. Meanwhile, the VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh said the civic body is prepared for the festival and they have arranged around 150 temporary toilets. Around 2,000 sanitation workers will work round the clock at the temple and ensure that visiting devotees do not face any inconvenience.

Fares skyrocketed after many private bus operators stalled online bookings to create a temporary shortage and drive up prices. Around 300 private buses operate services between Vijayawada and Hyderabad every day. Thousands of people working in Hyderabad are preparing to return to their hometowns in Andhra Pradesh to celebrate Dasara with their families. Cashing in on the sentiment of passengers, transport operators have increased their services to meet the demand, but tripled the fare. “We usually travel in an AC sleeper bus to Vijayawada at a fare of Rs 1,200 per passenger. But private operators have closed online bookings and are selling tickets through their agents at special counters for Rs 3,800 to Rs 4,500. This is adding a huge burden on us,” Bathula Sateesh Babu, a techie from Hyderabad said. Return tickets from Vijayawada to Hyderabad in a private bus on October 16, after Dasara ends, are priced at Rs 5,500 at a special counter arranged at the Old Bus Stand area in the city. Passengers expressed their ire over the artificial hike in price. “Transport officials are turning a blind eye towards private bus operators. There is no mechanism to control the fare. Operators are looking to bring back old buses to cash in on the festive season. Officials should take up special fitness drives,” M Satyabhama, a passenger demanded. Meanwhile, the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) has announced it willrun 350 special festival bus services to Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pvt-bus-fares-triple-on-back-of-festive-demand/articleshow/86789782.cms||Venu Lanka

He also cautioned the grand old party against the RJD, which fielded its candidates from Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly constituencies in the byelection. Asked about the merger of his party with the Congress, the former MP said a meeting of the core committee of JAP-L would be held on Wednesday to deliberate upon the matter. “I will talk to senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi after the discussion at the meeting of the JAP-L’s parliamentary board on Wednesday. I will also talk to former Congress MP Ranjeet Ranjan over the issue,” he said. Yadav added, “It is up to the Congress to decide what kind of support it wanted from me and my party. The people wanted to see the Congress in a new role. The party leader should come to the expectations of the people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pappu-open-to-merging-jap-l-with-congress/articleshow/86791722.cms||Ramashankar

But the region does not have enough trauma care units along the national highways to provide immediate medical care to accident victims. For the past few years, the region has reported about 800 to 900 deaths in road accidents per year. Most of the road accidents take place on NH-16 and a few other NH stretches in the region. In the absence of emergency trauma care centres (TCC) and ambulances along the highways, deaths on roads continue to increase. Speaking to TOI, principal of Andhra Medical College (AMC), Vizag, Dr P V Sudhakar said there is an urgent need to increase the number of trauma care centres. “We have to ensure good maintenance and there should be better understanding between the Union and state governments in respect of allocation of funds,” he added. While there was a proposal to set up a trauma care unit at every 25 kms along the NH-16 and at least one unit at every 40 kms on other stretches in the region, Vizag has only one trauma care unit at King George Hospital (KGH). Speaking to TOI, district medical and health officer (DMHO), Vizag, PS Suryanarayana said TCCs are equipped to handle critical accident cases and provide specialised medical services and resources to patients suffering from traumatic injuries. “It can reduce chances of death or permanent disability to injured persons. In the recent road safety meeting, we proposed to set up at least four to five TCCs in Visakhapatnam district to save the lives of accident victims. If all goes as per plan, the district will get some TCCs,” he added. In Srikakulam district, the RIMS-Hospital is the only ray of hope for accident victims. There is not a single TCC in Vizianagaram district, which is centrally-located in the region and also connects Andhra Pradesh to Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Ironically, most of the road accident victims in the region are referred to KGH in Vizag city, said DSP (traffic) Vizianagaram, L Mohan Rao. Nor is there coordination between various agencies such as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), medical and health, police, and road transport in setting up the TCC and providing necessary manpower to curb accident fatalities. The first hour after the trauma is referred t as the ‘golden hour’ and proper first aid given to accident victims during this hour increases their chance of survival manifold and reduces the severity of injuries. Apart from north Andhra Pradesh, there is also a need to set up TCCs in parts of East Godavari as sometimes victims from that district are shifted to Vizag for better medical care, feel police and medical fraternity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/road-deaths-climb-in-absence-of-trauma-care/articleshow/86789947.cms||Nalla.Babu

Sajjala said he suspected the role of Naidu and TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh behind the transport of heroin and ganja from the state. He was reacting to the allegation by some TDP leaders that the YSRC is behind the drug racket. Sajjala told the media here on Tuesday that the YSRC leadership is ready to take any criticism, as long as it is decent and based on facts. He added that Naidu had deliberately launched a malicious campaign, stating that chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s name may be in the Pandora Papers. Stating that Naidu should in fact be congratulating the state government for the seizure of the largest quantity of ganja by the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB), Sajjala said TDP leaders are instead trying to sling mud at the government. He also added that the TDP’s campaign to portray Andhra Pradesh as a safe haven for drug suppliers is baseless.

Addressing a virtual training session of the party workers from Delhi, Lalu said, “Don’t be scared of going to jail. Cases are lodged for taking out processions and staging dharnas. But don’t be afraid of such action, which are taken to maintain peace and law and order.” At the same time, he appealed to the workers to launch “satyagrah”, which is the best method to oppose the misdeeds of any government. He described the Lakhimpur Kheri incident as “barbaric”. Lalu took a potshot at the police for failing to initiate action against the culprits in the Lakhimpur incident. “It is said that judicial probe will be conducted. But I don’t know when the probe will start,” he said. The RJD chief advised the party workers to be extra cautious during byelection to the two assembly seats in the state and remain at the polling booths till completion of the polling process to avoid chances of rigging. “Senior leaders like Shivanand Tiwari and Jagadanand Singh should train the workers on the issue,” he added. The RJD supremo said the party workers should be in the villages during election and campaign in favour of the nominees to ensure their victory. He reiterated RJD’s demand for a caste-based census in the country. “Caste census is necessary to plan welfare schemes and allocate funds to the backward sections of the society,” Lalu said. Lalu, however, did not speak anything on his son Tej Pratap’s remark that his father was held captive in Delhi. The issue of induction of Kanhaiya Kumar into the Congress also remained untouched in Lalu’s speech. Top leaders of the party were present at the virtual training session held at Tejashwi’s residence here. Lalu assured the party workers that he would visit Patna soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/launch-jail-bharo-stir-to-expose-govt-lalu-tells-rjd-workers/articleshow/86791682.cms||Ramashankar

---||Business||In a digital-first world, all firms are technology cos||By Shalini KapoorThe evolution of the skilling-career continuum has accelerated following the pandemic. As the business landscape evolves for companies across varied sectors, skilling and work are more integrated than ever before. In this new frontier, job seekers — whether they are freshers or lateral talent — must link skilling with real-world opportunities by aligning to exponential technologies that are changing the way we work and the future of business. However, even as millions of candidates enter the employment market every year in India, companies in key sectors are facing a talent crunch due to skill gaps. According to a report by the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom), titled ‘FutureSkills Talent in India’, the demand for digital talent jobs in the country is about eight times the size of the fresh talent pool and the gap will increase to 20 times by 2024. The situation is similar in the case of lateral talent too. In a global survey by analyst firm Gartner, IT leaders revealed they see talent paucity as the biggest barrier to the adoption of 64% of new technologies by their companies. Today, the quartet of emerging technologies known as ABCD (AI, blockchain, cloud & data analytics) is the key to a successful career in not merely IT or software industry but other sectors too as these technologies are pervading companies everywhere. Essentially, every company is now a technology company in a digital-first world. ABCD is altering the skill landscape Artificial intelligence (AI) is an advanced technology that is being deployed at a robust rate by companies in education, banking, retail and healthcare sectors and even by governments due to its many benefits. In education, self-service portals using text-based chatbots and voice assistants are coming up on the back of AI technologies. Leading companies in the banking and retail sectors are looking to streamline their customer service and engagement using AI, given the improving ability of machines to understand human language. In the healthcare and life sciences industries, AI tools can supplement physician efficiency, lessen the burden on clinicians, offer new use cases such as intelligent scribes, documentation assistance and provide clinical decision support. Natural language processing, machine learning and neural networks are the areas of AI that are powering these new trends coupled with the digital transformation that companies are pursuing. Another new technology transforming a range of industries and governments is blockchain, as it moves beyond the proof-of-concept stage into solutions that create value. Companies in financial services, retail, insurance and manufacturing sectors are looking to adopt consortium-based permissioned blockchain for trading, cross-currency payments, supply chain, asset digitisation, loyalty programmes, risk provenance and maintenance tracking. Various state governments in India are laying the groundwork to use blockchain networks for e-governance, revenue collection, maintenance of land records and voting during elections. Similarly, open, hybrid cloud adoption is growing by leaps and bounds as companies migrate their data and applications to the cloud for data interoperability, improved customer engagement and asset management. The migration to the cloud is happening through models such as software-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service. Hybrid cloud is critical for companies to benefit from personalisation made possible by AI and asset management through the IoT technology. Last, data analytics continues to be a vital technology as every company is now becoming data-driven. Those operating in the banking, retail and telecom sectors rely on advanced data analytics to run personalised campaigns and provide omni-channel curated customer experience. Data analytics is helping them to improve their operational efficiencies, drive customer retention, mitigate risks and improve bottom lines. To summarise, the exponential technologies are becoming all-pervasive as they afford several benefits to companies and enable them to secure themselves from unprecedented events such as Covid. With the rise of low code and no-code tools that help deploy emerging technologies, their adoption by companies in many industries would increase rapidly. The disruption caused by the pandemic provides an enormous opportunity for companies to reconfigure the world of work. For job seekers, it is a chance to embark on an up-skilling and re-skilling journey that can prepare them for the future of work, whatever the working model may be. Continuous skilling aligned with advanced technologies in conjunction with a protean approach is crucial to stay relevant and become future-proof.

AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik in a press release said the party has decided to contest the by-election in Badvel assembly constituency. The decision to field Kamalamma was taken following a report by a committee headed by APCC vice-president and former MLA Shaik Mastan Vali. APCC president Dr Sake Sailajanath had forwarded the committee’s report to AICC and sought its permission to field Kamalamma in the by-election. Kamalamma, a former principal of government junior college, served as Badvel legislator between 2009-2014. She was the first legislator of Badvel after the constituency was reserved for Scheduled Castes. She has also served as member of the National Commission for SCs. Kamalamma lost the deposit when she contested 2019 elections as a Congress nominee. Congress nominee and five-time MP Chinta Mohan had also lost the deposit in the recent Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election.

IIFL Finance has Rs 43,160 crore of loan assets under management as on June 30, 2021 with around 93% of the book in retail including small-ticket loans. The account aggregator platform conceived by the RBI facilitates customers to give consent to lenders software accessing their bank details. This enables loans to be extended to those without credit scores. IIFL Finance aims to use the account aggregator to better underwrite small enterprises. The private lender is focusing on digital underwriting of unsecured loans up to 10 lakh for MSME. Customers can avail instant loans within a few minutes through the MyMoney app managed by IIFL Finance. IIFL Finance chairman Nirmal Jain said, “We believe account aggregator would be a game changer in the coming days. A lot of borrowers are denied access to credit due to unavailability of financial data. Creation of Account aggregator will solve that.” He added that currently around 8% of the users on IIFL’s platform are able to provide digital financial data to process the application. “We believe the Account aggregator will help us bridge the data gap and make 70-80% of the businesses eligible to seek digital credit”, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/iifl-to-use-a/c-aggregator-for-sme-loans/articleshow/86793534.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

His partially decomposed body with limbs tied and multiple stab wounds was found floating in river Dharmavati on the outskirts of Hirpur early Tuesday morning. The deceased, Bipin Bihari Ojha (32), was the son of Congress leader Prabhu Dutt Ojha, who is also the PACS chairman of Deokuli panchayat under Brahmapur police station area in Buxar. Bipin had gone missing on October 2. His father had lodged a kidnapping case against unknown persons the same day. Buxar SP Neeraj Kumar Singh said the woman is the niece of Bipin’s aunty. “It was Rani who had called Bipin over phone to her parental house at Hirpur on October 2. He reached there on a bike. He was stabbed to death within five minutes of reaching there. Her husband Ravi Mishra (35) and Rani’s brothers Ajay Choubey (22) and Vijay Choubey (19) later carried the body and threw it in the river. They buried the bike in a canal nearby,” he said. The SP said Ajay and Vijay were arrested on Tuesday. They confessed to killing Bipin and also helped police find the body and his bike. Rani’s mother was being interrogated. Bipin’s husband Ravi and her father Kanahiya Choubeywere absconding. Ravi is a constable in Chhattishgarh, he said. Neeraj said Bipin and Rani were having an affair since the days before their marriage. Singh said Rani got married in 2014 and Bipin five years back. “However, their relationship continued even after marriage. The woman’s family, including her husband, had come to know about it and used to oppose their relationship. The family members tried to break the connection but failed after which they allegedly murdered him with the help of Rani,” he said. He said the forensic experts have been roped in to examine the house inside which Bipin was murdered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-killed-for-illicit-relation-with-married-cousin-in-buxar/articleshow/86794120.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Patna: Durga Puja committees plan simple celebrations||PATNA: Navaratra is just around the corner and artists and decorators are busy giving final touches to theme-based pandals in the city. Many of them have, however, decided to celebrate the festival with less pomp amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Since ‘kalash sthapana’ will be performed on October 7, the Puja committees are making last-minute preparations to welcome Goddess Durga with love and devotion. Sanjiv Prasad Toni, the chairperson of Navyuvak Sangh Shree Durga Puja Samiti Trust, told this reporter on Tuesday that Durga Puja would be a low-key affair like last year. “Although no idol will be installed at the pandal near Dak Bungalow crossing, the devotees will be able to see Goddess Durga on a digital screen from a distance. None of them will be allowed inside,” Sanjiv said, adding that the structure of the pandal, which would be barricaded, was ready and only finishing touches were left. Raj Kumar, the convenor of Navyuvak Sangh Puja Samiti, also pointed out that Durga Puja festivities would not be elaborate. He added, “An 18-foot-high pandal has been made on Polytechnic Mor where only 20 visitors will be allowed at a time. Besides, all our members, who will manage the crowd, are fully vaccinated.” Echoing similar views, Kumar Ritesh, a member of Mithapur-Jakkanpur Durga Puja Samiti, said a simple pandal was being erected where only one idol of Goddess Durga would be installed. All the rituals would be performed in a traditional manner with devotion. On the contrary, Shri Durga Puja Samiti Navyuvak Sangh has roped in artists to make a 40-foot-high pandal in Defence Colony which looks similar to the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. A member of the committee, Krishna Singh, said, “Idols of Goddess Durga, Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Lord Kartikeya are being prepared.” He continued, “There will be separate entry and exit points for visitors to whom the pandal will be thrown open on October 11. There will also be sanitisers and face masks for them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/durga-puja-committees-plan-simple-celebrations/articleshow/86790706.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Delhi||This bone-rattler road atNehru Place is an orphan||New Delhi: This is an orphan road that usually no agency is willing to own up. The reason is not far to seek. It remains in a dilapidated state throughout the year despite the fact that it runs past a five-star hotel, a busy Metro station, a food court, a multiplex, and, most importantly, a bustling commercial centre. This is Astha Kunj Road at Nehru Place. Right from the time you turn into it from Lala Lajpat Rai Road and head past all these landmarks to your destination, you have to brace for a bumpy ride with potholes all over the place. The recent showers may have eroded the surface further but all visitors to this area will tell you that this road has never been one for a smooth ride. “I do not understand how a main road located outside such a busy prime market can be left unattended by the authorities perpetually,” says an exasperated S Parveen. “I work at South Extension and I have to visit Nehru Place almost every day for some or other work related to my office. Driving on this road is an ordeal.” The general manager of Eros Hotel, Davinder Juj, says he has repeatedly approached the agencies – corporation, PWD and DDA – for help. “I am concerned about the condition of the road and have complained about it to the authorities. We are always ready to cooperate with them for beautification of the area. DDA is constructing a skywalk here which will directly connect the Nehru Place metro station and food court Epicuria with the Nehru Place commercial complex and that’s wonderful,” he says. But this road is another story. Shailendra, who owns a computer repairs shop at Nehru Place, says the situation has deteriorated during the monsoon. “The road was waterlogged for days and commuting here has become a nightmare,” he says. Auto driver Sahil says it’s a pain all the year round. “I stay near Nehru Place, and in the past six years since I have been ferrying passengers in Delhi, I never had a smooth ride here,” he recalls. Visitors Sunny and his wife, Meena, who were visiting the computer hub were irked by this negligent attitude of the authorities too. “As it is, the whole complex has been ripped apart by DDA because of some major redevelopment work that’s on. There is no method in this madness,” said Shubho Banerjee, who had come to get a laptop battery replaced. Ruchi Sharma, a member of Nehru Place Greens — a voluntary association that takes care of beautification of Nehru Place by planting trees and maintaining a park there — says: “Whenever we complain to the corporation and PWD about the road conditions and lack of streetlights which put commuters’ safety at risk, we find the agencies shifting the blame on to each other.” Many roads in the capital suffer from failure to drain water which then damages the road. Drains overflow because the agencies do a poor job of cleaning them before the monsoon. Also, poor workmanship and use of substandard material could be the reason for the roads getting eroded very easily. However, one doesn’t know if contractors are held to account for such stretches which are perennial trouble spots. In view of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s direction to PWD to fill all potholes by October 20, TOI approached all the agencies. Finally, DDA owned up to the road. Chief engineer D V Raghav told TOI: "Right now, DDA is maintaining Astha KunjRoad and we are aware that it has developed deep potholes after the recent heavy rain. We are waiting for the road to dry up completely so that we can start filling them up.” Well, whether patchwork repairs can deliver the residents of Delhi from a bumpy ride remains to be seen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/this-bone-rattler-road-atnehru-place-is-an-orphan/articleshow/86793067.cms||Zumbish

---||Kolkata||As Devi Paksha kicks in, Kolkata raises a toast to Calcutta’s old-world charm||Kolkata: Hours before Mahalaya, the city’s radio man — Amit Ranjan Karmakar — was felicitated for his unique contribution to Kolkata’s cultural landscape. Karmakar has been repairing radios of all makes, including Bush, Murphy, Philips and Telefunken, since 1976 at his nameless Kumartuli shop. Purono Kolkatar Golpo (PKG) — a Facebook group with 1,80,000 members that chronicles Kolkata of yore — felicitated him on Tuesday with a wristwatch, a memento, certificate of honour and Rs 5,000. On Mahalaya, the group will also honour the contributions of Lucky Cafeteria at Maniktala Hawkers’ Market, New Bangolokkhi Pice Hotel of Koley Market and Café-de-luxe at Hazra. PKG’s administrator Jayanta Sen said this felicitation was specially timed a day before Mahalaya. “On Wednesday, he will open his store at four in the morning and tune his old Sansui radio for everyone in the locality to listen to Mahishashura Mardini. Apart from a break last year, Karmakar has been following this tradition since he joined this shop in 1976. His father had set up this shop in 1967,” Sen said. Karmakar's pride possession is a set that dates back to 1944. “The owner happily got rid of it at my shop,” he said. Everyday, the 63-year-old opens his shop, which has some 150 sets, at seven and tunes into the radio news before going for a swim. “I have been listening to the radio news since 1964,” he said, before repeating names of news readers including Nilima Sanyal, Prashanta Mukhopadhyay and Debdulal Bandopadhyay, sports commentators by Pushpen Sarkar and Kamal Bhattacharya and programmes like Binaca Geetmala and Joymala. “Days before Mahalayas were very busy earlier since everyone wanted their sets repaired to listen to Bani Kumar, Pankaj Mullick and Birendrakrishna Bhadra. In 1981, I earned the highest - Rs 7330 – during the Mahalaya. From 2004 to 2011, the number of clients dipped. Once photography was allowed in Kumartuli from 2012, youngsters would get their old sets for repair. Pandal-hoppers too drop by now and give me work. This year, the work has gone up,” he said. According to another PKG administrator Swarnali Chattopadhya, “Karmakar has a treasure trove of spare parts. Members of our group based aboard too have contacted him for spare parts. However, his next generation isn’t keen on following in his footsteps. However, his next generation isn’t keen on following in his footsteps. All these four small establishments we have chosen are important landmarks in Kolkata’s cultural identity. That’s why we are felicitating them.” New Bangolokkhi Pice HotelIn 1941, Bhabgrahi Bahru had migrated from Bhubaneswar to Kolkata to set up the New Bangolokkhi Pice Hotel. A lot of the revolutionaries would use the premises for hiding. Covid impacted the business drastically. Lunch is served to only 20 people. “We don’t have any staff. My wife, despite being a heart patient, cooks. We have a house in Patuli. Once lunch is over, we use the room for their personal purposes. The cheapest fish meal is for Rs 50 while the costliest is priced at Rs 90,” 72-years-old owner Bishwanath Bahru said. Subhas Saha’s grandfather, Satyaranjan Saha, had migrated to Shantipur from Dhaka before shifting to Maniktala. “In the late 50s, he had set up Lucky Cafetaria for tea and toast. My mother had named this stall as Lucky. She had contributed Rs 10 to set it up. That apart, we also serve ghuni, alurdum and egg curry. The mutton singara, introduced in the mid 70s, is so popular that it gets sold by 6pm,” Saha said. Café-de-luxe at HazraCafé-de-luxe was set up in 1952 by Sukhamoy Aich beside Basusree. “People would come to Basusree and then drop by at our café. Ritwik Ghatak had come to our café. Chuni Goswami, Ram Bahadur, Chandan Banerjee and Sukamar Samajpati would also come by. So did Anil Chatterjee, Bhanu Bandopadhyay and Jwahar Roy. We were the first to introduce mutton singara in south Kolkata,” claimed Sukhamoy’s son, Samir Kumar Aich. Pandemic and the restrictions have the business. “Fortunately, our old-timers still come here,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/as-devi-paksha-kicks-in-kolkata-raises-a-toast-to-calcuttas-old-world-charm/articleshow/86790719.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The exercise of updating the electoral assumes importance ahead of civic elections due in the state in early 2022. In normal times, 96,000 BLOs are assigned for election duty across Maharashtra. Most of them are state ASHA workers, anganwadi workers or teachers, besides other state and central government officials who have now been assigned Covid-19 duty. With a draft electoral roll expected in November, the BLOs have to check for nearly 4.63 lakh duplicate names and around 12.83 lakh names without photos, said officials. “We cannot delete names unless BLOs carry out verification and site visit. During the first and second waves, officials were assigned Covid-19 work but could not carry out site verification due to the various protocols in place,” said an election official. “Now, as many of them have not been re-assigned from Covid-19 work, it becomes difficult to get adequate staff to ensure the process is completed at the earliest,” said an election official. Pune district too is grappling with a staff crunch. There are nearly 26,937 duplicate names and about 2.86 lakh names without photos in the electoral rolls in the district. State election officials said collectors have been directed to conduct meetings and ensure the work is expedited so that the draft roll is ready by November. “Although the updating process is continuous, it has to be sped up,” said election officials. A BLO on duty said that besides updating electoral rolls, they are also roped in for data entry work related to Covid-19, and now schools reopening will add to their burden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/staff-shortage-affects-electoral-roll-revision/articleshow/86793028.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The SGST department is set to net a huge amount of tax and penalties in the action that started on Monday night near Ludhiana and continued till Tuesday early morning. This operation, which was kept a secret by the department, was conducted on several roads near Khanna, Mandi Gobindgarh and Amloh, and teams even checked trucks parked at dhabas and other spots. Several drivers fled the spot.Heavy police force and several teams of SGST, led by its director of investigation HPS Ghotra, conducted the operation. It was learnt that majority of these trucks were entering Punjab from different states and were laden with scrap, which is in huge demand in Ludhiana, Mandi Gobindgarh and other cities of the state.Ghotra said, “On the directions of taxation commissioner Nilkanth S Avhad and additional commissioner Showkat Ahmed Parray, a ‘no tolerance against tax evasion’ drive was launched. I, along with Fatehgarh Sahib SP (headquarters) Harpal Singh and supporting staff, conducted surprise checks on scrap vehicles entering Punjab from other states without valid documents.

The city police maintained strict vigil in and around the examination centres located across Pune city, Pimpri Chinchwad and rural Pune, Gupta said. “The exams were conducted in a peaceful manner. However, there were three cases of impersonation at the centres located off the Sinhagad Road and near Bharati Vidyapeeth. We registered cases against these candidates and the persons, who attempted to appear as their proxy, with the Bharati Vidyapeeth and Sinhagad Road police stations,” the commissioner said. “They were taken out of the examination halls before they could appear for the exam,” he said. The police will continue to check malpractices adopted by the candidates during the physical and medical examinations, which will be held later this month, he added. “We will cross check their ID cards and hall tickets at each stage of recruitment,” he said. Talking about the low attendance for the examination, the commissioner said, “We cannot comment on it at present, but there might be multiple factors.” A senior police officer said, “The examinations were announced in 2019 and forms were distributed and accepted then. There are chances that the aspiring candidates might have got the jobs somewhere else or some might have stopped preparing for the police recruitment.” Another officer said that there could also be chances that the candidates who had filled the forms from the neighbouring districts might have applied for posts in their districts only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/32-of-candidates-enrolled-in-pune-appear-for-exam/articleshow/86792996.cms||---

C-Dit has been asked to develop this system and they are in the process, he added. The government has decided to strengthen the vigilance wing of the cooperative department and also to bring in necessary changes in the cooperative laws to put an end to corruption, Vasavan said. The government is in the process of appointing an officer from the Indian Audit and Accounts Service in the post of cooperative audit director. The minister said that all these steps are being taken in the wake of the Karuvannur bank scam. A three-member committee has already been constituted to suggest amendments in cooperative laws to curb irregularities. In the AR Nagar bank fraud, it has been detected that the KYC guidelines were not followed while accepting deposits. Several people who have customer IDs did not have membership in the bank. Several customer IDs were given under one name and through this Rs 2.66 crore was disbursed as loan. Several employees and their relatives are also having a number of deposits in the bank. The rules and regulations were not followed during disbursement of loans. The minister said that it has been noticed that in several instances when there is default in loan repayment, the banks are increasing the interest rates and allowing the defaulters to renew their loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/co-op-society-audits-will-be-transparent/articleshow/86795501.cms||---

The decision was taken in the executive committee meeting of the association, which was presided over by its president Narinder Bhamra.Bhamra said, “During the meeting, the burning issue of steel price hike was discussed. All present were of the view that apart from prime steel producers, the local furnaces and steel rolling mills have also been increasing prices every hour. This not only creates panic in the market, but also makes us suffer heavy losses. This malpractice is uncalled for and members have decided to hold a protest on Wednesday at 3pm at the Cycle Market.”According to Rajkumar Singla, senior vice-president of FMAI, “It has also been decided to discuss the further course of action, such as chain hunger strike, on that day. Besides this, setting up of a cluster for treatment of effluents was also discussed and members accorded their consent to form an SPV for the purpose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bizmen-to-protest-steel-raw-material-price-hike-today/articleshow/86790730.cms||---
---||Pune||Congress slams ‘crime against humanity’ in Lakhimpur||PUNE: All India Congress committee (AICC) general secretary H K Patil on Tuesday blamed the BJP government for action against farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri village, terming it “crime against humanity.” He said that Lakhimpur Kheri incident is a heinous crime against farmers protesting peacefully. Instead of withdrawing anti-farmer laws, the government is killing farmers through their political followers and their kin, Patil said at a press conference here. “We strongly condemn the police raj culture and don’t want the country to turn into a police raj at any cost,” he said. The party also demanded an enquiry into the alleged Amazon bribery case. “The BJP-led government and its leadership and a foreign company is being promoted at the cost of 8 lakh small farmers, shopkeepers, traders and small businesses. We demand an enquiry by a sitting Supreme Court judge into the alleged scam,” said Patil. He said that the initiatives of the Union government like National Monetisation Pipeline and soaring fuel prices were causing harm to the economy and citizens. Even the promise of giving jobs to the youth has not been fulfilled, he said. Patil, who is also the party convenor of Maharashtra, refused to speak about the upcoming local bodyelections in the state. Asked about alleged offshore investments and tax evasion by the Congress leaders and their families as mentioned in the Pandora papers’ investigation, Patil termed it “the tactics of the BJP to divert attention”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cong-slams-crime-against-humanity-in-lakhimpur/articleshow/86793053.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Auto trip refusals, extra fare demand on despite crackdown||PUNE: Almost a month has passed since the police and transport authorities launched a drive against the errant autorickshaw drivers following the gang-rape of a minor girl, a major section of commuters depending on the three-wheelers feels not much has changed on ground. “I returned to the city from New Delhi on Friday last week and spotted a ‘meter booth’, earlier known as the ‘pre-paid booth’, of autorickshaws at the station with a few vehicles and passengers. But barely 50m in front of the main entrance of the state, autorickshaws waited in a long queue and the drivers demanded abnormal fares. For a ride from the station to Pradhikaran, they wanted Rs700,” Nilesh Shah said on Monday. “I decided to hire an autorickshaw plying by meter from the station. But I fail to understand what is the use of having the ‘meter booth’ service when the administration is allowing autorickshaws to illegally ply from the same place,” he said. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame said the system at the railway station would soon be streamlined. “The drive will continue. The idea is to profile as many autorickshaw drivers as we can to ensure people’s safety,” he said. Kondhwa resident Nikhat Parveen said, “Despite the crackdown, many autorickshaw drivers are still refusing tripes. I had to visit Wanowrie last week and at least eight autorickshaw drivers refused. Merely wearing uniform and badges is not enough. Trip refusals by the autorickshaw drivers are a major concern.” An autorickshaw driver said he would not be a part of the ‘meter booth’ service at the station. “If they force me, I will move out of the station. Our lives have been tough due to the pandemic and the ongoing drive has hit us hard. Plying by meter is difficult for us,” he said on condition of anonymity. Nitin Pawar, a senior leader of Rickshaw Panchayat Autorickshaw Union, said, “Many drivers have failed to renew their insurance and pollution-under-control papers due to the pandemic. The authorities are slapping penalties on them in the range of Rs1,000-2,000 for not having these papers.” A group of autorickshaw drivers in the Koregaon Park area said they had stopped accepting long-distance trips. “It means there are more chances of getting stopped by the police. How can we pay for the vehicle insurance when there is no income for us for more than a year?” one of the group members said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/auto-trip-refusals-extra-fare-demand-on-despite-crackdown/articleshow/86793048.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Need to bring services under one roof for kids with cerebral palsy: Experts||Pune: Suffering from cerebral palsy, two-year-old Samarth’s behaviour changed for the worse in recent months, with the Covid-19 pandemic restricting him to the house while his sister and brother played outside. Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological condition that affects muscles and movements. Before the pandemic, Samarth’s outings comprised routine visits to the hospital’s development centre for therapy sessions where he would play with toys his “didi” gave him. But everything changed drastically for children with special needs. Samarth’s spasticity or tightness of muscles increased with the irregularity in intervention. Sanjay Lalwani, medical director and chief paediatrician at the Bharati hospital, said, “The number of children with special needs coming to the hospital for intervention had dipped considerably during the lockdown. Our Child Development and Guidance Centre at the hospital saw monthly sessions dipping to just 100 in 2020 as against an average of 1,000.” Now that the lockdown has eased, parents have started venturing back. But varied needs of kids with neurodevelopmental disorders have made it challenging for hospitals. The hospitals, experts said, needed to initiate a multidisciplinary team approach with a CP clinic where all the specialists and therapy professionals would come together and discuss the goal plan for the child’s holistic progress. “This avoids the parents’ multiple visits and also provides a comprehensive plan in the discussion. We are starting HOPE clinic at our hospital this week where all services will be under one roof for children with CP,” Lalwani said. Developmental paediatrician and neurologist Leena Srivastava said, “Many parents of children with other neurodevelopmental disorders benefited from online support, but the ones with cerebral palsy were the worst hit as skilled support was not easy or advisable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/need-to-bring-services-under-one-roof-for-kids-with-cerebral-palsy-experts/articleshow/86793030.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Pune airport shut from October 16 to 29 for runway work||PUNE: The city airport will remain closed for all flight operations from October 16 to 29 to facilitate the runway re-carpeting work. “As per a written communication we have received from the Indian Air Force (IAF), flights from Pune will not operate from October 16 to 29 owing to the runway resurfacing work,” Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke told TOI on Tuesday. The airport is a part of the IAF’s Lohegaon air base. The IAF controls the runway and the air traffic control, while the Airports Authority of India (AAI) manages the civil enclave. The civil enclave has been handling 114-120 flight movements (landings and take-offs combined) in a 12-hour span from 8am every day since October 26 last year. Night-time operation of flights has been on hold since then to facilitate the runway work that is now in the final stages. As such, all flight movements would stop from 8pm on October 15 and resume from 8am on October 30, an airport official said. “Post-resumption, the airport will operate on a round-the-clock basis,” he said. An airport source told TOI that as the runway shutdown was due to an operational reason, airlines were liable to provide full refund to passengers but were not responsible to guarantee rescheduling. The airport closure is happening at a time when daily flight movements are the highest ever since domestic operations resumed after the first Covid-induced lockdown from May 2020. Also, the passenger traffic at the airport has been the highest as well with many travelling during the ongoing festive season. The re-carpeting work of the airport’s lone runway started last September. The authorities had then said the 14-day closure of the airport would happen from April 26 to May 9 this year. But the work was postponed following requests from various stakeholders, including the AAI, as transportation of Covid vaccines from Pune had started and was in full flow from the airport. For a month now, several flyers have been raising the query about the dates of the airport closure to plan their journeys. Many flyers have gone ahead to book tickets from Mumbai due to no formal announcement of the closure dates. Passengers who already have flights booked were confused. “This is the festive season and it is after long that we are travelling. Our tickets to Bengaluru were booked for October 20 and the return was on October 26. How come the flyers are being given a notice of only 10 days? This announcement should have come at least a month ago. I have to reschedule my whole trip and getting a refund from airlines is extremely stressful,” Ramesh Thorat, a businessman, told TOI. “We had booked tickets to go to Jaipur. My whole plan has gone for a toss,” another passenger said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-airport-shut-from-oct-16-to-29-for-runway-work/articleshow/86793089.cms||Joy Sengupta

From students to the professionals everyone was like their life has been stopped. Its effect was also witnessed in the state capital also. Vikas Nigam, a private firm employee hailing from Harda living alone in Bhopal has witnessed the importance of social media when it went off. “I was chatting to my fiancé when WhatsApp suddenly stopped working. You can imagine my condition when it was not available for the next 4 hours. It was quite irritating,” said Vikas. He added, “After day’s hectic work, social media was the only option left for me to interact as I am new to the city and I do not have many friends around.” Even several professionals who are working from home in companies based out of the country had to face a lot of trouble. “I work for a USA-based company. A lot of my work depends on WhatsApp. It was a horrible situation for me and my other colleagues working from other locations. I pray that such a situation does not occur again,” said Pooja Billore. As WhatsApp is a free call several people were not able to connect overseas. “I never thought of a day when WhatsApp stops working. Yesterday, I realised it. I did not have an international calling facility due to which I was not even able to call,” said Vipul Kumar, a private form banker. Even students were also facing trouble. “My teacher had sent an assignment on WhatsApp. However, I could not do it as it was not working,” said Akhilesh Gour, a student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/outage-throws-virtual-life-of-wa-fb-users-out-of-gear/articleshow/86793074.cms||---

The protesters demanded immediate arrest of “main accused” Ashish Mishra, son of Union home minister of state Ajay Mishra. The protest resulted in long queues of vehicles on the highway. Later, party workers submitted a memorandum addressed to the President of India through the local administration, demanding Rs1 crore compensation to the families of the victim farmers and a journalist and Rs 25 lakh to the injured farmers. PSP district president Sharafat Hussain said, “We will launch a jail bharo andolan if the accused are not arrested. The President should immediately suspend Ajay Mishra. If the state government fails to arrest the minister’s son within three days, PSP workers from across the state will march to Lakhimpur Kheri and will launch an indefinite strike. We are ready to go to jail but we won’t tolerate the dictatorship of the state government.” Meanwhile, Congress workers staged protests across the Agra region over the arrest of party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi in Sitapuur district.

Senior divisional commercial manager (Bhopal), Vijay Prakash said under this project, Banapura goods shed will be developed with improvement of platform surfacing and circulating area, drainage, lighting with high mast, new merchant room as well as facilities for labour. “Railways will be able to develop this infrastructure with private investment which will not only save railway exchequer but also result in reduction in wagon turn around. This will also result in increased traffic and in turn increased earnings of Railways. This PPP contract will also spare railway manpower for maintenance and thus achieve cost cutting,” said senior DCM Prakash. This contract is for a period of 10 years which will be helpful for railway growth projection in future and attract new traffic. “With the improved infrastructure, the traffic is expected to increase by 6% annually which will roughly translate into an additional 8 cr to 10 cr earning annually. PPP mode ensures investment and employment and Railways as well as society and private sector will benefit by this achievement of Bhopal Division,” added Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/railways-award-goods-shed-at-banapura-under-ppp-mode/articleshow/86793110.cms||---

He made these announcements while addressing ‘Janjatiya Sammelan’ organized in Jhabua district. He also said that the state government will soon implement Provisions of the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act or PESA in tribal areas to protect and conserve community resources. “Tribals will be able to sell mahua and toddy liquor. I don’t support alcohol but if tribals make or drink alcohol for the sake of tradition, then there is no harm in it,” said Chouhan, adding that in Vanvasi Samaj (among forest dwellers), there is a need of liquor on many occasions like birth, death, and worshipping too as it’s a part of culture of tribes. To maintain the culture and tradition of tribal society, permission will also be given to make liquor from mahua and a new excise policy will be drafted. He said that in many petty cases, tribals have to visit courts. “So, cases, which are not of serious nature, will be withdrawn,” the CM said. On the occasion, Chouhan instructed the officials concerned to launch a survey of eligible families, which are left out in 2011 survey in below poverty line (BPL category), as the state government will allot plots to them to construct houses. He announced that the state government will celebrate ‘Janjati Gaurav Divas’ on the birth anniversary of Birsa Munda (Indian freedom fighter) on November 15 while ‘Jhabua Utsav’ will also be celebrated once every year. “Under ‘Ration Apke Dwar Yojana’, ration will be sent to the villages of tribal people for distribution while vehicles, owned by tribals, will be hired for the distribution work. The state government will guarantee the loan for the purchase of these vehicles,” the CM said. During his public address, Chouhan and BJP state president VD Sharma slammed the previous Congress-led state government for not carrying out development projects in tribal-dominated areas including Jhabua. On the occasion, some Congress leaders of Jhabua and Alirajpur district joined BJP as Chouhan and Sharma welcomed them in the saffron party on the stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/tribals-will-get-permission-to-make-liquor-from-mahua-cm/articleshow/86793135.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Correction process begins, 5 BJP district presidents sacked||Thiruvananthapuram: Setting in motion a major organizational rejig in the state BJP unit after the rout in the recently-held assembly polls, the party state president K Surendran, on Tuesday, sacked five district presidents and made some cosmetic changes in the state committee. Party presidents of Kasaragod, Wayanad, Palakkad, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta were removed from their seats. Following the state-wide exercise by the party to identify the organizational troubles that marred the party’s prospects in the last assembly election, certain organizational changes were widely expected. The changes, though not drastic, reaffirm the trust BJP national leadership has on Surendran. The new district presidents are VA Sooraj (Pathanamthitta), G Lijin Lal (Kottayam), KM Haridas (Palakkad), KP Madhu (Wayanad) and Ravisha Thantri (Kasaragod). As part of the shuffle, party spokesperson B Gopalakrishnan, party’s former secretary Sivankutty and P Raghunath were appointed as new vice-presidents. Former district president of Kasaragod K Sreekanth, former Congress leader Pandalam Prathapan who recently joined the party, former state treasurer JR Padmakumar and Mahila Morcha leader Renu Suresh were appointed as new state secretaries. Actor G Krishnakumar, G Raman Nair, G Gireesan and MS Sampoorna have been nominated to the party national executive. Meanwhile, KVS Haridas, Sandeep Vachaspati and TP Sindhumol were appointed the new spokespersons. Jayaraj Kaimal will be the new state office secretary. A reshuffle in the lower level is also expected. All mandalam committees would be bifurcated and there would be a renewed effort to ensure discipline in the party, said sources close to Surendran. The central leadership, they said, has given Surendran a mandate to ensure strict discipline in the state unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/correction-process-begins-5-bjp-district-presidents-sacked/articleshow/86795595.cms||---

Police said the accused used to smuggle the weapons using fake Facebook profiles. Two pistols of .32 bore, four live cartridges, two magazines and three cellphones have been recovered from their possession.The arrested are Harinderpal, 39, of Lallian Khurd village, Jalandhar; Balwinder Singh, 39, of Badhala village, Jalandhar; and Arjan Kumar, 22, a native of Madhya Pradesh and resident of Haibowal. They were arrested near Lajpat Nagar park, close to Ludhiana bus stand.Deputy commissioner of police (investigation) SPS Dhindsa said, “Recently, the Ludhiana police had arrested some accused who smuggled illegal weapons from Madhya Pradesh and sold those here. Their disclosures and other inputs led the city police and the counter-intelligence cell to the three accused.”“Arjan hails from Madhya Pradesh, from where he used to smuggle illegal weapons not only to Punjab, but to other states as well. Arjan, along with his accomplices Harinderpal and Balwinder, ran the trade. The trio would make fake Facebook accounts to contact their customers, fix the deals and prices of weapons and then made the supply,” Dhindsa added.Harinderpal has five criminal cases against him, including those of scuffle, Arms Act, NDPS Act and murder. In the murder case, he was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment. After spending six-and-a-half years in jail, he came out on bail. “We will get his bail cancelled. We will also trace those who have purchased weapons from them,” he said.‘A community in MP making illegal weapons’Additional deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said, “There are two to three villages in Madhya Pradesh that are involved in this illegal trade. A community there, which earlier worked in iron factories, has been making illegal weapons at home for the past some time. Initially, they would make weapons manually, but now they have machines installed at their houses. It is a big illegal trade of weapons.”Made Fb a/cs in gangsters’ namesADCP Bhatti said in some cases, the accused have used the names of gangsters to make Facebook accounts so that they can contact like-minded people to smuggle weapons. The police will question the accused about their clientele.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/inter-state-gang-of-illegal-weapon-smugglers-busted/articleshow/86790871.cms||---

He added that the party also failed to take on the BJP at the national level. Announcing his decision on Tuesday, Balachandran said state and central leadership of the party were unable to take a strong stand on crucial issues. “One cannot stand with a leadership that has lost its sense of direction. It has become difficult for people with self-respect to continue in the party. Also, the party has not been able to become the protectors of minorities,” Balachandran said, adding that he was ending his 52-year-old association with the Congress. He added that both majority and minority communities were drifting away from the Congress and this was reflected in the second term for LDF government in the state. Balachandran alleged that Sultan Bathery MLA IC Balakrishnan had won the seat by engaging in vote trading with BJP which lost around 13,000 votes in that seat. He alleged that there was corruption amounting to crores of rupees in staff appointments in cooperative banks controlled by the party. Balachandran said though he had approached KPCC seeking a probe into the corruption, Balakrishnan had instituted an inquiry, which was a cover up attempt, before he could proceed. Interestingly, Balachandran lauded the performance of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in steering the state despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and two recurring floods. It is learnt that Balachandran had talked to CPM leaders and a decision about his future political course of action will be announced soon. Balachandran is the fourth Congress leader from Wayanad to leave the party. Former MLA KC Rosakutty, KPCC secretary MS Viswanathan and INTUC state general secretary PK Anilkumar had left the party in the run-up to the recent assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/pv-balachandran-quits-cong-says-the-party-has-lost-direction/articleshow/86795649.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Modi pushing India into financial slavery: Cong||Nagpur: Congress general secretary Mohan Prakash on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre accusing it of pushing the country towards financial slavery on the instructions of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) supremo Mohan Bhagwat. Interacting with the media here, Mohan Prakash, former MLA, said Modi government had crippled the economy of small and medium traders through disasters like demonetisation and then imposing Goods and Services Tax (GST) without proper preparation. “As a result, entire country is suffering as the prices of essential commodities have touched the sky. Prices of edible oils are soaring to a new high everyday. This is not inflation, but loot by the Modi government in collusion with his friends like industrialist Adani,” he said. “Inflation used to peak during the Congress government, but we used to control it by using different measures,” said the Congress leader. Accusing the central government of causing loss of about 14 crore jobs during the last one-and-a-half years, the grand old party’s spokesperson sought answer from Bhagwat as to who was responsible for this. “His (Bhagwat’s) humble swayamsevak is now India’s prime minister, who is bent on selling government companies. LIC (Life Insurance Corporation of India) is the lifeline of the country and has employed lakhs of youths and it also provides a whopping revenue to the government. No Indian citizen would want to sell it to private parties. However, the Modi government is a puppet in the hands of a few countries, which want to push India towards economic slavery.” Accompanied by Congress city president Vikas Thakre, Mohan Prakash alleged that the US e-commerce giant Amazon had allegedly paid bribes to the government to push its products in the Indian market through the ‘Great Indian Festival’. “The company has paid Rs8,546 crore as legal fees in the last two years for finishing the small traders. It was later disclosed that the amount was allegedly paid as bribe and the company had partially admitted to it,” he said. Criticising central and Uttar Pradesh governments for misbehaving with senior opposition leaders like Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra, Mohan Prakash said such things never happened during Congress regimes. “The UP government meted out inhuman treatment to opposition leaders in Lakhimpur Kheri where farmers were allegedly mowed down by convoy of Union minister’s son. It’s not happening for the first time. Earlier also, Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra was stopped by the police from meeting Hathras gang-rape victim’s kin. She was not going to address any rally there, but was to meet the victims’ families. Union home minister (Amit) Shah and Tanashah are pushing the country away from democracy and bringing it on the brink of dictatorship,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/modi-pushing-india-into-financial-slavery-cong/articleshow/86793170.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||Last hurrah for monsoon, withdrawal to commence from northwest India today||NEW DELHI: It was a last hurrah for the southwest monsoon this season as parts of Delhi received an intense spell of rain on Tuesday, catching many off-guard. The monsoon withdrawal is expected to start in parts of northwest India from Wednesday, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. Delhi, too, is expected to witness the same during this period, after a delay of nearly two weeks. While the usual withdrawal date for Delhi is September 25, it continued to see rain till the end of September and the month ended with 413mm rainfall — an excess of over 200% — against the monthly normal of 125.1mm. “Conditions continue to remain favourable for commencement of withdrawal of the southwest monsoon from some parts of northwest India during the next 24 hours,” IMD stated on Tuesday. R K Jenamani, a senior scientist at IMD, said the picture would be clearer by Wednesday. “Some places will see withdrawal on Wednesday itself and, based on that, we will be able to forecast when the other states will be impacted,” said Jenamani. Safdarjung, Delhi’s base observatory, recorded 0.5mm rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm, while trace rainfall was recorded at Ayanagar. Mayur Vihar recorded 1mm rainfall till 5.30pm. Between June 1 and September 30, Safdarjung recorded 1,169.7mm rainfall as compared to a normal mark of 648.9mm. From October 1 till Tuesday, 3.4mm have been added to Delhi’s share. The air, meanwhile, was in the “moderate” category with the air quality index (AQI) at 115, according to Central Pollution Control Board’s daily bulletin. “PM10 is the main pollutant because of the dry air coming from northwest India, along with local pollution. AQI will remain in the satisfactory-to-moderate range for the next three days,” said System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research. IMD’s seven-day forecast shows no rain is expected during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/last-hurrah-for-monsoon-withdrawal-to-commence-from-northwest-india-today/articleshow/86793280.cms||---

The teams visited the schools across the district and even in the city and found that the rules were being diligently followed. The schools for classes 8 – 12 started in Nashik city and those for classes 5 – 7 started in the rural areas from Monday. While on first day, 363 schools reopened for the classes 8 – 12, the number increased to 383 on Tuesday, the education department noted. On Tuesday, more than 21,000 students attended the classes. Similarly, for classes 5 – 7 in rural areas, as many as 1,945 of the total of 1,985 schools started functioning till Tuesday. The number of students attending classes in the rural areas also increased to about 1.5 lakh. “The parents and the children in the urban areas are wary of the situation. Parents here are taking cautious steps in sending their children to the schools. The schools are also cautiously opening up. But so far, all the schools that have reopened, were found to be adhering to all covid-appropriate behaviour,” the officer said. The schools have reopened after a gap of 18 months and the state government and local governing bodies have issued detailed guidelines about the measures to be taken to prevent the spread of the nCoV infection in schools. Only one child is allowed to sit on one bench and only the fully-vaccinated teaching and non-teaching staff at the school is allowed. The parents have to give written consent to send their children to school. About the schools in the rural areas the officer said that the attendance was on higher side largely because the schools for Classes of 8 – 12 have already opened up since long time and hence the parents are more open to the idea of sending their children to schools, the officer noted. Village level committees keep a watch on the number of cases and decide upon opening schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-edu-dept-teams-find-schools-following-all-norms/articleshow/86788714.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||Durga’s calling: Come back to life||KOLKATA: It’s been a dull, grey and wet monsoon so far, the fear of a third Covid wave predicted to strike soon have made it even gloomier. The year, too, has been a depressing one with the pandemic raging for most part, keeping people confined to their homes and the fear of the virus lurking everywhere. But whenever the sun has been shining through the dark, forbidding clouds, albeit for a brief while, for mellow, autumn rays to filter through, the scare has been dissipating. They have been signalling the arrival of the goddess, a hope for the revival of normalcy and announcing the triumph of good over evil and of the defeat of demons. With Durga Puja being less than a week away and the pandemic finally showing signs of an ebb, it’s time to put away the fear and celebrate with caution. And a time to welcome back those who have left the city to take up jobs or to study in other cities or seek a fortune beyond the shores of our country. It’s time to return to our roots, even as we embrace the faith that the goddess instils in us and share the joy that the festival brings with it. There could be no better time to return to Kolkata than the Puja. This is when the city throbs with laughter and celebration, decks up in lights and revellers take to the streets to soak in the inimitable spirit of the festival. We at TOI are celebrating this homecoming with a new edition of our tribute to the city, Phirey Esho Kolkata. We are looking forward not only to the return of the Mother Goddess but also all those who have had to go elsewhere and implore them to come back home for the Pujas, to return to a Kolkata that has changed beyond recognition over the past few years. With its multiple new flyovers, wider roads, a fast-expanding Metro service, a growing New Town, it holds out much promise. Durga Puja remained an inseparable motif of the city as well as of the power within, said eminent Kolkatans. There’s no other festival like Durga Puja anywhere else in the world, said painter Wasim Kapur. "Covid or no Covid, the Puja brings the same kind of excitement every year and it will be no different this time. Most of my friends and relatives living in other cities or abroad, return to Kolkata during the Pujas. And, they have the best time of the year, they say," said Kapur, a Kolkatan since birth. The Pujas are an inspiration and something to look forward to, especially in these difficult times, said author Manishankar Mukhopadhyay. "It’s the biggest festival for all who have had anything to do with Kolkata, not just Kolkatans. Just as Kolkatans from other cities or countries pine to return to the city during the Pujas, so do others across the state. For someone living in Howrah, the pujas there are just as dear as the Kolkata pujas are to Kolkatans," he said. Cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar said he was looking forward to the Pujas despite the threat of Covid. "We have suffered enough, physically and psychologically over the last 18 months. It’s time to rid ourselves of the drudgery and let our hair down," said Sarkar. He, however, cautioned that enjoyment should be tempered with caution. "The only difference between the last Puja and this one is that we have had the second wave and a decent section of our population has been vaccinated. We should still be wearing masks and avoiding crowded places. But let us welcome our near ones back and have a safe, enjoyable Puja," added Sarkar. The earliest references to Durga can be found in the Rig Veda, considered the most ancient Indian text, where she is invoked in the Devi Shuktam hymn. She is also mentioned in the texts of Atharva Veda and Upanishads, apart from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Durga Puja references are found consistently in ancient texts since the 16th century, according to mythologist Nrisinghaprasad Bhaduri. "From the 18th century onwards, the Pujas have taken on a bigger form. They have gradually transformed into a community celebration from a domestic religious occasion and continued to grow over the past two centuries. Like any other festival, Durga Puja, too, has grown in stature and grandeur in a normal course," said Bhaduri. There’s now a strong economic side to the Pujas, Bhaduri pointed out. "It plays a part in boosting the local economy since people spend duri ng the festival. I see nothing wrong with that," said Bhaduri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/durgas-calling-come-back-to-life/articleshow/86793581.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Dehradun||Char Dham Board bars pilgrims from sanctum sanctorum of 3 shrines||Dehradun: The Char Dham Devasthanam Board — which manages the Himalayan shrines and temples in the state — has released a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the annual pilgrimage that bars pilgrims from the sanctum sanctorum of Gangotri, Yamunotri and Badrinath. In Kedarnath, devotees would be allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum, but not permitted to perform jalabhishek or touch anything. The SOP came as the high court lifted its limit on pilgrim numbers to the shrines on Tuesday. The decision has been taken keeping in mind the safety of pilgrims and so that Covid protocol is followed, said board officials. The state government, too, had issued a fresh SOP after the high court’s decision. The board SOP said that no one would be allowed to sit inside the temple premises. “Devotees opting for special prayers, too, would be allowed for ‘darshan’ but cannot be seated inside the temple premises. Priests will perform special puja for them. Distribution of prasad or applying teeka inside the temple premises would not be allowed,” it said. For Badrinath and Kedarnath, the board would provide “darshan token” to the devotees. The token can be collected from counters set up for the process. The time allotted for darshan would be mentioned on the token and people would have to stand in queue while maintaining a distance of six feet from each other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/char-dham-board-bars-pilgrims-from-sanctum-sanctorum-of-3-shrines/articleshow/86791026.cms||Kautilya Singh

Breaking away from the usual trend, under the transformation programme launched in 144 schools of the district, managements focused on improving infrastructure and skill-based learning on the lines of private schools. Earlier, the number of students in Government Primary School, Dugalkhola, was 34 and now it is 55. Situation was no better in Government Primary School, Gevapani, where there were only 33 students. But now the number is 82. The programme aimed at increasing the student strength on the lines of Delhi model, which meant having smart classrooms and better facilities. Listing the achievements, District coordinator Vidya Karnataka said, “We have upgraded 144 schools in the district. They have the best of facilities for students. Student strength has also gone up.

The incident occurred at Akurdi earlier that same afternoon, when the complainant had gone to a computer and printer repair shop. Sub-inspector Mahendra Aher of Nigdi police said the complainant Kranti Rajput, a resident of Ravet, ran an industrial unit in Talawade. “Around 1.30pm, Rajput was on his way to a bank to deposit the amount. On reaching Akurdi, he told his driver to stop at a shop as he wanted to give a printer for repairs,” he said. Rajput had kept the bag containing cash in the car’s boot and told the driver to stay in the vehicle. “When he returned after about half an hour, he found the car was parked, but the driver was not inside. The key was in the ignition,” Aher said. When Rajput opened the boot, he found the bag containing the cash was missing.

---||Pune||For another year, community celebrations remain limited due to Covid-19 pandemic||PUNE: Dandiya is a huge part of Navaratra celebrations across the city, but for the second year in a row, such community celebrations are not being organised on a large scale due to the Covid pandemic. “The last dandiya event at Yash Lawns in 2019 was a big success. But we have not held such events since the last two years. The pandemic struck just before our Holi event planned for March 2020, for which we had to incur losses of Rs 10-15 lakh due to cancellation. This year, I have been invited as a guest at private dandiya functions,” said Monty Rathod, who runs an eponymous event management company. Dandiya enthusiasts are clearly disappointed as they cannot attend grand celebrations with their families and friends for the second consecutive year. Pimpri resident Supriya Dwyer said, “My friends and I enjoy watching participants dressed up in colourful outfits performing dandiya and garba, especially the children in their cute ensembles. That festive feeling is missing since the pandemic began last year, for all festivals.” Similarly, Jigar Bansiwala, an IT professional from Somwar Peth, said, “It is disheartening that my wife and I have not had the opportunity to perform dandiya together over the last two years. We miss the experience at these occasions.” Nightclubs and bars in the city are, however, planning to host dandiya-themed events at 50% capacity. Rohen Anttony, an event organiser at a nightclub in Vimannagar, said, “The dress code for the night will be traditional festive wear, and we will also be giving the guests dandiya sticks. We will ensure that we maintain 50% capacity on the premises. Since children cannot be allowed inside the nightclub, we have set up another arrangement for families on the rooftop, where the anchor will be engaging them in Navaratra-themed games and music.” Another event organiser for a club in Baner said, “We will be allowing entry to only fully vaccinated guests.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/for-another-year-community-celebrations-remain-limited/articleshow/86793292.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Pune||Pune: Six men held for running holiday racket, cheating 30 people of Rs 1.5L each||PUNE: The Hinjewadi police on Monday arrested six men from New Delhi on the charge of offering fake holiday packages and duping at least 30 people from Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. As per the Hinjewadi police, the gang accepted Rs1.5 lakh from each target and offered holiday packages to different destinations in India and even abroad. So far, three people have approached the police with complaints. Senior inspector Balkrishna Sawant said the police, while probing those complaints, received information that some people were duping people by offering them fake holiday packages at a hotel. “We sent a team to the hotel in Hinjewadi and took the six suspects into custody,” Sawant further said. Subsequent investigation revealed that the suspects would pose as directors and executives of a tour company and contact people. “They would tell people they won vouchers from the company and told them to come to the hotel,” Sawant said. At the hotel, the suspects would offer their victims the 10-year holiday packages to different tourist destinations. “They told their victims they would have to pay a ‘low price’ of Rs1.5 lakh. One of the complainants told us they compelled him to swipe his card at the spot,” Sawant said. The police verified the suspects’ claims and found that they were not affiliated to any tour company or upscale hotels. “It was all fake,” Sawant said. He said that the gang was active inthe Hinjewadi area for the past one week. “We have found a list of 30 names with them. Our probe is on,” Sawant said. In 2018, a tours and travel operator was arrested for allegedly cheating a group of 35 students of a college on Paud Road to the tune of more than Rs17 lakh by promising them air tickets to England earlier in the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/6-men-held-for-running-holiday-racket-cheating-30-people-of-rs-1-5l-each/articleshow/86793269.cms||---

He stated that a division bench of this court on January 11 had directed the collector or the additional collector to pass appropriate orders on the representation sent by him within eight weeks, based on the report submitted by the tahsildar. Since the authorities had failed to remove the encroachment, the petitioner filed the contempt petition.When the petition was taken up for hearing on Tuesday, the government pleader submitted a report stating that the authorities had suspended the process of laying the road by complying with the order passed by this court.A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar observed that while the petitioner has sought for a direction to remove the encroachments in the water channel, the order of suspending the work and cancelling the work order has nothing to do with the prayer sought for by the petitioner in the petition.The judges directed the collector to appear before the court on October 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/encroachments-hc-summons-collector-in-contempt-petition/articleshow/86793290.cms||---

Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari, while inaugurating road projects in Nashik on Monday, had suggested that Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and the local authorities explore the possibility of relocating logistics near the upcoming Surat-Chennai Greenfield Expressway that will cut down on pollution in the city and take care of traffic congestions at various locations. “We will figure out the location along the highway where the hub can be set up. We will have a meeting with the stakeholders and explore the possibility for the logistics park for which the ministry of road transport and highways has promised all its support,” Bhujbal said. The idea is being welcomed by the transporters who will be able to benefit from it in terms of speed, time and money. “There will be two benefits of the logistical hub. The warehouses here will enable storage, process and transportation of agriculture produce besides other industrial goods using the Expressway and the same time it will be at the intersection of Mumbai-Agra national highway and Surat-Chennai Expressway helping better transportation possibilities. It will not only help the businesses, but also increase the employment opportunity,” Rajendra Patel, one of the transporters in Nashik, said. The Surat-Chennai corridor will pass through Nashik district. It will enter Nashik district at Rakshasbhuvan in Surgana taluka and exit from Kahandalwadi in Sinnar taluka after crossing 122.1 km through 69 villages in six talukas. This is a greenfield project between Nashik and Surat, the officials pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/meet-to-discuss-logistics-park-possibilities-soon-bhujbal/articleshow/86788724.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The judge framed certain queries to decide as to whether the proceedings initiated under the Act and pending before the magistrate courts can be transferred to the civil or family courts, by invoking Article 227 of the Constitution. The judge directed the registry to place the matter before the Chief Justice for considering the issues for resolution by a larger bench. The judge observed that violence against women is a problem across the world and it is a violation of fundamental freedom, as mentioned in the charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It affects women of all races, ethnic groups, classes and nationalities. Every age group of women have been facing violence in their life.The judge observed that the phenomenon of domestic violence in India is widely prevalent, but has remained invisible in the public domain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/larger-bench-to-take-call-on-dv-act-cases/articleshow/86793308.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Dehradun||HC lifts cap on Char Dham pilgrims, U’khand rolls out new SOP||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court on Tuesday removed the cap it had imposed on the number of pilgrims allowed to visit the four Char Dham shrines following which the state government rolled out a new standard operating procedure (SOP) for the pilgrimage. The advocate general (AG), S N Babulkar, cited a report published in TOI on Tuesday to argue that there is little chance that the country will see another spike in Covid cases and therefore the limit should be removed. TOI had reported that the country had recorded the lowest number of daily cases in nearly seven months, with 16,000 fresh cases being reported on Monday. The court’s decision came with just three weeks left for the portals of the Himalayan shrines to close for winter. The government had sought modification of the court's earlier order which had limited the maximum number of pilgrims in Badrinath to 1,000 while 800 pilgrims were allowed to Kedarnath. The figure was set at 600 for Gangotri and 400 for Yamunotri. Shortly after the court’s decision, the state government announced a fresh SOP for the Char Dham yatra, replacing the previous one issued before the start of pilgrimage on September 18 this year. The new SOP does away with the requirement for local residents to register on the smart city portal before undertaking the yatra. Only those travelling from outside the state would need to register on the portal. Other guidelines have remained in place. Devotees can travel only 15 days after receiving the second dose while those who are not vaccinated need to produce a Covid-19 negative report. In case, authorities detect any person with Covid-19 symptoms, the devotee should be taken to the nearest health facility for a check up. A six-feet distance in temple premises and lodging is mandatory. On Tuesday, the bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma had held that it would be in the “interest of justice” to remove the upper limit on pilgrims and modified its order of September 16. The bench, however, added that since only three weeks are left for the yatra and because the festive season is approaching there could be a spike in pilgrims travelling to Char Dham shrines. “The state government should ensure that only those who carry negative RT-PCR reports or vaccination certificates should be allowed to the shrines,” the bench said. Babulkar said that the court has also asked the government to ensure that medical infrastructure is upgraded and helicopters are made available at the shrines in cases of medical emergencies. The district legal services authorities (DLSA) of Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi — the districts where Char Dham shrines are located — have been asked to send weekly reports to the HC about the status of medical as well as other facilities. Welcoming the court’s decision, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, said, “Strict compliance of guidelines would be ensured. We will see that all arrangements are in place.” The CM also inspected the preparations and ongoing development projects at Kedarnath shrine and said that projects worth Rs 708 crore have either been completed or are under construction in the Char Dham since 2017. “Projects worth Rs 409 crore have been proposed for Kedarnath out of which works amounting to Rs 225 crore have been completed,” the CM said. He said work on the mausoleum of Adi Guru Shankracharya at Kedarnath was in the final phase and the statue would be installed by October 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-lifts-cap-on-char-dham-pilgrims-ukhand-rolls-out-new-sop/articleshow/86791046.cms||Prashant Jha

The devotees, they said, were also aware of the situation and most of them were taking precautions on their own. Ashwani Jain from Durga Mata Mandir, near Jagraon bridge, said, “The celebrations will be of grand level, but we will follow all Covid guidelines.

We need blessings of goddess Durga so that the pandemic ends soon and we can live a normal life. The devotees will be allowed to enter with masks and they will have to maintain social distancing.”Pardeep Dhall from Durga Mata Mandir in Vikas Nagar said, “Due to the Covid fear, fewer devotees come to the temple these days. We have started decorating the premises, which will be like previous years. There will be 108 lamps in the temple. Only the dispensary in the temple is operational, while the computer centre and stitching centre for girls are closed because it is difficult to pay salaries to the staff.

The first RRTS corridor connecting Delhi to Meerut will have three stations in Delhi, including the terminal at Sarai Kale Khan.

The 82-km high-speed corridor will have a total of 25 stations, including three in Delhi at Anand Vihar, New Ashok Nagar and Sarai Kale Khan. “It is a matter of great pride that the capital is developing as a hub for transport, and in spite of the high density and restricted land availability, we are able to explore and optimise land usage without compromising vehicular movement. However, for us, pedestrian and passenger safety and convenience is accorded the highest priority and NCRTC has been advised to conduct an independent audit for pedestrian and commuter safety within and around the stations,” Gahlot said.

---||Noida||Sahibabad, Loni, Kaushambi among 10 pollution hotspots identified in Gzb||Ghaziabad: Ahead of winter, the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has identified 10 pollution hotspots in Ghaziabad. In a survey conducted recently, the sources of pollution in each of these hotspots — from industries to construction dust and garbage burning — have also been listed. Sahibabad, Loni, Kaushambi, Raj Nagar Extension and Vasundhara are some of the areas that have found mention on the UPPCB list. The district magistrate has ordered the setting up of quick response teams to keep pollution levels in check. Government agencies such as NCRTC and NHAI, which are involved in key infrastructural projects in the city, have been instructed to take measures to control dust around construction sites and install anti-smog guns.Deteriorating air quality has been a cause for concern in Ghaziabad, which has earned notoriety as one the most polluted cities in the country. “The overall air quality deteriorates considerably during winter in Ghaziabad. For the past several years, the city has been figuring on the list of the country’s most polluted areas. While this is largely due to the topography of the region, local factors are equally responsible,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.“This time, UPPCB and the Ghaziabad administration have started early preparations to ensure pollution levels remain under check. So, a survey was carried out and 10 pollution hotspots were identified along with the local sources. The survey will go a long way in keeping pollution levels under check,” he added.According to the survey, traffic congestion, industrial emission, road dust and dumping of waste are the major sources of pollution in Sahibabad.Loni, which is a hub of illegal factories engaged in retrieving e-waste and metals, is believed to be one of major contributors of pollution in the city.There are about 350 polluting industries across 11 industrial zones in Ghaziabad, many of which are in the vicinity of residential areas like Sahibabad. “We have asked all industries to mark the names of factories on the chimneys so that the polluting ones can be identified easily,” Sharma said.After the UPPCB survey, the district magistrate has passed specific instructions. “The municipal corporation has been asked to carry out mechanised road sweeping and green paving of dusty areas. Quick response teams to keep tabs on garbage burning in the open. They will also take necessary steps against the violators,” said RK Singh, the district magistrate. “To check vehicular and dust pollution, the authorities concerned have been asked to start water sprinkling in specific areas and impound diesel vehicles that are over 10 years old and petrol vehicles that are over 15,” added Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/sahibabad-loni-kaushambi-among-10-pollution-hotspots-identified-in-gzb/articleshow/86795817.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Pune||Pune: Attendance improves in schools as more students join classes||PUNE: The enthusiasm on the second day of schools’ reopening was constant as students turned out in good numbers to attend offline classes on Tuesday. The rural schools continued to dominate with maximum attendance while in urban areas it was a slow start.More government schools reopened than private institutions on Monday. Vikas Garad, an official in the State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT), said that the second day was nearly similar to the first day with the rural schools showing maximum attendance as compared to urban areas. “The reopening of schools is encouraged and not compulsory so the urban schools are taking it in their stride. Many have reopened on Monday in cities like Pune and Mumbai, but it will take some more time for them to match the rural school attendance,” he added. On the second day too, the mood was enthusiastic and the teachers kept it easy with not much stress on academics, but mainly having interactive sessions. Prakash Mete, a teacher at the civic school in Chandannagar, said, “We had about 40% attendance in our school today. The students are enjoying coming to back to school and we are ensuring that they follow all the precautions and at the same time be safe in school. As per the government plan, we will ensure that offline classes do not stop.” Samiksha Jadhav, a private school student, missed school on Monday because she had no consent from her parents. She said, “On Monday, everywhere there was only talk of school reopening. It was on the social media groups and society also. I felt bad that I had missed the first day. I am in Std IX and I insisted and convinced my parents to send me to school and promised to follow all safety norms. So I was able to make it on Tuesday and was extremely happy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/attendance-improves-in-schools-as-more-students-join-classes/articleshow/86793351.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Nashik||31 swords,12 firearms seized in Nashik range||Nashik: As many as 31 swords and 12 country-made firearms were seized by police from various parts of North Maharashtra in the past 10 days. The action was carried out by special squads under the instructions of Nashik range DIG B G Sekhar Patil. A special squad has been formed in every police unit in Nashik range to take action against people possessing weapons illegally. Acting on the instructions of the DIG, 20 swords were seized from Dhadgaon in Nandurbar district, one each from Nandurbar city and Pawarwadi in Malegaon, six from Ahmednagar and three from Dhule district. Further, the special squads also seized a country-made firearm from a person in Chopada in Jalgaon district, two in Ghoti in Nashik rural and one in Wadivarhe. Five country-made firearms were found in Dhule and another three were found in Ahmednagar. Speaking to TOI, Patil said that illegal possession of weapons with people is concerning. “Most of the times weapons are in possessions of youngsters which is not a good sign. The menace of illegal possession of weapons was observed all across Nashik. Hence it was decided to prepare special squads to gather information of people carrying weapons illegally and take action against them,” he said. “Arrests in the cases concerned have also been made by the police of the respective units. People found in possession of the arms claimed they carried it just out of fondness or for self-protection which however is illegal and attracts punishment under the law,” he added. The special squads would continue to collect information about illegal weapons and take action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/31-swords12-firearms-seized-in-nashik-range/articleshow/86788758.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Dehradun||A matter of right: Keep left-handed off high-handedness||Dehradun: Left-handed people, also known as southpaws, face a different set of challenges. To boost their morale and prevent them from being treated as outcasts, Indian left-handers club, which has over 5 lakh members across the country and was founded in 2011, was moved from Maharashtra to the city six months ago. The idea was to create awareness among those who often forced left-handers to become right-handed and also dispel the myth that left-handedness had anything to do with intelligence. “Children are often forced to use their right hands. Parents and teachers should ensure that kids are not put under any pressure. We need more awareness on the subject,” said Sandeep Vishnoi, founder of the club. Numbers culled from a recent global survey suggest that around 10-12% of the world population is left-handed, which means over 10 crore Indians fall in the category. To share their experiences, on October 2, left-handed people came together and vowed to uncover all myths. They look forward to having such a gathering in Haridwar soon. “Left-handed kids are impacted the most as they often fold under the pressure. It also scars their cognitive thinking, resulting in adult health consequences. A Bengaluru-based dentist, who recently relocated to Dehradun, shared at the gathering that she find it tough handling medical equipment designed for right-handed people,” said Vishnoi. Several others joined in. A 30-year-old Vikas Gupta, a Dehradun-based Digital marketeer, said, “Most tools and gadgets are designed for right-handed people. Even rituals are for the righties. All this needs to change.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/a-matter-of-right-keep-left-handed-off-high-handedness/articleshow/86791079.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

A five-year-old boy was the lone survivor of the attack that occurred in 2014. The bodies of the victims were discovered with 90 stab wounds in their home in Aadarsh Nagar on Diwali night seven years ago, sending shockwaves through the state. On Tuesday, the court of additional district judge (V) Ashutosh Mishra sentenced Harmeet Singh to death after finding him guilty under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 316 (causing death of quick unborn child by act amounting to culpable homicide). Singh had used a sharp-edged knife to stab to death his father Jai Singh, a trader, stepmother Kulwant Kaur, their adopted daughter Harjeet Kaur, a 27-year-old who was nine months pregnant and due to give birth the next day. Harjeet’s three-year-old daughter was also killed by Singh, but her 5-year-old son survived the attack on October 23, 2014. The family members were sleeping when they were murdered. Their bodies were discovered lying in a pool of blood by the domestic help the next morning and she alerted the neighbours. A case was registered against Singh based on the complaint made by his uncle Ajeet Singh. Advocate B D Jha, counsel for the complainant, told TOI, that 21 witnesses were produced before the court. “Singh had made 90 stab wounds and the knife used in the crime was recovered from the spot. After his arrest, Singh claimed that he was mentally unstable, but medical tests found no truth in his claims. This was a gruesome and rarest of rare crime. A DNA profiling was done and on the basis of all the evidence, the court found him guilty,” he said. Jha added that Singh has been handed a death sentence under section 302 of the IPC and 10 years each under sections 307 and 316. “The court has also slapped a cash penalty of Rs 1 lakh on him,” he said, adding that the sentences would run concurrently till the convict is hanged. The advocate said that a property dispute between the family members was the motive behind the heinous crime. “Jai Singh had two sons from his first marriage — Paras and Harmeet. While Paras lived with his mother, Harmeet had been living with his father.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/man-who-stabbed-4-family-members-90-times-gets-death-sentence/articleshow/86791133.cms||Kautilya Singh

Though they wanted to give shape to some new figurines this time, not all have materialised.Panchayat sabhas with people sitting under a tree in discussion are in high demand this season. “You can’t say how they became popular, perhaps because it was new and appealing. Some people come and ask for many sets and then we find there is a demand,’’ said R Harikrishnan, a doll maker. They had planned to make sets on Tokyo Olympics but as it was a low-key affair, they had given it up. In the trade for over six generations, Vilacheri doll makers are much sought after for dolls made of papier mache as well as mud. Tiny dolls are made of mud while those above one foot are made of papier mache for stability. As usual, miniature dolls depicting various mythological stories and those of idols are in demand this time too. They include Nava Narasimmar, Lord Narasimmah in nine avatars, Ashta Bhairavar and Saptha Kannis (nine angels) and Nava Balagargal. M Ramalingam, a doll makerrecalls that last year, when their trade took a big hit, they had sent photographs of their products through WhatsApp to those in their contact list. “That helped us to an extent as we delivered the dolls at the doorsteps, and residential associations also shared our products in our group,’’ he said.Ramalingam is relieved that doll sales have been seeing an upward trend after the easing of lockdown. Yet, there being a tinge of uncertainty they haven’t produced their original capacity this year. “Usually we start making and distributing dolls three months in advance, but after Covid struck, we started making only a month ago,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vilacheri-doll-makers-back-with-new-offerings/articleshow/86793365.cms||---

Around 23 lakh people from Kolhapur district have received their first dose and 9.33 lakh have got both jabs. The authorities consider a beneficiary due for the second dose if he or she has completed 84 days after getting their first dose. Such category of beneficiaries require to get jabbed the second time to develop immunity against the contagion. If the person delays the second dose further, then according to experts, he or she has to again get the first jab. However the policy regarding such condition is yet to be finalised. According to the data accessed from authorities, out of the 2.03 lakh beneficiaries due for the second dose, 98,054 are senior citizens. Yogesh Sale, district health officer, said, “We are trying to increase the turnout of the beneficiaries with second dose due by arranging special drives. We also appeal to the relatives of the senior citizens to get their elders to a vaccination centre for second jab, since elders suffer more and need to be hospitalised after the infection.” So far, 5.11 lakh citizens above the age of 60 have got the first jab and the target set by authorities was 4.79 lakh. The first dose turnout of senior citizens has thus surpassed the target, but a large number of senior citizens are due for the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/around-2l-due-for-second-dose-in-kolhapur-district/articleshow/86788800.cms||---

The bhoomi puja for the tank was conducted on Sunday in the presence of Manamadurai MLA Tamilarasi Ravichandran and other DMK functionaries.There are over 100 families living in Therkku Vandal, a drought-prone village where water supplied through the Cauvery scheme through taps is irregular. As theirs is an agrarian community, water from the village tank is used for agricultural activity while they depend on wells for drinking water.The copious rain this year resulted in the village tank filling up and helping them cultivate paddy and chillies. But when the tank filled up they could not conserve it. That was when panchayat president Prem Kumar decided to dig an oorani with local contribution. “It was a six-month project and took a lot of convincing before these 17 families came forward to donate a share of their land for the village’s good. At a time when people don’t want to part with even a squarefoot of land for free, what these people did is admirable’’ he said.An NGO has come forward to start the work with a funding of Rs 2.30 lakh, but Muthukumar says it will not be sufficient. Hence another Rs 2 lakh would be mobilised as public contribution and used for the oorani. Thangam, a villager, says that once the oorani is dug, the overflowing water from the village tank could be saved and used for their drinking water needs. ``This is a dream come true for the entire village, we will protect this water like gold,’’he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/villagers-pool-2-acres-of-land-to-dig-oorani-conserve-water/articleshow/86793394.cms||---

More than 100 people took part in the meeting and a total of 187 petitions were received. The meeting held at the zonal office was presided by corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan. The residents said that one of the biggest drawbacks during the Covid pandemic time was the issue of lack of access to corporation officials, to get their issues sorted out.Principal of the St Britto Matriculation school in ward number 14 gave a written petition seeking the shift the garbage bins near the school premises. Two bins near the school are always overflowing as locals throw their garbage into them. This could cause health hazards to more than 1,400 students studying in the school, he pointed out.Residents of Moovendar Nagar in Vilangudi sought proper maintenance of the street lights as only a few were working. People are forced to walk in the dark, especially during the rainy season and it is important that the roads and streets are well lit, they said.G Ramamoorthy from Bibikulam said that the non-conduct of the grievance meetings was felt by the people in ward number 5, where they were not able to get their issues rectified. “The corporation laid roads, but Indira Nagar third street and Pannian Mayandi street were left out. We have been making representations for over six months, but have not got a response,” he said. Street lights and open drains were other issues plaguing the ward, he added.The demolition of a urinal near the Varadarajulu park in Arapalayam Cross road was brought to to the attention of the corporation commissioner by A Pandi of Melaponnagaram. “The urinal was in use for over 50 years, now it is demolished and thousands of people who cross this area are urinating in the open place. This is becoming a big menace,” Pandi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corpn-besieged-by-issues-as-grievance-meet-resumes-after-2-yrs/articleshow/86793414.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Young people in India least likely to discuss personal mental health issues: Unicef report||Nagpur: A Unicef survey of almost two dozen countries found that young people (aged 15-24) in India are least likely to deal with mental health problems by sharing experiences with others and seeking support. The world body’s flagship survey, The State of the World’s Children-2021 (SOWC), mentions “among the 21 countries, India was the only exception, with 41 per cent of young people supporting the sharing option”. This is in sharp contrast to the 83 per cent median overall, who agreed it was better to deal with mental health problems by sharing experiences with others and seeking support. The rest felt that “such problems were personal and should be dealt with on one’s own”. This hesitancy in accepting mental health issues as something which needs to be addressed through counselling or speaking about, seems to be due to the perceived stigma. In SOWC, a feature titled ‘Stigma’ cites an example of school teachers’ perception about mental health. The SOWC article says, “Children do not learn to stigmatize mental health conditions on their own; many mirror behaviours they see in the world around them. For example, a cross-sectional study of 566 secondary school teachers in South India found that nearly 70 per cent believed that depression was weakness, not sickness, and that it was unpredictable but not dangerous.” Dr Suleman Virani, a Nagpur-based psychiatrist, said this attitude is slowly changing. “Things are changing but there is a huge difference between our words and actions. Just posting on social media that I support mental health is not sufficient. Suggesting others go to mental health professional is easy, but when it comes to your close member’s mental health, we tend to postpone it or avoid it,” said Dr Virani. He agreed that stigma factor is more in young people. “Parents have their assumptions that some deviant behaviour in this age may be because of growing up or hormones or generation etiquettes. But actually they ignore the core mental health issues and the illness becomes worse,” said Dr Virani. The multi-country survey of the same group also revealed that 14 per cent of Indians reported often feeling depressed or having little interest in doing things. The median percentage was 19. The Covid-19 pandemic induced lockdown, which saw closure of schools, high restrictions on physical interaction with those outside of immediate families etc has also contributed to the mental health issues in children. Unicef executive director Henrietta H Fore in the report’s foreword writes, “Children around the world have been locked out of classrooms, sequestered in their homes and robbed of the everyday joy of playing with friends – all consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic.” She added, “When we ignore the mental health of children, we undercut their capacity to learn, work, build meaningful relationships and contribute to the world. When we ignore the mental health of parents and caregivers, we fail to support them to nurture and care for their children to the best of their ability.” While these issues may have got more attention due to the pandemic, Fore writes that it’s just the tip of the iceberg. “It is an iceberg we have been ignoring for far too long, and unless we act, it will continue to have disastrous results for children and societies long after the pandemic is over,” she wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/young-people-in-india-least-likely-to-discuss-personal-mental-health-issues-unicef-report/articleshow/86793398.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Susmitha Sujith, who is the 12th accused in the case, was sent to ECB custody for three days by the principal sessions court, Ernakulam. ECB recorded her arrest on September 30 after finding that she had close links with the key accused in the case and was part of the drug selling network. ECB sought her custody and filed an application, which was approved by the court on Tuesday. Sources said that Susmitha was aware of the narcotic business carried out by other accused persons and she had supported it. Also, she had helped in the funding for purchasing the drugs and excise got the details of the financial transactions involving her bank accounts. “The accused, who is married to a person in Kottayam, is living alone in Ernakulam due to an estranged relationship with her husband. She said she is a teacher and currently takes online classes. We are checking her background and collecting more details about the financial transactions she had carried out in connection with the case,” said an ECB officer. The ECB will take her to various places in and around Ernakulam for evidence collection during the custody period. They also suspect that she had collected money from other sources for funding the narcotic business. “More people are being questioned based on the bank transaction details collected from the accused. More arrests are likely to be made in the coming days. However, we are yet to trace the suppliers of the narcotic substances which were procured from Chennai. If needed, we will seek the support of Tamil Nadu police,” said an excise officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/probe-team-gets-custody-of-accused-in-mdma-case/articleshow/86795976.cms||---

It was attended by Niranjani Akhara Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Kailashsnand Giri and seers from akharas across the country. The ceremony was followed by ‘shodashi’ rites of former Baghambari and ABAP chief Narendra Giri, performed on the 16th day of Giri’s death, which occurred on September 20 in Baghambari math. A writ petition challenging Giri's succession as mahant of the math, which was filed in the Allahabad high court on Monday, had no dampening effect on Pattabhishek ceremony, seers said. Narendra Giri had named Balbir Giri as his successor in his suicide note. On condition of anonymity, a seer from Haridwar said Giri’s appointment as the next Baghambari chief was a break from tradition. “The math's mahant should have been from the Girinama branch (madhi) as per tradition, but there have been exceptions. However, this might have raised some eyebrows,” he said. Mahamandaleshwar of Udasin Bada Akhara Swami Harichetananand said he wasn’t aware of the tradition as it belonged to Niranjani akhara. Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha said Giri was a deserving person for the post. “I have visited Bilkeshwar Mahadev temple regularly for decades, where Balbir Giri is the mahant and I believe him to be a simple man, an ascetic in true sense,” he said. Rahul Bedi, a resident of Bilkeshwar Colony, said Giri had brought about much-needed infrastructural changes in the temple. A CBI investigation is underway on Narendra Giri’s suicide. On Tuesday, a Prayagraj court extended the judicial custody of main accused Anand Giri and two others by 14 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/balbir-giri-named-in-narendra-giris-suicide-note-as-successor-anointed-mahant-of-prayagrajs-baghambari-math/articleshow/86791220.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

The Covishield maker aims to scale the paediatric trial further by including kids in the two to six years age bracket in the trial's next phase. The phase 2 and 3 paediatric trials of Covovax that kicked off in August would have a total of 920 children — 460 in 12 to 17 years, 230 in 7 to 11 years and another 230 in 2 to 6 years age groups. “According to the trial design, we expand the trial after ensuring the vaccine safety in 100 children from each group in the reverse order of age. We aim to include kids in the 2-6 years age bracket within a month, once the vaccine safety is confirmed in 100 kids in the 7 to 11 years age group,” said a trial investigator. The recombinant nanoparticle protein-based vaccine — NVX-CoV2373 — developed by the American biotechnology firm Novavax has been branded Covovax in India. The Serum Institute of India (SII), partnering with Novavax, is expected to launch Covovax for adults in India by November this year and for children early next year. Bharati Hospital and KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch in Pune are among the 10 sites where the children are undergoing advanced trials. They would be followed up for six months after being inoculated with two doses of Covovax, given 21 days apart. Confirming the development, Bharati Hospital’s medical director and chief paediatrician Sanjay Lalwani said, “Willing parents can enrol their wards by visiting the hospital’s paediatrics department.” KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch trial site chief investigator and gastroenterologist Ashish Bavadekar said, “Eligible children primarily living in Vadu in Pune’s rural parts are being enrolled for the trial.” Vadu village in Pune’s Shirur taluka is 32km away from the city. “We prefer eligible children from Vadu village as it will facilitate their monitoring post-inoculation,” Bavadekar said. SII would submit the interim trial findings on safety and immunogenicity after three months of the advanced clinical trial for licensure. According to the latest guidelines of the Drugs Controller General of India, the company can apply for a licence for the vaccine before the completion of the trials, based on the global test results. The child cohort comprises about 13 to 14 crore population. India would need about 25-26 crore doses for them, experts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sii-expands-covovax-paediatric-trial-to-include-2-6-years-old-kids/articleshow/86793448.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Patna||Bihar: Congress fields nominees against RJD in bypolls||PATNA: Cracks appeared in the opposition grand alliance (GA) in Bihar on Tuesday after the Congress announced its candidates against ally RJD from both the assembly constituencies for the bypolls scheduled on October 30. Congress fielded Atirek Kumar from Kusheshwar Asthan in Darbhanga district and Rajesh Kumar Mishra from Tarapur in Munger, after the RJD declined to spare one of the two seats for its ally. Atirek is the son of former Congress MLA Ashok Kumar, who lost the 2020 assembly polls to JD(U)'s Shashi Bhushan Hajari in Kusheshwar Asthan. Congress wanted this seat to contest again. Earlier on Sunday, the RJD fielded Ganesh Bharti from Kusheshwar Asthan and Arun Kumar Sah from Tarapur. Now, as both the GA partners have fielded their candidates from both the constituencies, it would be a ‘friendly fight’ between the Congress and the RJD against their arch rival JD(U), which had won both the seats in the last election. RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, however, said there would be no problem for his party if the Congress opted for a "friendly fight" on both the seats. "It is a byelection and the Congress too can give its candidate," Tejashwi said on Tuesday before Congress announced its candidates in Delhi. Tejashwi also said the RJD had decided to contest the bypolls from both the seats and they had conveyed the party decision to the AICC in charge of Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, a few days ago. “Our both candidates are comparatively younger than those fielded by other parties. The Congress has reposed its faith in the young leaders,” state Congress chief Madan Mohan Jha said while declaring the names of the party candidates. The bypolls for Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur seats were necessitated following the death of JD(U) MLAs Shashi Bhushan Hajari and Mewalal Choudhary, respectively. JD(U) has fielded Aman Bhushan Hajari, son of Shashi Bhushan, in Kusheshwar Asthan, and Rajiv Kumar Singh in Tarapur. Both filed their nomination papers from their respective constituencies on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cong-fields-nominees-against-rjd-in-bypolls/articleshow/86793479.cms||Madan Kumar

Nashik civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat said the swab samples from the areas bordering Nashik district are being sent for testing because of its proximity. “We are receiving about 1,500 samples on daily basis from Ahmednagar district, which is witnessing a surge in Covid cases,” said Dr Thorat, adding that there was no pressure on the laboratory. Usually, people from Sangamner find it closer to reach hospitals in Nashik than other spots in Ahmednagar. Because of the rising cases, the health agencies are conducting contact tracing of a large number of people, who are high-risk contacts of patients in the district of Ahmednagar. The testing laboratory at Nashik civil hospital is getting the samples from villages in Loni, Kopargaon, Sangamner and Akole talukas, which are around 80 km from Nashik. The reports generated here are sent to district headquarters in Ahmednagar district. The officer added that the turnaround time for the samples was about 48 hours to ensure the reports reach the respective medical officers for further and timely action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/nashik-tests-1500-swabs-daily-from-ahmednagar/articleshow/86788845.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Government report confirms second Covid vaccination-related death||PUNE: A government panel studying the Covid-19 vaccines’ adverse effects recently confirmed one death because of anaphylaxis after being administered Covaxin, but experts stressed such side-effects were extremely rare and might crop up in rare cases based on how an individual’s body reacted to a particular agent. An official from the Union ministry of health and family welfare said this was the second confirmed death in India following Covid vaccination, among the cases so far assessed by the causality assessment sub-committee at the national level. According to the government assessment of 92 reported serious Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) related to Covid-19 vaccines, the death in the latest assessment was reported as “vaccine product related reaction”. The deceased was a 47-year-old man, who took a Covaxin shot in June this year. An email was sent to Covaxin manufacturer Bharat Biotech for the company’s response to the report, but TOI did not receive a response till going to press. So far, over 10 crore doses of Covaxin have been administered. The first confirmed Covid vaccine -related death was that of a 68-year old man, who died due to anaphylaxis after being vaccinated in March. The deceased had received Covishield. According to the latest report, 18 cases of the 92 assessed report were found to have “consistent causal association to vaccination”. Of these 18 cases, 15 cases were vaccine product related reactions, including one death. Three of the 18 cases were immunization anxiety related reactions. A total of 57 cases of the 92 assessed were coincidental and not linked to vaccination, including 25 death cases, the report stated. Nine other AEFI cases were in indeterminate category, including four death cases. There were eight death cases in unclassifiable category, the report stated. A ministry of health and family welfare official told TOI, “This is the latest AEFI report based on approval by the National AEFI Committee. The earlier confirmed death following vaccination was after the individual had taken Covishield. The one in the latest report is that after Covaxin administration.” The official said such side-effects were extremely rare and might crop out in rare cases based on how an individual’s body reacted to a particular agent. “It is the same as some people tend to get gastritis after painkillers, while some others do not. This is how such side-effects play out, which is not something that is intrinsic to the vaccine, but how one’s body may react to it,” the official said. Anaphylaxis is an advanced stage of an adverse event, which could be life threatening. “Vaccinators have been trained to immediately treat those who seem to be going into an anaphylactic shock post-vaccination. Most of such people have been hospitalised and recovered. However, in some cases, people undergoing such side-effects do not report back or do not wait for the mandatory half-an-hour observation period after vaccination. It is such anaphylaxis cases that can succumb, ” the official said. Officials could not share the medical history of the deceased, though.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-report-confirms-2nd-covid-vax-related-death/articleshow/86793459.cms||Neha Madaan

In September, the average rate of Covid-19 vaccination in Maharashtra was around 7.5 lakh doses per day. “With more doses, we can easily achieve an average vaccination rate of 9-10 lakh doses per day this month,” Vyas told TOI. Explaining the process, he said all efforts must be made every day to administer doses equivalent to at least 1% of the eligible population of the district concerned. “If the eligible population of a district is 50 lakh, then 50,000 doses per day have to be administered. If the eligible population is 30 lakh, then 30,000 doses every day have to be administered. These are minimum desirable levels and can be further scaled up,” he added. In Pune district, the target population is nearly 83.66 lakh population.The district has been achieving nearly 70,000-80,000 vaccinations daily. “With a little push, we can go up to 84,000 vaccinations daily,” said Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, the assistant director (medical). Dr Vyas said the aim was to increase the pace of vaccination so that even if the number of novel coronavirus cases increased, severe illnesses and the number of deaths because of the same could be prevented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cover-1-of-targeted-population-daily-addl-cs-to-districts/articleshow/86793495.cms||Nisha Nambiar

As many as 86 child marriages have taken place in the state in 2020 and 2021 till August, as per data from the women and child development department. As per records, 45 marriages took place in the first eight months this year as against 41 last year. The highest number of marriages were reported from Wayanad district, due to the cohabitation culture among tribespeople, said officials. In Wayanad, 27 child marriages happened last year and it rose to 36 in the first eight months this year. Kottayam, Idukki, Ernakulam, Malappuram, Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur also witnessed child marriages in single digits. In Ernakulam, two child marriages happened this year and both were reported from migrant families and the marriage function was in other states, said child protection officials. “The families are staying in Ernakulam. But the weddings took place in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. We came to know about it when they returned,” said an official of the district child protection unit. Covid could be one of the reasons for the rise in child marriages as family elders think that cost-effective marriages can be conducted during the pandemic, said officials. “We get information from the field that many parents think that since the girl child is attending online classes, it is better to get her married. The government gives Rs 2,000 as aid for education of each child from poor families. There are 160 such beneficiaries in Malappuram. The child’s father may be dead or alcoholic or may have abandoned the family. In majority of the cases, the child’s mother was married off at an early age and deprived of higher education. Though she is healthy, lack of education is a hindrance to secure a job. Patriarchy is also a reason,” says Fazal Pullat, child protection officer in Malappuram. When a minor girl is married off, Pocso case is registered against her husband and parents under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, which invites three years of imprisonment. Child welfare committees attend to such cases. “What worries us most is that child marriages happen in families of guest workers who stay here. The marriage function is conducted in their respective states. The case of a 11-year-old girl married off to a 16-year-old boy came to our notice this month. Parents of both children are willing to get them married. In some cases, teenagers enter into a relationship and consummate their love even before the girl turns 18 years. This forces the parents to get them married off at the earliest,” says Bitty K Joseph, Ernakulam CWC chairperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-sees-rise-in-child-marriages-during-pandemic/articleshow/86796030.cms||T C Sreemol

The district administration has directed temple committees to make arrangements through respective taluk health officers to set up vaccination centres in the temple premises for those devotees who arrive without receiving the vaccine. Deputy commissioner Dr KV Rajendra said temples should organise Dasara in a very simple manner and ensure the celebrations do not lead to an increase in the Covid-19 test positivity rate in the district. “Devotees should be allowed to enter temples only if they show the vaccination certificate for both doses. Health department will arrange vaccine centres in temple premises. Public should not gather in large numbers during the festival,” he said, adding that permission will not be given for processions and public gatherings during the festival. “All programmes that violate social distancing have been banned. Temple committees should obtain permission from their respective local bodies. Cultural programmes can be organised by restricting the entry of people by 50% of the seating capacity of auditoriums. Festival committees should arrange live transmission through various media for the convenience of people. Similarly, temples should place digital display screens so that devotees may watch rituals and programmes from a distance,” the DC said. Tiger dance, which is closely associated with the Navaratri festival in the coastal district, is allowed with riders. The DC said tiger dance troupes should ensure social distancing while performing in temples and public places. “Official teams will be deployed in temple premises to monitor violations. Penalty will be levied on those who violate Covid appropriate behaviour. Further action will also be taken under the Karnataka Disaster Management Act, Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act and the IPC sections,” he warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/vax-certificate-must-for-devotees-entering-temples-during-dasara/articleshow/86791351.cms||---

While unlocking has resulted in the power demand increasing again, Delhi’s weather has also had a major role to play. In July 2021, Delhi’s peak power demand was more than the peak power demand of July 2020, and also that of July 2019 on 70% (21 days) and 37% (11 days) of the corresponding days, respectively. On July 2, Delhi’s peak power demand had clocked this season’s highest of 7,323 MW, making 2021 only the third year that it had crossed the 7,000 MW-mark. In 2018, the peak power demand had crossed the 7,000 MW-mark for the first time, clocking 7,016 MW. In 2019, it peaked at 7,409 MW. In 2020, however, Delhi’s season’s highest peak power demand only clocked 6,314 MW. In August 2021, Delhi’s peak power demand was more than that of August 2020 and also August 2019 on 70% (21 days) and 40% (12 days) of the corresponding days, respectively. The peak power demand of August 2021 was also the highest when compared with the peak power demands recorded in the entire August 2020 and 2019 in absolute terms, sources say. In August 2021, it was 6,550 MW (August 17), whereas it was 5,716 MW (August 4) in 2020 and 6,472 MW (August 29) in 2019. In September 2021, when Delhi witnessed record rainfall, the peak power demand was clocked at 5,548 MW (September 7), whereas it was 6,231 MW in 2020 and 6,626 MW in 2019. In September 2021, Delhi’s peak power demand was more than the peak power demand of September 2020, and also that of September 2019 on 20% (6 days) and 27% (8 days) of the corresponding days, respectively. A spokesperson of BSES discoms said they were fully geared up and sourcing adequate electricity to meet the power demand of not only domestic consumers but also essential services, such as hospitals, labs, quarantine centres and vaccination centres without compromising on the safety of its employees. “Apart from a robust distribution network and accurate load-forecasting, BSES discoms have also made proper arrangement, including long-term PPAs and banking, to meet the electricity demands of Delhi consumers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/peak-power-demand-this-monsoon-season-was-53-higher-than-last-year/articleshow/86793635.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Bhopal||PM Modi should immediately sack Union min Mishra: Diggy||Bhopal: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Tuesday sought removal of Union minister of state Ajay Mishra from the Narendra Modi cabinet. Speaking to reporters here on the Lakhimpur Khedi incident and detention of AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, the former chief minister said, “The Lakhimpur video which is really horrifying. I am surprised that those who crushed peaceful demonstrators under wheels have not been arrested.” He said that FIR may have been lodged but there is still no arrest. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweets even if anyonehurts a finger. But when four farmers have been crushed brutally by a jeep , there is not a single tweet. I condemn this because it has revealed his anti-farmer mentality,” Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh alleged. He said that AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi just wanted to meet the families of the victims of Lakhimpur. “What does Priyanka Gandhi want? She just wants to meet the families of victims and share their pain. If you want that the situation there remains under control, then let three to four police personneltake her to the victims, so that the meeting could be held. She has been under house arrest for 30 to 32 hours without any reason, ” Digvijaya Singh said. Singh urged the BJP government to clarify on what ground Priyanka Gandhi has been detained. “Have they registered a case against her. She has been unconstitutionally stopped and detained. She should be released. Priyanka has asked the right question from the Prime Minister,” he said. “Remove Ajay Mishra who gives hate speeches. In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Khattar is instigating violence. He is asking the youth to pick up lathis. He says if you go to jail, then you become a leader. This kind of mentality shows that fascist organsiation like RSS has decided to crush the farmers’ movement,” Digvijaya alleged. The former chief minister said that Congress party will not tolerate aggression against farmers. “Congress will stand with farmers. We also stand in support of our national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pm-modi-should-immediately-sack-union-min-mishra-diggy/articleshow/86793529.cms||---

On Monday evening, family members found him hanging from a ceiling fan at his residence in Shastrinagar locality under Nauchandi police station here and informed police. However, seeing her husband hanging, the 29-year-old wife of the victim and the mother of a seven-month-old daughter allegedly made a bid on her life by slashing her neck and wrist. Police said that they had taken into account the victim’s kin version, but they were “trying to find out the exact reason that drove the victim and his wife to take such extreme steps, because they are well-known in social circles and have bureaucratic connections, too. And thus, the matter has become the talk of the town”. Police said Amit Bansal, an engineer by education, turned out to be one of the city’s leading young businessmen, owning a firm that manufactures and sells ceilings. In 2016, Bansal married Pinky, a fashion designer, and the couple has a daughter who turned seven-month-old in September. They were happily married, said police, which is also evident from their social media accounts, where they would share photographs of their vacations very often. Thus, knowing the reasons that turned their world upside down is crucial to the case, said police. Meanwhile, Pinky is battling for her life in a hospital. Superintendent of police (city) Vineet Bhatnagar said, “According to the family, Amit was happily married. Besides, he also was not under any apparent financial distress. We are trying to find out what exactly led to this. Things will be clear once Pinky can speak.” The SP, however, added that from the CCTV footage, “it is evident that Amit went to the room and made a rope by cutting cloth to make a rope and hanged himself. We are trying to get hold of their phones and other evidence to get a clear picture behind the horrible incident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meerut-bizman-31-hangs-self-after-altercation-with-wife-who-too-tries-to-end-her-life-after-seeing-his-body/articleshow/86788951.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Mumbai||Covovax trial starts for 7-11 year kids, to add 2-6 year olds in mth||After ensuring vaccine safety in adolescents, the Serum Institute of India (SII) has expanded Covovax’s trial to children between seven and 11 years across 10 sites in India, including Mumbai and Pune. The Covishield-maker aims to scale the paediatric trial further by including kids in the two to six years age bracket in the next phase. The paediatric trials of Covovax that kicked off in August will have a total of 920 children — 460 between 12 and 17 years, 230 between 7 and 11 years and another 230 between two and six years. “As per the trial design, we expand the trial after ensuring vaccine safety in 100 children from each group in the reverse order of age. We aim to include kids in the 2-6 age bracket within a month, once the vaccine safety is confirmed in 100 kids in the 7 to 11 age group,” said a trial investigator. The recombinant nanoparticle protein-based vaccine — NVX-CoV2373 — developed by the American biotechnology firm Novavax has been branded Covovax in India. SII, partnering with Novavax, is expected to launch Covovax for adults in India by November this year and for children early next year. B Y L Nair Hospital in Mumbai, and Bharati Hospital and KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch in Pune are among the 10 sites where the children are undergoing advanced trials. They would be followed up for six months after inoculation with two doses of Covovax, given 21 days apart. Bharati Hospital’s medical director and chief paediatrician Sanjay Lalwani said: “Willing parents can enrol their ward by visiting the hospital’s paediatrics department.” KEM Hospital’s Vadu branch trial site chief investigator and gastroenterologist Ashish Bavadekar said: “Eligible children primarily living in Vadu in Pune’s rural parts are being enrolled for the trial." Vadu village in Pune’s Shirur taluka is 32km from the city. “We prefer eligible children from Vadu village as this will facilitate their monitoring post-inoculation,” said Bavadekar. SII would submit the interim trial findings on safety and immunogenicity after three months of the advanced clinical trial for licencing. According to the latest guidelines of the DCGI, the company can apply for a licence for the vaccine before the completion of the trials, based on the global test results. The child cohort comprises about 13 to 14 crore population. India would need about 25-26 crore doses for them, experts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covovax-trial-starts-for-7-11-yr-kids-to-add-2-6-yr-olds-in-mth/articleshow/86793605.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Speaking on the occasion, Jagan said many reports have revealed that almost 23 per cent of young girls in the country stay away from schools and colleges during menstruation. In order to change this, the state government is taking measures right from improving toilets in all government institutions under Nadu-Nedu initiative to launching Swechha programme. He said under the Swechha initiative, awareness on menstruation will be spread among the students studying in classes 7 to 12 once a month by women teachers and women cops. Apart from this, awareness on Disha App and Disha Act will also be created by women police, and joint collector (Aasara) will be monitoring the orientation programmes. A woman teacher will be appointed as a nodal officer. The state government will provide quality sanitary napkins to over 10 lakh students studying in classes 7 to 12, at a cost of Rs 32 crore. Each girl student will receive 120 napkins every year. The students will also be taught on proper disposal of sanitary pads in places where separate dustbins and 6,417 incinerators have been set up under clean AP programme. The chief minister said the state is leading in women empowerment. Sanitary napkins will be sold at Cheyutha shops at affordable rates. Later, Jagan released a poster on Swechha programme.

---||India||As apex court questions stir logic, kisan outfit pulls out||NEW DELHI: A day after Supreme Court questioned farmers over rationale behind continuing protests when the matter is sub-judice, the petitioner Kisan Mahapanchayat on Tuesday withdrew its protest till October 21 — the next date of hearing — even as the main farmers’ body opposing the farm laws, Samyukta Kisan Morcha, hardened its stand with an intent to further intensify the agitation. “In the context of the SC’s observation, we have decided to suspend our protest till October 21. The observation gave us a ray of hope that someone (in judiciary) would hear our points,” said Rampal Jat, president of the Rajasthan-based outfit. The group had been protesting at Jantar Mantar since July 5 even as it did not have permission to do so. Its members used to be detained briefly every day before they came back again at the protest site the next day following a drill of symbolic protest. It was this group’s petition which saw the SC asking farmers the reason for protests when none of the contentious farm laws were in force since January. The SKM, however, did not appear to relent. It has, in fact, intensified its protests. “The farmer movement is gaining greater momentum and intensity in states like Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, West Bengal. The spontaneous protests from numerous places to express outrage and resistance against the Lakhimpur Kheri massacre of farmers showcases this,” said the Morcha in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-apex-court-questions-stir-logic-kisan-outfit-pulls-out/articleshow/86798359.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Kappan and three others were arrested at Mathura on October 5 last year when they were on their way to a village in Hathras to meet the family members of a dalit girl who had died after being gang-raped. “He was arrested even before reaching the spot... We are fighting for a free media. There should be no curbs on the media if someone is going to a spot to report,” said PCI president Umakant Lakhera. “Spot and investigative reporting is dying day by day. We are appealing to the highest judiciary of the country to release Kappan and to quash the charges against him,” he added. Members of the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ), PCI and the Delhi Union of Journalists (DUJ) joined the protest. DUJ general secretary Sujata Madhok said, “…it has been one year since the jailing of Kappan and others… The judiciary must take action. You cannot indefinitely jail people.” The KUWJ also held a similar protest in front of the General Post Office in Thiruvananthapuram. Opposition leader VD Satheesan, addressing the protesters, said the UP government was muzzling the press freedom by slapping fake cases against journalists. Meanwhile, family members and friends of Atiqur Rahman of the Campus Front of India, who was arrested along with Kappan, addressed the media at PCI in Delhi. Rahman’s wife Sanjeeda said that her husband needs immediate medical assistance. Delhi University professor Apoorvanand alleged that the charges filed against the four accused are fabricated. Rajya Sabha MP L Hanumanthaiah said, “I have come here from Bengaluru in support of the people who have been in jail without trial even after one year...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/protests-held-seeking-kappans-release/articleshow/86796149.cms||---

However, as they were sealing the hospital on Tuesday afternoon, the health department officials had to face the ire of the family members of the patients lying out in the open. With the number of dengue patients crossing the 4,800 mark since August, and all government hospitals running out of beds, the kin of patients -- mostly children and elderly -- had little option. They asked the health official to provide them with an alternative. The videos of the incident were widely shared on social media. Later, the patients were taken to government health centres. With four more deaths in the last 24 hours, the toll in Firozabad district -- the hub of UP’s dengue outbreak -- touched 265 on Tuesday. Of these, 228 were children. However, the chief medical officer claimed that there were 63 deaths due to dengue-like symptoms. According to sources, when the rooms of the house, from where the health centre was being operated, were fully occupied, arrangements were made for treatment at the footpath on service lane of National Highway-2, which passes in front of the nursing home. On Tuesday, the staffers of the nursing home were seen providing treatment to 32 patients lying on the footpath. A local resident said, “Every house in the locality has at least one bed-ridden patient suffering viral fever and dengue-like symptoms. Six people have died in the last one week. Doctors are not available at government health centers. Private centers are fully occupied. People have been reaching private centers with cots and mattresses to get treatment. The doctor had a license to operate a clinic but for the last one month, he had converted it into a nursing home.” When contacted, chief medical officer (CMO) of Firozabad district, Dr Dinesh Kumar Premi, said, “The nursing home has been sealed. A committee headed by an additional chief medical officer is investigating the entire matter. All the patients have been transferred to government centers. On the basis of the probe report, suitable action will be taken against the doctor.” “There are 64 active camps in the district and 5,000 people, including those who have fever, are undergoing treatment there,” the CMO said. Sources also told TOI that at least 25,000 people in the district are estimated to be bedridden with fever at home or in private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/private-hospital-in-firozabad-found-treating-patients-on-pavement-of-national-highway-sealed/articleshow/86789013.cms||Deepak Lavania

As of September 26, the district registered 669 dengue cases which amount to 29 per cent cases of Andhra Pradesh (2,318 cases). As many as 755 patients were diagnosed with malaria – which is equivalent to 65 percent cases of the state (1163 cases). When it comes to chikungunya, the district witnessed 26 cases out of the 33 cases in Andhra Pradesh. Even in the last one week, between September 20 and 26, the trend remained the same. Of the 18 malaria cases in Andhra Pradesh in this period, Visakhapatnam alone recorded 11 cases. Of the 225 dengue cases, 56 cases emerged from Visakhapatnam. There has been a spurt in the case numbers this year in Ananthagiri, Araku, Paderu, Chintapalli, Hukumpeta and Dumbriguda mandals in the tribal belt and Rolugunta, Kasimkota, Devarapalli and Butchayyapeta mandals in the rural parts of the district apart from Vizag city. As per the official statistics, the areas falling into the limits of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation are accounting for the majority of the cases of the district. The district officials are conducting various awareness programmes and strictly implementing the vector-borne disease control programme. The GVMC has identified vulnerable areas and taking special measures in these colonies. Right from supplying medicines and fogging to anti-larval operations and door-to-door screening, we are taking all the preventive measures to curtail the growth of mosquitoes, said the GVMC health officials. According to experts, urbanisation has been providing thriving larval habitats for the mosquito vectors – right from artificial containers, tyres and changing lifestyle to crowded human population and unplanned urbanization.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/no-let-up-in-malaria-dengue-cases-in-vizag/articleshow/86791373.cms||---

Under the programme, the state government along with the C40 Cities Network will focus on bringing out leadership qualities in women so that stage can be set for the next generation of climate leaders. Women will get a chance to develop and implement action to accelerate their climate projects, and develop strategies to achieve the overall target of sustainable development goals. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray called on women to take part in this initiative and protect the environment from the effects of changing climate. “Women have always played an essential role in bringing revolutionary changes in society. Hence, we have initiated the international mentorship programme to groom women leaders at the forefront of this green revolution,” the minister said. Highlighting that the Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC) is focusing on making more urban forest thickets, Thackeray said it must be ensured that citizens are involved in planting native trees, and cool the neighbourhoods. He further announced that 1,900 electric buses will be added to the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) fleet by 2023. At present, 386 electric buses are plying in the megacity. Giving more information on the Women4Climate programme, officials said climate leaders will be selected through the city’s mentorship programme that will seek to put women mentees under the guidance of a mentor. “The programme will also empower them with the necessary tools and assistance. It will also arrange monthly webinars where mentees from different cities come together to learn about each other’s initiatives, share their achievements and ideas for improvements. Women4Climate will provide holistic support to further develop mentees' climate knowledge and leadership skills,” they added. Application for the 10-month-long programme can be filled on the W4C.org website. The last date of application is October 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-govt-brings-women-to-forefront-of-climate-change-fight/articleshow/86793615.cms||Manka Behl

Maharashtra reported 2,401 cases and 39 deaths on Tuesday. New cases in Mumbai rose to 427 after dipping to 339 the previous day. Daily deaths remained constant at two, with the overall toll at 16,127 so far. Meanwhile, neighbouring Thane registered the highest daily Covid positivity rate on Monday since the first week of August. Thane recorded a 4% test positivity rate as 61 patients tested positive of the total 1521 tests done. “Our daily test positivity rate has been steady around 1.3% and there are no clusters except for the medical students testing positive at KEM Hospital,” said a BMC official. “All the affected students had attended a get-together that led to the spread.” The number of active cases and those under home quarantine has been steadily increasing, but BMC officials believe the rise in cases is not alarming yet. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government task force on Covid-19, said that the focus right now should be on vaccination and reduction in the Covid-19 deaths to zero. “We have to ensure vaccination continues at a hectic pace. We should be able to identify areas and localities where vaccination hasn’t picked up and carry out special drives,” he said. Joshi said the other important thing is to ensure that people don’t give up Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Covid is still around. Covid deaths are still happening. We cannot afford to be complacent,” he said. The primary focus of the health machinery should be to ensure Covid deaths are zero, Dr Joshi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cases-in-city-remain-over-400-deaths-steady-at-2/articleshow/86793733.cms||---
---||Goa||SAFF CUP: Under pressure, India look to make up for lost points against Sri Lanka||Igor Stimac is ignoring all the chatter on social media and instead remains focused on India’s next clash against Sri Lanka in the SAFF Championship at the National Stadium in Male on Thursday. India’s opening round draw against Bangladesh, ranked 82 places below them and playing 38 minutes with a player less, has added to the pressure on the national coach. Under the Croatian, India have logged just three wins from 17 matches. They still have three games to make amends and make it to the final, but calls for the coach’s ouster have grown louder on social media. “We should not care about what is being said on social media,” Stimac said during the pre-match media interaction on Wednesday. “Social media will never decide who will play in the Indian team, and I hope, they will not decide who will be the coach or who will be sacked. They can write whatever they like. It's an open network. Serious people shouldn't care about social media.” What everyone says about Indian football right now is not encouraging. India’s failure to win matches even against weaker opponents is a cause for concern. Stimac agreed they had themselves to blame for their failure against Bangladesh and hinted at changes in the starting XI after having a final look at the condition of the players. “We analysed the game and were not happy with the final result. We are two points behind at this stage. We have to do everything on the pitch to win the (next) game. “We need to be better defensively. If we can’t score the second goal, we need to make sure that we don’t concede a goal. Man-marking is extremely necessary when you play serious football. We just cannot keep giving the balls away,” said Stimac. Sri Lanka have lost both their matches against Bangladesh (0-1) and Nepal (2-3) but have made life difficult for their opponents. “There will be chances and we need to be clever,” said Stimac. “Sri Lanka played their hearts out in the two games and could have had two points. That’s football life. We need to pick a deserving win and wait for the third game.” India need all three points against Sri Lanka, the lowest-ranked team in the competition at 205, almost 100 places below India. Any other result and social media will have a field day, again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/saff-cup-under-pressure-india-look-to-make-up-for-lost-points-against-sri-lanka/articleshow/86819789.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Accidents: Saviours to get cash, not cop fuss||Ahmedabad: Soon, people who go out of their way to help accident victims won’t have to endure inconvenient dealings with police. From October 15, the state government will implement a scheme to grant the award of Good Samaritans to those whose interventions save accident victims. The state government has received directives to this effect from the Centre. In line with the directives, the state government will give a cash award of Rs 5,000 and a certificate of Good Samaritan to those who save lives by giving immediate assistance and taking the victim to a hospital or a trauma care centre. The Good Samaritan title will be given to those who ensure that accident victims with serious injuries get medical attention in the ‘golden hour’ from the moment of a road crash. The injuries in question relate to brain or spinal cord, or those which warrant a major surgery, or at least three days of hospitalization. Amit Khatri, a traffic expert, said: “So far, not many have been coming forward to help accident victims as police procedures become a harassment.” He added: “But with this award, there is a possibility of many people helping accident victims.” He said this was a good move by the government to not only help accident victims but also reward the saviours. An official in the state transport department said: “The government is preparing the final guidelines for the award. The guidelines state that the ‘golden hour’ means the time period lasting one hour following a traumatic injury.” The official added: “The guidelines say that if more than one person is involved in saving the victim, the amount is to be equally divided among them.” However, the official said, in case multiple people get injured, each person involved in taking the victims to hospital will be given Rs 5,000. Officials in the transport department said that three Good Samaritan awardees will be considered for national honours. Ten India-level awardees will receive Rs 1 lakh each. The guidelines say: “After verifying details from the doctor concerned, police shall provide an acknowledgment to such Good Samaritans on the official letter pad.” The Good Samaritan’s name, mobile number, and address will be mentioned in the acknowledgment. As will be the details about the accident, such as place, date, and time. Police will note the role the Good Samaritan has played in saving the life of the victim. The copy of the acknowledgement will be sent by the police station concerned to the appraisal committee formed at the district level under the district magistrate. According to the guidelines, in case a Good Samaritan takes the victim to a hospital directly, the hospital shall provide all the details to the relevant police station. The guidelines state that the appraisal committee will comprise the district magistrate, the district’s chief medical officer, the regional transport officer, and the superintendent of police. The state-level monitoring committee will be under the principal secretary (home). The members will be the commissioner (health) and the additional director general of police (traffic). The commissioner (transport) will be the member secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/accidents-saviours-to-get-cash-not-cop-fuss/articleshow/86793956.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

While farmers -- and later thousands of others -- shared a video of a car crushing protesters in its path, those opposed to them posted videos of BJP men being beaten up. Farmer leaders who had congregated in the western UP district soon after the mayhem have conceded "there was retaliation" after a convoy of SUVs plowed through a marching band of cultivators. One of them had told TOI on record that it was "two BJP men and not three that had been killed". TOI hasn't been able to independently establish the veracity of any of the videos. In the 29-second video first shared by farmers from the site of the clash, a group of men walks slowly with black flags and banners on a road next to green fields as a siren draws near. A few men turn back and jump aside — a 'VIP' car is speeding ahead into the group of protesters — but most don’t realise what’s coming from behind. An elderly man, later said to be one Nachattar Singh, 63, and a few others are thrown up and then run over by the speeding vehicle, while another follows closely. “We have video evidence that clearly shows this was deliberate. That is what happened. I was there,” Gurpej Singh, a farmer, told TOI. .@narendramodi जी आपकी सरकार ने बग़ैर किसी ऑर्डर और FIR के मुझे पिछले 28 घंटे से हिरासत में रखा है।अन्नदाता को कु… https://t.co/pmChkU9qOW— Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (@priyankagandhi) 1633402127000The video, purported to be from Lakhimpur Kheri, was seen by lakhs on Twitter and shared by thousands, including BJP MP Varun Gandhi and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. “This video of Lakhimpur Kheri farmers being crushed deliberately shakes one to the core. Police should take cognizance and arrest those seen in the car and those associated with them,” Varun Gandhi tweeted on Tuesday. Priyanka, while sharing the video, tweeted, “The individuals killing those who provide us with food have not been arrested. Why?” In another video the farmers shared, a man gets out of a Thar and starts running while a flurry of men, purportedly farmers, are scrambling in the background. Farmers said that was after the cars had run some of them over. To counter the Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni’s repeated statements that his son Ashish was not at the site where the killings took place and he would resign if anyone proved otherwise, the farmers shared a video in which a man is seen loading a pistol and walking ahead, surrounded by a group of men. That, farmers said, was Ashish leaving the venue. TOI could not verify the claim. In a video from the other side, a few men, purportedly farmers, are seen trying to turn a vehicle over as others beat up a man on his head while he's lying on the ground, unable to move. In another, a man behind a camera asks a bleeding man, “Teni sent you to kill Sikhs?” Later identified as Shyam Sundar, a BJP worker from Nishad, he replies, “Teni did send me. See the crowds and manage them, he said.” When asked if he was asked to kill people in a staged accident, he looks around and starts pleading, “Dada, dada, dada.” Sundar died later. Gagan Chattha, another protester who was present there that day, told TOI, “He (Sundar) was not critical. We have a photo in which he is walking with the police after we handed him over.” Sundar’s father Balakram, however, said Sundar was “taken back from police custody and beaten to death with sticks and swords by farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/chilling-videos-emerge-from-violence-site-as-farmers-bjp-trade-charges/articleshow/86789066.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The two lawyers were in such tearing hurry that they misspelt ‘Lakhimpur Kheri’ twice in their four-paragraph letters, once referring to it as ‘Kheeri’ in one instance and ‘Khiri’ in another. Also, their letter appeared unfathomable at places. “The human rights violation in a democratic country like India coupled with the police excesses at the end of the government of UP is the scope, scale and ambit of the present communication replict (sic) with breath of fundamental right of the petitioners who are practicing advocates of the Supreme Court,” read one paragraph. Requesting the CJI to treat the letter as a PIL, the advocate duo said, “The agitating farmers have been peaceful in their protest towards the justiceability of their just demands and claims for the reasonable deal for the better ment of lot agricultural communities struggling for their livelihood within the meaning of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. They are no on the road representing the multitude of the masses of the country beset in the ongoing Corona crisis without any self-interest.” The CJI’s office said it has not received the letter yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-lawyers-write-to-cji-seek-cbi-probe-in-khiri-kheeri-case/articleshow/86798385.cms||---

NMC will spend Rs16 crore for the purpose, said standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar. TOI has been regularly highlighting the pathetic condition of tar roads across the city. Bhoyar said NMC’s public works department has been instructed to issue tenders for re-carpeting the bad roads. As per the proposal, two tar roads each were selected in Laxmi Nagar zone, Mangalwari zone, Hanuman Nagar, Dhantoli and Gandhibagh. Similarly, one road each will be re-carpeted under Dharampeth zone, Satranjipura, Lakadganj zone, Ashi Nagar and Nehru Nagar. Bhoyar told TOI the 15 roads selected for complete re-carpeting include Pratap Nagar Chowk to Orange City Street, Mangalmurti Chowk to Jaitala Bus stop, Shraddhanand Peth Chowk to VNIT Bajaj Nagar to Ram Nagar area, Omkar Nagar to Beltarodi, Krida Chowk to Apsara Chowk, Narendra Nagar flyover to Wardha Road, Besa T-Point to Shatabdi Chowk, Bidipeth to Shahenshah Chowk to Ring Road, Ganesh Chowk to Central Avenue (Haj House) to Shaukar Ali Chowk to Central Avenue, Manipura Chowk to Lakdi Pul Ayachit Mandir Bus stand, Dahi Bazaar Railway overbridge to Mehdibagh railway overbridge, Kumbhar Toli to Vaishnav Devi Chowk Juna Bagadganj Road, Automotive Chowk to Mohammed Rafi Chowk to Samparn Hospital, Jaripatka Police station to Nara village bus stop and Hotel Ashoka to Kamptee Road (Mount Road) to Guman Building to Gol Bazar Chowk (Link road). According to him, the 15 roads have not been re-carpeted for over a decade now, and all these roads are in very bad shape. In all these years, the NMC’s hotmix department either carried out pothole repair work or patchwork. The panel also gave administrative approval to eight other proposals pertaining to improving civic amenities, including construction of cement roads, laying storm water network and development of a playground. The administration will spend Rs4.63 crore on the works. It also gave approval to extend the contract of 96 civic cops for a period of 11 months. The NMC will spend Rs2.74 crore for their payments for the period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rs-16cr-sanctioned-for-re-carpeting-15-bad-roads/articleshow/86793761.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘29% dip in non-Covid cases notified in 2020, deaths up 12%’||MUMBAI: Notification of major diseases such as tuberculosis, diabetes, hypertension and HIV saw a 29% drop in the city in 2020 as pandemic hit, underlining the extent to which diagnosis of non-Covid ailments was crippled. During the period, deaths due to non-Covid illnesses increased 12%. In the absence of information on ‘causes of death’ though, the BMC is unable to decipher which diseases exactly caused the excess non-Covid deaths. NGO Praja Foundation that released its white paper on the ‘State of Health in Mumbai’ on Tuesday expressed concern that the corporation was in the dark about details of non-Covid deaths. The report stated there was a 24% increase in total registered deaths in 2020 (1,12,906) over 2019 (91,223) in Mumbai. If the 11,116 deaths due to Covid are excluded, there’s still a 12% jump in non-Covid mortality, which remains unexplained. “Covid accounted for only 10% deaths in 2020. But, due to the absence of cause of death (CoD) data since January 2020, the BMC doesn’t have an exact breakup of the diseases that caused the remaining 90% non-Covid deaths,” said Milind Mhaske, director, Praja Foundation. Typically, cardiovascular diseases and strokes account for the biggest share of all-cause deaths in Mumbai followed by diabetes, cancer and respiratory diseases. However, due to lack of CoD data for 2020, there is no way to find out whether deaths due to the diseases rose or dipped, he said. Data does show that fewer people with these ailments got diagnosed in the city last year. The Praja report stated new registrations for diabetes and hypertension dropped 29% and 24% in 2020 over the previous year, while that for tuberculosis fell 28%. The steepest drop was seen in dengue cases at 78%, which the civic body has often attributed to the lockdown. Detection of new HIV cases too dived 46%. The BMC was in possession of CoD data till the birth and death registrations were transferred to the Civil Registration System (CRS) of the Centre in January 2016. Thereafter, it claimed to no longer have access to CoD data. “Without real-time CoD data, how can the corporation plan interventions,” said Mangesh Pednekar, director, Healis Sekhsaria Institute for Public Health. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC executive health officer, said they have written to the Centre through the state asking for access to the CoD data. Mhaske said several states have started parallel CoD systems. Praja officials said BMC continues to grapple with 31% vacant posts in public health department and medical colleges. “Hiring manpower overnight, which we saw in the pandemic, cannot be an emergency activity,” Pednekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-29-dip-in-non-covid-cases-notified-in-20-deaths-up-12/articleshow/86793787.cms||---
---||Jaipur||RERA takes custody of Alwar home project from developer||JAIPUR: In a first, the Rajasthan Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) has taken possession of a residential project from a developer at Tijara in Alwar after a promoter failed to meet the completion deadline. After the promoter, Sarv Awas, failed to complete the project Aravali Gardens within the deadline; the move was taken by the authority. The project was registered on November 27, 2013 and the deadline to construct the project was October 25, 2020. RERA registrar Ramesh Chand Sharma said as per the proposal, a total of 905 flats were proposed to be constructed in six blocks out of which 650 residents had booked the apartments. “Only the first floor has been constructed in so many years. Notices were issued after receiving complaints of those who booked. Action was taken after promoter failed to file a reply. RERA will either auction the property to repay the investors or complete the project after hiring a third party as per the clause,” he said. On December 2019, RERA directed the developer to return the booking amount of the investors after adding 10.75 % interest. But, the developer failed to adhere to the directions. Following this, the RERA had written a letter to the district collector. “Despite reminders the developer did not give a reply. On January 23, 2020, the registration of the project was cancelled and RERA seized the accounts,” said the official. An official said for close monitoring of projects, RERA has also issued notices to approximately 415 developers in the state for not submitting quarterly progress reports. According to the mandatory provision, a promoter has to upload updates on the RERA website for the project at the end of each quarter on apartments/flats, status update of each building. A senior official at RERA said, “After issuing the notices, the developers will be given time to submit their reply in October. Registration will be cancelled if the reply is dissatisfactory.” After the enactment and implementation of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, a total of 1,635 projects have been registered under RERA across the state. “Extension has been provided to 561 projects in the state,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rera-takes-custody-of-alwar-home-project-from-developer/articleshow/86796193.cms||---

Inaugurating the rating system of the redressal cell and reviewing the functioning of the cell, he said that there should be accurate and correct decisions on the petitions and the petitioners should be informed of the final result. The petitioners are approaching because they have no other solution, and for the same reason, they should be dealt with compassion. The chief minister said that an officer will be appointed in each office for the complaint redressal system and the officer’s name will be displayed prominently in the office. The complainants approaching that office should be able to contact him, and the department heads should conduct a review of such officials once in a month, he said. Vijayan further added that financial aid from the chief minister’s distress relief fund is not a permanent solution to the aggrieved, and it should be disbursed in a time-bound manner. If all the required documents are enclosed, the financial aid should be disbursed within 100 hours, he said. He added that all petitions received at the village office should be transferred to the taluk office within three days. Principal secretary (revenue) has been given the responsibility to dispose of the pending petitions in the cell on a war-footing, he said. The rating system is being instituted to know if the public are satisfied about the services offered by the cell and to compile opinions from the public, the CM said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/resolve-redressal-cell-plaints-in-15-days-cm/articleshow/86796195.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As per the National Building Code, one dispensary is needed per 15,000 population in urban areas, the report stated. In that context, Mumbai should have 858. “But we have only 199 public dispensaries, which include both government and BMC,” said Yogesh Mishra of Praja. Wards K-W, P-S, R-S and T have only one for over 1 lakh population. Mishra said up to 12% of Mumbai’s Rs 39,000 crore budget is allotted for health, yet it is neglected. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC executive health officer, said BMC’s 15 14-hour dispensaries (rest open for 5-8 hours) work under a PPP model. “We plan to scale it up,” she said.

---||Vijayawada||After Covid gap, Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to go to public in Ongole||AMARAVATI: Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy will release the second spell of financial assistance under YSR Asara scheme to women self-help groups at PVR High School in Ongole on Thursday. The chief minister will also address a public meeting during the visit. Jagan Mohan Reddy did not campaign in Tirupati Lok Sabha elections and local body elections held in April to avoid spread of Covid-19. The chief minister, who had attended very few programmes since the outbreak of Covid-19 almost 15 months ago, refrained from addressing public meetings.  Recently, the chief minister hinted at renewing field visits with inspection of ward and village secretariats shortly. He had directed legislators and district collectors to make frequent visits to the secretariats to take feedback about public grievances. Ahead of his visits to the ward/village secretariats, the chief minister has decided to attend a public meeting while releasing the YSR Asara financial assistance. About 87.74 lakh women from 8.71 lakh women self-help groups will be receiving nearly Rs.6792 crore through YSR Asara scheme. The state government would remit the amount in a span of 10-days from October 7. The chief minister has promised to extend the financial assistance to the self-help groups to bail them out of debts. “Several lakhs of self-help groups slipped into group-C and group-D from group-A due to the failure of the Chandrababu Naidu government in clearing their debts. Naidu, who appealed to the self-help groups not to pay the loans before 2014 elections with a promise to clear their loans, had not kept his promise which pushed the self-help groups into debt trap,” said government advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy. He said that YS Jagan had promised to clear their debts in four spells after coming into power through Asara scheme. In addition, Jagan had also promised during his Padayatra before the elections to revive the Pavala Vaddi (3 per cent interest) scheme once coming into power. “The government identified that about 8.71 lakh groups owed nearly Rs.27,168 crore to the banks at the time of YS Jagan assuming charge. As per the chief minister’s promise, the government had paid Rs.6792 crore in last September as first spell and clearing the second spell Rs.6792 crore on Thursday,” said energy minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy. He said the CM was committed to help self-help groups and ensure their economic development. The amount released through Asara will be tied up with multinational companies to provide further support in taking up their own businesses. The minister and the officials reviewed the CM’s visit arrangements in Ongole town on Tuesday. District collector Pravin Kumar, SP Mallika Garg and other senior officials visited PVR High School ground and started making arrangements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-to-address-public-meeting-in-ongole-on-thursday/articleshow/86791513.cms||---

The order by Justice K Lakshman came in a petition challenging 35 FIRs across the state against freelance journalist Naveen Kumar Chintapandu, popularly known as Teenmar Mallanna, who has been often highly critical of the state government through his channel. The director general of police has now been directed to personally supervise the investigation and furnish information on pending cases, PT warrants and NBWs either to Mallanna or his wife. “They are detaining him in one case and showing PT warrant to arrest him in another if he secures bail,” petitioner and Mallanna’s wife K Mathamma told the court. Pointing out that heavy-handed action would erode public confidence gained by Telangana police through people-friendly initiatives, Justice K Lakshman ruled: “If there is more than one crime pending against Mallanna in respect of the very same allegation arising out of the same cause, the police shall conduct an investigation in one crime and treat the material in other crimes as statements under Section 162 of CrPC.” “Close all similar cases and use the statements recorded in such cases in the ones that are retained. The police can easily use technology to check if Mallanna was facing similar cases anywhere,” Justice Lakshman ordered. The judge further said that if the accused filed any application for recall of warrants, the magistrates should see if the allegations pertained to the same set and whether CrPC Section 41-A (for crimes with punishment less than 7 years) was followed or not. “If the arrest is essential, then follow DK Basu case guidelines. Do not harass the couple in the name of investigation,” the judge said and also directed the couple to cooperate with the police investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-pulls-up-t-over-35-firs-against-mallanna/articleshow/86797197.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The Lok Ayukta asked Kamal to produce her records after admitting a complaint by Akhila Khan, a Thiruvananthapuram native, who said in a complaint that the women’s commission member’s degree is fake and she has been misleading others by claiming that she holds a doctorate and prefixes her name with “Dr”. In her complaint before the Lok Ayukta, the complainant said that the international open university that Kamal has claimed is a fake university, and she is also not eligible for being awarded doctorate as she has failed in clearing her degree final year. Through her actions, Kamal has cheated the people and the state government for obtaining gains for which she is ineligible, the complaint said. The complainant further said that since she lacks honesty, which is the minimum required qualification for holding a post like women’s commission member, she should be removed from the post. A criminal case should also be registered against her, and a probe should be conducted. All the benefits that Kamal received from the government, including her honorarium, should be recovered. The complainant also prayed that the secretary of the social justice department, who had connived to publish fake educational qualifications of Kamal on the state government’s website, should also be penalised. The complainant had earlier approached the police with the complaint, but later approached the Lok Ayukta after the police did not take any action. The Lok Ayukta will consider the case again on November 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/panel-member-told-to-prove-edu-qualification/articleshow/86796265.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Notorious Chaddi gang behind Tirupati robberies?||TIRUPATI: Tirupati police are on a high alert after reports of back-to-back robberies in temple city in a span of just 48 hours. Suspecting the acts to be the handiwork of notorious Chaddi gang, Tirupati police have stepped up vigil. At 2.25 am on Sunday, four miscreants who were wearing shorts and vests, and a pair of chappals hanging around their waist, were captured on CCTV cameras when they were about to break into an apartment at Vidya Nagar locality here. The gang broke into the locked apartment and decamped with gold ornaments weighing 4 grams as they couldn’t find any other valuables. Following a complaint by the neighbours later, MR Palli police reached the crime scene and collected fingerprints and other evidence. They also analysed the CCTV footage. Even as the police were investigating this case, another robbery was reported not far away from the city, in Tiruchanoor police station limits where a gang of unidentified robbers broke into an apartment and decamped with 260 grams of gold ornaments and 1,500 grams of silver articles on Monday. They struck at a railway staffer’s residence. Tiruchanoor police, after learning about the incident, rushed to the spot with a team of experts and dog squad. They also registered a case. Tirupati SP Ch Venkata Appala Naidu urged the people of the temple city to remain cautious all the time. Meanwhile, memories of 15 back-to-back robberies committed by the Chaddi gang between 2017 and 2019 came back to haunt the people amid reports of the gang’s hand in the present cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/notorious-chaddi-gang-behind-tirupati-robberies/articleshow/86791546.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Hyderabad||Never said will give three acres to dalit families, says Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao in House||HYDERABAD: The TRS never promised to give three acres to poor dalit families in the state, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said on the floor of the assembly on Tuesday. The CM also said there was not much land available anymore to distribute. What the TRS had said in the past was dalits would be given the minimum required agricultural land to provide for their families, the CM said. For example, if a dalit family had two acres, the government would give one more acre. The CM said as per studies three acres of agricultural land was required per family to make a living. The distribution of assigned land by previous governments was done unscientifically, he claimed. KCR’s clarification came in response to queries raised by AIMIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi on whether the plan to distribute three acres would be continued after dalit families have been given Rs 10 lakh under ‘Dalit Bandhu’ scheme. Akbaruddin also sought clarification if the government had fixed the price as Rs 7 lakh per acre for land to be distributed to dalits. He said in that case three acres would be worth Rs 21 lakh, while the ‘Dalit Bandhu’ scheme promised only Rs 10 lakh per dalit family. The CM said there was no fixed price for purchasing land for dalits, adding that the government had gone to the extent of paying Rs 7 lakh per acre to private parties in Khammam district while looking for land. The state had given over 16,000 acres to dalit families till date, the CM said. KCR also said that not much land was available for distribution as the state itself had little in its land bank and was acquiring land for various projects. The CM said existing schemes for dalits would continue along with the ‘Dalit Bandhu’ programme. He, however, said that the government would review the need for various schemes in future after implementation of ‘Dalit Bandhu’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/never-said-will-give-3-acres-to-dalit-families-kcr-in-house/articleshow/86797202.cms||Roushan Ali

According to Geetha MG, Idukki district child protection officer, the task force will work under district collector. The decision to form the state’s first such task force was due to an increasing number of crimes against children in the plantation areas of the district. “The special task force will inspect several areas such as school dropouts, child marriages, child abuse, child labour, child trafficking, sanitation, drinking water, school facilities among other issues,” said Geetha. “A meeting for the task force formation was held at Vandiperiyar on October 1. We hope child rights commission will conduct a meeting with Idukki district collector and take a final decision to include officials from various sections in the task force,” she added. According to various officials, there has been a rise in crimes against children in plantation areas after the lockdown period. A six-year-old girl at Churakkulam estate lane was found hanging inside her house on June 30. Initial reports indicated that the girl who was alone accidentally got hung on the rope while playing. However, the autopsy report said that she was subjected to severe sexual abuse for long. The police later arrested Arjun who frequented the house. On September 30, a 14-year-old girl was sexually abused by an autorickshaw driver in the plantation area of Anayirankal. The girl’s parents are plantation workers and she was abused after the parents left for work in the morning. “As school are not functional, students are alone at home in the plantation areas, and it poses a security threat to them,” said a police officer. State child rights commission chairperson K V Manoj Kumar and other members visited the plantation areas of Vandipperiyar and reviewed the living conditions of children there recently. The commission members also visited the Malampandaram tribal community children at Sathram near Vandiperiyar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/child-rights-panel-forms-task-force-in-idukkis-plantation-areas/articleshow/86796317.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Ahmedabad||Now, Gujarat Gas raises its CNG, PNG prices||AHMEDABAD: State-run Gujarat Gas Limited (GGL) has raised prices of compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas (PNG) for residential and industrial customers with effect from October 5. The company raised its CNG price in Gujarat to Rs 58.10 per kg, an increase of Rs 3.65 (including taxes and duties) from the previous tariff of Rs 54.45 per kg, according to the company, which serves about 7 lakh CNG customers through its network of 450-odd CNG stations across Gujarat. The retail price of domestic PNG across the state has been revised upwards by Rs 2.12 per standard cubic metre (SCM) to Rs 29.61 per SCM (including taxes) from Rs 27.50/ SCM. The latest increase comes after the central government increased the price of domestically produced natural gas by 62% to $2.90 per million British thermal unit (mmbtu) for the period from October 1,2021 to March 31, 2022. The steep increase in natural gas prices in the international market has forced the company to raise the price of PNG supplied to industries. For ceramic and sanitaryware units in Morbi and Surendranagar areas, industrial PNG rates have gone up by Rs 9.5 per standard cubic metre (SCM) to Rs 47.01 per SCM from Rs 37.51 per SCM for the three-month minimum guaranteed offtake (MGO). For one-month MGO, the price has been increased by Rs 10.15 per SCM to Rs 47.51 per SCM (excluding taxes), said ceramic tile industry players. Last week, Adani Total Gas Limited (ATGL) raised the prices of compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas (PNG) for residential, industrial and commercial customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/now-gujarat-gas-raises-its-cng-png-prices/articleshow/86793934.cms||---

Known as percutaneous mitral valve repair (PMVR), the technique gains entry to the mitral valve through a vein in the leg (femoral artery) by a scope. In this case, once it reached the valve from the right side of the heart, a stitch (clip) was applied to the valve, reducing its leakage considerably. Dr Sameer Dani, director of cardiology services at Apollo CVHF, said a team of experts including cardiologists Dr Raj Makkar, Dr Tarun Chakravarty and cardiac anaesthetist Dr Moody Makar – all from the US – and Dr Sai Satish, a cardiologist from Chennai and himself had carried out the procedure. “The patient was considered the right candidate for the procedure as factors such as comorbidities and age prevented us from risky open-heart surgery. He had got hospitalized about six times in the past eight months due to his condition,” said Dr Dani. He said that the patient was operated on on Sunday and was out of the ICCU on Monday and started walking on his own on Tuesday. In a conventional procedure, this may have taken over seven days, experts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/92-year-old-gets-rare-mitral-valve-repair/articleshow/86793939.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Metro may tweak train timings||KOLKATA: Metro Railway may extend its evening operations by one or one-and-a-half hours for revellers during the Puja days. But in keeping with Calcutta High Court’s restrictions, the number of services will remain the same. Trains will be frequent as services may start only at 10am and not at 7.30am. But like last year, there will be no night-long services because of the pandemic. Until 2019, Metro Railway ran services till 4am during the Durga Puja days. Just before Pujas last year, the high court had ordered not to allow crowds near the pandals and Metro Railway dropped the all-night special services between Saptami and Dashami for pandal-hoppers. This year, even as the Mamata Banerjee government extended Covid-19 curbs till October 30, it lifted the night curfew for the Puja days, and some people were hoping if the authorities running Kolkata’s lifeline would provide matching services. But Manoj Joshi, Metro Railway general manager, told TOI on Tuesday, “We may only extend services by 1 hour or one-and-a-half hours, beyond the present 9.30pm during the Puja days. We are working out the details and shall share it once it is finalized. The total number of trains will not increase as we will start services late on these holidays.” The state government has allowed Metro to function for the public on weekdays and the carrier currently has increased its weekly trains to 266 since Monday. That’s its highest number of services in pandemic times. Before the pandemic, Metro’s total fleet was 288. Even as Metro, with a 3-lakh ridership, is gradually trying to reach its pre-pandemic fleet, the facility seems inclined to maintain the 266 daily services during the Puja week as well, to maintain the essence of the high court restrictions. “At the same time, the government has lifted the night curfew. So people are likely to go pandal-hopping beyond 9.30pm. We shall have to accommodate this late-evening crowd,” a Metro official said. The first Metro train now starts at 7.30am and the last ones leave terminals at 9.30pm. Metro may tweak the operation hours and start services at 10am. The last trains may leave at 10pm or 10.30pm. Officials said there will be fewer people from the districts flocking to Kolkata for pandal hopping this year as suburban train services have not resumed. Only staff special local trains are now running. Post the second wave, Metro has emerged as the city’s public transport backbone and has also been running staff specials on Saturdays and Sundays. Even as these are actually meant for essential workers, the authorities have stopped checking the ID cards and the public, especially Pujas shoppers, have made the most of these staff special services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ajanta/metro-puja-2021/articleshow/86791584.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Rise in Hooghly sludge threatens safe drinking water supply to Kolkata||KOLKATA: The sharp increase in sludge in the Hooghly water is threatening the operations at three major treatment plants that supply water to households in Kolkata. The century-old plant located at Palta, 22km from Kolkata, which caters to two-third of the city’s population, is the worst-hit by the sudden rise in turbidity or suspended particles in the water from the Hooghly. Going by records at Palta Waterworks, the turbidity level has shot up nearly four times from the usual 700 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) during September to 2,500 NTU on Saturday night. “We were shocked to see the turbidity level and initially, we thought it was due to some isolated incident upstream. But it has remained static since then,” said a KMC water supply department official. The suspended particles in such high volume have threatened the functioning of water treatment units at Palta. The plant engineers are apprehensive about the damage to the machines in the sedimentation tank zone. According to a KMC engineer, if any machine develops a snag, it will be difficult for the civic body to supply safe drinking water to large parts of the city. “Several machines work to ensure proper filtration of the water. We are being extremely cautious and are trying to protect the machines. If there is a breakdown, it will lead to a water crisis in the city,” said a civic official. The slow sand filtration bed at Palta water treatment plant has proved to be a saviour in this hour of crisis. “It is due to this slow sand bed that we have been able to keep our plant operational. This bed is actually helping in the absorption of the high volume of sludge and is keeping our plant operational,” said the civic official. Besides, plant engineers are using huge quantities of alum as a coagulant to make the water safe for drinking. The exercise of caution has, however, slowed down the filtration process and reduced water supply to stretches of north and central Kolkata. Similarly, the KMC engineers at Garden Reach water treatment plant and Dhapa plant are working overtime to supply safe drinking water to large parts of south Kolkata and EM Bypass. The chairman of the KMC board of administrators Firhad Hakim on Tuesday assured citizens that the civic body engineers were working overtime to supply safe drinking water to the residents of the city. Hakim expressed hope that the situation would become normal in another three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rise-in-hooghly-sludge-threatens-safe-drinking-water-supply-to-kol/articleshow/86791593.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt secures Covid orphans’ future, but present is uncertain||MUMBAI: Siblings Asmita (14) and Shrishail (12) Mhamane from Pandharpur are among the over 300 Covid orphans who have received Rs 5 lakh in the form of a fixed deposit from the state government, which they can claim when they turn 21. But the family is worried about the children’s present precarious situation. “The financial assistance given by the government will help Asmita and Shrishail in the future, but at the moment we are more worried about their present. Their father, Shivling (39), was the sole breadwinner and with his passing away we are faced with rising debt,” said Kailas, their uncle and guardian. Shivling (39), a farmer, succumbed to Covid-19 in May after a brief hospital stay leaving behind a debt of Rs 60,000 taken by his family for his treatment. His wife, Yogini, initially tested negative, but later developed pneumonia and passed away eight days after him. Kailas is keen that Asmita and Shrishail, who study in a local government school, continue their education. The state has also waived the education fee of students who have lost their parents to Covid-19. “Although the scheme of disburing Rs 5 lakh in FDs is only applicable for children who have lost both their parents, the state government is giving Rs 1,100 per month under a child welfare scheme to those who have lost even one parent to the pandemic. This is being done to extend support to these families,” said a senior state official. In Maharashtra, more than 1,000 children have lost both their parents. Till date, Rs 15.3 crore has been deposited into the bank accounts of 306 children; the remaining 600-700 children will be covered in the next few days, said the official. This government aid is keeping alive the dreams of Solapur siblings Mehak (17) and Mazhar Mashale (16), who want to study medicine and hotel management, respectively. The two collegians said the funds will be of great help to them. “My mother was a schoolteacher and father a small-time businessman,” said Mehak. “My mother caught the infection first and later dad also showed Covid symptoms. After staying in hospital for over 10 days, both of them passed away.” The siblings have moved in with their maternal brother, who has also taken up the responsibility of their education. “When our parents passed away, I didn’t know whether we would be able to continue with our education. I want to be a doctor and the government aid will help achieve my dream,” Mehak said. Vijay Khomane, women and child development officer of Solapur district, said the state government wants to help Covid orphans in these trying times. “We want to ensure that they do not discontinue their education and their basic needs can be fulfilled,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-secures-covid-orphans-future-but-present-is-uncertain/articleshow/86793950.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Delhi||Delhi: Green War Room will work 24x7 through the winter||NEW DELHI: In the Green War Room set up at Delhi Secretariat, environment experts analyse the Air Quality Index (AQI) of 13 hotspots from the past 24 hours. They observe that only two — Mundka in west Delhi and Wazirpur in northwest Delhi — have recorded an increase in AQI levels by 16% and 3%, respectively. They then start finding the reasons behind it. A few members of the team of 21 experts monitor farm fires on satellite images, some closely watch complaints received on the Green Delhi app, while others keep a tab on the real-time air quality at 26 monitoring stations. As the air quality in Delhi is expected to deteriorate from this month, the Green War Room is expected to play an important role in monitoring and controlling pollution. Environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday launched the advanced Green War Room, which would be functional 24x7 the entire winter. “The project management unit’s joint team has been set up for our war room, having members from University of Chicago and GDI Partners. This team will scrutinise the Winter Action Plan. We are recruiting 50 engineers to help coordinate the plan of action,” he said. “The war room, being the central point of contact, will play an eminent role in conducting and resolving complaints. Apart from monitoring 26 stations across Delhi, stubble burning will also be located. We have trained 2,500 people across 27 departments to do the job,” said Rai, while launching the iOS version and an upgraded Android version of the Green Delhi app. A war room official said, “After the agency concerned resolves the complaint on the app, 70 green marshals, who will be civil defence volunteers, will visit the site to verify the complaint. If the complaint is not resolved properly, it will be reopened.” An expert monitoring farm fires on satellite images said, “We cannot take any action against crop stubble burning in the neighbouring states, but if we spot any in the city, our team will immediately visit the site.” The app, launched for Android users in October 2020, has received 27,000 complaints in the last one year. Over 23,000 complaints have been resolved by the municipal corporations, Delhi Development Authority and PWD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/green-war-room-will-work-24x7-through-the-winter/articleshow/86793996.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||India||Widow fights 19-yr-old extortion case, gets hubby’s name cleared||AHMEDABAD: Her husband died five years ago, but Asha Gupta kept alive his fight to clear his name in a 19-year-old extortion case for which he was convicted. Her battle bore fruit on Tuesday when the Gujarat high court declared Lalit Gupta innocent in the criminal case slapped against him in 2002. Gupta along with his friend Ratnakar Rahurkar had been booked on charges of extortion and intimidation by Raopura police. In 2008, a magisterial court in Vadodara acquitted the two of serious charges but held them guilty of minor charges and awarded simple imprisonment for three years. Two years later, a sessions court upheld the conviction. Both the friends approached the high court. During the pendency of their appeal, Gupta passed away due to cancer in March 2016. His widow decided to join the litigation to obliterate the stigma of conviction and carried on with the legal battle for her late husband’s acquittal. Normally, the appeal filed by Gupta would have abated because of his demise. Last week, the high court quashed the decisions of both the lower courts and acquitted Gupta as well as Rahurkar. Acquitting the duo, HC noted that the main witness to threat and demands had not been examined by the prosecution. The court had not even taken the witness’s affidavit on record. Gupta was a Congress leader and his friend was a mediaperson, but the lower courts did not take pains to find out the truth in the case. “Why the prosecution should do it, that may not be a mystery, because the time of the alleged incident is immediately after 2002 riots and the accused were, as per the record, a local leader of the political party not in power then and one mediaperson. May be unknowingly, the courts below also facilitated this prosecution plan,” the HC observed in its order. Following the acquittal, Gupta’s eldest son, Hitesh, expressed satisfaction. He said, “Even on his deathbed, my father was worried about this case. After his demise, we decided to fight the case and clear his name.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/widow-fights-19-yr-old-extortion-case-gets-hubbys-name-cleared/articleshow/86798403.cms||---

In response to a PIL seeking criminal action and compensation for the accident, ONGC told the Gujarat high court that construction took place on revenue survey No. 1516/1 without the requisite NOC from it by the developer of Garden City Cooperative Housing Society Ltd. After terming the construction illegal, the corporation claimed that the authorities concerned also did not inform it and the district inspector of land records (DILR) about the amalgamation of revenue survey numbers. Moreover, the NOC obtained for construction on revenue survey No 71/4 was for 11,431 sq m, but revenue records revealed that the permission was granted for over 43,000 sq m. ONGC also made it clear that its pipeline beneath the houses, which were destroyed in the blast, was isolated in September 2020 after the four oil wells it was connected to stopped production. Later, hydro-flushing took place in the pipeline. There was water found in the pipeline and crude was not in a quantity that could create any problem. Moreover, there was no leak in the pipeline. ONGC made it clear that the blast that took place could not have been caused by crude oil, but suggested that it could have been caused because of a leakage from the gas connection by the Sabarmati Gas Ltd in the closed house and subsequent ignition. ONGC also complained that the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) conducted an inquiry into the blast but ONGC was not involved in the process. The corporation denied collusion with the authorities or corrupt practices in granting of the NOC for construction. It clarified that construction permission granted on revenue survey No 74/1 was conditional on requisite space from the pipeline alignment being left open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ongc-says-kalol-blast-not-its-fault-pipeline-was-not-in-use/articleshow/86794000.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Govt grants Rs 109 crore for repair of over 6k schools||Kolkata: The school education department on Monday approved more than Rs 109 crore funds for repairing 6,468 schools. The government will try to reopen schools in November if the Covid curve tapers off, said officials. The school education department had earlier sought from the schools an estimate of the costs needed for repairs to make them functional. The schools in Bengal, which have remained closed during the entire pandemic phase, were given a September 15 deadline to submit the details. According to sources, the estimates given by the schools were huge. A few district schools were asked to re-submit the data due to some anomalies. After the officials screened the documents submitted by the school authorities, the appeal for funds by 6,468 schools has been granted by the department. Sources said that the highest number — 760 schools — need to be repaired in South 24 Parganas followed by North 24 Parganas, East Midnapore and Nadia. It was estimated that Rs 6.3 crore would be required to repair 429 schools in Kolkata. Three districts in North Bengal — Kalimpong, Darjeeling and Siliguri — have a very small number of schools to be repaired before reopening. The school education department has already conducted a survey to know about the present status of the infrastructure of secondary and higher secondary schools while a Google form has been generated for the school authorities to answer certain queries. “Schools are shut for more than one year, many school buildings have been damaged severely due to the cyclones Amphan and Yaas and other natural calamities,” said an official. Chandan Maity, general secretary, Advanced Society for Headmasters and Headmistress, said, “Repairing work needs to start soon, otherwise it will not be possible to reopen schools after vacation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-grants-rs-109-crore-for-repair-of-over-6k-schools/articleshow/86791608.cms||---

He has asked them that the daily vaccination drive should cover at least 1% of the eligible 18-plus beneficiaries in their district. These are the minimum desirable levels, and can be further scaled up, he added. With Maharashtra’s target population being 9.14 crore, the state set a goal of administering 9-10 lakh doses a day in October. The additional chief secretary said that each district should also identify the areas where the vaccination campaign has yet to pick up, and concentrate on those pockets. “We need to increase the pace of Covid vaccination in our state as we have received an increased dose of vaccines in the month of October,” he said. The state received nearly two crore doses of vaccines this month. “In September, the average rate of vaccination in the state was around 7.5 lakh doses per day, and with the increased doses we can easily achieve an average vaccination rate of 9-10 lakh doses per day this month,” Vyas told TOI. State officials said that of the 9.14 crore targeted population, nearly 6.14 crore doses have to be administered in the rural areas. Dr Vyas further added that the aim was to increase the pace of vaccination so that even if the number of Covid cases rise, at least severe illnesses and the number of deaths can be prevented. The state currently has fewer than 35,000 active Covid cases. The state Covid task force members said that the state government has been issuing guidelines for implementing the unlocking process from time to time, and this has to be followed in letter and spirit. “Increasing vaccination in all districts and following Covid protocols is the need of the hour as the festival season is underway and more unlocking haappens,” said a task force member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-govt-asks-dists-to-vaccinate-1-of-population-daily/articleshow/86803836.cms||Nisha Nambiar

These are the minimum desirable levels, and can be further scaled up, he added. With Maharashtra’s target population being 9.14 crore, the state set a goal of administering 9-10 lakh doses a day in October. The additional chief secretary said that each district should also identify the areas where the vaccination campaign has yet to pick up, and concentrate on those pockets. “We need to increase the pace of Covid vaccination in our state as we have received an increased dose of vaccines in the month of October,” he said. The state received nearly two crore doses of vaccines this month. “In September, the average rate of vaccination in the state was around 7.5 lakh doses per day, and with the increased doses we can easily achieve an average vaccination rate of 9-10 lakh doses per day this month,” Vyas told TOI. State officials said that of the 9.14 crore targeted population, nearly 6.14 crore doses have to be administered in the rural areas. Dr Vyas further added that the aim was to increase the pace of vaccination so that even if the number of Covid cases rise, at least severe illnesses and the number of deaths can be prevented. The state currently has fewer than 35,000 active Covid cases. The state Covid task force members said that the state government has been issuing guidelines for implementing the unlocking process from time to time, and this has to be followed in letter and spirit. “Increasing vaccination in all districts and following Covid protocols is the need of the hour as the festival season is underway and more unlocking haappens,” said a task force member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-govt-asks-dists-to-vaccinate-1-of-population-daily/articleshow/86803833.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Kochi||Baby born on London-Kochi Air India flight||NEW DELHI: Air India’s London-Kochi flight of Tuesday is being rerouted to Frankfurt after a baby was born on board the Boeing 787. The woman went into labour sometime after the plane took off from London at 1.21 pm (local time). A doctor who was on board and the flight’s cabin crew helped deliver the baby. At that time, the aircraft was over the Black Sea en route to India. Since the newborn and the mother needed medical care, the airline decided to divert to the nearest airport, Frankfurt, and had turned in that direction. The aircraft was winging its way to Germany at the time of filing this story, an AI spokesperson confirmed. Many AI employees see the birth of the baby just ahead of the announcement of the airline’s future buyer as a “good sign”. “We are awaiting the rebirth of our airline under the new owner… This is the beginning of new beginnings,” said a long-time AI employee. The aircraft has over 210 people on board, including 193 economy and 11 business class passengers. The aircraft is expected to land in Frankfurt at 11pm IST. According to the rules, only the newborn, the mother, and a close relative like the husband, can alight at Frankfurt. The others will fly to Kochi unless the flight requires a crew change due to flight duty time limitations. “We have always put passenger wellbeing over monetary aspects. The moment the baby was born, and knowing that our destination was several hours away, we immediately decided to divert to Frankfurt,” a source said. “The human face of Air India was evident yet again as a lady passenger flying from London to Kochi went into labour mid-air. Our experienced cabin crew swung into action and, identifying doctors on board, sought their assistance. To ensure the wellbeing of the newborn, the flight is being diverted to Frankfurt as a medical emergency without any commercial considerations,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/baby-born-on-london-kochi-air-india-flight/articleshow/86796413.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Delhi||MoU signed to work on real-time pollution sources, forecast||New Delhi: The Delhi cabinet on Tuesday approved a memorandum of understanding between IIT-Kanpur and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) for conducting a project on real-time source apportionment and forecasting for advance air pollution management in Delhi. The study will help in tracking the sources of air pollution in real time and a forecast will be issued for the pollution management. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said this would go a long way in identifying and resolving various factors of Delhi’s pollution. A team of IIT-Kanpur, IIT-Delhi, The Energy & Resources Institute (TERI) and IISER Mohali will execute the study in the national capital. DPCC has been authorised to act as the nodal agency for finalising and implementing the terms of reference of the proposed study and finalise payment conditions and sign the MoU with IIT-Kanpur-led consortium with the approval of the cabinet. According to officials, the “real-time source apportionment” project will help identify the factors responsible for the spike in air pollution at any spot and help understand the real-time impact of various sources like vehicles, dust, biomass and stubble burning, and emissions from industries. Based on the results obtained, the government will be able to take the necessary actions to curb the sources. The MoU was signed to ensure smooth implementation of the project, attainment of the objectives, and efficient monitoring, they added. With the approval from the cabinet, the scientists will start working on this innovative project in full swing. A low-cost unmanned spatial monitoring network for hotspots and critical areas will be carried out. The funds will be used under the planning scheme of “Pollution Control and Hazard Management” as “Matching Saving” by the finance department for releasing funds-on-demand basis to DPCC. The Delhi government will allocate funds up to Rs 12.72 crore for the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mou-signed-to-work-on-real-time-pollution-sources-forecast/articleshow/86794050.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Puja is a feast of life, love and harmony||Durga Puja is in the offing. It is not merely idol-worship for four days. It has much greater significance in our own lives and also for the people and places around us. It is not what we see externally around us during this period, the pandals, the deity, the illumination, but it is much more, which needs to be introspected. It comes as an opportunity to express joy with all and speaks of our unison with Mother Nature. In Bengal, Puja is also called ‘Sharodotsov’—the Autumn Festival or Feast. It is the feast of life and love, of holiness and harmony, of brotherhood and sisterhood. This feast is the highest point of all celebrations in Bengal. It is the most sacred, most meaningful, most beautiful celebration for which people of Bengal wait eagerly all the year. An overall expectation of Ma coming to her home is generated among the people. To welcome her, they prepare the pandals and illuminations —the preparations outside. But there is indeed a need for much more to prepare inside, that is, preparing one’s heart and dispositions, through good relations with all and bringing goodness to all, especially to the poor and needy, like Ma. Only then the quest for holiness and harmony will be fulfilled. The weather is cool; it is calm all around. After the rain, all water bodies are brimming with fresh water and fish, flowers, like shiuli and kaash are blossoming all around. So, there is new life all around. The nature shows it is transforming. Nature gives us oxygen, sunshine, air, rain for all, good or not so good. It purifies our surroundings, and also our body and mind. It is a call from Her, like Her to be good to all, to bring welfare to all, those who are good to us and not so good to us. Importantly, all must take care and protect nature. Before any important occasion, we always pray to our forefathers and seek their blessings. The experience of ‘Mahalaya’ is that. It shows the union with our forefathers, continuation of the dynasty and never-ending relationships. During the ‘arpan’ on Mahalaya, while remembering our forefathers, offerings are also given to the unknown who do not have anybody for such offering. This speaks of universal love and affection and oneness of all, even who have gone for rest. The images of gods and goddesses are made of up of these five elements, soil, water, fire, wind and space. The universe is made up of these very five elements. This shows our union with and respect for one another, for nature and for the universe. On Bijaya Dashami, the ‘sindur khela’ and ‘kolakuli’ signify the breaking of boundaries and establishing greater sisterhood and brotherhood. Mother comes to destroy our sin, selfishness, pride and all evil as we realize our helplessness to liberate ourselves from all these. As worthy children of Ma, we, too, must do our part by being away from sin, selfishness, evil and establish her reign on earth by bringing new life and peace. The festival opens our eyes to the realization that Ma comes into our life not just once but at every moment. Let us be aware of Her presence in every spell of our lives, in all human beings and in nature. Let us be holy, harmonious and loving, like Her. Let us pray for Her blessings on all of us, especially on our helpless brothers and sisters, and very much for mother earth—our extended home.

A report released last week stated that people of Delhi who do not smoke cigarettes inhale as much smoke as 10 to 15 cigarettes a day due to pollution,” Bidhuri said in a statement. Bidhuri said that everyone should come together to tackle pollution. “We as a responsible opposition want to give some constructive suggestions. Delhi needs 15,000 buses, but in the last seven years, the Kejriwal government could not bring even a single bus under DTC. The roads in Delhi are in bad shape. The work of repairing needs to be done on a war-footing level,” Bidhuri said.

---||Chennai||Don’t kill tiger, it may not be man-eater: Madras HC||CHENNAI: The Mudumalai tiger — codenamed T23 — against which ‘hunting’ orders have been issued may not be killed as both the Tamil Nadu government and the Madras high court made it clear there were no plans to shoot down the animal. “Don’t go for the kill immediately. It may not be a man-eater, it may have been misunderstood,” said the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu on Tuesday. The state government, represented by government pleader P Muthukumar, said there was no plan to kill it. Muthukumar said, “Efforts are on to capture the animal alive, study its psychology and behaviour to assess what future course of treatment to be adopted.” Recording the submissions, the bench said: “It appears from news reports that the tiger was spotted yesterday and there was a huge bandobust in the area to capture the animal.” After an order to hunt T23 was issued, on the ground that the animal killed three people near the tiger reserve, two PILs were moved by People for Cattle in India (PCFI) and an activist, seeking direction to the state forest department to capture the animal alive. During the hearing, the court said the principal chief conservator of forests would use his best discretion to ensure that the least number of people intruded into any forest, since the natural habitat would get disturbed by the movement of large posse of humans. “However, the authorities are left free to deal with the relevant animal for its treatment and for ascertaining its conduct and behaviour,” the first bench added. All that can be said at the moment is that other animals in the area should not be disturbed to the extent avoidable for tracking down the tiger, though some discrete measures could be used for such purpose with the object of ultimately seeking the animal and respecting its right to remain in the wild and free to roam in the forest, the court said. The judges then adjourned the plea to October 21 for the state to file a status report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dont-kill-tiger-it-may-not-be-man-eater-hc/articleshow/86794080.cms||Suresh Kumar

We have people cutting across four generations living in under the same roof in our home where we have learned to accept, adopt and accommodate to live in this new normal world. At a time when the world is moving towards nuclear families, our strength lies in being in a joint family, with parents and in-laws, staying together and collectively getting over the trauma of Covid-19. Among the many things that the pandemic has taught us, one learning has been that nothing in this world is permanent. So, it is important to cherish what we have today. I am glad that we have managed to stick together as a family through thick and thin, in this joint family system, and ensure that we all take care of each other, while giving each other the respect and space that is necessary for every member. That’s the secret to our happy new normal. (The writer is an IT professional) ….............. Found an escape in poetryBy Sufiya Fatima The phase that everyone has gone through was quite devastating.

The impact was so fierce that victim Ajay Kushwaha was hurled 20 feet and died instantly. Witnesses say that only a couple of seconds before the accident, he had advised those sitting close to him to move to a safe distance, said police. “Earlier, it was suspected that the tyre had blown up. It was a tubeless tyre, which slipped out of its rim while being inflated. Ajay was sitting close to the tyre, and took the full impact on his face,” Jaura police station in-charge Yogendra Singh Jadaun told TOI. “Two other persons, including the truck driver, were sitting close to him. Ajay told them to move off to a side when he inflated the tyre. The moment they moved aside, the accident happened. He saved their lives,” said Jadaun. Ajay was 25 and lived in Sikrauda village, around 30km from town. Police have registered a case and are finding out why the accident happened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mechanic-pumping-in-air-killed-as-tubeless-tyre-slips-out-of-rim/articleshow/86798420.cms||---

It will eventually report the issue with the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) after collecting more data from the field on this invasive species. Currently, experts are vetting the report and will submit it to the state government at the earliest. KFRI has got as many as 155 red-eared slider turtles after pet lovers got left the turtles with the institute, where scientists are studying it. Following KFRI’s warning against people dumping the turtles in water bodies, many pet lovers left the turtles with the institute forcing it to open two more rehabilitation facilities for the turtles at its sub-centres in Nilambur and Palapilly. “The turtles coming are emotionally loaded. They respond to our actions and identify people. KFRI converted ponds in the centre and at sub-centres to maintain the turtles as the number of them rose. To prevent population growth and dissuade people from abandoning them at water bodies, we have to ban the trade of the turtles. We are preparing a draft to ban the trade,” said Dr T V Sajeev, principal scientist at KFRI. A turtle in the centre has laid eggs and itself ate them recently. KFRI director Dr Syam Viswanath said the institute will also intimate the MoEF of the threat posed by the red-eared turtles to the natural habitat. “Other countries, including Australia, also face the problem caused by these turtles. The problem is not limited to Kerala alone. It is pan-India. In Bengaluru, people keep the turtles as pets after buying them from pet shops, and it has become a big issue. While informing the state government, the central government should also take cognizance of the problem. Since KFRI is the recognized centre of the MoEF, we will write separately to the central government after collecting more data on the turtles,” he said. Pet shop owners said the arrival of red-eared turtles has come down nowadays after the warning issued by the KFRI. “Earlier, people used to buy the turtles for around Rs 200–250 per baby turtle. Now, the arrival and the demand has come down drastically,” a pet shop owner in Kochi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kfri-for-ban-on-trade-of-red-eared-turtle/articleshow/86796453.cms||T C Sreemol

The first automated track in Delhi came up in January 2018 at Sarai Kale Khan, which caters to both the South and Central zones. In March 2019, three more were added at Mayur Vihar, Vishwas Nagar and Shakur Basti, followed by a track at Burari in July. Last year, similar test tracks came up in October at Loni Road, Rohini and Raja Garden, and another at Dwarka in January 2021. The will be completed at Lado Sarai, Hari Nagar and Jharoda Kalan in 2022. These tracks, however, are not enough to tackle the rush of applicants seeking to appear for the tests. As a result, the Delhi government has now zeroed in on educational institutions for constructing tracks, which will not only reduce the load on the existing test tracks but also make it easier for the youth to appear for tests. Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI that seven such sites had already been identified at Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) at Mayur Vihar, Shahdara, Narela, Jail Road, Pusa Road and Jafarpur, apart from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University at Kashmere Gate. Delhi is “the first state to have completely automated driving test tracks and also has a strong enforcement wing with 70+ vehicles”, Gahlot said on Friday during a Road Safety Summit hosted by the department. “We are very soon taking on board schools and colleges and have already identified six locations... to increase capacity of test racks and impart a life skill at a young age,” he had said. The Delhi government also plans to start 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, at the automated driving test tracks at Sarai Kale Khan, Loni road, Shakur Basti, Rohini and Janakpuri. These regional transport offices (RTOs) issue the highest number of driving licences every year and the 12-hour shifts throughout the week will also be planned for other RTOs later, depending on the volume, sources said. The next year, the transport department also plans to rope in another agency for maintenance and operations of these tracks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/seven-new-automated-test-sites-at-edu-institutions-to-put-you-in-drivers-seat/articleshow/86794160.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Namas’cray is a Delhi-based firm registered as Caneplus Trading Private Limited. The firm was established on 30 October 2020. The company was tasked with the management of the event on board Cordelia Cruises’ Empress ship. The NCB on Tuesday produced four accused (including two who were arrested on Monday) — Abdul Kedar Shaikh, Shreyas Nair, Manish Rajgaria and Avin Sahu — before the 8th metropolitan magistrate and sought their custody.  All the four were remanded to NCB custody till October 11. The four-event organisers — Gopal Jee Anand, Samir Sehgal, Manav Singhal and Bhaskar Arora — will be produced before court on Wednesday. Sehgal and Anand are additional directors of Namas’cray. All the eight held earlier have been remanded to NCB custody till October 7. The NCB on Tuesday added the stringent sections of 27 (A) for financing, 22 (b) (contravention involving quantity lesser than commercial quantity but greater than small quantity) and 22 (c) (where contravention involves commercial quantity) against Shaikh. The section pertaining to financing has also been invoked against Shreyas Nair. While seeking custody of Shaikh, NCB public prosecutor Advait Sethna requested the court that they want minimum exposure of him as he is a key accused and investigations are on. Shaikh, whose face was covered with burkha, was whisked away by NCB officials. Shaikh’s lawyer later said his client wants to retract his statement as it was taken under duress. The NCB said it had recovered 2.5 grams of Ecstasy tablets and 54.3 grams of MD from Shaikh. “We are at the remand stage, we need to investigate, and there are also other aspects as it has come to light that the cruise did not have permission from the Directorate General of Shipping. Besides, we have found several irregularities which need to be investigated,” Chetna said . The NCB remand application stated that one of the arrested accused Mohak Jaswal during interrogation said the drugs were supplied to him by Shaikh. The NCB arrested Nair after arrested accused Ismeet Singh Chadha said the drugs he brought were from Nair. Nair and Shaikh are accused of being suppliers and two others — Manish Rajgaria and Sahu — are guests who consumed drugs and had a brawl on board. Rajgaria and Sahu both admitted to have consumed ganja on board the ship, NCB claimed. NCB’s zonal director SameerWankhede said, “Some of the accused hid drugs under shoe soles, some under sanitary napkins and eye lenses and medicine boxes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lawyer-of-key-accused-says-statement-taken-under-duress/articleshow/86794117.cms||Ahmed Ali

The Chirag faction will be called Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) with ‘helicopter’ as its poll symbol while the Paras group will be known as Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party with ‘sewing machine’ as its poll symbol to be allocated to the candidate set up, if any, by their groups in the byelection for the Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats, to be held in Bihar on October 30. The EC, in its interim order, had barred both the groups from using LJP as their party name and its poll symbol bungalow in the October 30 bypolls. However, the EC will take a final decision after hearing their sides and perusing the papers to be submitted in support of their claims on November 5. Both the groups hailed the EC’s decision. Chirag faction’s spokesperson Md Ashraf Ansari said the EC allocated the name and symbol to his faction as per his leader’s request. Ashraf said Chirag will now keep a tab on the development works carried out by the state government by hovering in the sky in the helicopter, the party's election symbol. The state president of Chirag group, Raju Tiwari said, “Since the name and symbol have been allotted by the EC, we are in the process of finalising the candidates for the two assembly seats.” Paras also welcomed the EC order and said he was busy in making preparations for the first death anniversary of his elder brother late Ram Vilas Paswan in Patna on October 8. Paras has already declared his support to the NDA candidates in the byelection. “We are part of the NDA,” he reiterated. Notably, five of the six LJP MPs had rebelled against Chirag and elected Hajipur MP Paras as their leader in the Lok Sabha. Later, Paras was inducted into the Narendra Modi Cabinet in July this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/separate-party-names-and-symbols-for-paras-chirag/articleshow/86794150.cms||Ramashankar

VSSC director S Somanath will lead the committee. The syndicate, chaired by vice-chancellor M S Rajasree, has also decided to request the government to amend the University Act to grant the Industrial Council the same statutory powers as the academic and research councils. A decision in this regard was taken by the varsity syndicate, the university authorities said. “The council will be in charge of thoroughly analysing and revising the state’s engineering curriculum and learning processes in order to make the courses more vocational. The council will recommend initiatives to be made to incorporate industry-related internships, projects, and other subjects into the curriculum so that students completing their engineering studies can gain job-ready skills and competencies in relevant sectors while still in college. The main objectives of the council are to establish vocational courses needed to build a knowledge community in Kerala, address and upgrade existing knowledge and skills deficiencies, provide training opportunities for teachers and students in entrepreneurship to gain expertise and training, to set up laboratories with industry participation in colleges, and provide students with the skills and services of industry experts in colleges,” a statement by the university said.

---||Vadodara||Rape-accused CA claims he was not in Vadodara on day of crime||Vadodara: The 24-year-old law student’s rape case took a curious turn with the lawyers defending the accused chartered accountant Ashok Jain stating in the court on Tuesday that he was not in Vadodara when the crime was committed. The lawyers furnished documents during the hearing of Jain’s anticipatory bail plea that he was in Delhi and Lucknow at the time when the rape was allegedly committed. “The affidavit submitted by the investigating officer to the court mentions that the alleged crime took place either on September 2 or September 3, but on both dates, my client was not in Vadodara,” said Jain’s lawyer Hitesh Gupta. According to the documents, Jain left for Delhi from Vadodara by flight on the morning of September 1 and took another flight to Lucknow. He returned to Vadodara on the morning of September 4. Interestingly, the complaint given by the rape survivor remains silent on the exact date of the crime. The FIR mentions that the rape took place around a month before September 19. In response to these documents, police told the court that there are issues with the digital video recorder (DVR) of the CCTV cameras installed at the place of crime. “If there are issues with the DVR then their evidence itself becomes irrelevant,” Gupta said. Meanwhile, the survivor too submitted an affidavit to the court on Tuesday requesting not to allow bail to Jain. Her affidavit rebuts the grounds of Jain’s anticipatory bail application. She has vehemently stated that the bootlegger Alpesh Wadhwani alias Alpu Sindhi has no role to play in the case and Sindhi’s name is being taken by the accused to divert the court’s attention. The affidavit also states that Jain has money and muscle power and political contacts due to which she feels pressurized. After hearing all arguments on Tuesday, the court will pronounce the order on October 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/rape-accused-ca-claims-he-was-not-in-vadodara-on-day-of-crime/articleshow/86791529.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Goshamahal road safe again for commuters||Hyderabad: Less than one week after a citizen reporter aired his grievance about a poorly-lit stretch near Sri Chaitanya Techno School in Goshamahal, the issue was resolved by civic authorities, on October 4. The issue was brought to light by Goutam Chand, using the TOI Citizen Reporter app on October 1. According to Goutam’s complaint, commuters and residents in the area were having a tough time travelling through this street, especially during the night. “The streetlights in this area were dysfunctional for almost 15 days before the officials took stock of the matter and repaired them recently. Such delays in fixing these civic issues can prove to be dangerous for commuters in the city. We are glad that the issue has been resolved now,” said Goutam. Locals and commuters using the route also said that the stretch had become unsafe for women due to poor illumination. “I thank authorities for fixing the problem and TOI for publishing the grievance. Hardly one or two lights were working on the street, now the complete stretch is illuminated. I saw accidents on the road due to poor illumination,” said Sampath Kumar, a resident of Goshamahal. A commuter said that the road is safe for women after the issue was resolved. “My friends and I frequently visit that part of the city to click pictures of heritage structures. But since the streetlights were not working, we were not comfortable using the stretch. Now, thankfully, it has been fixed,” said Razia Sultana, a degree student. When contacted, GHMC assistant engineer S Karunakar said, “There must have been some issue with the auto control of the lights, but it has been sorted now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/goshamahal-road-safe-again-for-commuters/articleshow/86796508.cms||---

The side of the tanker developed a tear after the impact around 7.30pm. A disaster was averted as fire and rescue services personnel and police reached the spot and evacuated people from the area, disconnected power supply and diverted traffic from the spot. Also, the spilt fuel could be contained in the area by dumping soil over it. The tanker, which was on its way from Kochi to Pulpally in Wayanad, met with the accident after it had to take a different route through Tanur town as police had diverted vehicular traffic following another accident at Devadar bridge involving a lorry and a bus. Tanur fire station officer Rajendra Nath M said that half of the fuel in one of the three chambers – estimated to be around 2000 litres – was spilt on the road. There was 12,000 litres of fuel in the tanker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/tanker-hits-electric-post-fuel-spills-onto-streets/articleshow/86796545.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Dasara deadline for tests slammed by government teachers||HYDERABAD: The government school teachers have decried the state’s hurry to finish formative assessment 1 (FA1) before Dasara vacations without keeping in mind the academic limitations due to the pandemic. Consequently, hardly any government school has met the deadline and teachers said it would have been better if authorities had planned it after Dasara vacation, allowing both educators and students enough time to prepare. While the academic calendar released by the Telangana government for class 1 to class 10 said that FA1 should be completed by October 5 before Dasara vacation, many schools have completed only the baseline test, which is generally conducted during the beginning of the academic year. Schools are now considering the baseline test as a slip test, which is part of FA1. “We completed FA1 only for class 10. Even for them, the results are not satisfactory,” said Ch Durga Bhavani, a headmistress of a government school in Khammam. Claiming that digital classes cannot be taken into account, she said, “We have to consider September 1 as starting of the academic year. Even then, we are unable to complete the syllabus at a fast pace as we have to explain topics linking them with what they learned earlier.” Teachers said that many schools could complete only the baseline test by September 30, dividing students into ‘can’ and ‘can’t’ to identify those who needed more coaching. They said that it would have been ideal if the state had scheduled FA1 after Dasara as students would have got time to at least complete projects during the vacation. “Most students are not ready to appear for these exams,” said M Ravindar, a math teacher working in the city. Teachers said that conducting these exams should not be an issue as there was plenty of gap between FA1 and summative assessment 1 (SA1), which is scheduled for December. However, they said that it would be best to hold them as soon as possible after vacation so that even if schools were to shut again, students could be graded based on these marks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dasara-deadline-for-tests-slammed-by-govt-teachers/articleshow/86794396.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Little space left in Secunderabad Cantonment for kids to play||HYDERABAD: Sports enthusiasts and athletes residing in Secunderabad Cantonment have to travel to neighbouring Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) areas due to a lack of facilities around them. There is no place for them to raise their grievances either as, unlike GHMC, Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) does not have any specific department to monitor sports facilities within its limits. As against 56 playgrounds in GHMC limits, there are barely four or five major playgrounds under SCB limits — in Tirmulgherry, Mudfort, Bolaram and Bowenpally. While the GHMC grants funds for maintaining and improving playgrounds, sports enthusiasts from SCB areas rue that no funds have been allocated for development of sports facilities in their neighbourhood. “While GHMC has a dedicated sports funds to conduct summer camps, tournaments in addition to equipment and uniform, SCB has not granted any funds over the past few years. Right from electricity bills to conducting tournaments, we have to either depend on private sponsorships or have to spend from our own pockets,” said T Sudheer, physical director, Cantonment Sports Associations. The disappearance of lung spaces has become an issue reported by several athletes training at grounds in the cantonment. “Technically, every ward should have a playground with coaches and proper equipment. While there is enough land under SCB limits, they are not being utilised. Over the years, we have seen open spaces being captured in the name of real estate development. If children don’t have place to play, where will they go?” quizzed Jampana Pratap, a senior leader from SCB who regularly facilitates tournaments at SCB playgrounds. A few years back, there was a huge outcry from residents over the diversion of a part of the Mudfort ground to set up a waste collection and segregation point. The issue, which persisted for years, was only cleared a few days back by the Cantonment Board authorities. “I have been training at the Bowenpally and Mudfort ground for the past 24 years. Before the pandemic, almost 100 students would come on a daily basis to these two grounds to learn football, wrestling, cricket among other sports. Almost 15 to 20 days back when the Cantonment Board’s chief executive officer visited the ground, the waste was completely cleared,” said DG Jagadish, a resident of Bowenpally. Officials said that the SCB had sanctioned ₹15.07 lakh towards maintenance and repairs to buildings for construction of compound wall at Bowenpally playground during a board meeting held in October last year. “The work order for this has been issued. The contractor has been asked to commence the work for Bowenpally playground. As and when we have funds, other playgrounds will also be taken care of,” informed an SCB official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/little-space-left-in-cantt-for-kids-to-play/articleshow/86792727.cms||Preeti Biswas

Ranjan is a non-FIR accused in the case. The girl was brutally murdered after gang rape inside her rented accommodation at Kundwa Chainpur market area. Her family members were forced to create the body the same night. Her parents fled to Nepal after the incident, but later returned and approached the Sikrahna SDPO on whose direction an FIR was lodged on February 2. When contacted, East Champaran SP Naveen Chandra Jha told TOI over phone on Tuesday that a proclamation notice was procured against the accused SI on Monday and it has been executed by pasting at his residence under Ishuapur police station area in Saran district. "We will attach his property soon. Three days back, police attached the property of another accused, Devendra Sah," Jha said. "The parents were called to Motihari on Tuesday with the help of the Nepal administration. Their blood samples have been collected. It would be sent for DNA matching with the charred human remains at forensic laboratory in Patna," he said. The SP said the forensic experts had collected some charred remains from the spot where the girl had been cremated. Jha said the 11 accused in the case were still in jail and police have filed chargesheet against them. "Only the suspended former SHO and Sah are evading arrest," he said. It was an alleged call recording of Ranjan, which had brought the case into limelight; that how he allegedly connived with the accused. Ranjan could allegedly be heard directing the accused to arrange woods for cremation. He was also heard directing them not to bring parents to the police station and take a written complaint from them that she had died of cold. TOI doesn’t authenticate the audio clip. Ranjan was suspended soon after that audio clip came to light. Earlier, he had tried to misguide his seniors claiming that the case seemed to be suspicious.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/8-months-on-cop-yet-to-be-arrested-in-nepal-girls-rape-murder-case/articleshow/86791615.cms||Chandra Bhushan Pandey
---||Jaipur||3 cops among 4 arrested in REET cheating cases: Rajasthan Police||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan police on Tuesday arrested four accused, including three police constables, in two separate REET cheating cases. In the first, police arrested three persons, identified as Paramveer Singh (35), a resident of Bharatpur district and currently posted as a constable in Dholpur police line; Digambar Singh (30), a resident of Sewar in Bharatpur and posted in Sawai Madhopur police line; and Jai Veer Singh (20), a second-year B.Ed student based in Bharatpur. Police said that all the three accused were linked to the Sawai Madhopur cheating racket in which the REET question paper had allegedly reached an accused before the exam on September 26 and led to the arrest of a total of 13 accused, so far. They, however, did not reveal the exact role played by the three held on Tuesday in the racket. Meanwhile, the chief accused in the same case, identified as one Batti Lal Meena, is currently on the run. Sources said that only Meena’s arrest would reveal the identity of the “mole” that passed the paper to him before the exam. In the second case, the Dausa police arrested police constable Manish Sharma, posted in the district’s police line. According to police, a 40-year-old person had filed a complaint that he had applied for REET and Sharma had contacted him about 15 days before the exam, offering the question paper for Rs 15 lakh. Sharma directed him to come to Jaipur on September 24, two days before REET. The complainant arrived in Jaipur and spoke to Sanjay Meena, also booked in the Sawai Madhopur case, at Sharma’s behest. The complainant claimed that he met Meena in Durgapura area and handed over Rs 2 lakh. The complainant said that he was shifted to a room in Narayan Vihar area on September 25, a day before the exam, and was told that the question paper would be shared with him at night. But he did not receive any paper in advance. He left the house early morning on September 26 to appear for REET. He alleged that after the exam, he demanded his money back from Sharma who returned Rs 99,000 through online transfer. When he demanded the rest of the money, Sharma replied that it was with Meena who refused to return the amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/3-cops-among-4-arrestedin-reet-cheating-cases/articleshow/86796528.cms||---

While people in this age group previously accounted for nearly 5-6 per cent of the overall cases of osteoarthritis, they are now accounting for 20-25 per cent of overall cases now. This debilitating problem, beginning early in life, reduces the quality of life drastically by restricting one’s movement, apart from causing severe pain and swelling. “Osteoarthritis is degeneration of the joints. Osteoarthritis affects various joints of the body, including knees, hips and hands. The condition is progressive,” said Dr Sai Laxman Anne, head of department orthopaedic surgery, KIMS Kondapur. Dr Sai Laxman said that a disturbingly high number of youngsters with stage-2 degeneration were walking into the OPDs nowadays. “Sitting jobs, lack of exercises, weight gain and low exposure to sunlight are the main reasons for osteoarthritis among the youth,” he said. It is best not to avoid any joint pains if they start affecting the way one walks or is restricting normal activity. In such cases, seeking immediate help is important, say specialists. “It happens when the cartilage in the joints starts getting damaged. In youngsters, old neglected injuries is often the cause but nowadays we are seeing many cases among people who are just 30 years. Junk food and fried food are rich in oxidants and harmful for the cartilage. Also, obesity is a high risk factor for osteoarthritis,” said Dr Saketh Kolla, consultant joint replacement and regenerative orthopaedic surgeon, Gleneagles Global Hospital. While previously, onset of osteoarthritis was seen among people in the age group of 55-60, but this has changed of late. “While osteoarthritis is not reversible in later stages, if detected early, it could be controlled with medication, physiotherapy, cartilage supplements and lifestyle changes. Progression of the disease can be stopped,” said Dr Kaushik Reddy, consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Apollo Hospitals. Dr Kaushik said he comes across at least 10 patients in their 30s every month. “The numbers are only increasing. We are also seeing a lot of cases of patella-femoral arthritis, which is inflammation of the knee cap, among younger patients,” he said. He attributes this to obesity. “In such cases, arterial knee pain is seen. Although they may not have pain while walking, pain is felt while squatting or using the stairs,” he explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/osteoarthritis-in-youth-a-concern-docs/articleshow/86794536.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||India||Mega outreach: Shah to open first edition of J&K cultural fest this month||NEW DELHI: Union minister for home affairs and cooperation Amit Shah will inaugurate the first edition of Jammu & Kashmir cultural and tourism festival during his visit to the Union territory from October 23 to 25 as part of the Centre’s ongoing mega outreach programme. The festival, which will be simultaneously observed in both Jammu region and Kashmir Valley, seeks to celebrate the rich cultural heritage of J&K, including the ‘Sufi’ culture that has deep roots in Kashmir. Shah, who shall be touring J&K for the first time after abrogation of Article 370 and will cover both Jammu and Kashmir divisions, will hold a comprehensive review of the security situation and progress of ongoing development initiatives there. He will be inaugurating the maiden edition of J&K cultural and tourism festival – on the lines of similar events organized by most states with good tourism potential – though the venue, which could be a houseboat, a convention centre or even a scenic tourist spot like a fort, is still being finalized. The J&K cultural and tourism festival will see a host of cultural programmes and performances being organized over 3-4 days not only at the popular tourist spots but also the lesser-known but equally scenic backdrops like forts, palaces and temples across J&K. For instance, the events and performances planned as part of the festival may be set in Sher Garhi palace in Srinagar or Mubarak Mandi and Bahu Fort on the banks of Tawi River, which is also being developed on the lines of Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad, in Jammu. All these palaces were either built or restored by Dogra rulers. “The idea is to promote these venues as tourist destinations even as we try to revive the rich cultural heritage of J&K by organizing Sufi-themed events …Sufi culture of Kashmir appears to have taken a backseat over the years,” a government officer told TOI. Home ministry sources said Shah would lay foundation stones of or launch projects in both Jammu and Kashmir divisions, besides meeting delegations of people’s representatives comprising elected members of panchayats and district development committees, tribal groups like Bakarwals and local business/trade associations to hear their concerns. The security review in Srinagar is expected to take stock of the terrorism-related incidents in J&K; pickup in infiltration, particularly in North Kashmir; and radicalization of youths in J&K. The review will be attended by the entire security brass of J&K, including from the Army, Central para-military forces, intelligence agencies as well as the J&K police. The Union government’s public outreach programme, which started on September 10, comprises visits by 70 Union ministers to different parts of J&K over nine weeks to review ongoing projects related to their respective ministries and launch new projects. All ministers will be submitting a report on their respective visits to the home ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mega-outreach-shah-to-open-first-edition-of-jk-cultural-fest-this-month/articleshow/86798422.cms||Bharti Jain

Sources said Bali was sent on a two-day police remand on Tuesday. The investigation has revealed that Bali had asked his associate, Naveen Hooda alias Bhanja, to arrange for a shooter to kill gangster Jitender Gogi. Bhanja then hired a man, code-named Nepali, for the job, who came to the court dressed as a lawyer on September 24. Rahul and Jagdeep, the two shooters allied with gangster Sunil Maan alias Tillu Tajpuria, facilitated Nepali’s entry and tasked him to shoot Gogi if they failed and police took him out of the courtroom. The trio was supposed to escape in a getaway car in which their aides, Vinay and Umang, were waiting outside the court. The plan went haywire with cops killing the two shooters. Nepali fled the spot by mixing with the crowd. Vinay and Umang drove away in panic, but were arrested later from their flat. Cops want to quiz Bali and Bhanja to ascertain the identity and whereabouts of Nepali. Bhanja is on the run and teams are conducting raids to nab him. Earlier, Tillu had been interrogated. He had planned the shootout from Mandoli Jail. Other gangsters like Suneel Rathi are also on the radar of investigators. Rahul used to work for Rathi, but had joined the Tillu gang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rohini-court-shootout-police-question-gangster-after-obtaining-2-day-custody/articleshow/86794291.cms||---

On Monday when schools and junior colleges reopened, more than 40% of the 4.5 lakh students from classes 8 to 12 attended in the city. A big chunk of the 1.8 lakh students were from Class 10. Principals said more parents of Class 10 students have given consent for attendance than classes 8 and 9. A day after schools reopened, more parents were willing to give their consent, said principals. Schools have begun chalking out plans to conduct their first semester exams in the offline mode. In the last academic year (2020-21), all exams were held online. “Both parents and students want offline exams. We will have physical exams from October 21,” said Sajitha Venugopal, principal, Cosmos High School and Junior College, Bhandup. Around 68% of students have consented to attending physical school. “Over 90% Class 10 students are attending physical school in batches,” said Venugopal. The seriousness of the students was evident when all got to school on Tuesday, a day after the formal reopening that saw them being welcomed with flowers and music. Vidyamandir school in Dahisar will have their offline exams from October 16. “Considering the good response to physical school, we will hold a pen-and-paper exam,” said principal Sudhir Desai, who had around 60% parents consent for classroom learning. Few schools may hold offline exams after Diwali. “We will think of offline preliminary exams for Class 10 and 12 students in November. Right now let the children just enjoy getting back to school,” said Mahima Raheja, principal, K J Khilnani High Cchool and Junior College, Mahim. BMC had given permission to non-state boards like Cambridge, IB, CBSE and CISCE to conduct physical exams for classes 10 and 12. Some of the schools that reopened are likely to shut in coming days to conduct online exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-schools-gear-to-hold-1st-offline-exams-since-march-last-year/articleshow/86794252.cms||Sandhya Nair

The 24-year-old Thane student pursuing higher studies at Dublin University in Ireland lost Rs 5.2 lakh to a cyber fraudster who forced him to transfer the amount to keep it ‘safe’ from hackers. The student, who holds a joint account with his mother in a Thane bank, received a call on September 23, and the caller identified himself as a government officer from Ireland. The caller told the victim that since he had visited some objectionable websites prohibited in the US, he had been exposed to hackers who could now siphon off his savings from his bank account. The imposter then convinced the victim to transfer the money to his account as a preventive measure. When the student informed his mother about the transfer, she immediately registered a complaint with the Chitalsar police station. “After the case was registered, investigators sought details of the bank account where the victim had transferred the money. As the probe widened, it was learnt that the account belonged to a branch in New Delhi’s Rohini sector,” said Dr Vinay Rathod, DCP (zone-5). Police immediately communicated to the bank through e-mail and informed them about the fraud. They were told to freeze the account and transfer the amount back to the victim’s account. Action was taken in the nick of time since it woud have been difficult to recover the money had the accused transferred it to another account, said a police officer. Police are now trying to identify and trace the accused involved in the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-student-gets-back-rs-5l-lost-online-to-ireland-official/articleshow/86794281.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

The department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) on Tuesday released the ratings of industrial parks and SEZs, Industrial Park Rating System (IPRS) 2.0, in the country. As per the list, 41 parks were rated as leaders, with Rajasthan accounting for 17 (41%) of them. Eighteen such parks are from Maharashtra. For land availability, Rajasthan came fourth (19.58 lakh hectares), not far behind Tamil Nadu (21.45 lakh hectares), the top state in the category. In the report, minister of commerce and industry Piyush Goyal said, “These insights will not only empower investors to make conscious decisions regarding investment, but also provide policy makers guidance to focus on strengthening the existing ecosystem.” The IPRS 2.0 used 45 parameters such as external and internal infrastructure, business support services and environment and safety to assess investor-friendly facilities. Besides the response of park developers, the rating also evaluated the feedback of tenants or industrial units operating there. A RIICO official said, “RIICO has set high standards in the country in providing the best infrastructure, logistics, and common facilities. This is going to be a key differentiator when investors look for location to ground their investment.” In the special economic zone (SEZ) ratings, the Mahindra World City Jaipur found a place in the leaders category. In product-specific parks, Rajasthan secured No. 1 position in four sectors out of 21. The textile parks in the state have the largest used or occupied area than any other park in the country. Similar is the case with gem and jewellery, software, and construction parks in the state. In all, 449 parks and SEZs were nominated for the rating. They were rated under the categories of leaders, challengers and aspiring. Due to the criteria, 365 industrial parks and SEZs were rated in the report developed by DPIIT with the help of Asian Development Bank (ADB).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/showing-the-way-17-raj-industrial-parks-rated-leaders-in-the-country/articleshow/86796583.cms||---

The seat has been a stronghold of Congress for the past four decades. This is the second victory of the AIMIM candidate in Bharuch. During the municipal elections in 2020, Fahim Sheikh had won from Ward 10.

Meena on Tuesday shot three separate letters one each to chief minister Ashok Gehlot, Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education chairman DP Jaroli and the Special Operations Groups (SOG). In thd letter to Gehlot, he alleged that two exam centres, DS Science Academy and Gyandeep School in Gangapur city, which is at the epicentre of the cheating scams, have a dubious past. “Both the schools were earlier running under one society. Several complaints pending against them were ignored and allowed to hold exams,” said Meena. In a second letter, Meena questioned the appointment of JK Mathur as the in-charge of the confidential cell of REET. “Mathur has been involved in malpractices related with the two schools in question in Gangapur City. His position in REET raises questions on his involvement behind the cheating scam,” said Meena. In a letter to the SOG, Meena has attached documents allegedly pointing fingers at the state government and the RBSE. Raising the issue, BJP state president Satish Poonia said even the SOG, the investigating agency, has said paper had reached four persons/candidates. “The government should tell us what criteria they have followed to declare a paper leak. Has paper getting leaked to four persons does not qualify as paper leak? If the paper has not leaked, why people are being arrested and suspended?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-mp-meena-writes-to-cm-rbse-over-reet-leak/articleshow/86796611.cms||---

But those at the bus stand at Bevoor village of Bagalkot paint a different picture — they spend time at the digital library set up by Bevoor GP. Though the library has not been officially inaugurated, it has started attracting college students and the general public in hordes.Vijay Kotin, panchayat development officer (PDO) of Bevoor GP, told TOI that the library building, measuring 15x60 sqft, was built using MPLAD funds. “As it was in pathetic condition, we renovated and refurnished it at a cost of Rs 1.06 lakh. We also digitalised the library using a Mint Box. Forty people can access the digital library at a time,” he said. As Bevoor is an education centre for students from 8-10 surrounding villages, hundreds of them come here for nursery to degree classes. “We saw most of them spending more screen time, either chatting or browsing. So we thought of digitising the library six months ago. We now have 12,000 books on Mint Box and over 3,000 books. We have requested the district library officials to sanction 1,000 books,” he explained.Librarian Ashok Hosamani said the facility remains open from 9am to 5.30pm. “We have 1,000 registered members who borrow books for reading at home. For those with a smartphone, we allot a password so they can browse our books. Mint Box works like WiFi and offers 12,000 books (80% Kannada and the rest English) of varied genres — stories, novels, biographies, autobiographies, those on competitive exams and news websites. After digitalisation, many students are coming here to read. As the Mint Box connectivity is available in 100m radius, students read while sitting on benches at the nearby General GG Bevoor Memorial,” he stated.Farmers too visit the library to read agriculture-related books which are in Kannada.Gyanesh Diddibagil, a II PU student, said they visit the library instead of wasting time in browsing and chatting. “It has about 35 chairs and four large tables. Separate sections for men, women and children make everyone comfortable,” he said.The GP authorities have requested publishers and the public to donate good books for the benefit of students and the people of Bevoor and surrounding villages. “Books can be sent to The PDO, Gram Panchayat, Bevoor-587115, Bagalkot taluk and district. We will acknowledge the gesture by putting up donors’ name prominently at the library,” PDO Kotin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bevoor-gp-offers-students-constructive-screen-time/articleshow/86789610.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

In the first phase, the 6km encroachment-free wall will be renovated. It has been a long-standing plan of JMC-Heritage to renovate the wall that is being encroached upon and in a dilapidated condition. The total length of the wall is 18km, but only 6km is encroachment free which is easier to maintain. The other part will take time and manpower to get thousands of people away from it. A senior corporation official on condition of anonymity said, “We have taken up this project to renovate the Wall which has both the sides free from encroachment. A file for financial sanction has been sent to Directorate of Local Bodies and once it is confirmed we will invite the tenders. Around Rs 19 crore will be needed to repair the 6km long wall.” It has been in the terms of UNESCO to renovate the Heritage Wall the city and remove encroachment. This is however, a challenging task to remove encroachment from 12 km long Heritage Wall. Around Five years back, JMC, Heritage received Rs 30 crore from state archaeological department to remove the encroachment from the Wall but corporation is not been able to utilize it. A senior official of the corporation on condition of anonymity said, “Thousands of people have made permanent houses attaching to the wall. If we ever try to remove all those people, it will be a difficult job and may cause a riot like situation. Hence, we are planning to get extra force or any alternative to get this work done.” Majority of the Heritage Wall is already destroyed over the years and it has become a challenging task for the corporation to repair this. But until the wall is repaired, there is will be always be a risk of losing the World Heritage Tag by the Wall City.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-set-to-shell-out-rs-19cr-to-repair-6km-of-heritage-wall/articleshow/86796618.cms||---

Islam prohibits the use of alcohol. The halal sanitisers used by these shrines will instead contain hydrogen peroxide and colloidal silver. “We will ensure that the SOPs issued by the government are complied with. We will also keep halal or non-alcoholic sanitisers for devotees,” said Sohail Khandwani, managing trustee of Mahim dargah and trustee of Haji Ali dargah. He added that no devotee will be permitted inside the shrines without face masks, and social distancing will be maintained strictly. Both at Haji Ali and Mahim dargahs, separate queues for men and women will be formed for better crowd management. Shoeb Khatib, president of Juma Masjid of Bombay Trust, which manages both Juma Masjid near Crawford Market and Bada Kabrastan at Marine Lines, said that a full-body disinfection machine is being installed at the iconic mosque’s entrance. “Nobody will be allowed to enter the mosque without getting sanitised completely. We will follow all the protocols that the government has issued,” he said. While 30 to 35 people will be allowed to enter Mahim dargah at a time, at the mosques, social distancing will be maintained between worshippers on the prayer mats. “On the prayer mats, adequate space between worshippers will be kept vacant,” explained Khatib. The permission to reopen places of worship comes after a long period of financial crisis, as donations had dried up in the last two years. Mosques and dargahs run mainly on donations, but Khandwani said that even regular donors had curtailed donations substantially as their businesses were severely affected during the lockdowns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mosques-dargahs-to-reopen-with-halal-sanitiser/articleshow/86794357.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

It should be noted that ‘aedes aegypti mosquito’, responsible for spreading the virus, prefers fresh water for breeding. Meanwhile, the health department is conducting spot inspection to identify breeding spots and penalising property owners. Since September 19, after the Ganesh festival was over, a total 3,373 notices were issued to owners of properties where water accumulation was found. Fine of Rs 5.93 lakh was collected from those places where mosquitoes were found breeding. “The positive cases of dengue found in laboratory tests could be less but many patients are found with symptoms of dengue.

Claiming that October 9 marks the “martyrdom day” of “Sukha and Jinda” who assassinated an Indian Army General for heading Operation Bluestar, SFJ says in a statement that the only solution to the “anti-farmer laws” was the “Khalistan referendum” the voting for which it says would begin on October 31 from London. The referendum will be held in Punjab during the 2022 assembly elections, the outfit’s spokesperson and counsel Gurpatwant Singh Pannun further states. Pannun had earlier released a video statement in which he said: “Today four farmers were killed in Lakhimpur, UP. Hundreds of deaths have happened since farmer protests started. The only way out is Khalistan. Kisan Hal Khalistan.” “On October 9, siege Yogi and Ajay Mishra, whose vehicles were used to kill our brothers. Use drones and tractors. Don’t pick up arms... But use legal terror... Put them under house arrest.... Only Khalistan can solve your problems,” US-based Pannun further said. The new video has had agencies on high alert because of the reach and impact Pannun has on his followers. Sikhs for Justice has been on the radar of Indian agencies since January 26 violence in Delhi. In July, Pannun had asked his followers and protesting farmers to “break the country”. The special cell has already filed an FIR against the outfit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/terror-outfit-announces-7-5k-for-lakhimpur-victims/articleshow/86794397.cms||---

Around 190 buildings of Trichy Corporation use the electricity generated by the solar power panels. With the green energy project, the civic body plans to save Rs 58 lakh on its annual electricity expense.The project has been implemented at all the buildings including the central bus stand, offices, primary health centres, Anganwadi centres and sanitary complexes of the corporation that have adequate rooftop space. A combination of monocrystalline and polycrystalline panels was fixed at all the 206 buildings. The main office of Trichy Corporation, which has been equipped with panels to generate 118 kWh (kilowatt-hour) (peak capacity), is the largest facility, while around 65 Anganwadi centres and community toilets each with a capacity to generate 1 kWh were the smallest in terms of capacity. Apart from powering the civic body establishments, the solar power panels have been equipped to supply the surplus power to the grid of Tangedco. During holidays when the offices are closed, the rooftop solar plants can supply surplus electricity to Tangedco through net meters capable of automatically switching between receiving and supplying electricity modes.“During the time of calculating electricity bill, Tangedco will reduce the equal value for the electricity supplied by the panels to their grid. This way, we can reduce the electricity expense significantly,” an official with Trichy Corporation said. Solar power will be utilised for operating motors in sanitary complexes. Lights, fans and even air conditioners can be powered in the offices with solar power. During night hours, the buildings requiring power may shift to conventional electricity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-completes-solar-project/articleshow/86796650.cms||Deepak Karthik

Officials have claimed that while the department had always been working for road safety, there will be more awareness along with increase in the responsibility of each official with the revision of the name. Experts, while appreciating the change in the name, lamented that it might remain a case of ‘what’s in a name?’ if no actual work is done on the ground regarding road safety. Moreover those working for road safety also claimed that the state should work towards making a Road Safety Authority instead of just renaming an existing department. State transport minister Pratapsingh Khachariyawas, who had been pushing for the name revision said, “The name change will work to create awareness among people as well as officials who would strive towards curbing accidents particularly on national highways which is a cause of major concern for us.” While the transport department is the nodal agency for road safety and even has a special cell for the same according to the guidelines issued by Supreme Court Committee, officials claimed that they are regularly taking measures to curb accidents though experts claimed that a lot still could be done. Explaining this, Ashwini Bagga, a road safety expert and former consultant transport department said, “The road map approved by the CM says we should strengthen the existing mechanisms and get adequate number of people who can work on the ground at divisional or district levels. Few states have got a road safety authority, which is an autonomous body that has its own powers and works as a dedicated body just for safety.” Recently, the department issued a notification for a scheme to study the causes and conduct analysis of accidents caused by motor vehicles in order to develop wayside amenities on highways and create traffic-aid posts. Nidhi Singh, deputy transport commissioner (road safety) added, “The road safety cell continuously keeps taking fresh initiatives and now there is a Road Safety Board at the national level, which might soon be replicated in states also in which case it is better to have just one body rather than multiple ones working towards the same purpose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transport-dept-gets-new-name-to-focus-more-on-road-safety/articleshow/86796656.cms||---

Addressing a protest rally against Lakhimpur violence at the PCC office in Jaipur, Gehlot said people who ask where is the Congress should know “it is in every house and village of the country.” “The DNA of Congress and India is same,” he said claiming that Modi's graph is on the decline and people will bring back Congress in the next election.  “Fascist forces will come and vanish, but Congress has been running since the time of Mahatma Gandhi,” he said.  “The graph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is coming down and people have understood that there is a difference in his words and deeds,” the chief minister said. Following the AICC’s coordinated protests on the Lakhimpur issue, Punjab CM’s visit to Jaipur and Gehlot’s cabinet meeting were called off on Tuesday. Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot demanded a probe into violence in Lakhimpur Kheri by a sitting judge of the Supreme court. “The inquiry should be conducted by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court because people have no trust that the state agencies will get them justice in the matter,” Pilot said during his Tonk visit. Gehlot hit out at BJP governments at the Centre and in UP on Tuesday over the killing of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri, saying democracy was under "threat" in the country. Gehlot said the video of the incident shared by Priyanka Gandhi is sufficient to substantiate the charges but no arrests have been made. Priyanka on Tuesday shared a video which showed a group of protesting farmers being mowed down by an SUV. "The situation is dreadful. What happened in Lakhimpur Kheri is not a small thing; this has shaken the whole country," Gehlot said. The senior Congress leader urged people to come forward as democracy was under "threat" in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/people-will-replace-dictator-modi-govt-with-cong-gehlot/articleshow/86796644.cms||---

DCP (crime) Digant Anand said SIM cards from different states are brought to Rajasthan and used in a range of cyber offences including sextortion and online cheating. The crime branch on Monday arrested two persons from Bharatpur district for their alleged involvement in operating a widespread sextortion racket. Police learned during the interrogation that both the accused had SIM cards of Assam, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. “Vendors of network companies act as the lynchpin of the entire racket. They rotate SIM cards between different states,” an official said. Police said they have sought information from network companies and authorities about roaming mobile numbers, which are not active in their sanctioned circles. Police have also asked about those phone numbers where there is a glut of outgoing calls but only a few income calls. Police said these details are important to inch closer to the whereabouts of cyber crooks. “Cybercriminals rarely use SIM cards which are generated from within their states. This impedes interception and makes surveillance an arduous task for us,” an official said, adding that they have written to all major mobile service providers about illegal customers. Sources said Mewat region of Alwar and Bharatpur acts as a hub of illegal SIM cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sim-cards-from-other-states-being-used-for-crimes-in-raj/articleshow/86796659.cms||---
---||Kochi||Realty sector shows signs of revival in Kochi||KOCHI: Land acquisition for mega projects like Gift City, Silverline semi high-speed rail, NH-661 widening and construction of new roads like Angamaly-Kundannoor NH bypass road has given a push for real estate sector in Kochi. Real estate agents have already started procuring land parcels in the suburbs of the city as well as eastern parts of the district in anticipation that those evicted for these projects may soon make a beeline for purchasing holdings. Land acquisition for the widening of NH-66 (old NH-17) into a six-lane road is in its final stages while the notification for acquiring 144 hectares in Ayyampuzha for Gift City has been issued on October 4. Procedures for land acquisition for the Silverline project and Angamaly-Kundannoor NH bypass road have already been started. “We are all set to expedite the land acquisition for the widening of NH-66. Of the Rs 1,200 crore earmarked for the acquisition in eight villages in the district, we have already disbursed Rs 9 crore to the landowners,” officials with revenue department said. “We have arranged everything for giving compensation to the landowners within seven days of submitting all the original documents. The landowners will get up to a maximum of Rs 40.9 lakh per cent as compensation, including solatium,” officials said. This will create an immediate spurt in demand for land as the evictees will be on a purchasing spree. Normally, the evictees would be preferring the suburbs or eastern parts of the district as the land in those areas will be comparatively cheap. Sensing a surge in the demand, the real estate agents has started buying land in Angamaly, Perumbavoor, Puthenkurishu and Aroor areas. The realtors expect a boom in the housing sector as well. “Growing demand can be expected mostly in affordable housing sector. The sector will be flourishing in the suburbs. More real estate projects may come up in Angamaly, Aluva, Perumbavoor, Vaikom and Aroor areas,” said Ravi Jacob, president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations in India (Credai), Cochin chapter. Similarly, there may be a spike in the demand for land parcels along Angamaly-Kundannoor NH bypass. Once the bypass becomes a reality, commerce and business on either side of the road will flourish. This will lure more investors to put in money in land holdings along the stretch. Real estate sector in Kochi, like other areas, had been facing a slump for the past few years. Floods in 2018 and the pandemic had caused negative growth in the real estate sector. Now, the real estate sector in Kochi city and suburbs have already started to show the signs of revival. At the same time, the work from home culture which is a “by-product” of the pandemic may affect the construction of new apartment complexes in IT hubs and such potential areas where realty would have flourished otherwise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/realty-sector-shows-signs-of-revival/articleshow/86791919.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

He completed Bachelors in Business Administration (BBA) from his native country and came to India in 2018 on a visitor visa. His visa has expired and he was staying illegally in the country. “He got upto Rs 3,000 per match and it was his main source of income when he came on visitor visa to India. But later he developed contacts with the accused and he started providing bank accounts to transfer the fraud money,” said Y A Gohil, assistant commissioner of police, cybercrime.  Police had earlier arrested Toty Dago Gregoire Kouduo Toti Augustin (33) of Ivory Coast and Tikendrajeet Dhirnchandra Bora (30), a native of Assam from Bengaluru. The third accused Gregory Yermadeh (32), a native of Nigeria was caught from Faridabad. Toty developed websites that looked similar to leading hospitals in the country where the scamsters posted advertisements looking for kidney sellers. The complaint was lodged on July 13 by Arbaz Rana, (25), a car reseller, who was duped between September to October 2020. Rana told police that there was no business since the past three years and he wanted to get his sister married for which he needed money. Due to the financial crisis, he decided to sell off his kidney and make quick money. Investigation revealed the accused offered Rs 4 crore to Rs 7 crore for a kidney on fake websites of top hospitals like Manipal Hospital, Apollo, Max Super Speciality, Lilavati, Tata Memorial, Garden City, Fortis and others. They also created fake websites for forex trading and bitcoin investment. Tory created fake websites offering jobs in airlines, agriculture, oil and gas, construction, dairy and courier delivery sectors in the UK, Canada and USA. The accused used four e-mail IDs that look similar to IDs of RBI officials to convince victims that it is not fake. Trusting one of these websites, Rana contacted a Whatsapp number given in on the site in September 2020. The woman on the other end introduced herself as Dr Shilpa Kumari of Manipal Hospital in Bengaluru. Police claimed that it was a fake identity given by the woman.

---||Trichy||Nutrition centre with forged FSSAI licence sealed, 2 held||Trichy: Two people, who faked the licence issued by the Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), were arrested by the city crime branch (CCB) police in Trichy on Monday, more than six months after they absconded. Meanwhile, the nutrition centre run by one of the accused, for which the fake licence was procured, was sealed on Tuesday evening by a team led by designated officer (DO) of food safety and drug administration department, Trichy Dr R Ramesh Babu. The accused were identified as R Bhuvaneswaran alias Bhuvaneswar, 41, of Mela Sridevi Mangalam and his friend B Balasubramanian, 50 of Nehruji Nagar in Ariyamangalam. The accused had created a bogus FSSAI licence for a nutrition centre run by Bhuvaneswaran in Puthur. They were arrested on charges of criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery for purpose of cheating, forging the document and criminal conspiracy under IPC. A search is on for another accused hailing from Bengaluru.“The accused were absconding ever since the case was booked. They were finally arrested yesterday (Monday). The search is on for one more accused in the case,” CCB inspector Kosalairaman told TOI on Tuesday. The case was filed by the CCB based on a complaint by the DO Babu on March 31. Babu said that Bhuvaneswaran brought an FSSAI licence, which required his signature. When Babu verified the licence, he found that the FSSAI license number started with the state code no. 128 instead of Tamil Nadu’s state code 124. “I had a doubt on the genuineness of the number. After sending him back, I verified and found it to be a fake one,” he said. The FSSAI licence number mentioned in the copy was that of a food business operation in Hooghly, West Bengal. Further investigation by the police revealed that Bhuvaneswaran had to get his FSSAI license renewed. Since the usual process would take more than a month’s time, he sought Baskar’s help, who connected him with the Bengaluru-based man to create the fake licence.Babu said that the application for new and renewal of licence and registration can be processed 60 days after due verification. “Instead of following the system, he violated it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/nutrition-centre-with-forged-fssai-licence-sealed-2-held/articleshow/86796634.cms||---

Thackeray was speaking while releasing the gene bank reports prepared during the last 6-7 years of research on traditional knowledge on crop genetic diversity, sponges, livestock, grasslands, freshwater aquatic native cow breeds, etc. Funded by Rajiv Gandhi Science & Technology Commission (RGSTC), it is a collaborative work of the Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER), Pune, National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa, and National Centre for Cell Science (NCSS), Pune, Shivaji University, Kolhapur, & College of Fisheries, Ratnagiri, with the participation of 13 NGOs. Releasing the various reports in the presence of a battery of officials and Dr Anil Kakodkar, chairman of RGSTC, Thackeray said, “To face the climate change challenges, it is pertinent to protect biodiversity may be crop, seeds, fish, livestock, grasslands, etc. The Maharashtra Gene Bank has prepared the ground and now we have to take it forward with the coordination of all. It will give a new direction.” “We will have to prepare concrete action plans to which extent we want to go. Norway has protected many rare seeds. In Britain, there is a museum of such biodiversity-protected species where many students and researchers pay visits for learning. We too need to work on the same lines,” said Thackeray. Over 30 NGOs and institutions like IISER have generated data on traditional knowledge on crop genetic diversity, sponges, livestock, grasslands, freshwater aquatic native cow breeds like Dangi, Lal Kandhari, Gaulau, and Sangamneri, besides Berari goat and Satpudi hen, for identifying superior animals for breeding purposes. Modern genetic tools were also used to identify the genetic relations between different breeds. “We took special efforts to reach out to the people and community-based organizations (CBOs) at the grassroots, blending science and technology tools and scientific validation. Providing livelihood and nutrition benefits to marginal communities and creating field evidence and multi-institutional partnerships across the state,” says Dr VS Rao, project coordinator, IISER. “In these 6-7 years, the project achieved significant contributions in biodiversity documentation and conservation, livelihood generation and sustainable utilization of resources in agricultural crops, native livestock breeds, grasslands, forest eco-restoration, management of forest produce, wild edible plants, freshwater, and marine ecosystem,” said Pravin Srivastava, member-secretary, MSBB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cm-calls-for-budgetary-support-to-gene-bank/articleshow/86791939.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Delhi||Artificial pump removed as 56-yr-old’s own heart recovers||New Delhi: In a rare success, a 56-year-old Iraqi patient regained his heart function after being on the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) — an artificial heart pump — for over one year. The device helps the failing heart and aims to restore normal blood flow. Chairman of Fortis Heart and Vascular Institute in Noida Dr Ajay Kaul said the patient was in a serious condition when he was rushed to India in 2018. “His heart function was so poor that he couldn’t perform daily activities and couldn’t breathe properly. We put him on a heart transplant list. While waiting for the donor heart, his condition deteriorated further and it became so critical that he had to be put on LVAD,” he explained. Normally, the left ventricle, one of our heart’s four chambers, pumps blood into the aorta (the large artery leaving the heart) and around the body. In case of the Iraqi patient this wasn’t possible as his heart was too weak to pump enough blood around the body. LVAD implantation is a major surgery attaching one end of the device to the left ventricle and the other end to the aorta. Blood flows from the ventricle into the LVAD. The device pumps the blood out into the aorta, where it then flows to the rest of the body. Dr Kaul said that LVAD is usually considered a bridge to heart transplant meaning it sustains the heart function until a donor heart is available for transplant. However, in this case, they found during a routine check-up that the patient’s heart had recovered about a year after the device was implanted. “The speed of the pump was reduced and the patient was monitored for another 1.5 years. In the beginning of 2020, the tests seemed to indicate that the heart was completely healed. We then decided to stop the device completely. The patient’s heart condition was checked every three months with and it showed his heart was working just fine without needing the device,” he added. A decision was taken to remove the LVAD last month. The Fortis hospital doctors said this was perhaps the first case of ex-plantation or removal of the LVAD from a patient following a full-recovery of heart function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/artificial-pump-removed-as-56-yr-olds-own-heart-recovers/articleshow/86794465.cms||---

---||Agra||UP: Firozabad hospital lines up 32 patients on NH pavement, sealed; toll touches 265||AGRA: Shocking visuals of over 30 fever patients, lying on the pavement with intravenous drip bottles attached to the wall of a busy flyover on the national highway, sent the health department in UP’s Firozabad scurrying for answers as it hurriedly nixed the licence of the private hospital which was "treating"them. However, as authorities were sealing the hospital on Tuesday afternoon, health department officials had to face the ire of the family members of the patients lying in the open. With the number of dengue patients crossing 4,800 since August, and all government hospitals running out of beds, the kin of patients -- mostly children and elderly -- had nowhere else to go. They demanded that health official provide them an alternative. Videos of the incident were widely shared on social media. Later, the patients were taken to government health centres. With four more deaths in the last 24 hours, the toll in Firozabad district -- the hub of UP’s dengue outbreak -- touched 265 on Tuesday. Of these, 228 were children. According to sources, when the hospital was packed with patients, staff there made "arrangements" for patients on the footpath of the National Highway-2 service lane. A local resident said, “Every house in the locality has at least one bed-ridden patient with viral fever and dengue-like symptoms. Six people have died in the last one week. Doctors are not available at government health centers. Private centers are fully occupied. People have been reaching private centers with cots and mattresses to get treatment.” Chief medical officer (CMO) of Firozabad district, Dr Dinesh Kumar Premi, said, “The nursing home has been sealed. A committee headed by an additional chief medical officer is investigating the matter. All the patients have been taken care of now. On the basis of the probe report, suitable action will be taken against the doctor.” Sources told TOI that at least 25,000 people in the district are estimated to be bedridden with fever at home or in private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/firozabad-hosp-lines-up-32-patients-on-nh-pavement-sealed/articleshow/86789682.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Kochi||‘Kochi sees rise in number of street dwellers’||KOCHI: The number of people living on streets during the pandemic has seen a rise, according to district social justice department and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). According to NGOs, as several good Samaritans and organizations are providing free food packets to street dwellers, they are found staying in various corners of the city like Thoppumpady Junction, Palluruthy, Ernakulam Town and South railway station premises, Kadavanthra, KSRTC bus stand and Kaloor stand premises, Palarivattom, Edappally, Jos Junction, etc.  Most orphanages and shelter homes have closed their doors to these people due to fear of infecting other inmates. “There has been an increase in number of street dwellers. Some are gypsies. Also, there are many from other states too. During the Covid lockdown, many have come and ended up in different places,” said district social justice officer K K Subair. “We have rescued around 1,700 people during this Covid period. Of this, around 1,300 people were in Ernakulam. Most of them are from other states like Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Gujarat, Delhi, Bihar and Jharkhand. Currently, 36 inmates in our ‘Theruvuvellicham’ are mostly from these states,” said Murugan, secretary of NGO ‘Theruvoram’, which rescues people from streets. He said that during the lockdown days, they had attended to calls from other districts like Kollam, Kottayam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Kozhikode and Alappuzha. Officials said that one of the biggest challenges they face was shortage of NGOs engaged in rescuing street dwellers. “Most NGOs are reluctant to come and attend to ill people. We hope that once the social volunteers’ policy becomes final, we will be able to get more agencies,” said an official. “One of the most important needs of the hour is having palliative care centres for street dwellers. A good number of people that we could rescue had to be hospitalized. We have taken many to Kottayam and Alappuzha medical college for treatment,” said Murugan. He said that they have had to cut down on going out because one of the two ambulances they had has a breakdown. “We now operate with just one and are not able to reach everywhere on time. There is no shortage of people who need helpsaid Murugan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/city-sees-rise-in-no-of-street-dwellers/articleshow/86791980.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: BJ Medical College hostel block ‘unsuitable’ for use, says report||AHMEDABAD: The ‘C’ block of the ladies’ hostel at BJ Medical College on the Civil Hospital campus is dilapidated and unsuitable for living, according to a report from the executive engineer of the project implementation unit, health, family welfare and medical services, Ahmedabad. The report comes while student protests about the hostel becoming unliveable, sharing photos and videos of ceilings falling apart and cracks on walls, putting students’ lives at risk. There are 136 rooms in the block. According to the report, the hostel building is about 50 years old and tests need to be carried out on its structural capabilities. A team of structural experts should be roped in for this and further action should be taken based on their findings, it says. The report from the structural experts will take two months during which period the college administration should take up renovation after re-locating the girls to a safer place, it said. “In the last fifteen days at least three girls have been injured by chunks of concrete falling off ceilings. One of them suffered a fracture in the leg while another escaped with minor scratches on the hand. A third student also escaped with minor injuries,” said a hostel resident. There have also been cases of electrocution while using the water geyser and in one instance a ceiling fan fell down. No one was hurt in that instance. Waterlogging is another major issue and at times rooms get flooded due to the drainage system being choked. “There girls got dengue due to the water pooling issue,” a student said. The condition of the D block is similar and it too needs urgent repairs. Oman Prajapati, president of the Junior Doctors’ Association said the students took out a protest rally on Tuesday to press their demands. “We will continue our protests till the issue is resolved,” he said. He said that a few years ago the department had come out with a similar report that stressed the need for urgent repairs to the hostel but the recommendations were not implemented. There are just five restrooms for180-odd students and issues related to water supply are very common, due to which students have to go without baths for days together at times. The college authorities submitted a proposal to the state government to replace the old hostel building with a new one, but it has been pending with the state government for three years now, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bj-hostel-block-unsuitable-for-use-report/articleshow/86794460.cms||---

Since the civic body has a big land parcel in the locality where several infrastructure projects including integrated bus terminus (IBT), wholesale market and truck terminal have been proposed, the master plan aims at holistic utilization of the available area.Sources said that a tender was floated to identify a suitable agency to execute the study. It will have parameters for key design and development proposals besides reviewing the existing ones. As Trichy integrated transport hub was planned at Panjapur comprising maintenance yard, multi-level car parking, omnibus stand and a comprehensive mobility plan, the vicinity requires a planned development, officials said. The master plan pursues land classification and will assess water availability, physical features of the land through geomorphology and environmental studies. Officials said Trichy corporation has 575 acres of land in Panjapur on which a slew of proposals have been made. With about 115 acres earmarked for IBT, the remaining land will have a planned infrastructure development. “Except for Panjapur, the civic body does not have a consolidated land parcel,” an official said justifying the need for a master plan. The agency to be identified will conduct infrastructure and utility assessments to suggest compatible infrastructure proposals. Besides the proposed projects, Panjapur was also tipped to receive Trichy trade centre on about 10 acres and a slum clearance board residential project to accommodate high-rises. With such investments lined up, officials said that sustainable development must be ensured for which master plan was vital. Once identified, the agency must complete the study in five months, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corporation-to-have-master-plan-for-panjapur/articleshow/86796673.cms||Deepak Karthik

Hopefully, we will get the final verdict in the case by next week,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nagaur-rape-verdict-likely-next-week/articleshow/86796669.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Buying a pet? Check breeder’s credentials||Moulika KV drives through the city to find how illegal pet breeders have mushroomed, courtesy the steep rise in demand for pedigree dogs. Experts admit to this growing menace and share a dos and don’ts list that every aspiring pet parent must keep handyHYDERABAD: Notwithstanding the strict ban and directives from civic authorities to comply with directives of the Telangana State Board of Animal Welfare, several unregistered pet stores and illegal breeders continue to thrive in the city. A quick search on the internet or a casual visit to the pet shops and reveal the harsh truth behind pet breeding in Hyderabad, which is filled with illegal breeders cashing in on the never-ending demand for pedigree pets. Animal welfare experts working on regulating this illegal trade say that that buying pedigree dogs from breeders, without a proper background check of the pet’s lineage will not only harm the pet but also the person buying. “Dog breeders have been working outside the law for years. They breed foreign breed dogs in filthy conditions, mate dogs as young as six months old with their own parents and bring hundreds of diseased puppies with uncertain tempers into the world, sell them to people and make everyone’s life miserable for years,” said Shreya Paropkari, senior manager of Humane Society International, an NGO that works to prevent cruelty to animals. This Rotweiller was rescued after it was found in a severely malnourished state with an illegal breederThis Great Dane was abandoned after breeders noticed it was born with deformed legs—result of inbreedingAccording to experts more than 90% of dog bites in Telangana as well as in India, as per government statistics, are from owned pedigreed dogs – courtesy this illegal practice. While experts call for a need for stricter implementation of dog breeding regulations in the state, Dr Monika, assistant veterinary director, state animal husbandry department said, “We have received applications for registration from over 75 pet shops in the city so far and prior to that 67 of them were served notices. The concerned officials conduct inspections and only if the inspection report is satisfactory, we issue an inspection certificate.” However, when asked about the illegal breeders and those breeding dogs at home for commercial purposes, a senior GHMC official said, “Within GHMC limits there are only 12 breeders. More than 90% of the dog breeders are outside GHMC limits. If people are breeding dogs at home, we cannot designate them as breeders.” FACT SHEET:Checklist for pet buyers: Ensure the breeder is licensed or registered with the state animal welfare board. Ensure the breeder keeps animals in proper care Practices like mutilating animals’ ears, force-feeding them fluid to make them appear fat, hot branding, cold branding etc should ring alarm bells Ask for medical health records for both the mother and puppy. Other pointers:First-time pet parents be aware of the responsibility Do thorough research before bringing a pet home Understand the dietary, exercise requirements, temperament, life span, breed related health issues etc before taking a decision. It will reduce stress on the pet as well as on person adopting it Look for professional trainer, who uses positive reinforcement methods to train you and your pet, to address behavioural issues from day 1. EXPERT SPEAK:Veterinary experts who are seeing an increase in health and behavioural issues among dogs brought from illegal breeders in the city say that the stories of these dogs stand testimony to all that’s wrong with the implementation of dog breeding regulations in Telangana and elsewhere in the country. “While more and more people are seeking to add a dog to their family, the demand for illegal breeders has also increased tremendously in the city. Around 99% of them, selling dogs or cats, are all illegal breeders. As a result, these dogs not only have increased incidences of inherited diseases but also heightened health issues due to their bodily frames and shapes, such as hip dysplasia in large breeds like the German Shepherd and the Saint Bernard, and patellar luxation, or persistent dislocation of the kneecap, in toy and miniature breeds. —Dr Prateek | Veterinary physician, Canfel pet clinic, Madhapur. TALES OF HORROR:Separated at birth to be sold:When Karishma Kumar, a resident of Moosapet, brought a 13-monthold female English Cocker Spaniel, Byron, into her family she was only 20-days-old. Prior to buying, the breeder had assured Karishma that the pup- py was at least over two months old. “The breeder had separated her at birth, and she had barely opened her eyes by the time I had her in my arms. The veterinarian warned me that due to not receiving her mother’s milk and having changed environments at such a tender age, she stood little to no chance of surviving within the first three months of her life. This resulted in me being over cautious, paranoid and excessively worried almost all the time," recalls Karishma. She said that the repercussions of the breeder’s misdeeds were felt for long afterwards as the puppy was unable to let go of her – acute attachment issues caused by latching on to a human mother very early on. “She has behavioral issues that stem from not having been disciplined by her own mother – something that every dog mom does in the first three months of her pup’s life. The illegal breeder also failed to disclose any legitimacy of his business,” she said adding that this is the reason why we see so many abandoned pets today. "Illegal breeding causes long-term health issues in pets leading to them being left on their own by parents/owners who can’t cope with these issues or nurture them back to health,” Karishma said. ‘Pet has Parvo virus’BBhagya, a resident of Secunderabad, recently bought a one-month-old Labrador Retriever from a breeder in Yapral. Within one week after that, she found that the puppy was infected with Parvo virus. This is highly contagious and can prove to be fatal if not treated. “I was not aware of this illegal breeding business before I brought the puppy home. I got t h e number of this breeder on the internet and blindly trusted her to give me a healthy puppy. I decided to go ahead because the pup looked healthy at that time. I did not know that it was important to check the place and the condition in which other dogs are being kept by the breeder,” said Bhagya. “The puppy’s health, however, deteriorated over the next few days and despite several trips to the veterinarian, it died a slow and painful death,” she added. Bhagya said that the seller was breeding dogs at her home in Yapral. “She had more than 10 dogs and even cats at her place. Some of them were kept in crates. I am sure most of these pets, especially dogs, are sold with distemper or parvo virus. But since the entire trade is in black, the buyer cannot return the dog or demand a refund,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/buying-a-pet-check-breeders-credentials/articleshow/86796663.cms||Moulika.KV

In a letter, the MP stated that forms in respect of the postal savings scheme are in English and Hindi. “This is making it difficult for ordinary people to fill up those forms, forcing them to depend on others for making deposits. Our country is having multi-lingual diversity and government departments have to be sensitive towards making customers comfortable in communications. Regional languages would ensure that,” he said.Venkatesan recalled that money order forms were available in Tamil but were dispensed of with the introduction of digital forms. Payment and withdrawal slips for deposit accounts that were earlier in Tamil are also not available now. Customers have to understand the terms and conditions properly before entering a contract with the department.When they make deposits they are to be informed of obligations on both sides, else it would create complications thereafter and customers would be ultimate victims in those cases. Even big private companies with commercial intent give an option to converse and communicate in regional languages, he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/make-customer-service-postal-forms-available-in-tamil-mp/articleshow/86794433.cms||---

The centres will also be opened even during the holidays, the officials stated.With the help of water released from the Mettur reservoir on June 12 this year, farmers raised Kuruvai paddy in 4.31 lakh acres during this season. In Thanjavur, Kuruvai paddy has been raised in 1.64 lakh acres, while it was 1.37 lakh acres in Tiruvarur and 1.30 lakh acres in Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai districts, officials from the agriculture department said. Kuruvai paddy is ready for harvest in several places where farmers raised their crops using pump sets during April and May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dpcs-in-delta-districts-to-start-functioning-from-7am/articleshow/86796683.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

However, after September 14, when the new payment methods took effect, a total of Rs 6,00,600 was collected as fine between September 15 and 30. Previously, payment of fines through the e-challan system could have been done through the e-challan machine immediately by use of debit or credit card or else the fine had to be paid only at a government e-service centre. However, many violators often left it unpaid because they could not pay through card or did not want to incur commission while paying at an e-service centre. The new payment methods have helped public make payments easier as many have access to digital wallets or at least net banking. “We have been creating awareness among public about the new payment methods available and there has been good response so far. We hope it continues. These methods help them pay without any hassle and not spend much time,” said a traffic police official.Madurai city traffic police have also registered cases against 6,698 people for violations in number plate while action was taken against 171 drivers for driving vehicles without number plate. The vehicles were released after fines were levied and proper number plates were in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/digital-mode-nets-double-traffic-fines/articleshow/86794500.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat government taking sides in religious sect’s factional battles, says high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court castigated the state government for siding with a faction of a religious sect against another and for taking sides in battles related to the elections of the Gadhada Swaminarayan Temple by resorting to externment orders. The case before the high court was the Botad district authorities’ decision to extern two priests of the Gadhada temple — Swami Satyaprakashdasji and Swami Ghanshyamvallabhdasji. The sub-divisional magistrate passed an externment order on May 31, asking both priests to leave six districts — Botad, Bhavnagar, Amreli, Rajkot, Surendranagar and Ahmedabad — and not enter for the next six months. The priests were externed on the district police’s recommendations following bitter disputes between two sides of the Swaminarayan sect — Acharya Paksh and Dev Paksh — ahead of the temple trust elections. The priests challenged the externment in the high court, which stayed the order on June 15. After hearing the case, Justice Paresh Upadhayay criticized the authorities for holding everything against the priests, even their approaching the high court and getting protection against executive orders. The high court noted that the stakes of the temple trust’s election are so high that the issue reached the Supreme Court. Referring to various court orders and the externment order, Justice Upadhyay said, “This further fortifies the prima facie satisfaction of this court that, the State, through its instrumentalities, has been facilitating the battles, including the legal battles, of one side against the other side, including by resorting to externment orders of priests of one group of the same religious sect.” The court also made observations against police officials’ “high-handedness”, which is readily accepted by the revenue authorities through the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in externing the priests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-taking-sides-in-religious-sects-factional-battles-hc/articleshow/86794509.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Eight districts did not report corona cases for 50 days||JAIPUR: Amid apprehensions of the third wave of Covid, state’s eight districts have not reported new infections for over 50 days. The districts are Bundi, Karauli, Chittorgarh, Dungarpur, Banswara, Dausa, Jaisalmer and Prapatgarh. Bundi district on Tuesday achieved the milestone of not reporting a single Covid case for 94 days . The last case reported in Bundi was on July 3. The state had witnessed severe and aggressive second wave in April and May and since then the trajectory of daily new infections started going down. Bundi is the district which has now completed 94 days without reporting even a single Covid infection. Since July 3, over 28,000 samples were tested for Covid in Bundi, but not a single sample tested positive. “Though cases have not been reported in our district for a long time, still we are conducting tests of over 3,000 samples,” said Dr Mahesh Tripathi, chief medical health officer (Bundi). Bundi is one of three districts which have reported lowest number of Covid infections. Dr Tripathi said they had achieved it as they conducted the survey and detected Covid early during the second wave and ensured that the patients got treatment at home for which they provided the medicines to patients at the doorsteps. Karauli district has not reported new Covid infection for the past 93 days. The last case was reported on July 4. Chittorgarh reported its last Covid case on July 23, Dungarpur on July 25 and Banswara on August 5. Dausa and Jaisalmer reported their last case on August 6 and Pratapgarh on August 9.

The new fare has already been implemented in seven major stations. However, rail users have opposed the move saying that the hike will affect them and demanded the railways to reduce it.The decision has been taken by the railway board to prevent a large number of people gathering on the platforms, officials said. Price hike has already been implemented in Trichy, Thanjavur, Kumbakonam, Mayiladuthurai, Villupuram, Puducherry and Virudhachalam stations in the divisions. Now, it has come into effect in Ponmalai, Budalur, Papanasam, Vaithisvarankoil, Sirkazhi, Chidambaram, Cuddalore Port junction, Thirupadripuliyur, Thiruvannamalai, Thirukovilur, Vellore, Thiruverumbur, Tiruvarur, Mannargudi, Nagapattinam, Nagore, Velankanni, Pattukottai, Trichy fort, Trichy town, Ariyalur, Lalgudi, Pennadam, Karaikal, Pantruti, Needamangalam and Srirangam stations. While some of the passengers welcomed the move stating that it would prevent anti-social elements from occupying the station facilities to sleep, some others flayed the decision to increase the fare, especially in rural stations. Senior citizens and women need help to reach the stations and to board the train. Since several stations included in the list are falling under delta districts, people from the agrarian areas will find it difficult to pay such a huge amount, secretary of Train Passengers Association, Papanasam, T Saravanan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rly-platform-ticket-fare-hiked-to-rs-50/articleshow/86796688.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Kin dispute autopsy, agree to cremate 3 after mediation||BAREILLY: For hours on Tuesday morning, families of farmers who died in Sunday’s violence at Banbirpur in Lakhimpur Kheri refused to cremate the bodies after the autopsy reports "did not mention bullet injuries". Over the day, with Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait stepping in and holding talks with the administration, the bodies of three of them were finally cremated and a second autopsy ordered for the fourth. Police, meanwhile, have set up an SIT to investigate charges from both sides. Sources told TOI that the autopsy reports of the four farmers who died on Sunday — Lovepreet Singh, 20, Nachattar Singh, 60, Daljeet Singh, 35, and Gurwinder Singh, 19 — said they had antemortem injuries and did not mention bullet injuries, indicating they died in an accident. The journalist who died, Raman Kashyap, 32, had similar injuries and died of one on his head, the report said. The two BJP workers who died — Shyam Sundar, 32, and Shubham Mishra, 29 — and one driver, Hariom Mishra, had injuries consistent with being beaten to death, the report added. “There was no clarity on when we’d get the autopsy reports and over the FIRs. We didn’t want to cremate him before that. We shared our grievances with Rakesh Tikait and he asked us to stop cremation until police made things clear. We were told a second autopsy would be done,” Gurpej Singh, Lovepreet’s uncle, told TOI. For hours, Kheri SP Vijay Dhull and other officials tried to convince his family to cremate the body but the family refused. Tikait was in Shahjahanpur at the time. Lovepreet was from Bhagwantnagar and Nachattar from Ramdanpurva, both in Lakhimpur Kheri. Tikait arrived at Lovepreet’s village around 1.30pm and spoke to the family. “We were convinced all injuries on Lovepreet’s body were mentioned in the autopsy report. Then, around 3pm, we cremated him,” Gurpej said. Nachattar, too, was cremated in the afternoon. His family had not contested the autopsy findings reported at the time. Families of Lovepreet and Nachattar were handed over cheques of Rs 45 lakh each by the district administration later in the day. At Nanpara in Bahraich, the families of Daljeet and Gurwinder, too, were waiting for word from Tikait. By afternoon, they had received word about the contents of the autopsy report. “My son had a bullet injury. The autopsy report is incorrect. We want justice,” said Gurwinder’s father Sukhwinder Singh. Gurwinder’s family said a bullet hole could be seen near the right ear. Bhartiya Sikh Sangathan president Jasbir Singh Virk and Tikait then held a meeting with ADG (Gorakhpur zone) Akhil Kumar and other senior officials at Nanpara. After a long discussion, a decision was arrived at — Gurwinder’s body would be sent for a second autopsy. “It will be done by three doctors from PGI Lucknow in the presence of two members from Gurwinder’s family. A team will record a video,” Tikait told TOI from Nanpara. The team landed at the reserve police lines in Bahraich and was conducting the autopsy at the time of filing the report. Daljeet, meanwhile, was cremated around 5.30pm after Tikait met his family. By evening, the autopsy reports and the FIRs had been shared with all four families. Two speeding cars from Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni’s convoy had allegedly run over farmers staging a black flag protest on Sunday. The farmers had alleged that Teni’s son Ashish was part of the convoy and gunshots were fired. In the FIR on farmers’ deaths, a copy of which is with TOI, minister Ajay Mishra Teni’s name was not included. “I have not seen the FIR copy but the Union minister’s name was mentioned in the complaint and is part of the FIR. The investigating officer will question everyone mentioned in the complaint,” ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said. “An SIT will investigate the case and work in parallel with the judicial inquiry. It will be led by an additional SP.” Meanwhile, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha leader Tejender Singh Virk, hospitalised with serious injuries, told a news channel that the minister’s son was in a car that ran the farmers over. “We were told at 3 pm that their route had changed. We started going back peacefully. Suddenly, speeding cars hit us from behind. The car was at over 100 km/hour speed. They ran us over on purpose. Ajay Mishra's son and his men were in the car. Then I lost consciousness … I am willing to testify,” he is quoted as saying. In another video shared on social media, he said, “Shots were fired at me after I was run over. I had a narrow escape.” When asked why no arrest had been made yet, a senior cop told TOI, “Negotiations with farmers were going on. Police were ensuring law and order. Action on arrest will follow soon.” (With inputs from Aakash Ahuja in Rudrapur)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kin-of-3-farmers-refuse-to-cremate-bodies-relent-after-tikait-steps-in/articleshow/86792014.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Delhi||Stubble burning may sting again: Nasa data suggests uptick after monsoon||NEW DELHI: Scientists at a scientific organisation associated with Nasa have reported an increase in burning of harvest remnants in the fields in Punjab and Haryana as evidenced by satellite imagery. They have cautioned that the number of the polluting fires could spike following the withdrawal of the monsoon from the region around Delhi. “The 16-day MODIS NDVI data suggests a consecutive year of large rice crop production of around 12.6 million tonne in Punjab and Haryana. In the traditional burning scenario, this harvest volume can potentially lead to around 16,500 post-harvest (October-November) fire occurrences, or the equivalent of the 2020 level,” disclosed Hiren Jethva, aerosol remote sensing scientist at Universities Space Research Association (USRA) at Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center, US. Pawan Gupta, another senior USRA scientist, who analysed VIIRS satellite data between September 1 and October 1, revealed that farm fire events had begun increasing from the last week of September though the numbers were still low. “The consistent cloud and rain over north India are both delaying agriculture waste burning and limiting detection by satellite,” Gupta said. “The fire season is delayed relative to past years, but stubble burning is increasing and as soon as the rain disappears, the regional air quality will be hit.” In the data for September 1-October 3 that he analysed, Gupta observed 268 field fires in Punjab and 47 in Haryana. In comparison, during this period last year, Punjab had already recorded 1,370 fires and Haryana, 245. Gupta considered the caveat, however, that the consistent cloud cover might have restricted the satellite imaging capabilities and the actual fire figures might not be as low. “Due to the cloud cover and rain this year, we may not be detecting all the fires in the region,” he said. Dr M. George, scientist at Delhi Pollution Control Committee, confirmed at a press conference on Tuesday that stubble burning was now visible on satellite images. “We have observed farm fires and they are more prominent across the borders,” said George. Another official said more fires were being seen in Pakistan than in Punjab and Haryana at this time. Last month, the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR (CAQM) had stated that the stubble bio-decomposer solution developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute and tested in Delhi fields last year would be used this winter over six lakh acres in Haryana, one lakh acres in Haryana and 7,413 acres in Punjab. CAQM added that besides the use of the bio-decomposer, Punjab and the NCR states had readied individual action plans to tackle stubble burning. These plans were designed based on specific frameworks created for each state. The commission has directed the strict implementation of these plans in the states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fire-in-sky-stubble-burning-may-sting-again/articleshow/86792006.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Delhi||Fears of riot victim about harassment by cops ‘real, not illusory’, says Delhi court||NEW DELHI: A court has said the apprehension of a victim of the northeast Delhi riots regarding alleged harassment by police in the name of further investigation prima facie seemed to be “real, and not illusory”. The complainant has alleged that in the past 18 months, he was called to the Khajuri Khas police station on at least 50 occasions in relation to the investigation regarding vandalism at his house during the riots. He further alleged that a police official also pressured him to settle the matter by taking compensation from the accused named in the complaint. As he has refused, he is being harassed, the complaint claimed. Chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg said a bare perusal of the draft chargesheet and the case diary showed that the investigation was “far from satisfactory” in as much as no step seemed to have been taken by the investigating officer (IO) to collect call detail records (CDRs) of some accused, though CDRs of others have been collected. “No plausible explanation has been given by the IO as well as the SHO for non-collection of CDRs of all accused,” the court said. It further said the report purportedly received from the DCP (northeast) was “silent” about the status of the investigation. The court noted that the applicant had alleged that the IO was repeatedly serving notices to him to supply the documents submitted by him on two previous occasions, for which he hadn’t got any acknowledgement receipt. His counsel, M R Shamshad, said the victim had taken shelter at some other place since the riots, but police were forcing him to disclose the details. The SHO Khajuri Khas and the IO submitted that “they just want to record the statement of the new landlord... However, the court is unable to comprehend the purpose... when the aforesaid landlord is not a witness to the alleged incident”, the judge said. Under such circumstances, the complainant’s apprehension regarding the alleged harassment by both “prima facie seems to be real, and not illusory”, he added. The court directed the joint commissioner of police, eastern range, to file a comprehensive status report of further investigation under his signature within two weeks. It further directed him to ensure that the probe was carried out by the IO in an unbiased manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fears-of-riot-victim-about-harassment-by-cops-real-not-illusory-says-court/articleshow/86794543.cms||Usha Das

According to the complainant Suresh Solanki, his daughter Vandana consumed poison due to the harassment for dowry by her brother-in-law Vipul Vaghela, sister-in-law Jagu Vaghela, uncle-in-law Mukesh Vaghela and aunt-in-law Gau Vaghela. Vandana and her husband Karan had fled from their homes about six months ago and later their families had agreed for their marriage. However, after marriage, Vandana’s parents had snapped ties with her. As Vandana’s family had not given her any gifts or dowry at the time of the wedding and would never visit her, the in-laws harassed her, Solanki stated in his complaint. On September 21, Vandana had requested a relative of hers to ask her father to take her back. Solanki had then spoken with Vandana and had asked her to deal with the issue patiently. Solanki then asked one Bharat Awaliya, who had mediated between the two families at the time of the wedding, to speak with his daughter’s in-laws. Things settled down temporarily after Awaliya’s intervention. But on October 3, Solanki received a call that Vandana had consumed poison. When Karan learnt about his wife’s act, he too consumed poison. The couple was admitted at Sir T Hospital in Bhavnagar where Vandana succumbed during treatment. When Solanki visited her at the hospital, he noticed that Vandana had even tried to slit her wrist a few days earlier.

The state has guaranteed a loan worth Rs 10 crore to the Rajgad cooperative sugar factory in Pune district controlled by Congress MLA Sangram Thopte and the other loan worth Rs 18 crore to the Sahakar Shiromani Vasantrao Kale sugar factory in Pandharpur controlled by former MLA Kalyan Kale who recently switched from the BJP to the NCP. The guarantee has been extended only for the period of one year. “Pre-seasonal loan guarantees were extended keeping in mind that other factories in Pandharpur have not performed well and the one in Pune is in a location which is quite far from other factories,” said a senior official. Last year, the MVA government had extended guarantees for loans worth Rs 516 crore to 32 sugar factories. The government said cooperative sugar factories were finding it difficult to get loans from cooperative banks after new Nabard guidelines were enforced which required the borrower to have a positive net disposable resource. Officials, though, said only seven of the 32 factories availed of the guarantee given last year since the conditions were too strict. The Rajgad factory had been given a guarantee for a Rs 12 crore loan last year as well. Sugar factories take pre-seasonal loans ahead of the crushing season in October to overhaul machinery and give advances to labour for harvesting and transportation. When the MVA government took over in November 2019, it cancelled guarantees on loans granted by the former BJP-led government to cooperative sugar factories. Sugar and politics is deeply intertwined in Maharashtra, with sugar barons rising to become chief ministers and cabinet ministers. Several leaders from Congress, NCP and BJP control the factories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-govt-guarantees-rs-28cr-loans-to-two-sugar-factories/articleshow/86794549.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

The panchs have stated three reasons for passing the notice. They said that the sarpanch does not take them into confidence on matters. They have also alleged that Borkar did not crack down on illegal constructions in Sancoale and that he has not been handling his duties properly. Naik has called for a no-confidence meeting on October 12 after which elections for the new sarpanch will be held. The panchayat has 11 members, of which Borkar’s wife Sunita is also a member Last year, after a no-confidence motion was passed against Girish Pillai as sarpanch, a panch supported by Cortalim MLA Alina Saldana was to become the new head. Borkar joined hands with Dabolim MLA and panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho to become sarpanch. With only a few months for the next assembly polls, panchayat members backed by Saldanha and Godinho have come together to vote Borkar out of office.

The capital already has 13 hotspots, which were declared on the basis of pollution levels. Environment minister Gopal Rai said, “The 13 hotspots were marked for high levels of pollution. However, after analysing data of the Green Delhi app for about a year, we have marked 150 hotspots now. We will control, manage and closely monitor the problems with the departments concerned.” An official said the new hotspots were those areas that had received the maximum number of complaints on the app. The sources of pollution were related to road dust, illegal dumping of garbage and construction and demolition (C&D) waste, dust pollution due to C&D activity, burning of garbage, biomass, garden or plastic waste and air pollution from sources other than industry. Track the pollution level in your city“Most of the hotspots have two issues, road dust and illegal dumping of garbage on roadsides and vacant plots,” he added. Most of the hotspots are located in six districts — West, South, Central, Northwest, Shahdara and New Delhi. In the winter of 2018, Central Pollution Control Board and Delhi Pollution Control Committee had identified 13 pollution hotspots based on the average PM2.5 and PM10 levels recorded through the year. These included Rohini, Dwarka, Okhla Phase-II, Punjabi Bagh, Anand Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Jahangirpuri, RK Puram, Bawana, Mundka, Narela and Mayapuri. They were defined as places with annual average levels higher than the mean value of the city. “However, the new hotspots are entirely based on complaints and feedback received on the app and their pollution level has not been taken into consideration,” said the official. Another environment department official said, “As all complaints had geocoordinates embedded in them, they were located and analysed using Google Earth for inference. Repeated complaints and chronic locations were chosen on the basis of their spatial frequency (more than 5 complaints from a single location) and temporal frequency (more than 8-10 complaints in a day).” “The new areas have been identified so that the agencies concerned can take substantial action towards mitigation of pollution,” added the official.

The saffron party is concerned that anything strongly in favour of the scheme or opposing it will have far-reaching ramifications on its electoral prospects in the bypolls. At the state-level leaders’ meeting on Monday, Dalit leaders like Bangaru Shruthi were assigned to come up with a plan. They were told to study the scheme in its entirety in the next three days. Shruthi is the daughter of former BJP national president and ex-Union minister Bangaru Laxman. A group of young Dalit leaders will meet with intellectuals and academicians and report to the party high command. “The issue is that if we ask too many questions, we may send out incorrect signals. The team will deliberate on how to make additional demands. What if we demand that all poor sections in the state be provided the benefits of the scheme,” sources said. The party is determined to win the by-election, especially since state party chief Bandi Sanjay has embarked on a padayatra.  “Many national leaders will also campaign in Huzurabad. So, the outcome of the election will be vital for us,” said a party leader. Meanwhile, TRS MLAs tried to corner the BJP on Dalit Bandhu during the assembly session. TRS MLA Gadari Kishore said: “Instead of making efforts to tarnish the scheme, why don’t you (BJP MLAs and MPs) pressurise the Union government to grant funds for the scheme. You will earn a good name for yourselves.” Another MLA M Anand wondered, “If Bandi Sanjay has a sentiment to take up any initiative from Bhagalakshmi temple, why cannot CM KCR stick to his sentiment of launching schemes from Karimnagar district.” At the state-level leaders’ meeting , Dalit leaders ike Bangaru Shruthi were assigned to come up with a plan. They were told to study the scheme in its entirety in the next three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-ropes-in-dalit-leaders-to-iron-out-strategy-on-bandhu/articleshow/86794545.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The commission has been informed that eight cells in Rajasthan and two in Haryana had been created so far.“To control dust pollution, directions have been issued by CAQM to all road owning/maintaining/ road construction agencies of the state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi to set up dust control and management cells in their respective states. The cell will regularly monitor the compliance of road dust control measures by the authorities concerned and will also keep track of the progress of measures undertaken,” the commission said in a statement.The 10-point action plan includes utilisation of road sweeping machines, scientific disposal of the dust collected, water sprinkling to suppress dust, augmentation of mechanised sweeping, management of roads and conversion of non-paved roads into paved ones.The cell has also been asked to identify hotspots where road dust is being generated in a large quantity. “Ramping up the capacity of dust control and management cells will not only provide a sustainable solution to the persistent problem of road dust pollution but will also help in re-aligning strategies to initiate timely preventive and corrective measures,” CAQM added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/road-agencies-told-to-set-up-dust-mgmt-cells/articleshow/86792016.cms||---

Covid-19 cases in Madurai have been consistently hovering over 30 in the past few days, which is a slight increase compared to last month. “We are doing our best to improve Covid-19 vaccination coverage. However, adherence among public to safety norms is a matter of concern and we can’t hound them over it now,” said a health official. In many areas, on both roadsides and inside shops, people could be seen without wearing masks or maintaining social distance. Though fines were previously being collected for not wearing masks, now the rule has been largely relaxed.“There is only a borderline increase now. But, if the number of fresh Covid-19 cases goes up to 50 a day, then it will be a huge concern as it can double quickly. Considering the current pattern, by November third week there is a possibility of cases peaking. During festive season, usually cases have a tendency to rise,” said Dr V N Alagavenkatesan, president-elect, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Madurai. Public health experts further said that the infrastructure and treatment for Covid-19 have improved now giving us a better chance to tackle Covid-19 spread.“More than 50% of population is mostly immune to Covid-19 by vaccination or through infection, as shown by sero survey studies. The challenge now will be the population that is not vaccinated and who are at high risk of Covid-19, particularly elderly peopl and those with co-morbid conditions,” said Dr K Kolandasamy, former director of public health. The expert further said that in case of festive season, the biggest issue would be unnecessary crowding inside shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/be-wary-of-third-wave-experts-warn-ahead-of-festive-season/articleshow/86794458.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Goa||Socorro sarpanch, deputy defeated in no-trust move||Panaji: BJP lost control of the Socorro panchayat on Tuesday as sarpanch Sandeep Vazarkar and his deputy Deepali Satardekar were ousted in a no-confidence motion. With the ruling group not attending the special meeting held on Tuesday as it could not succeed in getting the numbers on their side, the motion of no-trust was carried with a score of 6-0. Anil Pednekar, Rovlu (Rajan) Parsekar, Sandeep Manjrekar, Reshma Morajkar, Maya Keni and Sanjay Pednekar voted in favour of the motion. Politically, it is a significant development in Porvorim constituency as BJP has been trying hard to outsmart Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte for a long time. The control of Socorro panchayat shifting into the hands of Khaunte assumes significance as the next assembly polls are just four months away. Of the three panchayats that constitute Porvorim assembly area, Salvador do Mundo is with BJP. Vazarkar is an aspirant for the BJP ticket Khaunte alleged that during the past 15 days, government machinery was used to win over some of the members and expressed happiness that the six-member group stayed united. Sources said that the group had moved out of Goa for more than a week to prevent getting poached. Khaunte alleged that BJP tried its best to break the group of six. He expressed surprise that chief minister Pramod Sawant still continued to support Vazarkar who has cases of land grab against him. Khaunte also expressed apprehension that there would be pressure on the same group for the election of the new sarpanch. Until three years ago, Vazarkar was with Khaunte. When he was asked to make way for another person to take over as sarpanch, Vazarkar formed his own group and continued as sarpanch by joining BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/socorro-sarpanch-deputy-defeated-in-no-trust-move/articleshow/86794570.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But, if it is served in unhygienic condition, it could become a nightmare as it may invite diseases. To ensure safe and hygienic street food, the health department will now give a tag to cluster of street food vendors of ‘clean street food hub’ but only after ensuring that they are following all hygienic practices. Places with cluster of eateries will be declared as ‘clean street food hub’, after the health department conducts training of such vendors to follow best hygiene practices so that their food is safe and clean for consumption. For the purpose, the health department has identified places such as Jaipur’s Masala Chowk, Gaurav Tower area and places across state where clusters of eateries are offering food to the people. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India is helping the state as it has already issued guidelines for declaration of ‘clean street food hub’ on upgrading of infrastructure of existing food streets. The initiative will also help in popularising and promoting local and regional cuisines. “We have prepared a list of all such places where street food vendors are operating in clusters. We will ensure that the food handlers should remain clean, use clean water for cooking and drinking, and also use hand gloves and aprons, where necessary. Also, they should wear head gear and cover their mouth while at work,” said Dr Ravi Prakash Sharma, additional director, health department. “The food vendors will be trained first and only after ensuring that the clusters of food vendors are following proper guidelines will the area be declared as clean street food hub,” said Dr Sharma. The initiative will help food lovers to go to such places and consume food without hesitation. The health department will start basic food safety and hygiene training of street food vendors, helpers and handlers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hygienic-street-food-joints-to-get-health-depts-clean-label/articleshow/86776092.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Bond duty allocation pushed back twice for govt PG doctors||MUMBAI: Nearly 1,500 postgraduate doctors from the state’s government colleges who completed their MD/MS and diploma are still awaiting their bond allotment after their results were announced last month. The Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) has extended the bond allotment date twice. Doctors claimed that during the peak of the pandemic last year, they were allotted postings a day after results. This year, their results were out on September 15. These doctors are posted as speciality medical officers or senior residents in government- and civic-run hospitals or at public health centres based on vacancies. The DMER was to allot bond duty on September 28, but rescheduled it to October 5. In a fresh circular issued on Tuesday, the allotment date has been pushed to October 11. Some of the doctors claimed that due to the delay in allotment, they are unable to join any other organisation. “There are vacancies, but we are bound to serve in government facilities after PG. We cannot join another organisation and leave in a month as the bond duty is allotted. Moreover, after our postgraduate residency ended on June 31, we are not eligible for stipends. Many of us rely on the stipends as our only source of income,” said a doctor from Sion Hospital. A DMER official said the schedule had to be revised as the seat matrix changed. “Last year, some allotments were delayed, and their terms are getting over now. These posts are getting added to the vacant list and the seat matrix is changing, leading to a minor delay. We need to give everyone an equal opportunity to choose from the available posts based on their merit. If some desirable post opens later, meritorious candidates may lose the chance to opt for it,” said the official. A student from Nair Hospital said that in the past, vacant seats arising later were added to the seat matrix for the second or third round. Bond service is allotted based on merit — on the scores obtained in the final postgraduate exams. In the first seat matrix issued by the directorate, 799 posts were vacant for the senior residents in government and corporation colleges, 259 for speciality medical officer (SMO) posts in BMC’s peripheral hospitals, 235 in SMO posts in municipal corporations, excluding BMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bond-duty-allocation-pushed-back-twice-for-govt-pg-docs/articleshow/86794581.cms||Yogita Rao

Responding to media queries at Calangute, Lobo pointed out that Narendra Modi was declared the BJP's prime ministerial candidate at the BJP national executive meeting in Goa 10 years ago, and he went on to become the prime minister in 2014. “Goa has been very lucky for BJP and Modi. So I think Banerjee feels that coming to Goa may also be lucky for her. She’s in the race to become the next prime minister. This is why they're putting up her posters on all available signboards all over Goa,”the waste management minister said. Quizzed about the electoral prospects of TMC in Goa, he said, “It's a little too early to comment on whether TMC will make any impact in Goa,” he said, adding, “I don't think we should underestimate anybody. They will try their best to win.” “Every political party in India wants to come to Goa,” he said referring to the constant speculation about various MLAs and leaders joining the new entrants on the Goa political scene. “There is nothing wrong in meeting them or hearing what they have to say,” the ports minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-mamata-eyeing-goas-lucky-charm-for-pm-post/articleshow/86794620.cms||---

---||Delhi||London To NY: Global experience to shape revamp of Delhi roads||NEW DELHI: With the Delhi government itself working to revamp over 540km of the national capital’s roads as per the best global practices, an online workshop on Tuesday saw experts from across the world share experience of street transformation from top global cities. The workshop was organised by Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi (DDC) in partnership with World Resources Institute India (WRI-India) on “Transforming Delhi’s Streets”. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and public works department minister Satyenodar Jain were present as chief guests, along with the vice-chairperson of DDC, Jasmine Shah, WRI-India CEO O P Agarwal and senior government officials. Jain said the government was committed to redesign over 540km roads in Delhi as per the best global practices to make them safe, sustainable, pedestrian-friendly and accessible, especially to senior citizens and children. Sisodia said the Delhi government was currently identified with its social reforms in the education and health sectors, and it was committed to focus on infrastructural reforms and road redesigning with similar vigour. He requested all participants to keep an open mind to learn and deliberate upon the global experiences shared in the workshop. Shah said all global cities began their journeys in street transformation only 15-20 years ago and had cited how critical political leadership was for the transformation. “Under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi government is determined to build world-class streets in the national capital,” Shah said. GyengChul KIM, a transport expert from South Korea’s Seoul, said that from building flyovers and footbridges, which were inequitable and inaccessible to many, Seoul had incorporated more pedestrian squares, pedestrian crosswalks and lanes dedicated to buses, made possible by the political will. Ong Eu-Gene, director at Singapore’s Land Transport Authority, said Singapore had decided to become a “Car-Lite Nation” and rely more on public, shared and active transport. He shared Singapore’s key infrastructural initiatives such as building more integrated transport hubs, active mobility networks, community spaces, pedestrian streets and transit priority corridors, and using the railways as the backbone of the public transport system. Michael Replogle, former deputy commissioner for policy, New York City Department of Transportation, emphasised on the need to integrate data-driven processes in redesigning roads, recording progress and revising yearly priorities. He shared the observations from the Speed Camera Program adopted in New York where most vehicles that received one traffic violation ticket did not receive another within a calendar year. He said the Covid-19 outbreak further transformed street environment with the emergence of open streets, open restaurants, outdoor learning streets and expansion of bike network. Alex Williams, director of London City Planning, shared the city’s vision of “Streets for All”. London has focused on increasing the use of bicycles and buses, he said, adding that London City Planning has made the buses more reliable and consistent with 24-hour operations, which has reduced the traffic congestions due to private motor vehicles and made roads safer for cyclists and pedestrians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/london-to-ny-global-experience-to-shape-revamp-of-roads/articleshow/86792123.cms||---

According to TNAU, above normal rainfall is expected in Chennai, Chengalpattu, Cuddalore, Kancheepuram, Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Tiruvallur, Tiruvannamalai and Villupuram. Normal rainfall( plus or minus 10 % from long term average rainfall) is expected in Ariyalur, Coimbatore, Dharmapuri, Dindigul, Erode, Kanyakumari, Kallakurichi, Karur, Krishnagiri, Madurai, Namakkal, Perambalur, Pudukkottai, Ramanathapuram, Ranipet, Salem, Sivaganga, Thanjavur, Theni, The Nilgiris, Tiruchirappalli, Tenkasi, Tuticorin, Tirunelveli, Tirupathur, Tiruppur, Virudhunagar and Vellore. Chennai is predicted to receive 880mm rainfall, about 12% higher than its normal rainfall, while Coimbatore would receive 320mm which is 7% lesser than normal rainfall. Madurai would receive the normal showers, around 420mm and Trichy, 390mm, which is 1% lesser than its normal rainfall. Tirupur, Erode and Salem would receive 280mm, 370mm and 310mm respectively, more or less the normal rainfall that these districts receive. Though some districts were seen to receive lesser rainfall than their long term average, the deviation was within 10% and hence considered as normal rainfall, TNAU authorities said. Farmers in cauvery delta districts can rejoice as all the districts in central TN are predicted to receive higher rainfall than their average, albeit marginally.  The forecast was presented with a 60% probability level, a statement from TNAU said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/10-tn-districts-may-receive-above-normal-rainfall-from-ne-monsoon/articleshow/86794617.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Though it is only an initial trend, colleges are hoping to fill the seats in subsequent rounds of counselling. A total of 442 seats out of 645 seats were filled in the Government College of Technology (GCT), leaving 203 seats to be filled in subsequent rounds. Kumaraguru College of Technology (KCT) filled 53% of its seats in the first round. Out of the 723 seats available in the college, 384 have been filled. Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology could fill only 50% of the seats. To give a perspective on the trending disciplines, 10.5% of the available computer science seats were filled but only less than 2% of mechanical engineering seats were opted by students, according to career guidance experts. “While computer science engineering and information technology were opted by many students, artificial intelligence and machine learning courses also had good demand this year,” CEO of Hindustan education institutions K Karunakaran said. But there are also students who are going by their area of interest like bio-medical engineering. This year, the cut-off has increased compared to last year because of the new allotment of marks, he said. A total of 14,788 students were called for the first round of counselling and 10,148 sof them were allotted seats. This was more than the seats allotted last year in the first round.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/six-engineering-colleges-fill-more-than-50-seats-in-first-round-of-counselling/articleshow/86794671.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Last week TOI asked its readers if they think the government is doing enough to protect Hyderabad’s green cover. Here are some of the responses....||A couple of months ago a tree was being chopped, in my neighbourhood, as it was hindering the expansion plan of a builder. We stopped the cutting and lodged a complaint with the Tree Protection Department, associated with the forest department. They came right away and checked, asked the builder to pay a fine of Rs 3800 (as he had not taken earlier permission) and gave him the clearance to continue chopping the tree. The builder happily paid the amount and carried on with the felling. What does this mean? It means that officials are no longer interested in protecting and preserving trees but want to turn it into a revenue generating scheme. If this continues, how do you think we are going to protect the rest of the trees (very few anyway) left behind? -- Vanita Khatter The government is not doing enough to protect Hyderabad's tree cover. Tree felling is happening not only in my neighbourhood but everywhere in the city. Look at the road widening works going on. Are the trees that are being felled for it, being relocated? Look at all the other constructions (flyovers, buildings etc) that are happening. How many trees are being felled to make way for them? Flyovers are now more important than parks for the government. Whatever little green cover is being protected, is being done by responsible citizens and conscious societies. It’s time the government stepped up too to do its bit. -- Nagarjuna S Rao Y A few days ago, I read an article in TOI about Hyderabad pollution that said that the air (oxygen) which we inhale is equal to smoking two cigarettes a day. This means we are all smokers and one day we'll suffer from it. During the pandemic, people spent thousands of rupees on oxygen cylinders. People should understand how trees are helpful to us and grow as many trees as possible. -- Suman Vikram The drastic drop in green cover, owing to infrastructure work underway in the city, is a serious concern. While the government has taken up initiatives to compensate for this loss and tackle air pollution, the alacrity and pace of planting saplings, after the initial enthusiasm, has sadly reduced. It is important that the government take tougher measures to safeguard old and big trees while continuing the process of planting more saplings, in order to increase the green cover of the city. -- Srinivasan Ramaswamy The GHMC is planting trees on a massive scale. But at the same time, it should involve the local community to protect these plants and water them till they are fully grown. The GHMC should also give incentives to house owners for planting trees by reducing property tax according to the number of trees they plant. At the same time the GHMC should give priority to developmental activities where there is more greenery. The government should also insist that all new high rises are given permission only if they assure to take up vertical and horizontal gardening. These steps will bring down temperatures and reduce pollution levels particularly along the IT corridor. -- Kanchiraju Kasinath For years now the Telangana government has been spending close to Rs 500 to 1,000 crore every year in the name of Haritha Haram, to make Hyderabad a green city. Yet, it has failed to make much difference. To address this our government must allot two-three members from every colony to maintain the saplings that are planted. This can also help in providing employment for the youth. The government can also ask ward corporators to survey houses in their wards and reward those who maintain a good green cover. This will encourage more people to take up plantations. -- Ajay K||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/last-week-toi-asked-its-readers-if-they-think-the-government-is-doing-enough-to-protect-hyderabads-green-cover-here-are-some-of-the-responses-/articleshow/86796808.cms||---

A total of 32 admissions were completed for the course at Ramjas by Tuesday evening and 60 at Hindu College. At Shri Ram College of Commerce, the maximum cutoff benchmark is not deterring applicants. For economics (H), 31 of the 61 applications for admission have been cleared. The college offers 63 seats under the general category. In BCom (H), 108 admission have been approved from the 261 applications received, and 31 students completed the admission process by paying the fees too. The approval of 26 are in process. Twelve admissions have also been logged for computer science (H) with a cutoff of 100% at Hansraj College. At Ramjas, 32 admissions were concluded, one being in the OBC category in political science (H). Tanvir Aeijaz, political science programme coordinator at the institution, said, “With the cutoff at 100%m we expected a few students to apply. But the applications we have received have been way more than expected.” Most of these students taking admission at Hansraj are from Kerala. At SRCC too, of the 31 admitted for economics (H), 13 were from the Kerala state board. “With their 100% aggregates, the Kerala students could have gone to any college but since they have seniors in Hansraj College, many of them opted for our institution,” said Aeijaz. At Hindu College, because the students from other categories had also secured 100%, they were all automatically converted to general category admissions. “We have fully approved 60 entries and the process is under way to clear the others,” said Anju Srivastava, Hindu principal. “We have already admitted more students than the seats we are offering under the category. There is one more day left, so we expect more students to apply.” By the day, applications are also increasing at SRCC for the premium BCom (H) and economics (H) courses. An SRCC official said, “Though we generally don't keep data on the different boards of the aspirants, we have noticed the trend of one student for every three applicants being from Kerala. I think this year, we will admit more students from education boards in south India than north India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/100-or-not-du-seats-are-running-out-fast/articleshow/86794748.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Delhi||Centre-Delhi ‘services’ tussle to resume in Supreme Court after Diwali||NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party government on Tuesday renewed attempts to resume its six-year-old unfinished tussle with the Centre to wrest jurisdiction of ‘services’ in Delhi and requested Supreme Court for early adjudication of the validity of Union government’s May 2015 notification taking over ‘services’, despite this being part of the State List in Constitution. Appearing for Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra requested a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana that the Centre continues to exercise administrative control over services, causing grave impediments in the governance of Delhi. The CJI said he would constitute a three-judge bench for this purpose after Diwali for resuming the hearing, which was stalled due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The case was last heard in January, 2020. The core question involved in the pending petitions is whether ‘services’ relatable to Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, which pertains to the state public service commission, lie within the legislative and executive domain of Delhi and if the Centre can take control of as was done through a Government of India notification of May 21, 2015. The central government notification had led to an ugly turf war between the lieutenant governor of Delhi and the AAP government headed by Arvind Kejriwal, with the former putting a spoke in almost every administrative decision taken by the Delhi government. As per the creation of Delhi as a state under Article 239 and 239AA, the land, police and public order, which ordinarily vest with the state government, was retained with the Centre. In the meanwhile, Parliament passed the NCT of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, which gives the Centre said “clarifies” the role of the LG. The passage of the law was opposed by Aam Aadmi Party and Congress. The law states the expression ‘Delhi Government’ shall mean the Lieutenant Governor, which in effect means that the nod of the office will be needed for several decisions the state government may seek to take. The Kejriwal government had challenged the 2015 notification in Delhi high court, which in its judgment on August 4, 2016 had ruled that Delhi continued to be a Union territory despite Article 239AA and that concurrence of the LG was mandatory for implementation of all administrative decisions of the council of ministers headed by the CM. On appeal, a five-judge Suprem Court bench on July 4, 2018 had ruled that the LG was bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers headed by the CM on all matters over which the Delhi assembly had legislative jurisdiction. However, the decision on whether the ‘services’ rested with the Delhi government was left to be decided by a two-judge bench. The two-judge bench on February 4, 2019 had ruled that Delhi enjoyed a unique position as a Union Territory and also that of a state but returned a conflicting opinion. The matter was then referred to a three-judge bench, which had last heard the matter in January 2020 but the outbreak of pandemic and the need for physical hearing of a complex constitutional issue have delayed the hearings by nearly two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-delhi-services-tussle-to-resume-in-sc-after-diwali/articleshow/86792143.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

I met a lot of people and sought their opinion. I also spoke to the party leadership, right from Rahul Gandhi to AICC in-charge for Goa Dinesh Gundu Rao. I finally decided to do what the people want – fight BJP unitedly,” Lourenco said. Speculations were rife for some days that Lourenco was considering moving over to AAP, though he had not confirmed it Chodankar said all issues raised by Lourenco have been satisfactorily addressed and that due respect and recognition will be given to the Curtorim MLA by the party at the state and central level. Giving an account of the party’s fire-fighting operations to prevent Lourenco’s exit, Chodankar revealed that the party’s top brass at the national level – Rahul Gandhi, P Chidambaram, Rao and KC Venugopal - got involved in placating the only young Turk among the four Congress MLAs of Goa “to ensure that Lourenco gets on board”. Chodankar said that Lourenco raised “meaningful” issues concerning his constituency and the state. “We are largely in agreement that there should be no compromise on all the core issues raised by him,” he said. Kamat said that Congress would stay united to fight BJP and protect “Goemkarponn.” “Let there be no doubt in anybody’s mind that all of us will fight the election unitedly. Reginaldo’s contribution to Goa and its people cannot be denied. He will play an important role in the years to come. His work speaks for himself,” Kamat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rahul-gandhi-intervenes-to-stop-lourencos-exit/articleshow/86794663.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Goa was prosperous during my tenure as CM: Digambar Kamat||MARGAO: Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat on Tuesday said that his tenure as chief minister, from 2007 to 2012, was “a period of prosperity” for the state, and that the current BJP government has led the state towards poverty. “2007 to 2012 was a period of prosperity where people prospered. In a way, chief minister Pramod Sawant admits this when he says that the government treasury was then full. Now what happened to the treasury? These 10 years of BJP governance is a period of poverty,” Kamat told reporters. He was reacting to Sawant’s statement recently after a photo showing Kamat taking a selfie with a pothole went viral on social media. Congress has launched a ‘spot a pothole’ photography competition in a bid to highlight the bad condition of roads in the state. “The road conditions were the same during the tenure of Kamat. The state treasury was full then, but they failed to make good roads. Now he is criticising my government. I don’t need advice from Kamat and his party regarding development,” Sawant had said. BJP general secretary Narendra Sawaikar had also posted a sarcastic comment on Facebook over Congress’ “spot a pothole” competition. “Trinamool’s grass grows in Goa only in potholes developed in Congress. Therefore, be watchful, and if possible take a selfie too,” he had remarked in a clear reference to Congress veteran Luizinho Faleiro’s switchover to TMC. Kamat said that people’s livelihoods too have suffered. “Everywhere I go people tell me how things were better when I was chief minister. I had demanded a package of Rs 100 crore for pandemic-affected people so that at least Rs 20,000 to 25,000 could be given to them,” Kamat said. He further said that with the government coffers being empty, contractors’ bills are not getting cleared and social welfare scheme beneficiaries are not getting their payments in time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kamat-state-was-prosperous-during-my-tenure-as-cm/articleshow/86794700.cms||---

The Saravanampatti police said the burglars had struck at the house of K Dhinakaran, 44, on Maniyakarampalayam Road when he was away at Tiruchendur temple to offer prayers along with his wife Ishwarya, 34, son Akshayakeerthan, 16, and daughter Anu Roopa, 14. “He is into steel business at Vellakinar near Thudiyalur.” According to a police officer, Dhinakaran had locked his house on Sunday afternoon and went to Tiruchendur temple along with his family members. “When he returned home on Monday evening, he found the lock of the first-floor door was broken open and gold ornaments weighing 101 sovereigns were missing from the steel locker on the ground floor. The burglars had left behind another 30 sovereigns gold.” The officer said while the burglars had repositioned CCTV cameras in order not to get their images captured, their efforts had gone in vain. “Their images were recorded on the CCTV cameras. They had sprinkled red chilli powder at the crime scene as well to prevent sniffer dogs from tracing them.” Dhinakaran alerted Saravanampatti police inspector Kandasamy, who visited the crime scene along with his team and collected the CCTV footage. Forensic experts have lifted two fingerprints from the crime scene. Dhinakaran lodged a formal complaint with the Saravanampatti police on Tuesday morning and they have registered a case against two unknown burglars and formed four special teams to nab them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/101-sovereigns-gold-stolen-from-businessmans-house/articleshow/86794750.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Centre rejects request to exclude certain areas from Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone||NEW DELHI: The central government on Tuesday informed Delhi High Court that it had rejected the recommendations of Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC) to exclude certain areas in the city from Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone (LBZ) and remanded the issue back to the commission for reconsideration. Justice Rekha Palli, who was hearing a batch of petitions seeking implementation of the recommendations, was informed by the DUAC counsel that now the meeting of the commission was scheduled on October 7 to consider the Centre’s action. The petitioners, who are the residents of the areas proposed to be excluded, contended that the rejection of the recommendations was mala fide and without any due application of mind by the authorities. Several plot owners and residents of Sundar Nagar, Golf Links, Bengali Market and Panchsheel Marg, who wanted to reconstruct or alter existing buildings, approached the high court seeking a direction to the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs to implement the recommendations made by DUAC in 2019. “The issue is that they (Centre) are not accepting. As a court, we will hear the matter at length. We will have an idea (after the commission’s meeting),” said the court and listed the matter for further hearing on October 18. The high court added that it expected DUAC to examine the queries raised by the Centre at the time of the reconsideration and address them. In their plea, the residents submitted that one of the recommendations of DUAC was that Jor Bagh, Golf Links, Sunder Nagar, Bengali Market, Ashoka Road, Mandir Marg, Panchsheel Marg, Sardar Patel Marg, and Chanakyapuri ought to be excluded from the Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone. In the plea concerning Bengali Market, the petitioner defended the exclusion on the ground that the area comprised small residential plots measuring 212.5 to 500 square yards and developed properties could not be considered “'bungalows” as was commonly understood and also described in the report submitted by the DUAC. In August, the court had directed the ministry to decide on DUAC’s recommendations within three weeks while keeping in mind the peculiar bungalow-style features of the zone and the fact that the recommendations did not seek to interfere with LBZ guidelines, but only suggested exclusion of some areas having modern construction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/request-to-exclude-certain-areas-from-lbz-rejected/articleshow/86792205.cms||---

SMC had set the target based on registered voters in the city. The population that have been jabbed may include migrant population and those who are not residents of the city, claimed officials. City’s estimated population currently is above 70 lakh. However, the Diamond City performed better compared to other cities in the state which are yet to achieve 100 percent of first dose vaccination to its targeted population. “It should be noted that the vaccination drive continued along with the second wave and health teams focused on both areas for better results,” said a health official. SMC has set a target of 34.32 lakh people against which 34.36 lakh first doses have been administered. Total 16.61 lakh people have been given a second dose as well. According to the latest figures, 48.4 percent of the targeted population is fully vaccinated. Total 50.9 lakh doses have been administered by the health teams. “Now we have data of those who got the first dose. So, we can trace and convince them for the second dose as well.

---||Hyderabad||No guarantee opposition unity will transform into alliance||Hyderabad: Though Congress, CPI, CPM, TJS and other smaller parties have come together to stage dharnas, rasta rokos and agitations against the ‘anti-farmer’ and ‘anti-people’ policies of the TRS and BJP governments respectively, there is no guarantee that this unity will transform into an alliance in the October 30 bypoll to Huzurabad constituency. The ground is still wide open in Huzurabad. Neither the left parties nor the Congress have come to a conclusion on stitching up an alliance to defeat the TRS and BJP in the by-election. While Congress has announced student leader Balmoori Venkat as its candidate for the bypoll, the left parties have almost made up their mind not to field their party candidates. However, both the CPI and CPM are still undecided on extending their support to any of the political parties, including Congress. On its part, the Telugu Desam Party has decided not to contest, stating that the bypoll was thrust on the people unnecessarily due to friction between CM KCR and former minister Eatala Rajender. The TJS is likely to contest the bypoll and will announce its decision formally. While Praja Kutami, the Congress-led alliance comprising TDP, CPI and TJS had failed to defeat the TRS in 2018 assembly elections, Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy announced that party doors were open for all the like-minded parties, civil society and caste welfare associations to come along with Congress to defeat the TRS and BJP. However, he did not come clean on Congress making any efforts to stitch up an alliance. CPM state secretary Tammineni Veerabhadram and CPI state secretary Chada Venkat Reddy told TOI that their parties will take a decision soon on extending support in the bypoll. “The left parties have joined hands with Congress and other parties to oppose the ‘anti-people’ policies of BJP and TRS governments. Our support is issue-based and it cannot be assumed that it would continue even in the bypoll to Huzurabad. We will look at what stand different political parties have taken in the bypoll and take a final call in the interests of the people of Huzurabad,” Veerabhadram said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-guarantee-opposition-unity-will-transform-into-alliance/articleshow/86794734.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Delhi||All Delhiites to get health card, cabinet clears funds||New Delhi: Delhi cabinet on Tuesday approved the funds for launch of the AAP government’s health information management system (HIMS) project under which health cards will be given to each citizen for free. The system will allow doctors to see a patient’s medical history using the card and the patients will be able to take appointments from home. A government official said while the HIMS had been envisaged to track and record the complete medical record of each individual and help provide continuous healthcare, health cards have been developed to supplement the efforts in this initiative by making the entire system more robust. “The health card will act like a unique health identity for each individual through which everything from their medical history to appointment dates can be accessed,” the official said.The health cards will have the complete demographic and key clinical details, along with other related information about the individual’s eligibility under various health schemes and programmes of Delhi government. “The health cards will facilitate the identification of individuals as well as the schemes and programmes under which the particular individual is eligible so they may be provided best in class health care services in Delhi. It will also act as a foolproof backup in case the HIMS is accidentally non-accessible and hence, all the details may not be available in real time,” the government said in a statement. The health cards will also facilitate easy identification of key clinical information, which may be vital for the treating doctor to provide personalised health care services. Also, any new diagnosis will be further included in the health card. This continuously evolving digital record will help an individual get personalised healthcare in Delhi.The health card will be secured. Voter ID card of Delhi will be the only mandatory document for registration for citizens who are 18 years and above. They will be issued health card for availing free health care services in any of the healthcare institutions of Delhi, which may be further extended to institutions outside Delhi as well. All citizens between 1 and 18 years will be issued a health card linked to their parent’s health card. All newborn children (up to one year of age) will be linked to their mother’s health card. The AAP government will be setting up a centralised support centre and counters at Delhi health facilities and camps to facilitate the service. The citizens of Delhi along with their family members will be able to pre-register themselves for issuance of a temporary e-health card.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-delhiites-to-get-health-card-cabinet-clears-funds/articleshow/86792175.cms||AlokKNMishra

Since monsoon currents are still active across the state, thunderstorms will continue. The rain on Tuesday was heavier in northern parts and fringes of the city even as south Kolkata received drizzles. A low-pressure trough between Bihar and Odisha and a cyclonic circulation over Malda led to thunderstorms in the city and several districts of south Bengal, said the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). “Both systems are supplying moisture into the region. So long as these two remain active, thunderstorms and rain will continue,” said RMC director GK Das. The weather could turn dry from the latter half of Thursday. “By then, the low-pressure trough and the circulation could move away. But sporadic rain can’t be ruled till monsoon recedes,” said Das. Kolkata has received almost double the normal volume of rain – 96% above the normal mark — in September even as Gangetic Bengal has recorded 31% excess rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/met-spies-light-rain-on-mahalaya/articleshow/86792295.cms||---

None of the farmers participated in the bandh against the Centre which is a sign that TN farmers have accepted the farm laws,’’ he said. “However, in Uttar Pradesh only certain farmers’ associations’ keep opposing the laws,’’ he added. Annamalai said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sought specific issues of concern in the farm laws that affect farmers, but none have pointed out any. Even the Supreme Court has questioned the farmers’ association on the logic behind the protests when the three laws have been kept in abeyance, he said. “The farm laws and the UP incident are two different things,” he said. Terming the accident and the subsequent violence that resulted in the death of eight people as tragic, Annamalai said that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath has assured that those behind the incident would be brought to book. “He has promised action on those who drove the car that ran over farmers. But opposition parties are attempting to politicize the incident. They shouldn’t do that,’’ he said. On the opposition to establishment of a nuclear waste centre in Kudankulam nuclear power plant, Annamalai said that plant has been functioning all these years without any problem following global scientific norms. “But all of sudden there is opposition to it. This is nothing but politics,’’ he said. In Erode, BJP cadres presented a goat to Annamalai on Tuesday. He came to Chennimalai to celebrate the 117th birth anniversary of Tiruppur Kumaran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/tn-farmers-have-accepted-new-farm-laws-annamalai/articleshow/86801059.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Manish Greval, director of the Biotic Waste Solutions Pvt Ltd, said that the plant would also treat medical waste such as bandages, cotton swabs, diapers, needles, catheters, etc, generated by ailing people at home, provided that the local civic body collects and hands over the waste to the plant vehicles. Biotic Waste Solutions Pvt Ltd will operate the biomedical waste plant on BOOT (Build, Own, Operate and Transfer) for the next 20 years, while the government has made the land available for this purpose. The entire plant has been erected by the company by spending Rs 10 crore and will charge fees for the services it provides. Parag Prabhudesai, convener, Bio Medical Waste Cell, said incinerators like these are allowed to be set up for a radius of 75 kms and Goa would not have any other plant due to its small geographical area. The reason behind this is that it should get sufficient quantity of waste for treatment, he said. During the inspection on September 23, minister for waste management Michael Lobo had said that the state had no facility for common biomedical waste treatment and that the plant will help people by avoiding improper burial or dumping of biomedical waste or burning it. Lobo also said the the plant’s charges for hospital would slightly increase. Presently, Rs 7.2 is charged per bed to treat such waste which is expected to increase to Rs 9 per bed. The state has a total 6,194 beds, including 2,485 in private hospitals and 3,709 in government hospitals. Goa has a total 749 clinics. All the institutions totally generate 2,992 kg biomedical waste per day and 10,92,166 kgs per annum. The plant has arranged seven vehicles that would collect biomedical waste from the entire state and treat it, Greval said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kundaim-plant-to-treat-medical-waste-from-homes-too/articleshow/86794877.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

Additional Sessions Judge Shivaji Anand said prima facie, Kumar was visible in the video, as reflected in the photos taken out of the same video footage, and seemed to be causing severe injuries to the deceased. “The victims were lifted from different places at gunpoint. As per the chargesheet, it was a daring and awful act by the accused who openly caused brutal injuries to the victims without having any fear and as per the chargesheet, they are having firearms as well as other weapons like sticks, dandas, etc,” the court noted in the order. It added that while deciding the interim bail application of the co-accused, the court had observed that the accused and victims were from the same fraternity and locality and there was apprehension of life of the applicant also due to enmity. The court noted that a video was recovered from the phone of co-accused Prince, where Kumar was seen carrying a stick and clearly seen beating the victims. During the hearing, advocate Pradeep Rana, appearing for Kumar, had argued that the police had left no stones unturned to present a false and guilty image of him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-for-sushil-court-says-act-daring-and-awful/articleshow/86792271.cms||Usha Das
---||Delhi||Cops suggest use of tech to make courts secure in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has suggested maximising the use of technology and proper verification of lawyers who enter court premises to make these compounds more secure. It has also urged Delhi High Court and other courts to insist on physical presence of parties only in extreme and compelling circumstances, adding that only authorised vehicles be allowed inside the premises after proper checking with security equipment. Police also said security gadgets installed on the court premises were outdated and would be replaced with high-resolution CCTV cameras and monitors, 360-degree vehicle scanning with RF tag/barcode reader facilities, scanners for luggage and bags, and the same for checking explosives and narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. These are some of the suggestions made by police on maintaining security at the city courts in view of the recent shootout that killed three people in a Rohini courtroom. A bench of Chief Justice Dhirubhai Naranbhai Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh on Tuesday asked other stakeholders, including the Centre, the Delhi government and various bar associations, to also give suggestions so that they could be incorporated in the order. “All other respondents shall file a report or affidavit on suggestions which shall be incorporated in our order for the safety of advocates and all others appearing in the courts in Delhi,” the bench said while listing the matter for further hearing on October 12. The high court also issued fresh notices to bar associations for their reports. The court had last week taken suo motu cognisance of the issue of security at the courts in the national capital following the September 24 shootout. It had said there was a need for proper and effective deployment of sufficient numbers of police personnel on the court premises and sought stand of all stakeholders. The bench had said there was a need for a fool-proof entry system in courts, installation of metal detectors, under-vehicle surveillance system, CCTV cameras at strategic points, and proper training of police personnel as well as regular meetings of all stakeholders. On September 24, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana expressed deep concern over the shootout inside the crowded courtroom and spoke to the Delhi High Court chief justice in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-suggest-use-of-tech-to-make-courts-secure/articleshow/86792226.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur activists seek action against illegal autorickshaws||Kolhapur: Transport activists on Tuesday demanded strict action against autorickshaws plying on the Kolhapur city roads illegally. Several activists met the officials of the regional transport office (RTO) and said that more than 3,000 autorickshaws operating within the Kolhapur city limits are illegal. The activists said the operators of such illegal autorickshaws are making money and eating into the business of the registered and legal operators. “As per rule, the autorickshaws registered to ply on the city road only should be allowed to carry passengers. However, it has been observed that many autorickshaws that are registered outside the city as well as the district, and some very old vehicles marked for scrapping, are still operating within the city limits. The local autorickshaw driver is, therefore, at a loss. He is earning just Rs 200-300 each day, which is not even enough to pay the licence fee. We have sought immediate action against the illegal autorickshaws,” said Baba Indulkar of the Common Man Autorickshaw Union. Activists said that the operators of the non-registered vehicles and autorickshaws that are very old have forged documents. Such operators do not follow the RTO rules either. They pick up passengers from anywhere while the legal operators wait for passengers the whole day at designated autorickshaw stops. “The RTO officials have assured us of strong action against such operators. As many as 6,000 autorickshaws are legally registered with the department, while 3,000 are not. We demand a random survey to identify the illegal autorickshaws and action to get rid of the illegal autorickshaw menace,” said Indulkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-activists-seek-action-against-illegal-autorickshaws/articleshow/86787901.cms||---

Police have arrested the alleged killer and seized an ice pick-like pointed weapon. The victim has been identified as Arvind and the accused as Avdesh alias Pappu. Around 8.30pm, police received a call regarding a quarrel near LIG flats in Sarita Vihar. A police team that reached the spot was told by locals that the rickshawpullers had an argument that soon turned violent. Avdesh took out the pointed weapon and stabbed Arvind in the chest, they said. “Residents said Arvind collapsed on the road. Avdesh was caught by locals and passersby, and the injured was taken to the Apollo hospital,” said a senior officer. Police got to know from the hospital that Arvind had succumbed to his injuries. His family members were informed and the body was sent for a postmortem. A case was registered under IPC Section 302 at Sarita Vihar police station and Avdesh was booked for the murder. He has been arrested, the officer said. “CCTV camera footage from the vicinity are being checked.

---||Mumbai||Handler of Mumbai terror suspects likely based in Pakistan, says ATS||MUMBAI: In a major development in the recent city terror conspiracy case, the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) said on Tuesday the internet protocol address of the device used to make calls by the foreign handler of the arrested accused indicates its location in Pakistan. The foreign handler, Anthony alias Anas alias Anwar alias Annu, had used SIM cards of Malaysia, UAE and Russia to communicate with the accused. Rizwan Momin stayed here in Mumbra on rent“One of the arrested accused was communicating with his handler through an internet call. Although the number is not a Pakistan number, the IP address indicates its location in Pakistan,” said Vineet Agarwal, ATS chief and additional DGP. Mateen Hafeez reports. Handler ‘Anthony’ may be a brother of fugitive gangsterThe Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) has claimed that the communication between a suspect held in the nationwide terror conspiracy recently indicates that although the phone number is not Pakistani, the IP address of the device indicates the handler is located in Pakistan. The ATS had registered a case under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on September 17. The suspects were booked for criminal conspiracy to commit a terrorist act, destruction of evidence and harbouring a terrorist. ATS sources said the handler, Anthony, is suspected to be the brother of a fugitive gangster. State police have so far arrested three persons; auto driver Zakir Shaikh (52), tuition teacher Rizwan Momin (40) and Irfan Shaikh (50), a tailor. They are currently in ATS custody. Police said auto driver Shaikh was in touch with Anthony and had saved his numbers under different names. “A document recovered during the search has details about the allotment of budget to execute the terror conspiracy,”' said an officer. “Shaikh had asked Irfan to receive Rs 50,000 from a financial services company. Irfan received the money, gave Rs 1,000 to Shaikh and was asked to keep Rs 49,000 with him. We have recovered money from Irfan. Moreover, Shaikh had booked a ticket to go to Lucknow. He wanted to visit Kanpur also and we are interrogating him about the purpose of his visit,” said an officer. Shaikh could not board the train since ATS arrested him from Irfan’s house before he could leave for the railway station. Police also called the office bearers of the financial services company through which money was sent. “They will be helping us with details about the financial transactions,” said an officer. The Rs 50,000 was routed through a US-based company ‘to avoid suspicion’, added police. Police claimed Shaikh had given his mobile phone to Momin and asked him to destroy it. Momin broke it into three pieces and threw it into a nullah in Mumbra near his residence. Police recovered the mobile and sent it for cyber analysis. “While searching Momin’s tuition class in Bandra, we have recovered five SIM cards. We are probing it,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-handler-anthony-may-be-a-brother-of-fugitive-gangster/articleshow/86794897.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Senior officials at several colleges said these courses were likely to be filled in the first cutoff list itself for the general category. Science courses like BSc (H) chemistry, physics and botany, with cutoffs of 97.33%, 98.33% and 97%, respectively, are also seeing a huge rush at Miranda House, acting principal Bijaylaxmi Nanda said. “Apart from political science, these courses are also likely to close for the general category after the first list. Processing is taking some time as original certificates are coming in late. We have cleared 170 applications as of Tuesday afternoon,” she said. Lady Shri Ram College for Women saw the maximum rush for political science and economics, said principal Suman Sharma. At LSR, BA (H) political science has been pegged at 99.75% while economics has a cutoff of 99.5%. At Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, 200 students have completed the payment process, said Gyantosh Jha, its principal. “Economics, BCom (H), BCom, physics and BA programme have received the maximum number of applications,” Jha said. At Gargi College, certain courses are likely to close for the reserved category too. Principal Promila Kumar said, “Out of the 200 approved applications, 90 have already completed the payment process. For the second list, quite unexpectedly, the reserved category admissions may close for courses like political science, history, some combinations of BA programme and a few science courses.” BA programme also saw many takers at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya (DDU) College. “Against 40 seats that we have for BA programme with the history-political science combination, we have received over 109 applications. Eleven of them have been rejected. Besides this course, it is unlikely that any other course will close in the first list,” said principal Hem Chand Jain. Officials at College of Vocational Studies said that with 208 approved applications for BCom (H) and 160 for economics, both courses were looking at overadmissions. While Rajdhani College saw the maximum number of applications for BA (H) English, BA programme was the most sought-after course at Ramanujan College, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pol-sc-ba-programme-most-popular-courses-on-first-2-days-of-admissions/articleshow/86794843.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Air India to fly over Hindu Kush on way to UK, North America||NEW DELHI: The increased flying time for Air India nonstop between Delhi and UK and Delhi and North America since Afghan airspace closed on August 16 is going to reduce significantly with the airline deciding to fly over the mighty Hindu Kush range for the first time. This new routing will see Boeing 777s and 787s soaring over Tirich Mir (7,780 metres), the world’s highest peak outside the Himalaya-Karakoram range. Since mid-August, nonstop flights on these routes, including PM Narendra Modi’s recent US journey on India One, have taken the longer route via south Pakistan below Afghanistan and then via Iran-Turkey instead of the shorter Pakistan-Afghanistan-Turkmenistan/Uzbekistan route. Now heading straight north towards Kashmir, over the Hindu Kush range and then the usual route to the west will mean less flying time for passengers and fuel saving for AI at a time when fuel prices are on fire. “The flying time for north American nonstop flights will come down by up to 40 minutes and for the UK (London and Birmingham) by 20 minutes — almost like before the Afghan airspace closed,” said an airline source. “Our nonstops between Delhi and mainland Europe will continue to take the south Pakistan route for now as determined by our cost benefit analysis.” The sources said that on the return from north America, an aircraft will save four tonnes of fuel (one tonne while going and three on return). On a return UK flight, the saving will be 2.5 tonne. At the moment, due to travel restrictions in the United States (likely to be lifted from early November), there aren’t too many daily flights, but AI will still save 30 tonne per week using the Hindu Kush route. “At $800 per tonne of fuel, the weekly saving alone is $24,000, or around Rs 18 lakh at the current currency exchange rate,” confided a source. “When restrictions are lifted and we mount more flights to north America, the savings will multiply. Once the Afghan airspace reopens, we will resume the old route.” Canada, for instance, has just permitted nonstop flights from India and AI has resumed its direct Delhi-Toronto and Delhi-Vancouver services. Carrying less fuel will mean more payload in terms of passengers and/or cargo. So, the benefit of say, four tonne less fuel will be double — lesser fuel and the differential amount in extra payload. For the high terrain route, Air India has prepared through extra simulator drills, trial runs and special precautions. “This is the first time we will be taking the Hindu Kush route (technically called P500 and G500),” said a person in the know of things. “The Afghan airspace closure is a cost nightmare due to rising fuel prices. When we sat down to discuss how to beat this emerging crisis, the Hindu Kush route presented itself as the answer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ai-to-fly-over-hindu-kush-on-way-to-uk-n-america/articleshow/86792310.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Figures released by the state water resources department said that 727 dams in four divisions of Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur and Kota filled up to 71.60% as of October 5, while it recorded the highest 71.75% on September 30, 2020. The figures of the remaining three divisions of Ajmer, Bharatpur and Bikaner are not available. Jaipur division’s 261 dams have surpassed the water holding capacity of 2020 by 3% which means more water for irrigation. Kota division is leading with attaining 97% of the total capacity which is 10% higher than the previous year. Baran and Kota being only two districts where all dams—small and big has been filled 100% of their capacity making water available in abundance for irrigation and domestic use. The entire state expects the Hadoti region was under the clout of severe drought till the beginning of the first week of September with almost all dams were filled less than 50% of the capacity. Other than dams in the Kota region, Ghambiri, Orai and Bassi dam in Chittorgarh, Mahi Bajaj Sagar in Banswara, Parwati Dam in Dholpur, Gudha Dam in Bundi, Galai Sagar and Devpura in Sawai Madhopur have filled 100% of its capacity. In Jaipur district, Ramsagar Nevta and Kanota have been filled 90% and 80%, respectively, while the remaining dams are way below making the average occupancy of 20.62%. TOI called up the secretary of the water resource department, Dr Prithvi Raj for his comments on the water in dams but he didn’t respond. Sources said that the department will hold a review of the rainfall to classify districts on the basis of water accumulated in the rainy season. The review will decide which region/district will receive grants and aid accordingly. Rajesh Goyal, principal scientist, Central Arid Zone Research Institute, told TOI, “The unexpected rain in September is like hitting every ball out of the fence in the final overs.

---||Kolkata||Netizens grapple with 9-hr social media void||Kolkata: Some switched to Telegram, some reopened their dormant Twitter accounts following a stringent password recovery process, while others continued to switch on and off the mobile data and wifi routers, unable to digest the fact that a global outage had shut down WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, leaving an irreplaceable social media void between 9pm on Monday till 5am on Tuesday. “In this work from home period, we generally interact with team members virtually over WhatsApp for sending text messages as well as designs for approval. With the messaging system down, our entire communication became dependent on mails,” said Gourav Ghosh, who runs a graphic designing firm. Prior to Durga Puja, the Facebook outage meant a major business loss for fashion designer Subhasree Basu who had as many as three Facebook lives planned between 9.30pm and 1.30am but couldn’t log in despite several attempts. “I had to book the slots on different selling groups and the outage meant I had to incur a loss of anything between Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000 of sales,” rued Basu. But for a large section of Kolkatans, the unavailability of social media networks provided the perfect opportunity to turn nostalgic and at times even tickle the funny bone with Twitter, Signal and Telegram. Hilarious memes followed. “When everyone realizes that it wasn’t your Wifi....Wifi is not the imposter,” was one such meme that did the rounds. “Ab aaya unlimited SMS pack ka yaad? One minute of silence for all those who lived only on their Wifi,” tweeted Anubhab Chatterjee. “I even cleared data on WhatsApp thinking maybe it’s my phone and now I have to sign in only to find out that WhatsApp is down,” tweeted Ritika Das. The good old phone calls replaced the text messages in a number of case. “For the first time in several years, friends and family members started calling and wishing me on my birthday after midnight. It seemed special as I was hearing voices of my friends with whom I regularly interact on WhatsApp groups but hadn’t spoken for ages,” said Suvajit Dutt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/netizens-grapple-with-9-hr-social-media-void/articleshow/86792337.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Not only are popular artists and singers targeting residential societies across Ahmedabad, but sponsors also are eyeing to fund locally organized garba. With the state government banning commercial events, many residential societies have been flooded with offers of sponsorship and collaborations from cloud kitchens, real estate developers, jewellers, food businesses, and even banks. “We have received several requests from food and hospitality brands for collaborations, and we are on the verge of finalizing names. A company which runs a food truck is already conducting trial runs at the society. Since commercial garba functions will not take place this time, we have receive more sponsorship and collaboration requests than previous years,” said Chiranjiv Jha, chairperson of a residential society in Makarba. “Garba has been allowed after a good two years and therefore, sponsors are also excited to fund garba events in residential societies. Over the past few years except last year, we never faced much problem getting sponsorship but this year, the response is so exceptionally good that we don’t have much space to put up food stalls or banners,” said Jaymin Patel, secretary of a society in South Bopal area of the city. Businesses who used to cater to commercial and ticketed events until two years ago have shifted focus towards residential societies this year. Jigar Soni, an Ahmedabad-based jeweller, said, “Till last year, we used to market our brand by sponsoring garba at clubs and other commercial events organised at party plots. However, this time around, we are funding events at popular residential societies and townships too. Even though our budgets have shrunk, the response is tremendously good this year, wherever we’ve collaborated and put up our banners.” Similar is the case with those in catering business, who are now moving towards private events with more exclusive offerings. Narendra Somani, a city-based hotelier said, “We are catering to small-scale private events at farm houses and private party plots this year, unlike clubs and commercial events earlier.

The figures of the remaining three divisions of Ajmer, Bharatpur and Bikaner are not available. Jaipur division’s 261 dams have surpassed the water holding capacity of 2020 by 3% which means more water for irrigation. Kota division is leading with attaining 97% of the total capacity which is 10% higher than the previous year. Baran and Kota being only two districts where all dams—small and big has been filled 100% of their capacity making water available in abundance for irrigation and domestic use. The entire state expects the Hadoti region was under the clout of severe drought till the beginning of the first week of September with almost all dams were filled less than 50% of the capacity.

TOI called up the secretary of the water resource department, Dr Prithvi Raj for his comments on the water in dams but he didn’t respond. Sources said that the department will hold a review of the rainfall to classify districts on the basis of water accumulated in the rainy season. The review will decide which region/district will receive grants and aid accordingly. Rajesh Goyal, principal scientist, Central Arid Zone Research Institute, told TOI, “The unexpected rain in September is like hitting every ball out of the fence in the final overs. It has saved the state from additional financial burden, giving farmers hope of a good harvest, cattle herders promise of a constant supply of fodder, supply of water to household and industries a respite.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/727-dams-in-4-divs-filled-up-72-due-to-incessant-rains/articleshow/86800727.cms||Shoeb Khan

Woman in Ahmedabad alleges fraud||AHMEDABAD: A woman has approached the Gujarat high court challenging a divorce decree obtained with mutual consent and claimed that she was made to sign divorce papers while she was heavily intoxicated under drugs to treat her severe depression. The woman lives in Ahmedabad and her husband lives in Muscat, Oman, with their nine-year-old daughter. Upon the woman’s complaint that despite agreement on visitation rights she was not allowed to talk to her daughter, the HC ordered the man to allow her to do so. In this case, the couple got married in 2010 and was living in Muscat. The woman claimed that she was suffering from severe depression and her husband brought her to India in November 2015 for treatment. She knew that a return ticket had been purchased tpp. She alleged that she was made to sign an affidavit and divorce petition while under the influence of medicines. She did not know this. On the day of departure, the husband went to Muscat with the daughter. In 2016, the divorce decree was drawn. Three years later, the woman challenged the decree alleging fraud. The husband disputed this claim. The court questioned the veracity of the claim as the parties are required to sign on the affidavit seeking divorce through mutual consent before the court. The court also said that a civil suit ought to have been filed in this case and an appeal is not maintainable. The court added that the woman should have been advised properly when she had sought aid from HC authorities.

---||Ahmedabad||Screen to classroom: Jitters click in||AHMEDABAD: Schools have been spruced up and classrooms have been disinfected, but the most integral part of the education system — students — are still missing from the scene. Citybased school officials and experts said that apprehension among both children and parents is keeping classroom thinly populated. They also said that issues such as limited attention span and non-interest in studies are cropping up in initial days at schools. Hitesh Patel, president of Ahmedabad School Management Association, said that students back from over a year-long break from conventional education often show a lack of focus and take some time to process instructions. “Many have also reported weight gain,” he said. “Some students need guidance to write cohesively and legibly,” said Fr Xavier Amalaraj, principal of St Xavier’s High School Loyola Hall. Manan Choksi, president of the Ahmedabad Progressive School Management Association, said that some teachers have also reported temper issues. “They need to spend some more time with the students to understand their behaviour,” he said. “In several schools the examination mode had to be modified to fit the online format, and now with offline schooling, it is likely to go back to the pre-Covid format,” said Dr Punita Grover, a city-based adolescent and child psychiatrist. “Kids may need time to adjust to it and get back into the groove.” Dr Prashant Bhimani, a city-based psychologist, said that schools can opt for ‘soft start’ in which they don’t talk about education or syllabus right away. “It would be of great help for students and teachers alike if they can start with some fun activities and group activities to get the students acquainted with the environs of the school again,” he said. “In psychiatry, a term is applied to the behaviour of the jitters and sometimes even psychosomatic disorders — separation anxiety,” said Dr Kevin Patel, a citybased psychiatrist. “The children have been in this setting for long, and will take some time to adjust to the new normal. A similar phenomenon was seen when online classes had started over a year ago.” (With inputs from Parth Shastri)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/screen-to-classroom-jitters-click-in/articleshow/86791989.cms||Bharat Yagnik

A senior UT official said they have started accepting applications for BH series. UT has received one application and RLA authorities have asked the applicant to complete the set of documents required. The Union ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH) announced Bharat series (BH-series) on August 26. This is to facilitate seamless transfer of vehicles for owners moving from one state to another. According to Motor Vehicle Rules, a vehicle is not permitted to ply with another state registration number beyond 11 months from the date of migration. Vehicle owners will have to re-register it from the parent state to the new state, which is a cumbersome process. On August 26, MORTH issued a notification on BH services, which came into effect on September 15 and is applicable to defence personnel, employees of central government/state government/central/ state public sector undertakings and private sector companies/organisations, which have their offices in four or more states/ Union Territories. Under this scheme, MV tax will be levied for two years or in multiples of two instead of the present one-time lifetime regime (15 years). After 14 years, the tax will be levied annually, which will be half the amount levied for the vehicle earlier. This is mainly to help those who have transferable jobs to move from one state to another without any registration hassles. Road TaxAs per the notification, for a BH registration vehicle, road tax will be charged at 8% if the cost of the vehicle is below Rs 10 lakh. It is 10% for those costing between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 20 lakh. For vehicles costing more than Rs 20 lakh, the tax is 12%. Diesel vehicles will be charged 2% extra. Electric vehicles shall be charged 2% less tax. BH numberThe BH number will look like “21 BH XXXX A”. In this, the first two digits is the year of the first registration, BH is the code for the series, the four numbers (XXXX) between 0001 to 9999, followed by two letter (s) A, B, C……AA, AB….AZ of the English alphabet. BenficiariesBH services are applicable to defence personnel, employees of central government/state government/central/ state public sector undertakings and private sector companies/organisations, which have their offices in four or more states/ Union Territories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bh-series-registration-begins-for-vehicles-in-chandigarh/articleshow/86792373.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Before the second wave in March, the district used to record only less than 150 cases a day. While there was a fluctuation in the daily caseload, with the district topping the state in the number of fresh cases following the surge in the infection rate in neighbouring Kerala, the cases started to dip over the past two weeks. There wasn’t a spike even after relaxing the lockdown norms significantly. Cases were below the 200-mark in the district for the past 11 days. There is a considerable decline in the containment zones too. At present, the district has just 34 containment zones, compared to 85 in mid-August. Health officials said the mass vaccination drives had helped them keep the fresh cases in check. “We have administered more than 34 lakh vaccine doses in the district so far. In the past four weekends alone, we have inoculated close to five lakh people at the mass vaccination camps. This has helped people develop antibodies against Covid-19,” said a public health official. P Aruna, deputy director of health services, said while the relaxation of the lockdown norms and reopening of schools had posed challenges, the district was able to contain the virus spread. “This was possible with the random sample collection across the district, especially from the educational institutions. The infected could be identified early and isolated to prevent them from transmitting the virus to their contacts.” At least 208 Covid patients were, meanwhile, discharged from various treatment centres in the district on the day, bringing the number of active cases down to 1,842. While 2,43,294 people had tested positive for the virus in the district till date, 2,39,107 of them have recovered. The Covid toll, meanwhile, shot up to 2,345 with the state including two more fatalities that occurred in the district in the media bulletin. Fresh cases continued to decline in neighbouring Tirupur too where 72 people were found to be infected with the virus on the day, taking the case tally to 9,3421. With 79 patients getting discharged from hospitals on the day, the number of active Covid cases in Tirupur stands at 846, while the number of recovered patients has increased to 91,618.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/covid-cases-touch-6-month-low-of-151-in-dist/articleshow/86794871.cms||Sampath Kumar

Dr Shriniwas Gadappa, head of department of obstetrics and gynaecology at GMCH, on Tuesday said ambiguous genitalia occurs due to hormone abnormalities during pregnancy. A disruption of the steps that determine sex can result in a mismatch between the appearance of the external genitals and the internal sex organs or the genetic sex. “Such abnormalities affect foetus’s developing sex organs. The genital of newborn with ambiguous genitalia cannot be identified as male or female due complex developments of tissues. Besides hormonal abnormalities, a family history of such disorder is also an important factor in the occurrence of the rare disorder,” he said. Gadappa said the sex of the child with the disorder is decided depending upon the sexual orientation and other characteristics during growth stages. “We are carrying out different tests and investigations of the newborn to decide the line of treatment. The option of medications and / or surgery can be explored later depending upon the lab reports,” he said. The baby was born on September 14 and was discharge from the hospital recently. The GMCH authorities have also counselled the parents, who are coping with the medical emergency arising after the birth of their first child. The 24-year-old father of the baby said he was awaiting lab reports. “Our entire family is going through an ordeal at present. We pray to God that our child comes out of all this and leads a normal life,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/baby-with-rare-birth-disorder-born-in-aurangabad-gmch/articleshow/86788013.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Pilot project of tree census reveals 51% of 15k trees are exotic species||Nagpur: The pilot project of tree census has revealed 50.73% of the total trees in surveyed stretch are exotic species, and 77% are planted ones. It indicates replacement of natural tree cover by manmade tree cover in this particular area. Under Local Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (LBSAP), International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) had planned to prepare Natural Asset Map (NAM) of the city and also conduct tree census in scientific manner to identify existing biodiversity and suggests steps for its conservation and improvement. ICLEI entrusted the project to World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), which engaged city’s Punarnava Ecological Services as partner agency for carrying out the field work. A team of well known ecologists and experts, including Pradyumna Sahasrabhojanee and Prachi Mahurkar, selected an area of 2.77 sq km situated between four squares — Variety, Law College, Bajaj Nagar, and Lokmat for pilot project of tree census. As per the report, 14,458 trees were found in this area belonging to 191 different species. Of total trees, 7,335 (50.73%) trees were of exotic species, 7,097 (49.1%) native, and 26 cultivated (0.17%). Sahasrabhojanee and Mahurkar told TOI, “It is expected that native species should be 100%. Presence of 50.73% exotic trees, which are not from Central India, means native species were removed for one or other purposes. Survival rate of native species is always higher compared to exotic. Also, native species help sustain entire biodiversity of a particular area right from insects to birds, animals etc. Even religious rituals, traditions of human beings are based on native species. Another disadvantage of exotic species is that they are likely to become invasive for native species.” Also as per report of tree census, percentage of naturally grown trees is 23% while remaining 77% are planted ones. Sahasrabhojanee and Mahurkar said Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) should conduct tree census using this scientific pattern across the city. “Tree census should be done once in five years to know destruction of greenery, and plan further improvement or conservation of existing ones. We ensured marking of each tree on the map with all possible details like local names, botanical names, height, girth, condition, local or exotic species, location with latitude/longitude along with a photograph. Later, tree labels were also placed on all major species at different public places. It will help NMC conserve these trees,” they said. Mahurkar also said uncontrolled urbanization is taking a toll on biodiversity of the city. “Sometimes re-planting of trees, if done honestly, can help the city to recover its green cover. But to retain the diversity of rare and endangered plants in the city, or to increase proportion of suitable native trees, which improve environmental conditions, scientific surveys and documentation of available biodiversity is needed. This base data will eventually help NMC take action against illegal tree felling,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pilot-project-of-tree-census-reveals-51-of-15k-trees-are-exotic-species/articleshow/86792431.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Both of them rolled out this unique initiative by flagging off a helicopter to undertake this survey. Jal shakti ministry has recently given a sanction to this survey with a view to develop high resolution aquifer map and management of water for enhancement of the groundwater resources and resolution of water problem of water in arid areas of North Western part of the country in Rajasthan, Gujrat, Haryana and Panjab. “With this heliborne survey, we would be able to cover more bigger areas to derive more accurate data. In some areas, this survey would also provide information about level, quantity, quality and their information of groundwater present as deep as 500 metres,” said Shekhawat in his inaugural address. He said we should be conscious that how to take maximum produce from the least water because domestic and industrial consumption of is lesser than the agriculture. “Rajasthan also have highest cattle population which also required more water. So there is the dire need of better water management here,” he said. The new technique, he said, would help in water conservation, identification of new places for ground water recharging and that too at lesser cost than the prevalent ones like digging tube wells using geophysics and remote sensing techniques,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/heliborne-survey-to-map-aquifers-in-arid-regions/articleshow/86796970.cms||---

Jitesh, 30, who holds a BTech degree in civil engineering, is expected to put up a strong fight for the October 30 bypoll. The election was necessitated following the demise of his father due to Covid-related complications in April. “My father enjoyed mass following as he was a leader with a clean image, who had his feet on ground. His untimely demise has equally shocked his voters from Deglur assembly constituency,” Jitesh told ToI, while expressing confidence about winning the election. With the formal announcement, Congress leaders from Nanded, including PWD minister Ashok Chavan, have swung into action. The maiden election rally took place at Kundalwadi in Biloli taluka on Tuesday. Addressing the rally, Chavan recalled last days of Antapurkar in hospital before his death due to post Covid complications on April 9. “While everyone was worried and panicky during those days, Jitesh was dealing with the situation in a stoic manner. This attitude is an essential quality for any good public leader. I can guarantee that he will fulfil your expectations,” he said. Chavan also took pot shots at Subhash Sabne, who has ditched Shiv Sena to fight the bypoll on BJP ticket. “He (Sabne) was shedding tears while leaving his party. But these are crocodile tears,” he said.

The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is constructing Line 2A (D N Nagar to Dahisar) via the Link Road. This route’s station at DN Nagar is named as Andheri West. “This is the only station on this corridor where an entire floor will be leased for commercial exploitation,” S V R Srinivas, metropolitan commissioner, said. “We expect a good response as the location is attractive for business activities like retail and eateries.” Andheri West station will have three levels with the first being offered for commercial use. The second level will house the ticketing area, and third level will have platforms. Shadab Siddiqui from Auctus Advisors, who are consultants for non-fare revenue for Lines 2A and 7 Andheri (E) to Dahisar (E) said, “Around 13,500 sq ft of space is available at level 1 and approximately 4,000 sq ft at level 2. Market benchmarks from the existing Line 1 and catchment areas of 2A and 7 indicate rentals in the range of Rs 500 to 1,000 per sq ft per month.” At Andheri West station, the unit sizes available are in the range of 26 sq ft for small kiosks, like ATMs and vending machines, up to 3,500 sq ft for a café or mini food court. The MMRDA said that the work on the station building has just begun and it will take at least six months to complete. Officials said all Metro corridors that are being executed will make profits as they are predicted to have a good financial internal rate of return owing to decent ridership number and potential to earn from non-fare box revenue sources. Apart from advertising, non-fare revenue will also be earned from station branding rights, mobile apps and even leasing out advertising rights in trains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-metro-2a-to-offer-17500-sq-ft-on-rent-on-andheri-w-stn/articleshow/86794939.cms||Manthank Mehta

Two of the 15 talukas have received less than 70% of their yearly rainfall quota, while four have received 100% and others have received more than 100% showers. Overall, the district received about 30% of the total rainfall in September alone, said the district administration. While the usually parched Chandwad taluka has received just 60% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon period that got over by September 30, Nashik taluka has registered just 63%. However, nine talukas have received more than 100% of their annual rainfall. The Nandgaon taluka received almost twice its annual rainfall quota. On September 7, the taluka got 126 mm rainfall. The Nashik district, which receives about 1,000mm of rain on average every year, had received 1,047mm by September-end. Last year, the district had received 1,086mm of rain. Resident deputy collector Bhagwat Doifode said the rain started very late this year and the water levels in the dams were dropping fast.

---||Goa||Non-Covid rush: Some Goa Medical College wards run out of beds||PANAJI: In April-May, Goa Medical College (GMC) ran out of beds in its Covid-19 wards as the second wave of the pandemic made its ferocious impact felt. Fast-forward five months, and the state’s premier healthcare institution is once again facing a shortage of beds — but this time, it’s because of a sharp rise in non-Covid patients. This spike in GMC admissions has been noticed since Covid cases started dipping. At times, patients have even to be accommodated on stretchers. GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar said that during the second wave, when regular OPDs were shut, most wards were converted into Covid wards, and non-Covid patients were unable to visit their doctors for follow-ups. Also, people who got sick then were compelled to avoid the hospital. All this has now added up, and the tertiary care hospital is seeing more than 200 admissions daily, which is far higher than the average numbers. “The sudden increase has been seen (mainly) in patients having lifestyle-related diseases, and they are presenting in a critical state,” said Bandekar. “People are likely to have ignored their regular diet and other routines during the lockdown. It has all manifested into their ill health, and suddenly we are seeing a rush of patients. That’s what we feel.” A spurt has been seen in stroke cases, and all medicine and surgery wards are running full. “In ward 139, with 30 beds, where stroke patients are kept, we have 59 patients,” he said. Last week, Dr Shirish Borkar, head of GMC’s cardiovascular and thoracic surgery department, told TOI that his department too was seeing a lot more patients since Covid cases had waned. Another GMC doctor said that the institute also sees more patients as even the slightest critical case gets referred to GMC from district and sub-district hospitals. However, it has not been computed on average how many patients are referred daily by other government hospitals to GMC, and indeed if all cases sent are critical. “Besides, many people visit the tertiary care hospital on their own when their ailment could be taken care of at the hospital close to them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/non-covid-rush-some-gmc-wards-run-out-of-beds/articleshow/86794995.cms||Bindiya Chari

The proposal was kept on hold after allegations of irregularities and diluted tender conditions by the opposition BJP. The committee cleared proposals for redevelopment of conservancy workers’ quarters in N ward (Chirag Nagar), L (Lions Garden), S (Amrapali Building) and T wards (Gaikwad Nagar). Proposals for redeveloping quarters in P-South (Mithanagar, Pragati Nagar) were also cleared. This project will cost BMC Rs 351 crore. The total project cost for the redevelopment projects is Rs 574 crore. But proposals for redeveloping quarters in R-South ward (Akurli Road) and R-Central ward (Babhai Naka) worth Rs 89 crore were deferred. The committee had cleared proposals for redevelopment of conservancy workers’ quarters in B ward (Dongri), F-South (Parel, Sewri) and G-south (Worli) under Ashray Yojana to provide bigger homes. BJP had objected to the process of appointment of contractors for redevelopment of staff quarters. BMC plans to spend around Rs 3,500 crore on the entire scheme. “In many tenders, BMC got a single bid but still awarded the contract. As per CVC guidelines, BMC should have reinvited the tenders,” BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-panel-clears-part-of-rs-574cr-project-for-redevpt/articleshow/86795010.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Speaking to reporters at Mangaluru International Airport here on Tuesday, he blamed “police high-handedness” in the detention of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi who was on her way to Lakhimpur to console the families of farmers who were killed. “Male cops manhandled her (Priyanka Gandhi), and this is an insult to the country’s culture and democracy,” he said. “The son of a central minister has killed four persons after ploughing a four-wheeler over the protesting farmers. But still, police have not arrested anyone behind the incident and the minister has not resigned. Is there a government and law in our country? What crime has Priyanka Gandhi committed? Everyone has the right to protest in a democracy. The government is trying to suppress the rights of people. Neither the Prime Minister nor any other minister have visited the farmers who have been staging peaceful protests for several months,” he said. DKS appears before court Shivakumar appeared before a court in Sullia in a case pertaining to the arrest of a man, who was booked for abusing him when he was the energy minister. Shivakumar had then received a call from Sai Giridhar, a trader from Bellare. Giridhar had allegedly hurled abuses at him, after which police arrested him from his house. During the hearings, Shivakumar failed to respond to summons. “When I was the energy minister, an unknown person had called me and abused me using filthy language. Later, officials filed a complaint, because of which they too were abused. The court has directed me to appear as a witness in that case. Initially, I was not aware of it. But now I have heeded the court’s order,” Shivakumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/up-govt-snatching-citizens-rights-to-protest-dks/articleshow/86792059.cms||---

As per data obtained from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), between June 2020 and September 30, 2021, the Nuisance Detection Squad (NDS) has recovered over Rs1.98 crore penalty from 46,260 citizens for not wearing mask. Similarly, Rs70.14 lakh fine was recovered from 2,444 shopkeepers for violating odd-even rule imposed during the lockdown in city limits. The civic cops also penalized owners of marriage halls, lawns and shopkeepers for disobeying Covid-19 protocol and imposed over Rs1.95 crore as penalty. Despite paying such a huge amount as fine, many Nagpurians can still be found venturing in public places without bothering to follow Covid safety protocol. On Tuesday, TOI spotted Mankapur police personnel not allowing citizens without mask to cast their vote during the zilla parishad bypoll at one of the polling booths. However, the situation inside the polling booths was exactly opposite. Polling staff and agents of major political parties sitting inside were without mask. TOI visited many public places including railway station, Ganeshpeth bus depot, Mor Bhavan city bus depot and found scant or no regard for Covid-19 protocol. Similar was the situation at the city’s main commercial areas like Sitabuldi, Dharampeth, Cotton Market, Sakkardara, Sadar etc. Even though a large number of citizens can easily be spotted moving about without face mask in public places, the NMC’s civic cops have been penalizing average 15 to 30 citizens a day only. Sources pointed out that during the first and second waves of the pandemic, the NDS team led by commandant Virsen Tambe had done a commendable job in enforcing Covid guidelines such as face mask must rule etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpurians-pay-rs-4-64cr-for-flouting-covid-protocol/articleshow/86792495.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Dr Shriniwas Gadappa, head of department of obstetrics and gynaecology at GMCH, on Tuesday said ambiguous genitalia occurs due to hormone abnormalities during pregnancy. A disruption of the steps that determine sex can result in a mismatch between the appearance of the external genitals and the internal sex organs or the genetic sex. “Such abnormalities affect foetus’s developing sex organs. The genital of newborn with ambiguous genitalia cannot be identified as male or female due complex developments of tissues. Besides hormonal abnormalities, a family history of such disorder is also an important factor in the occurrence of the rare disorder,” he said. Gadappa said the sex of the child with the disorder is decided depending upon the sexual orientation and other characteristics during growth stages. “We are carrying out different tests and investigations of the newborn to decide the line of treatment. The option of medications and / or surgery can be explored later depending upon the lab reports,” he said. The baby was born on September 14 and was discharge from the hospital recently. The GMCH authorities have also counselled the parents, who are coping with the medical emergency arising after the birth of their first child. The 24-year-old father of the baby said he was awaiting lab reports. “Our entire family is going through an ordeal at present. We pray to God that our child comes out of all this and leads a normal life,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/baby-with-rare-birth-disorder-born-in-aurangabad-gmch/articleshow/86788083.cms||---

The accused have been arrested. According to police, the incident was reported on Monday when Gupta was in his house in the park area of Karol Bagh.

The estimated cost of the project is Rs 33 lakh. TOI had frontpaged a report on September 19 highlighting the community’s continuous struggle in Camona’s remote forest area without basic necessities such as water, electricity and a motorable road. Assistant engineer (electricity) Sharad Naik told TOI that the procurement of material and the tendering process to supply electricity to the Dhangar community has been fast-tracked. “We are trying to supply power to them during Diwali as soon as we issue a tender and work order, but it will not go beyond Chirstmas,” Naik said. A total of 50 RCC poles will be erected using two transformers covering a distance of nearly 3km. Sources, however, said that erecting them may take extra time due to the difficulty in manoeuvring heavy vehicles transporting the poles on the uneven road. The stretch, however, is likely to be levelled temporarily. Two houses at Naqueri under the Cavrem-Pirla panchayat have also been included in the tender. Seven poles will be erected to give them power supply. An elated Bhome Bhavdhan, 55, said the misery of living in darkness from the time she was born birth would be over. “We were unable to purchase electrical equipment like fridges, TVs and washing machines due to lack of power supply. The sweltering summers, too, have been difficult to get through without a fan in our homes,” Bhavdhan said. Another local, Bombo Bhavdhan, was equally happy after staff from the electricity department visited the ward for a quick survey to erect a new line. “We had completed the wiring in our houses two year ago and had submitted our files in the Quepem office,” he said. The families were connected to a solar power network about five years ago, but it didn’t last long.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-living-70-yrs-in-the-dark-cavrem-dhangars-to-see-the-light-by-christmas/articleshow/86795050.cms||Johnny M
---||Mumbai||Sanjay Raut meets Rahul Gandhi, sings Priyanka’s praises||MUMBAI: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Tuesday met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi. Raut, who is the executive editor of Saamna, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, spoke to Gandhi and reportedly discussed the violence in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri and other issues related to Maharashtra. After the meeting, Raut said he discussed issues related to Maharashtra and UP. He lauded Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for her courage. “There was discussion about UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri incident and Priyanka’s Gandhi’s arrest. Priyanka’s arrest is unfortunate. Arresting her and putting her behind bars, it can only happen in India under the garb of democracy. But this is not democracy. Unless and until the opposition is united we won’t be able to stop such incidents,” Raut said after the meeting with Rahul Gandhi, which lasted 20-25 minutes. “Priyanka Gandhi has been arrested so at such a time it was very important to meet Rahul Gandhi and talk to him. The Congress is the principal opposition party in the country. It is the largest opposition party. CM of states are not being allowed to other states, this is shameful in a democracy. The CM should be respected even if he is from another party. Under this rule, what is freedom when we celebrate independence? The Congress has a history since the independence movement. Since those days, big Congress leaders have faced FIRs and cases. The courage shown by Priyanka Gandhi will give energy to opposition parties across the country,” Raut said. “They are missing power and trying to strangle the opposition. There is a law, if it is equal for all then why is Priyanka Gandhi in jail and those responsible for this incident roaming scot-free?” he said. Before his meeting, with opposition leaders prevented from going to Lakhimpur Kheri, Raut had called for joint action by political parties against this ‘oppression’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raut-meets-rahul-on-up-sings-priyankas-praises/articleshow/86795046.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The meeting, which was held in the wake of the latest legal developments in the case that is said to have gone against the university, saw discussions on the ruling of the Bombay high court’s Aurangabad bench. The court has recently set aside the Bamu order, which had removed Prof Prashant Amrutkar from the post of the dean of the Humanities department. A Ph.D scholar had accused the professor of illegal gratification to arrange his viva-voce. The court had also sought an inquiry into the incident by a grievance redressal mechanism, not the inquiry committee set up under the Maharashtra Public Universities Act. Sanjay Nimbalkar, a member of the management council, said all documents related to the case and other details have been sought from the university administration. “We will study the verdict and the updates to decide whether to challenge or review the HC decision,” he said. Nimbalkar added that the forensic investigation of audio-clips between the research scholar and the dean had not taken place so far. “We have requested the university administration to look into the lapse,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bamu-mgmt-council-takes-stock-of-cash-for-viva-case/articleshow/86788080.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||India||Gujarat civic polls: BJP wins big, AAP chips off Congress votes||GANDHINAGAR/AHMEDABAD: BJP broke the jinx and rode to victory in civic polls in Gandhinagar. Counting on Tuesday saw BJP bag 41 seats in the 44-member body; Congress was all but wiped out in its traditional stronghold. Prior to this, BJP has never secured a majority in the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC) polls since the body’s inception in 2010. Much of Congress’s anguish came from AAP. Congress saw its vote share slashed from 46.9% to 27.9%, a cut of 18.9%. AAP grabbed an impressive debut vote share of 21.3%. BJP’s vote share increased by 1.7% to 46.5% but helped it corner 90% of the seats. Gandhinagar is the seat of power and polls were held against the backdrop of the BJP high command’s audacious experiment of completely overhauling the government ahead of the 2022 assembly polls. Significantly, despite pocketing 21% of the vote share, AAP won just one seat in the corporation. Congress won just two seats. Firecrackers were set off, sweets were distributed, and drums rang out for most part of the day at Kamalam, the state BJP headquarters in Gandhinagar. State BJP chief CR Paatil and CM Bhupendra Patel credited PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah for the party’s superlative showing at the polls. With the Gandhinagar civic body in its kitty, BJP is now in complete control of all urban bodies as it governs eight major cities, including Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot, Vadodara, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, and Junagadh. Political analysts said this win will enhance Paatil’s stature as a party leader who can consistently deliver results. “The historic result again proves that the people of Gujarat completely trust Modi,” Paatil remarked. Gopal Italia, state AAP president, said,“BJP has won the numbers game. In winning people’s hearts, AAP has certainly done great.” He added, “Our candidate has won and the party has got a whopping 21% vote share in its maiden contest. BJP has managed through money and muscle power.” Meanwhile, in a setback for BJP, Congress emerged victorious in Bhanvad municipality in Devbhumi Dwarka district, winning 16 of the 24 seats. BJP, which managed to win only eight seats this time, had been in power in Bhanvad since 1995.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gujarat-civic-polls-bjp-wins-big-aap-chips-off-congress-votes/articleshow/86798473.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Manchu Vishnu luring senior actors by paying for postal ballots, says Prakash Raj||HYDERABAD: A controversy broke out in Tollywood days before the Movie Artistes Association (MAA) goes to polls on October 10. Actor Prakash Raj, a contender for the president’s post, alleged that rival panel headed by actor Manchu Vishnu was trying to influence voters by paying for the postal ballots for the use of senior actors who may not be able to come to cast their vote physically. As per the norms, Rs 500 fee will be paid for the ballot paper, which will be sent to the artiste’s house in the address that they reside. An infuriated Prakash Raj, flanked by actor Srikanth and actress Jeevitha Rajasekhar, questioned the propriety of Vishnu panel in depositing amounts on behalf of the artistes who would be sent the ballot paper. “A lumpsum amount was paid. This only goes to show that the individuals on whose behalf they paid the money will be influenced to vote for them,” Prakash Raj charged. While raising the issue, Prakash Raj dragged the names of several seniors in the film industry demanding that they respond to what was happening. He said the amount had been paid even on behalf of disciplinary committee chairman Krishnam Raju, veteran hero Krishna, Paruchuri brothers, senior actress Sharada and actor Sharath Babu. “I request Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna and all the seniors to react to the developments taking place in the run-up to the elections. There is no fair play in the elections. This is tragic and not acceptable,” he said. Returning officer Krishnamohan said Rs 28,000 that a person had deposited on behalf of senior citizens for their ballot paper had been returned. “We have informed senior actors the bank account to which they can send the money and they will have to do it individually,” he said. Giving a clarification on a person associated with Vishnu depositing the amount, Krishnamohan said Vishnu had informed him that he was in touch with senior citizens to explain to them about the postal ballot facility and how a person associated with him had deposited the amount on behalf of all these individuals. Manchu Vishnu reacted sharply to what Prakash Raj said. “Don’t you dare drag my family into your criticism. This is my last warning to you,” he said. He also questioned Jeevitha Rajasekhar for asking actors to ignore the calls made by his father Mohan Babu to vote for him. “My father can seek votes on my behalf. What is wrong?” he questioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vishnu-luring-senior-actors-by-paying-for-postal-ballots-raj/articleshow/86792550.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Nagpur||NMC lays paver blocks on drainage chambers||Nagpur: The residents of Barde Layout in Borgaon have been left baffled after they found that their numerous complaints regarding a faulty sewage line were allegedly “solved,” though dirty water continues to enter their compound and remain clogged in the bylanes. Foul stench rents the air with mosquitoes breeding in small pools at different spots. Making matter worse, the NMC’s public works department laid paver blocks on the drainage chambers. Residents complain that many people have been suffering from dengue and malaria, yet the Mangalwari zone, in whose jurisdiction the area falls, has left much to be desired. Vijay Humne, assistant commissioner of the zone, blamed division among the residents for the seepage of sewage. “Some residents wanted paver blocks without the chamber hump and hence the chambers got sealed over a year ago. Since there was an issue with the sewage line, the chamber mouth should have been properly made. I have asked the concerned engineer to ensure the chambers are cleared of paver blocks,” he said. Humne expressed inability to immediately solve the sewage line fault. “We don’t have enough funds to replace the line,” he said. Ajay Pillay, a resident, said, “My wife had to be admitted for dengue for five days. She was critical for some time and is still weak. The sewage water is overflowing for many years. After all these complaints, authorities think the problem has been ‘resolved’. But actually, the problem still persists.” Another resident Asma Qureshi’s 64-year-old husband had to be admitted twice since August. The Qureshi family is the worst affected as the sewage-clogged lane covers entire one-side of their home. “The foul stench becomes unbearable during the night. We have been living here since 1997. Earlier, there was only a kutcha road. The problem started when a tar road was laid. Within days, the drainage line blocked and remains so till date,” she said. IT professional Ivan Anthony said, “Every monsoon, sewage water gets accumulated in our compound. This is the main sewage line of the colony. Some people living in upper areas are dumping waste in chambers which leads to blockage in the lower portion. The sealed chambers have only added to the problem. So far, we used to only have foul stench and hygiene issues. Now, residents are facing health hazards too. Who will be responsible if a life is lost?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-lays-paver-blocks-on-drainage-chambers/articleshow/86792559.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Goa||Five reservoirs in Goa filled to capacity as monsoon ends||PANAJI: At the end of the monsoon, all minor and major reservoirs in the state, except one, are filled to capacity, ensuring sufficient raw water reserves for Goa until the next monsoon arrives. Even water levels in the Tillari reservoir, across the border in Sindhudurg, Maharashtra, stand at 97%. Goa received 6% excess rainfall during this monsoon. Officials of the water resources department said that this year, the reservoirs were overflowing by early August itself, as Goa received copious amounts of rainfall in the first two months of the monsoon’s arrival. Water had to be released from dams to maintain safe levels in the reservoirs. Yet, at the end of the monsoon season, the reservoirs stand filled to capacity again. Water levels stand at 102% of capacity at the Selaulim dam in Ugem, Sanguem, which provides raw water to meet drinking water requirements of most of South Goa. The other major reservoir in the state, at Anjunem in Sattari, is filled to 99% of capacity. The minor reservoir of Panchwadi is similarly filled to 98% of capacity, while Chapoli and Gaunem reservoirs in Canacona are 100% full, as per WRD records on Tuesday. “In the case of the Tillari reservoir, though records show it as 97% full, it is filled to capacity. Because of safety reasons, to maintain a safe level in the dam, water was being released during heavy rainfall. Now, the dam is being allowed to fill up gradually again,” said an official. The Tillari reservoir provides water to meet drinking and irrigation needs of Goa in an understanding with the Maharashtra government. Amthane in Bicholim is the only reservoir of the six in the state where water levels stand at less than half the capacity. Water levels in Amthane dam presently are at 41%. Soon, pumping of water into the dam from the River Sal will begin to replenish the reservoir. “As Amthane supplies raw water to the Assnora plant, when there is no rain, the incoming water is less and outgoing water is more,” said a WRD official. “This leads to a drop in water levels due to demand at the Assnora plant. The pumps which are kept at a higher and safe level during the monsoon, to keep them from getting submerged, will be brought down now and pumping from the Sal into Amthane will begin soon.” The Assnora plant meets the drinking water requirement of Bardez taluka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/five-reservoirs-in-state-filled-to-capacity-as-monsoon-ends/articleshow/86795075.cms||---

However, most of the siphoned off money could not be recovered by the city police since the accused had either already spent the ill-gotten money or it had changed multiple hands. City police claimed that they have unravelled the fraud and on Wednesday atleast two more persons will be declared arrested apart from the three persons who have already been arrested. “We found that four specific accused, which include the bank officials, shared Rs 15 crore of the total siphoned off Rs 60 crore among themselves as commission. There are other accused who distributed the remaining money among themselves,” an official involved in the probe said. When asked about the recovery, an official said, “The fraud has been taking place since December 2020. So the distribution of the money and spending has already been taking place since a long time. As a result, the recovery of the missing money at this point is less and during further investigation, we have to focus on making additional recovery.” An official of the accounts wing of Telugu Akademi and a few others are still being questioned before the declaration of their arrest on Wednesday. “Some of these accused were booked in similar cases of fraud in different states, including Hyderabad,” police said. Though the police said that the banks concerned- Union Bank of India and Canara Bank- are liable to repay Telugu Akademi’s FD money since they are the custodians, a few days ago the banks too had lodged a complaint at CCS claiming that the money of the Telugu Akademi was withdrawn by a few persons through submission of fake documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/inter-state-gang-behind-rs-60-cr-telugu-akademi-scam-police/articleshow/86792563.cms||Srinath Vudali
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Dalit Bandhu has no bearing on bypoll, says CM K Chandrasekhar Rao||HYDERABAD: Dismissing the allegations that Dalit Bandhu was launched with an eye on Huzurabad by-election, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said the scheme would be implemented even after the elections. He exuded confidence that Telangana Rashtra Samithi would come to power in the next term also and that BJP will have no chance at the hustings. He reiterated that the government wanted to implement schemes on the lines of Dalit Bandhu for minorities, BCs and upper castes. During a short discussion on Dalit Bandhu in the state assembly on Tuesday, the CM said: “Dalit Bandhu will continue and will be implemented in saturation mode in Huzurabad. The government will not resort to cheap tricks and tell lies for electoral gains. The amount released for the scheme will remain with district collectors till it reaches all the beneficiaries.” He was replying to MLAs’ queries as the scheme was being implemented as part of SC sub-plan. Some wondered if the government was ready to give a statutory status to the scheme. On the issues raised by AIMIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi, Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka of Congress and BJP’s M Raghunandan Rao, the CM said Dalit Bandhu would be implemented for 100 people in each assembly constituency in all 119 segments in the current financial year. The scheme is already being implemented in Huzurabad and four mandals in four constituencies in the state by spending about Rs 3,000 crore. The chief minister said: “The government will earmark Rs 20,000 crore in the next budget 2022-23 for extending the scheme for 2,000 people in each assembly constituency.” On the advice of Raghunandan Rao on seeking support from the Centre, the chief minister said he had already requested the Prime Minister to support the scheme. “If we get financial support from the Centre, we will extend the benefit to five lakh people next year,” he said. K Chandrasekhar Rao said the TRS may dictate terms to Centre in the coming years. He said a situation may arise where theTelangana Rashtra Samithi could play a key role at the Centre.

On Monday, the village residents carried out a search for the child — Arav Rajesh Kesarkar — but failed to find him. The boy’s father, Rajesh Kesarkar, a construction worker, filed a missing complaint at the Shahuwadi police station. District superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade visited the village on Monday and deployed more police personnel to search for the missing boy. Shivaji Bajarang Patil, the village sarpanch, said, “The boy was found dead in front of his parents’ old house. We had searched the place earlier, but had not found him there. We suspect he was murdered and the body was dumped at the spot later. Also, we found ceremonial colours on his body.” Tirupati Kakade, the additional police superintendent, visited the village and asked the local police to trace the people who might have committed the act. The body was taken for post mortem and the report is awaited. This is the second case in the district in recent months when a boy has been kidnapped and allegedly murdered. In August, in the Kagal tehsil, a seven-year-old was kidnapped and murdered. In that case, the boy’s father’s friend was arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/missing-5-year-old-found-dead/articleshow/86788138.cms||---

The headless carcass of the animal was found floating in a nullah on Banor-Thadipaoni road. According to deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Bharat Singh Hada, the cub seems to have been killed three days ago. “We found the cub’s head nearly 100 metres away from the spot,” he said. According to sources, the leopard is suspected to have been caught in a trap, perhaps laid for hares for bushmeat. After finding the leopard in the trap, the suspected poachers tried to destroy evidence by chopping the head of the animal. The incident once again highlights large-scale poaching of herbivores by locals for meat. According to RTI information, 58 leopards and 26 tigers have died due to poaching, which mostly included poisoning, trapping, and electrocution. The leopard carcass was shifted to Seminary Hills Transit Treatment Centre (TTC) where postmortem was conducted by veterinarians Dr Mayur Kate and Kavita Sakhare in the presence of ACF PD Palwe, RFO RP Bhivgade, state wildlife board member Kundan Hate and honorary wildlife warden Ajinkya Bhatkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/headless-carcass-of-leopard-cub-found/articleshow/86792604.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: BJP puts up ex-Sena MLA against Congress for bypoll||MUMBAI: Deglur will witness a straight contest between Congress nominee Jitesh Antapurkar and BJP’s Subhash Sabne for the October 30 by-election to the legislative assembly. Jitesh is the son of Raosaheb Antapurkar, the assembly member from Deglur who succumbed to post-Covid complications. Along with Congress, Jitesh has been supported by Shiv Sena and NCP. A week ago, the Congress Parliamentary Board had unanimously recommended the nomination of Jitesh, which was approved by the AICC on Monday. The BJP was looking for a suitable nominee for the by-election, and unexpectedly, it found a prized catch when leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis succeeded in persuading Sabne to quit the Shiv Sena and joined BJP. Sabne agreed immediately, following which he was admitted into the BJP and nominated for the by-election. Sabne had won from Deglur in the 2014 assembly elections, while Antapurkar had won in 2009 and 2019. Sabne’s decision is being viewed as a major setback for the Sena, since he was among the prominent leaders of the party in the Marathwada region. According to reports, following the formation of the MVA, Sabne had no option but to join the BJP. The by-election assumes importance for both former CM and public works minister Ashok Chavan and Fadnavis. Chavan had made all-out efforts to ensure Sabne does not quit Sena and had knocked at the doors of the Sena leadership to talk to him. Chavan’s efforts did not help; on the contrary, Sabne blamed the former CM for the current political situation in Nanded district. Wresting the Deglur seat is important for Chavan as Nanded is also his hometown. Chavan will have to show his clout and tell the party leadership he still has control over Marathwada politics. For Fadnavis too, the by-election is crucial. In May, during the by-election to the Pandharpur assembly seat, Fadnavis had effected a surprise as BJP’s Samadhan Autade wrested the seat from NCP. Autade then defeated NCP nominee Bhagirath Bhalke. The by-election had been necessitated following the death of Bhagirath’s father, Bharat Bhelke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-puts-up-ex-sena-mla-against-cong-for-bypoll/articleshow/86795116.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||No intention to kill tiger from Day 1, says top forest official||Udhagamandalam: On the observation of the Madras high court that the forest department should not kill the tiger that is causing problem in the Nilgiris, Shekar Kumar Niraj, principal chief conservator of forest and chief wildlife warden, said there was no intention to kill the tiger from the first day of the search operation when it started in Devarshola range in Gudalur division on September 25. “Even when the hunting order was issued on October 1 after the tiger killed a tribal man, the order was specific about capturing or tranquillizing the tiger. We clarified this in the court today. We stand by our original plan of capturing the tiger,” he said, adding that the forest department had showcased its capabilities in capturing troublesome wild animals as in the case of Rivaldo, a wild elephant. On hearing a PIL on Tuesday, the court asked the state forest department to not kill the tiger as it may not be a man-eater. Meanwhile, the search teams had another fruitless day on Tuesday, the eleventh day of combing operations. The teams found a forest buffalo that was killed and half devoured in the Mannadiar forest area located between Singara and Masinagudi ranges in the buffer zone of Mudumalai Tiger reserve (MTR). “We did not come across any animal that was attacked by the tiger for the past four days since it killed a tribal man near Kurumbarpadi hamlet in the Singara range. We don’t know whether the tiger killed the buffalo. But its pugmarks were found on the location and we are sure that it had eaten part of the carcass,” Niraj said. “This may help us catch the tiger.” As per the instructions of Niraj, a ‘machan’ (tree house) was erected close to the location where the half-eaten buffalo carcass was found. “A team comprising forest officials and a veterinarian will be in lookout for the tiger from the tree house. If the tiger comes back to eat the remaining carcass, it could be tranquilized and captured,” said Niraj. The search teams have found pugmarks of another tiger in the location. They believe two more tigers are roaming in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/no-intention-to-kill-tiger-from-day-1-says-top-forest-official/articleshow/86795098.cms||---

The fire was finally doused late on Monday and more than 100 firemen, using multiple fire engines, were cooling down the structure on Tuesday morning, when the collapse took place. “We double-checked to ensure no pocket fire was left behind. As a portion of the front side crumbled, we are demolishing the weak sections. The KMC will study its stability status,” said a senior fire officer. The forensic team had to cancel their visit on Tuesday as the building was still highly heated up. “It’s something similar to that of Bagri market. We will go there on Wednesday,” said an officer.  When the owner’s son visited in the morning, the four families living in the building demanded they be provided alternative places to stay and that their new house be sponsored by him. Cops from Bowbazar police station escorted the owner’s son out of the house after a round of negotiations. The fire department is lodging a complaint against the owners as there is no fire-prevention facility, cops said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/portion-of-colootola-house-crashes-families-demand-alternative-accommodation/articleshow/86792623.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana assembly to pass resolution seeking caste census: CM K Chandrasekhar Rao||HYDERABAD: After sending state assembly resolutions to the Centre on enhancement of reservations for minorities and STs a few years ago, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said the state government would now pass a resolution in the assembly demanding the Centre to take up caste census in the country. He found fault with the BJP government for submitting an affidavit in the Supreme Court, expressing its inability to take up the BC census in the country. KCR said there was a need to increase reservations for SCs from the existing 15% as SCs’ population had increased in the past few decades. AIMIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi and Congress leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka also urged in the assembly during a debate on Dalit Bandhu scheme that the state government to pass a resolution in the assembly on caste census and send it to the Centre. CM said there was a mismatch between SCs’ population and reservation extended to them. As per the ‘samagra kutumba’ survey done by the government in 2014, the population of SCs in Telangana was 17% of the total state population — about18 lakh Dalit families. But in some districts such as Mancherial, the SCs’ population is 26%, while it is 22% in Jayashankar Bhupalapally district, 21% in Jangaon, Khammam, Rangareddy and Vikarabad and 20% in Karimnagar. The lowest population of SCs (11%) is in Hyderabad, he explained. “Going by these figures, the SCs’ population is growing every year and there is a need to increase their reservations accordingly,” KCR said. In April 2017, Telangana government passed resolutions increasing reservations for Muslims from 4% to 12% and that of STs from 6.5% to 9.8% in the state assembly. The Centre rejected reservations on the basis of religion, while the STs’ quota enhancement matter is still pending with the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/assembly-to-pass-resolution-seeking-caste-census-cm/articleshow/86792619.cms||Koride Mahesh

It is meant to give hope to the Temple Town, which is currently battling for survival, with barely any tourist footfall. “To ensure that culture of our state is showcased in the best possible manner to all kinds of tourists, we are setting up a new wing at the museum where 12 huts dedicated to various tribes and regions of MP will do the needful,” said in-charge of Khajuraho state museum and curator of Tribal Museum, Bhopal, Ashok Mishra. “Seven huts there will exhibit the lifestrle of Baiga, Saharia, Gond, Korku, Bharia, Bhil and Kol tribes of our state and there will be 5 huts showcasing the lifestyles of people living in Malwa, Bundelkhand, Baghelkhand, Chambal and Nimad regions of MP. “Seven huts there will exhibit the lifestrle of Baiga, Saharia, Gond, Korku, Bharia, Bhil and Kol tribes of our state and there will be 5 huts showcasing the lifestyles of people living in Malwa, Bundelkhand, Baghelkhand, Chambal and Nimad regions of MP. These will be the live ethnic spaces with each and every object belonging to specific tribes and regions,” said Mishra. The project, which began three months ago, is expected to be complete by February 2022, said the in-charge of the museum. He added, “A budget of Rs 1.5 crore has been allocated for these 12huts. It is the tribal and regional artistes, who are providing their services and making the artefacts as well as the huts. The idea is to give a practical platform to talented artistes in hinterland so that they can earn a decent living and showcase their awesome skills to the world,”said Mishra. He also said that this new wing at Khajuraho Museum would definitely give a fillip to tourism in the state. “Culture and tourism are strongly inter-connected. This is the lone project in MP where the culture of entire state can be seen at one single spot. So it is definitely going to attract many tourists, especially the foreigners who will visit once pandemic recedes,” said the curator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/culture-of-entire-state-to-be-showcased-on-single-platform-at-khajuraho-museum/articleshow/86792639.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi

SAGE is the principal advisory group for vaccines and immunization that advises WHO on overall global policies and strategies, ranging from vaccines and technology, R&D, to delivery of immunization and its linkages with other health interventions. “Covaxin manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, has been submitting data to WHO on a rolling basis & submitted additional info at WHO’s request on 27 September. WHO experts are currently reviewing this info & if it addresses all questions raised, WHO assessment will be finalized next week,” WHO said. WHO also pointed out that the EUL process carried out by WHO and the technical advisory group of independent experts is centred on determining if a manufactured product, like a vaccine, is quality-assured, safe and effective. On September 29, WHO had updated the decision date for Covaxin EUL to October 2021 in its latest EUL guidance document for Covid-19 vaccines from “yet to be confirmed”. Bharat Biotech had submitted its expression of interest for the two-dose inactivated virus vaccine to WHO on April 19 this year and the EUL application has been under review since July 6 when the rolling data submission to WHO started. Many of those who have taken the two-dose inactivated virus vaccine have been awaiting a WHO approval as it would make international travel smoother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/who-to-take-final-call-on-covaxin-eul-next-week/articleshow/86792608.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Fire brigade and police personnel reached the spot to get Sable out of the water. Sable, meanwhile, was using a mobile phone to communicate his demands while floating on the lake for more than two hours using a tyre tube. Sable, who eventually came out of the lake on his own after an “assurance” from the authorities, said the farmers have been left to die due to alleged official apathy. “Phulambri and other talukas in Aurangabad district have witnessed damage of upto 80% kharif crops due to the heavy rain. Despite submitting memorandums to the government authorities thrice and staging a hunger strike, no help has been offered. I decided to take the extreme step today (on Tuesday) in order to draw the government’s attention to the plight of farmers,” he said. Sable said Kadu established contact with him following the agitation. “Even if our leader is in power, he does not hold a portfolio of departments that directly deal with the issue of farmers. If the relief is not offered to the farmers in a week’s time, I will commit suicide by consuming poison at the Mantralaya,” he said. City Chowk police have detained Sable. No offence was registered till the filing of this report. Aurangabad collector Sunil Chavan could not be reached for a comments. The revenue department officials said the process to offer help to the farmers has already been initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-attempts-jal-samadhi-to-seek-aid-for-rain-hit-farmers/articleshow/86788197.cms||---

---||Mumbai||BMC readies blueprint for Nehru Garden renovation||MUMBAI: Over two months after the Public Works Department (PWD) handed over one acre of land parcel and the Jawaharlal Nehru Garden near Mantralaya to the BMC for maintenance, the civic body presented to residents its plans for repair and refurbishment of the open space. In a meeting held last week, the civic body shared its master plan layout, according to which it plans to retain all the existing trees and shrubs and only create pathways, lawn mounts, decorative lighting, a pergola with seating and a portable security cabin, among a few other things. As the garden falls under the Marine Drive Heritage precinct, a nod from the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC) would be required before carrying out renovation works. Local residents have been closely monitoring the Nehru Garden project as they have fought a long legal battle to save the green space from illegal encroachments. Corporator Harshita Narwekar said the residents have been very clear right from the beginning that the open space should be refurbished in a way that the green cover remains intact. “Civic officials have already completed a survey of the plot, including mapping of utilities, and we plan to begin work as soon as possible,” she said. The Nariman Point Churchgate Citizens Welfare Trust (NPCCWT) which played a crucial role in saving the Nehru Garden from encroachments said they have already conveyed to authorities that they would not want a single inch of concrete to creep in. “We have given our feedback on how we want it to be permeable and open to sky space. The garden cell proposed having an undulating landscape, but considering the population of senior citizens in the area who may want to use the space, we suggested keeping it at one level without any raised landscape,” said Atul Kumar, vice president NPCCWT. The NPCCWT’s legal battle dates back to 2013, when they had challenged encroachments near Nehru Garden by the BJP state headquarters, Janata Dal and agencies such as the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation, the Employment Exchange and the Zunkha Bhakar Kendra (ZBK). A senior BMC official from the garden department said all inputs from citizens will be seriously considered, and while the work is on, they also plan to put up the proposed design at the entrance in a bid to invite additional suggestions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-readies-blueprint-for-nehru-garden-renovation/articleshow/86795138.cms||Richa Pinto

Four friends went on a pleasure trip to Kongala waterfall, but their outing ended on a tagic note with one of them drowning in the water body. Wazedu sub-inspector Tirupati Rao said software engineer P Rahul, 33, a resident of Tarnaka, drowned at the waterfall. He used to work for a software company in Hyderabad. Rahul and three of his friends started their journey from the city to Wazedu on Monday night. Around 6 am on Tuesday, they reached Kongala waterfall. All the four got into the water. “After a point in the water body, it is deep. Since they did not know that, they went deep and all started to drown. Three members manged to come out by holding on to the dress of each other, whereas Rahul could not,” Tirupati said. According to police, the three friends, who managed to get out of the pond, came to the police station at 8am and narrated their tragic experience. The shattered friends broke down in front of police. Police pressed in expert swimmers and finally through a big net fished out Rahul’s body. Unlike a few other waterfalls in the district, there is no security mechanism at Kongala. Also, it is also located in the Maoist-affected region. After a post-mortem examination, police handed over the body to the victim’s family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-techie-drowns-at-kongala-waterfall-in-mulugu-district/articleshow/86792628.cms||---
---||India||HC delay in deciding bail pleas is ‘curbing of liberty’, says SC||NEW DELHI: As the Allahabad High Court will take 35 years, on an average, in deciding criminal appeal against conviction orders of trial courts and thousands of convicts have already been languishing in jail for years, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said delay on part of the HC in pronouncing its judgement on such appeals as also in deciding on the bail pleas amounted to “curtailment of liberty” of prisoners. Not satisfied with the Allahabad HC’s response on how to deal with the crisis which is peculiar to the high court, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said there was no application of mind on behalf of the HC to find a solution and "it is telling of their performance". The court also took exception of the HC response for simply accepting the suggestions of the Uttar Pradesh government and not coming up with its own views. "It is not a problem across the country. It is specifically to some of the bigger high courts. You have to find your solution as it is your problem. But you are not offering any solution. Saying that you agree with the state government is not a solution," the bench said and decided to take suo motu cognisance. The data placed before the SC revealed that the average waiting period of getting justice in criminal appeal against conviction by trial court is around 35 years as more that 1.83 lakh appeals are pending in the HC. The most efficient year in terms of disposal of cases was 2019 when the HC decided a record 5231 criminal appeals in a year. Going by that figure, it will take almost 35 years to dispose of 1.83 lakh cases and that too when no new appeal, filed in future, is entertained out of turn. The bench said suggestions given by the state will make the exercise of grant of bail more cumbersome and said if an appeal is pending at the high court stage and the convict has undergone eight years of sentence, bail would be the rule except in exceptional cases. The apex court said a mechanism must be put in place in the Allahabad HC so that bail pleas are heard expeditiously so that they do not move to SC directly and putting unnecessary burden on top court. “The HC has to place before us how such cases would be taken up for consideration of grant of bail,” the apex court said. “We note that there may be convicts in custody in life sentence cases and in such cases when 50 per cent of sentence is undergone, it can be the basis of grant of bail. We grant four weeks to the high court to place before us its policy in this regard. We would not like to retain consideration of all matters pending before us,” the bench said. Taking into account the inordinate delay in deciding criminal appeal, the Supreme Court had earlier asked the Uttar Pradesh government to take proactive steps to release those prisoners who are languishing in jail, particularly 7,214 inmates who had completed around 10 years in jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-delay-in-deciding-bail-pleas-is-curbing-of-liberty-says-sc/articleshow/86798495.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The investigators have written back to the medical board asking for more information. Sources told TOI that the report, which was received earlier this week, mentioned that the woman died due to excessive bleeding and injuries. “Police are probing various angles in the case, including whether the injuries were self-inflicted,” sources claimed.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh's second dose vaccine coverage sluggish, awaits momentum||BHOPAL: After administering 4.87 crore first doses of Covid-19 vaccine jabs against an estimated 5.5 crore people eligible for vaccination, Madhya Pradesh may be on the top among 10 most populated states on first jab front, but when it comes to fully vaccinating these 4.87 crore people, it ranks among the bottom three. Till now, only 1.55 crore second doses of vaccine have been administered in the state. Thus of the 4.87 crore who have received the first dose, only 1.55 crore have also received the second dose. This is roughly around 31% of the total who have received the first dose. And among the 10 populated states, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are the only states which are below this. Of these 10 most populated states—Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Gujarat—Andhra Pradesh ranks best on this front. More than 50% people who have received the first dose have also received the second dose in Andhra Pradesh. It is followed by Gujarat where 46% of such people have been administered with the second dose too followed by Karnataka where 44% population that has received the first dose has also received the second dose of vaccine. Worst three among these states are -Uttar Pradesh where only 25% of the people who have received the first dose have also received the second dose of vaccine, Bihar where 27% have received the second dose also and Madhya Pradesh where 31% people have also received the second dose of vaccine. Sources said, given the slow pace of vaccination in the last few days, it seems difficult to achieve the target of attaining complete vaccination in Madhya Pradesh by the year end. Even if 4.87 crore who have received the first dose are taken into consideration, instead of the estimated eligible population of 5.5 crore, more than 3.37 crore are yet to be vaccinated in the next three months to ensure complete vaccination . On an average, close to 3.5 lakh people need to receive second dose every day for this to happen, whereas on October 1, only 1.33 vaccine doses were administered, on October 2, only 93,000 vaccine doses were administered and on October 3, only 33000 vaccine doses were administered across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mps-2nd-dose-vax-coverage-sluggish-awaits-momentum/articleshow/86792673.cms||Amarjeet Singh

CM said the government had already issued notifications to fill 1,51,000 vacancies in various government departments. Of them, 1,31,000 have already joined the respective departments. The CM held a couple of meetings with departments heads and secretaries in the last two months and asked them to identify the number of vacancies in state, zonal and district level posts. The departments submitted the list of vacancies to the CM. KCR said the state government had submitted the new zones system file to the Centre for approval, while the Centre took seven months for giving the approval. “After Dasara, the government will hold a meeting with employees’ associations on zonal transfers and other issues,” he said. Admitting that the pandemic hit the state’s finances badly, he said the government still implemented Pay Revision Commission (PRC) for state government employees and increased salaries of outsourced employees. “For the first time in the country, advocates and private teachers got financial assistance during pandemic,” he said. He said theirs was the only government in the country which took care of every community in the state. “Even Brahmin parishad is going to get a new building,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/80000-job-vacancies-to-be-filled-up-soon-says-kcr/articleshow/86792676.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Disha encounter hearings: Weapons not checked for fingerprints, says clues head||HYDERABAD: Clues Team head N Venkanna on Tuesday stated before the SC-appointed inquiry commission that no fingerprints were collected from the weapons of the police team involved in the alleged encounter killings case as they thought it was not necessary and no fingerprints were found on the articles of veterinarian Disha, recovered from the encounter site. The VS Sirpurkar committee has been conducting an inquiry into the alleged encounter killing of the four accused in the Disha gang-rape and murder case. The four were killed in an alleged encounter during scene reconstruction on December 6, 2019. Venkanna, who is a witness in the case and quizzed for the second consecutive day, was asked whether he had advised investigating officer (IO) J Surender Reddy to collect fingerprints from the recovered spent cartridges. To this query, he responded saying, “I do not remember.” When he was asked if his team had recovered and examined two SLRs and an AK-47 alleged to have been used by the police team during the exchange of fire, Venkanna stated that his team did not recover or examine the weapons used by the police team and he did not ask the police officials due to crowd present at the scene. When pressed further on exactly how the crowd prevented him, Venkanna stated that he did remember what exactly happened at that time. Venkanna further stated that while fingerprints expert Naveen Kumar checked the weapons found in the hands of the two deceased for fingerprints, the team felt it was not necessary to check for fingerprints on the weapons in possession of the police team. Venkanna also said that IO J Surender Reddy had removed the two pistols from the hands of Arif and Chennakeshavulu and he could not recollect if the IO had taken any assistance from the fingerprints expert. As Venkanna stated that he had only provided measuring tape to the tahsildars while they were conducting the inquest on the four bodies, the commission’s advocate showed a video clip of Venkanna’s team providing assistance during the inquest procedure where distance between the bodies and the spent cartridges were also being checked by the team. As Venkanna also stated that recovery proceedings in respect of Md Arif were conducted after the inquest, a video clip of Arif’s body being turned facedown to examine the wounds during the inquest process was played and he was asked how the pistol was found intact in the hand even after the body was flipped. Venkanna stated that the pistol was removed from Arif’s hand and kept aside before the body was turned. The witness said that no fingerprints were found on Disha’s articles, including a cell phone, recovered from the encounter site as the articles were found mixed with soil and dry grass. Answering a question posed by the tribunal chairman, Sirpurkar, the witness stated that the possibility of gunshot residue (GSR) depositing on the hands of the deceased would be there if someone places a pistol in the hand of the deceased and opens fire before rigor mortis sets in. Commission member R K Baldota posed a question to Venkanna about not preparing a sketch of the scene of occurrence with all details, referring to the state police manual and asked, “was it not your responsibility to collect that information and draw the sketch on that basis?”. He responded saying, it was his responsibility. Venkanna said that his team handed over photos and videos from the crime scene to the IO on December 7, 2019”, but no covering letter was issued for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/weapons-not-checked-for-fingerprints-clues-head/articleshow/86792668.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Hyderabad||SC panel quizzes doctor who treated injured cops||Hyderabad: The SC-appointed commission quizzed Dr G Naveen Kumar, who initially treated the two cops who sustained injuries in the alleged attack by the four Disha rape and murder case accused during the exchange of fire at Chattanpally on December 6, 2019 about the nature of injuries sustained by the two cops and the treatment offered to them. In his affidavit submitted before the commission, Dr Naveen Kumar, who was working at Community Health Centre (CHC) in Shadnagar when the alleged encounter took place, stated that the injured cops, SI Venkateshwarulu and head constable, Aravind Goud were unconscious when they were brought to the CHC. However, during his deposition, the witness mentioned that though he referred them to Osmania General Hospital (OGH) for treatment, the injured cops wanted to be referred to Care hospital. When the commission reminded him about the unconscious state of the two cops, Dr Naveen Kumar responded saying that after his first aid treatment, the two injured cops regained consciousness and they along with the two cops who accompanied them requested for a referral to the private hospital. Naveen Kumar said that he dressed the injuries of Venkateshwarulu, and gave him an analgesic and a tetanus shot. According to the doctor, Venkateshwarulu sustained an abrasion and a 2 cm long laceration on the forehead. The commission’s advocate then pointed out the difference between the details pertaining to the SI’s injury mentioned in the hospital Medico Legal Case (MLC) diary (2 cm) and the wound certificate (3 cm x 1 cm). The witness stated that he filled up the details in the wound certificate based on the records of the private hospital where the victim was referred to. However, after verifying the private hospital record, Naveen Kumar stated that there also it was mentioned as 2 cm. The doctor agreed that some of the entries pertaining to Aravind Goud were struck off in the MLC register but did not agree that the entry pertaining to Venkateshwarulu appears to be in a different ink. While answering questions about how the two cops were brought to CHC, the doctor initially said that they were brought in a wheelchair and later said they were brought by two cops on a stretcher. Subsequently, he said that by the time he attended to them, the injured were in casualty ward and he stopped the bleeding from Venkateshwarulu’s 1 cm deep injury by applying pressure but the same was not mentioned in his statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sc-panel-quizzes-doctor-who-treated-injured-cops/articleshow/86792652.cms||---

During a brief debate on the flagship scheme in the assembly on Tuesday, Vikramarka said a substantive debate on the scheme will be possible only if allocation of funds is clarified. In support of the policy, he said: “Our party wants the scheme to be implemented in all 119 constituencies and without any disparity. All those who are eligible should receive the benefit.” The scheme requires over Rs 1 lakh crore, but the existing allocation is insufficient, he said and sought clarity from the government. He said representatives from recognised political parties apart from the ruling TRS should be included in the committees to oversee its implementation. “I have been speaking with people on the idea. There are numerous questions on the scheme such as whether a group of people could form into an association to gather more than Rs 10 lakh,” he said. “Will there be any skill training imparted to those who receive the benefit,” he asked. He also wanted to know if a ration card was the only criterion for eligibility and if newly-weds who do not have a ration card could be beneficiaries by presenting the marriage certificates. The Madhira MLA also urged the government to restart the land distribution programme for Dalits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/clarify-on-fund-allocation-for-dalit-bandhu-says-bhatti/articleshow/86792646.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Delhi||On Road To Redemption: With Rains On The Way Out, PWD Looks To Fix Damage||New Delhi: The Public Works Department (PWD) has started repairing roads under its jurisdiction that were damaged by the seasonal rains. Initially, the potholes will be filled in and after the monsoon is over, extensive repair work will be undertaken. In the last few weeks, the PWD control rooms have received numerous complaints from across the city about potholes and damaged roads. There are around 1,260km of roads under PWD. Following widespread grievances, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal called a high-level meeting on Friday and asked officials to make Delhi’s roads free of potholes by October 20. He asked officials to deploy maintenance vans in large numbers to cover every area during the special drive. Najafgarh Road, one of the longest in the capital, is in a shambles. Innumerable potholes mark the carriageway from the district centre towards Tilak Nagar. The damaged road slows down the speed of the vehicles and during peak traffic hours, there are lengthy traffic jams down the stretch. The road at the end of the flyover on Chaudhary Charan Singh Marg (from Anand Vihar towards NH-24) is also in a similar state of disrepair. “I have driven on this damaged road several times,” said Dr Amarendra Jha, a senior physician. “People using roads with such deep potholes can suffer from slipped discs.” It has become painful to traverse a section of the road near Krishna Nagar Metro Station because the carpeting has worn off and there are many potholes. It is a busy thoroughfare and the poor condition of the road considerably slows down traffic. “During rains, when the potholes fill up with water, the commuters fear driving there because they can’t make out if it’s good enough not to shake the bones,” said a local resident. There’s a major pothole on Vikas Marg near Vikas Minar, worsening the already bad situation caused by constant waterlogging. The pothole is so deep that bikers run the risk of falling if they drive over it. Abhishek Goel, a businessman from Chandni Chowk, reported that a big segment of the road near Lajpat Nagar metro station is in a shambles. “It is a busy road and the pothole has made driving a very bad experience besides posing a health risk,” said Goel, adding that PWD should repair this stretch as early as possible. A PWD official said that road repairs began four days ago. “The potholes are being filled up by the zones concerned. The road repairs will be done according to the complaints received in the control room. After the monsoon ends, a bigger repair exercise will be undertaken,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-road-to-redemption-with-rains-on-the-way-out-pwd-looks-to-fix-damage/articleshow/86792927.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Hyderabad||Do not assume automatic relief in contempt cases, high court warns Telangana government||HYDERABAD: In a stern warning to the state government and its staff caught in contempt cases, the Telangana high court on Tuesday made it clear that convicted officials should not be under any false impression that they would automatically get relief from the court. “We are interested in securing justice for our people. We are not interested in sending your officials to jail. But if you force us, we do not mind sending them to jail,” a bench of Justice A Rajasheker Reddy and Justice T Vinod Kumar told advocate general BS Prasad while pointing out that contempt cases have been growing at an unusual pace. The note of caution from the bench came as it suspended the two-months’ jail term awarded to Karimnagar police commissioner V Satyanarayana and SHO B Narasimlu in a contempt case filed by two women over acquisition of their land to build a police station in Komaram Bhim Asifabad district. Satyanarayana was then the SP of the district. The two cops were convicted along with three revenue officials and fined ₹2,000 each by a single judge after concluding that they had forcibly taken away 10 acres belonging to petitioners Routhu Saidabai and Renubai of S C Colony in Chintala Manepalle without any land acquisition process or compensation. The single judge had held them guilty of deliberately misplacing and tampering with panchnama and other records to escape the wrath of the law. “It is okay to construct hospitals and police stations, but you should not do it by flouting court orders,” the bench said as it stayed the contempt case after the state showed it had now constructed the police station without disturbing the two petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/do-not-assume-automatic-court-relief-in-contempt-cases-hc-warns-state-govt/articleshow/86792678.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Bhopal||150 Mantralaya staff set up their own time bank||Bhopal: State secretariat employees have set up their time bank; it became operational from October 1. Over 150 employees have become members in the time bank. A time bank is where you offer voluntary service to earn credit hours and get repaid the same way. This free of cost service has time users and time volunteers, apart from time managers who work like bank managers to act as a bridge between time users and volunteers. Sudhir Nayak, former president of the Mantralayin Karmachari Sangh, who created the time bank, said, “We have taken people who were inclined to help others. It is a voluntary service. We have named the time bank as Mantralaya Karamchari Helpline Time Bank. The ones who become members have to download mobile app I-TIMBA- the state’s first time bank app created by former bureaucrats in March. Depending upon their location and nature of help needed, people can make different requests through the app, he added. Former secretary in the MP government, Manohar Dubey who created the state’s first time bank along with app I-TIMBA, said “We are also motivating others to create time banks; these different time banks would be displayed on our app. People from different fields of work, cities and backgrounds can create their time bank. The objective is to link thousands of people offering and seeking a variety of services. Over 260 volunteers and 450 users have already been registered in the app I-TIMBA. The time bank created by secretariat employees will be visible on the app within a week, he added. Senior IPS officers are now looking after the security issues, as the time bank will grow from Bhopal to different districts of MP and outside. Dubey said the objective of the time bank is to bring the service seeker and service provider on the same platform. Verification of the people getting associated is mandatory. MP became the first in the country to have a ‘time bank’, where people offer voluntary service to earn credit hours and get repaid the same way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/150-mantralaya-staff-set-up-their-own-time-bank/articleshow/86792692.cms||Ankur Sirothia

The accused are Shayam Shankar, Abhishek, Karthik and Sagar. Police commissioner N Shashi Kumar on Tuesday said main accused Shyam Shankar also works in Ashirvad petrol pump at Mannagudda where the victim Bhojappa works as a manager. “He knew the manager deposits the daily collection of the petrol pump in Saraswat bank. He along with three of his friends hatched a plan to rob him. They first discussed the plan at Shakthinagar on September 13 and did a recce of the route before executing their plan. They first planned to rob him on September 26 but did not execute it due to unfavourable conditions. Two days later they succeeded,” he said. Bhojappa suffered serious injuries in his head and ear when he fell down after being waylaid by the bike-borne robbers. After the incident, the accused fled to Mumbai where they splurged the looted money on electronic gadgets and others. Police could recover only Rs 60,000 out of the stolen Rs 4.2 lakh and two two-wheelers used in the crime.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Monson Mavunkal case: Opposition targets Kerala police, CM Pinarayi Vijaya defends Loknath Behera||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition targeted the state police, including former police chief Loknath Behera, in connection with the arrest of conman Monson Mavunkal in the assembly on Tuesday, despite assurance from the chief minister that any police officer, who has colluded with Monson, will be punished. There will be no leniency for any officer who is found to have illegal or immoral involvement in Monson Mavunkal’s activities. The allegations that government tried to forge ancient documents in copper plates to dupe the public are baseless, said Pinarayi Vijayan. The chief minister said that a crime branch SIT was set up to probe all cases and government has also requested Archaeological Survey of India, department of archaeology and DRDO to probe the artefacts maintained by Mavunkal. Once these agencies submit their reports, those will also be probed. In addition to the four crime branch cases, four more cases at Mulanthuruthy, Piravom, Pandalam and Ernakulam Town south have been registered against Mavunkal and a probe is underway, he said. Taking a dig at KPCC chief K Sudhakaran, Vijayan said that he had availed treatment from Monson Mavunkal and remained a witness to handing over of Rs 25 lakhs to Mavunkal by one of the complainants. Replying to Vijayan’s comments, opposition leader VD Satheesan said that anyone approaching a person, who projects himself as a cosmetologist, is not a crime, be it political leaders or actors. Justifying Sudhakaran, he asked why would anyone go to a person knowing that he is a fake doctor to get treatment. He further added that Sudhakaran had stated that he is ready to face any kind of probe in this matter, but the government need not be under the impression that the opposition can be silenced using it. He said that the heart of the matter is that the police continued to provide protection to Mavunkal despite receiving intelligence reports that he is a fraud. He said that police officers with lower rank, conducting a probe in a matter in which higher ranking officers are involved, cannot be justified. Stating that the CM has not even initiated departmental action against the officers who were found to be wrongdoers, Satheesan said the police was ready for a probe two years after ADGP (intelligence) submitted a report that Mavunkal was an international fraud. The police gave protection to a person who violated all the provisions of The Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972, Satheesan said. Earlier, seeking a leave for adjournment motion, PT Thomas said that instead of ousting Loknath Behera from the post of KMRL MD, the chief minister awarded him a hefty salary. The opposition staged a walk out after speaker MB Rajesh refused to grant permission to the adjournment motion on the basis of the explanation given by the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/monson-case-opposition-targets-state-police-cm-defends-behera/articleshow/86795286.cms||---

While complimenting the government for constructing Vaikunta Dhamams, TRS MLAs, including Patnam Narender Reddy, said due to continuous rain, it has become difficult to even approach the cremation facilities as there was no bitumen or cement roads.  The TRS members urged the government to sanction funds for laying of roads, electricity connections and sinking a bore and providing a motor pump at these cremation facilities.  Earlier, panchayat raj minister Errabelli Dayakar informed the House that construction of Vaikunta Dhamams, dumping yards was almost complete at a cost of over Rs 1,860 crore. Panchayat raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao said: “A three-member central committee visited the state and inspected whether there were any irregularities in utilisation of central funds as Telangana had emerged as the number one state in utilising employment guarantee funds.

Advocate Zeller D’Souza, who appeared for the panchayat, stated that the survey is already under way and will be completed within two weeks. “We further clarify that the details should include structures that may have been permitted by the panchayat but not by the MPDA, as well,” stated the division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar. “The time granted to the flag officer to file an affidavit is also extended up to the next date,” the court further stated. “We direct the sarpanch or the secretary of the village panchayat to file a detailed affidavit on this aspect giving full particulars, on or before the next date without fail,” the high court stated. The matter is now posted for further consideration on October 25. In February 2020, the high court directed the Navy and director general of civil aviation (DGCA) to initiate action against unauthorised constructions around Goa International Airport within nine months. Despite the directions, no action has been taken and at the previous hearing, the high court said that it will “consider whether any action under the Contempt of Courts Act is necessary”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/give-details-of-illegal-bldgs-near-airport-by-oct-25-hc-tells-chicalim-panchayat/articleshow/86795241.cms||---

Energy minister G Jagadish Reddy said the state overcame power cuts to the domestic and industry sector within three months. And within a year, nine-hour free power supply was extended to the agriculture sector, and within three years 24x7 power supply was extended to the agriculture sector. Replying to queries from TRS members Marri Janardhan Reddy, Kranthi Kiran and K Chander on the steps taken up by the government to meet the growing power demand in the state, the minister said an additional capacity of 9680 MW was added after the formation of Telangana state. Also, various power projects of an accumulated 7962 mw capacity were in different stages of completion. The state government spent Rs 16,210 crore in the last seven years to construct 17 substations of 400 KV capacity each, another 45 sub-stations of 220 kv each, 66 sub-stations of 132 KV each and extended 10,491-km of new circuit lines to improve transmission network. Also, another Rs 16,048 crore were spent after formation of Telangana on improving power distribution network including construction of 990 sub-stations of 33 KV capacity each, 1.59 lakh kilometres of new circuit lines were extended, 3.12 lakh DTR transformers were added among other power infrastructure projects. “Today, we are in a position to meet even 17000 MW power demand,” the minister said. As on date there are 1.65 crore consumers of all categories as against 1.11 crore at the time of state formation. The agricultural connections were 19 lakh in June 2014, and their number has gone up to 25.63 lakh in the last seven years. All the villages and tandas have been given electricity connection as Telangana has achieved cent per cent electrification, the minister added.

Speaking at the TiE Sustainability Summit (TSS), Krishna Kumar, founder, agri-tech player CropIn, said the food production has to be doubled by 2050 but there are headwinds like climate change, crop losses due to pests and disease and low yields, among others. “We need to digitise this industry and build AI intelligence to bring in predictability and ensure timely action and increase per acre value,” Kumar said while participating in a virtual panel discussion on ‘AI Driving Higher Crop Yields: AgriTech’ on Tuesday. Citing instances of usage of AI in predicting pest attacks, Rema Subramanian, managing partner, Ankur Capital, pointed out that AI will play an important role in boosting the yield because land will be in short supply in the coming days. She also said that development in the field of biotech along with computation technologies will prove beneficial for agriculture in the coming days. She also added agri-tech startups are drawing interest from investor community.

---||Mumbai||Complex, varied entry norms may stall air travel recovery||MUMBAI: Countries have begun reopening borders, but complex and varied entry norms to manage Covid risks could stall air travel recovery, said International Air Transport Association (IATA), an airlines’ trade body, which studied latest restrictions put up by 50 countries. While complete harmonization of these varied entry norms is unlikely, IATA said countries could come together to commonly adopt at least some “simple best practices” easy for passengers to comprehend. The 50 countries surveyed account for 92% of global air traffic, said IATA. Of the 46 countries that have pre-departure testing norms, 24 accept only PCR testing, 16 recognize antigen tests, of which three require PCR in certain circumstances. Then, 18 countries exempt vaccinated travellers from testing, and 20 countries provide exemptions from testing requirements for recovered Covid-19 travellers, but under differing conditions on how to prove prior infection, the survey found. “Thirty-three countries exempt minors from testing, but with no consistency on age, and in some cases, differing rules if the minor is accompanied by a vaccinated adult. Testing time window varies broadly, including specifications by test type,’’ it added. IATA found that nine out of its surveyed countries do not recognise the full WHO list of vaccines. There are at least five definitions for the point after inoculation at which vaccines are considered effective, it said. Only Germany, France, Switzerland and Austria recognize immunity resulting from previous Covid-19 infection as equivalent to vaccination. But there is no consistency on what is needed to prove prior infection. IATA director-general Willie Walsh said, “There is far too much complexity in the way borders are reopening. The potential for a global reconnect could be hijacked by bureaucracies favouring standalone “made-at-home” solutions over approaches that work across borders”. Thirty-eight countries had some form of Covid-19 restriction on who can enter. Within these, 20 exempt or foresee exemptions from restrictions in various forms for vaccinated travellers, but six exempt minors (unable to be vaccinated in most markets) when they travel with vaccinated adults. There was no consistency on age definition of minors. Walsh said, “The situation is a mess. It’s stalling recovery. Complete harmonization is unlikely. But some simple best practices that travellers can comprehend should be achievable.” Safely reopening borders is on the agenda of UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) high-level conference on Covid-19, to be held online next week. “The most important result that the conference could achieve is bringing commitment from states to reduce the evolving complexity,’’ he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-complex-varied-entry-norms-may-stall-air-travel-recovery/articleshow/86795247.cms||Manju V

Mavunkal was remanded in custody in a cheating complaint filed by Rajeev Sreedharan, a native of Pala. Mavunkal had allegedly swindled the complainant of Rs 1.72 crore after promising to get a 500-acre estate, owned by Madhya Pradesh government in Wayanad, on lease for him. Sreedharan reportedly deposited the amount into four bank accounts of Mavunkal’s employees. CB had held Mavunkal in custody in connection with a cheating case in which he is accused of swingling another person of Rs.10.5 crore. “There are five cases against Mavunkal. Though he used fake antiques to lure many people, it seems he had not sold any of them to anyone,” said an officer. Meanwhile, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), on Tuesday, inspected the authenticity of the copper inscription related to Sabarimala that was in Mavunkal’s possession. CB had requested ASI to inspect the copper plate after a controversy erupted around its authenticity. “The ASI officials from will submit a report within two days,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/accused-sent-to-crime-branch-custody-again/articleshow/86795284.cms||---

He said revamping major stormwater drains will prevent artificial flooding in the city during monsoon. “Even moderate showers result in flooding at Kudroli, KS Rao Road, Chandrika Layout, Pandeshwar and other areas. Overflowing of stormwater drains leads to flooding at many places in the city. Restoration of all rajakaluves in the city may require Rs 200 crore. I am confident of getting additional Rs 35 crore in the next phase. The tender process has been completed and the first phase will begin within a month or two. Constructing retaining walls will prevent the drains from overflowing during monsoon,” he said at an interaction organised by Dakshina Kannada District Working Journalists Association here on Tuesday. “A sports complex with a mini swimming pool will be constructed at Urwa. The proposal has been prepared for the waterfront project in the riverfront areas in Mangaluru. Discussions are being held with private players to join hands with Mangaluru Smart City Limited to take up projects,” he said. For the convenience of migrant labourers, the government plans to construct labour sheds in the city, Kamath said. “Majority of construction workers in Mangaluru are from other districts and states. The city has no sufficient infrastructure for migrant labourers to stay while they work in various sites. Hence, labour minister Shivaram Hebbar has promised to sanction funds for the project. Sites have been identified and a proposal has been submitted,” he said. TDR Cell in MCC soonA dedicated Transferable Development Rights (TDR) Cell to expedite the process of land acquisition for various development projects will be opened at the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) soon. The cell, which will issue TDRs to those who have given their land for development projects, will start functioning shortly. “We have been facing difficulties in land acquisition due to delay in issuing TDR certificates to landowners, who surrender their lands. As a result, the implementation of projects gets delayed. Officials including a surveyor have already been appointed for the cell,” Kamath said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/rs-35cr-to-prevent-artificial-flooding-in-city-mla/articleshow/86790481.cms||---

Haryana assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta has asked chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Mukta Kumar to prepare a plan to set up the hospital and provide a detailed report of number of doctors, staff and other technical requirements needed to run the hospital. Barwala residents have been demanding a hospital as they have to travel a lot to reach General Hospital, Sector 6, and its primary health centre does not offer all facilities. The residents are offering their panchayati land for the hospital. They were also willing to give up the share of their land if the government hospital facility was set up in their area. One Ayushman hospital was also running at the primary health centre. Kumar said, “The proposal is being prepared and will be presented before the speaker within this week.” Gupta said “Soon after receiving the final proposal, I will forward it to the health department for approval so that the necessary works, machinery and hiring of staff could be done accordingly.” Kumar has requested Gupta to shift food and drug department from the Sector 26 poly clinic to Agro Mall in Sector 20 for expansion of facilities at the clinic to cater to more residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/barwala-to-get-50-bed-hosp/articleshow/86792844.cms||Arvind Bishnoi
---||Hyderabad||ICRISAT develops 3 new drought-resistant chickpeas||Hyderabad: Premier city-based agri-research organisation, ICRISAT, on Tuesday said it has developed three new chickpea varieties with traits like enhanced drought tolerance, disease resistance and high yield. The chickpea varieties, IPC L4-14, BGM 4005 and IPCMB 19-3, have been developed in collaborations with ICAR-Indian Institute of Pulses Research (IIPR), Kanpur, and ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi. As per ICRISAT, after evaluation at several locations under no-irrigation conditions for many years, the new varieties reported a 14.76% and 11.9% overall mean yield advantage over their parental lines. These varieties have been notified for cultivation by the Central Varietal Release Committee and have been released for cultivation in Punjab, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh. Commenting on the development, Trilochan Mohapatra, secretary, department of agricultural research, and director general, ICAR, said, “Genomics driven interventions to enhance crop yield and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses are the need of the hour under changing climate. Thirty-five varieties of different crops with special traits including climate resilience were dedicated to India by the Prime Minister and two of these were chickpea varieties developed in partnership with ICRISAT.” “These new varieties are well poised to strengthen food and nutrition security as well as livelihoods in India by providing adaptation mechanisms to the climate related challenges confronting the agriculture sector,” said Jacqueline Hughes, director general, ICRISAT. Stating that research in chickpea is necessary, Arvind Kumar, deputy director general – research at ICRISAT, pointed out that drought conditions cause up to 60% annual yield losses in chickpea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/icrisat-develops-3-new-drought-resistant-chickpeas/articleshow/86792826.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal doctors’ research to help diabetics check glucose level, lead drug-free life||BHOPAL: Without undergoing diabetes prick test, a study by Bhopal-based doctors is aiming at bringing positive change in lives of people living with diabetics and perhaps like in the case of a minority group by helping them lead a medicine-free life. Using a glucose monitoring system that provides records sugar levels at a 15-minute interval all the time throughout the day, the research diagnosed 24x7 individual patients’ glucose level pattern. If a person’s sugar levels are going up or down, it is triggered by an event. Understanding the cause and effect relation, the team developed a customized diet plan for each patient. A diabetic patient eats several different food items in a day and does several different activities without knowing about the real picture of the glucose levels in his body during the course of the day. Until now with fasting and postprandial blood sugar levels it was merely a guess work. A generalised diet chart would be handed over to the patient and diabetic medication started. This never helped the patient manage his diabetes without medication, instead he would have to take the medication all through his life, said team lead by Government Homeopathic College Bhopal Prof Dr Nisanth Nambisan. A machine learning algorithm (backed by data from coin sized sensor over the skin), was developed to diagnose the root cause of rise in blood sugar of patients. “It does so by recognising the abnormal patterns going on in the body that too in real time, by continuously collecting 288 blood sugar levels in a Day and 4032 levels in 14 days. After analysis of the data points of importance, the system narrows down to the cause and suggests corrective action,” he added. The corrective actions made 14 out of 20 patients in the study drug free, 3 patients could curtail dose of medicine, and 3 others started symptomatically feeling better. Research conducted by Dr Nishant Nambisan, Dr Smita Nambisan and others, aims to help diabetes patients to live a drug-free life, we are trying to fund the world-class study, said Govt Homeopathic College Bhopal, principal, Dr SK Mishra. Dr Chanchal Jain, Dr Narendra Sharma, Dr Ajay Jaiswal, Dr Abhishek Dwivedi and Akhilesh Soni were also part of the team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-docs-research-to-help-diabetics-check-glucose-level-lead-drug-free-life/articleshow/86792854.cms||Jamal Ayub
---||Nagpur||BREAK SHACKLES BEFORE THEY BREAK US||After weathering two agonizing waves, battered city businesses are longing for resurrection, but despite declining infection rates and emptying Covid wards, several curbs continue. Panellists at this month’s TOI Debate call upon the authorities to relax restrictions and revitalize the economyThe conception of a ‘new normal’ has made humanity second-guess its propensity to live free. Nearly 18 months of curbs have chipped away at people’s mental health. As the pandemic wears on, said psychiatrist Dr Suleman Virani, myriad symptoms keep cropping up. “Initially it was panic, anxiety and phobia of an unknown virus. Now we are seeing the after-effects of the financial impact of Covid. We are diagnosing patients with severe depression and suicidal tendencies,” he stated. Virani added, “The joy of outdoor socializing has diminished. While the pandemic has affected different people in different ways, majority of the population is at home, fearful of what the virus bodes next.” The uncertainty is particularly crippling for students on the cusp of heralding their careers. Coaching institute owner Sameer Phale said the pandemic exposed government’s failure to digitalize the heartland. “This phase has taught us that for education, online cannot replace offline. The government has not ensured internet connectivity in remote areas; we are unable to engage our students the way we used to, in person,” he added. School trustee Sachin Kalbande chimed in, “Every school has students with low, medium and high IQ (intelligence quotient). In a physical classroom, teachers are able to heed all three kinds equally, but the online mode is not amenable for that.” When so many families are struggling to put food on the table amid lockdown, added Kalbande, how could they afford smartphones and internet connections? “The government is not alive to ground reality,” he said. Hotelier Angadh Singh Arora claimed of a similar dissonance with the hospitality industry. “As of 2019, the closing time approved by the excise ministry for food and beverage (F&B) outlets is 1.30am, but we have now been asked to operate till 10pm. Most people like to have their dinner around 8-9pm, which essentially gives us a 2-hour window,” he said. Instead of preventing the virus spread, felt Arora, the 10pm guideline is “creating more chaos and crowding”. He asserted that widening the window would curtail crowding and help restaurateurs better adhere to distancing protocol. Travel agency owner Rajesh Agrawal said the government had done nothing to resuscitate the tourism industry. “Overseas tourists and business travellers from other cities are not visiting us out of fear. Why did the Centre effect a reciprocal quarantine move for British nationals? What do we stand to gain from it? In its quest for revenge, the government has further hampered our business,” Agrawal lamented. Arora added, “In 2019, Nagpur was doing well in medical tourism too. The healthy influx of tourists from all over the country not only boosted the medical industry, but also associated industries like hospitality, transport, entertainment. With the number of tourists falling drastically, all across the board have been affected.” Phale pointed out that the inflow of students from other states and districts had dropped too. “Our fees has not increased in the last two years but the price of petrol and hence, many other products and services has increased. How do we manage?” he said. On top of that, Phale added, the coaching industry pays 18% GST. “Our students simply cannot afford it,” he said. Joining the chorus, movie exhibitor Sanjay Surana claimed that due to the state government’s inaction, scores of single screen theatres may never reopen. “Having to stay shut for over one-and-a-half years has severely drained our resources, and the Maharashtra government has not helped theatre owners at all. Many theatres will not open at all because of lack of funds. With no big-ticket releases and the unpredictability of lockdowns, cinema owners are fearful — we don’t know when we will be asked to shut shop again,” Surana said. Agrawal reiterated that the imposition of restrictions was causing fear psychosis. “Humans fear from two things — God and health. All these curbs serve to alarm citizens, even though cases are not rising,” he said, adding that the government did not have a task force representing all industries to assess the impact of its guidelines, and that it sorely needed one. The ‘projected’ third wave has worsened matters, as per Kalbande. “The wave didn’t come, but schools have opened. Who will pay for the losses caused in anticipation of the third wave?” Panellists found authorities lacking on the Covid-preparedness front too. Kalbande said that he had written a letter to the education department stating that since schools have been reopened, it should organize a webinar featuring doctors, psychologists, police officers, education department officials and school headmasters. “This would guide the schools on what to do if and when a student tests positive. But there has been no action on the letter.” The panel unanimously called for the government to cease lockdown-like restrictions, and to modify protocol based on the Covid situation. When politicians had no qualms in conducting rallies in the middle of the pandemic, is it fair to expect business owners to keep suffering, asked Phale. “All these restrictions don’t seem to apply to politicians. It is ironic that the government made guidelines for us, but is itself not following them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/break-shackles-before-they-break-us/articleshow/86795264.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Referring DPRs to AP unwarranted: T||Hyderabad: Telangana and neighbour Andhra Pradesh are once again involved in bitter water wars as Telangana has reacted strongly to referring detailed project reports (DPRs) of its irrigation projects to AP. In a letter to Godavari River Management Board chairman J Chandrasekhar Iyer, irrigation special chief secretary Rajat Kumar said DPRs of projects such as Choutpally Hanumanth Reddy Lift Irrigation Scheme and Chanaka-Korata Barrage have been referred to AP for its observations and comments which, he said, was unwarranted. “The projects were well within the water allocations made to Telangana and there were no inter-state issues involved here. The Choutpally Hanumanth Reddy LIS was taken up, executed and commissioned under the united AP government and has been in operation for six years. Chanaka-Korata project was approved as per the GRMB gazette notification and was taken up as per an agreement with Maharashtra and AP and subsequently between Telangana and Maharashtra,” Rajat Kumar pointed out. AP had requested Tungabhadra Board to divert KC Canal quota of 2 tmcft in addition to the already diverted 2 tmcft from Tungabhadra dam to the high-level canal. “The request is untenable and against the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-1 award. It is detrimental to the requirements of Rajolibanda Diversion Scheme in Jogulamba Gadwal district, which always gets deficit inflows,” Muralidhar said.

Powai resident Pamela Cheema, who is the S ward coordinator of AGNI (Action for Good Governance and Networking in India), said: “We wrote to the CM to tell him to cancel this plan as nobody wants the cycle track. The Indian marsh crocodiles bask and lay their eggs on the banks of the lake here. So just let it be.” She added, “The three lakes Tulsi, Vihar and Powai are a part of an ecosystem, with each lake overflowing into the other. In fact, Powai lake overflows into the Mithi river, so further reducing the lake size for the cycle track will lead to flooding in the city.” Citizens alleged that no Environment Impact Assessment was done for the project, and said the opinions of locals and stakeholders were not taken into account. The letter also states: “For a progressive state like Maharashtra, it is appalling that the BMC insists that Powai lake is not a wetland because it is man-made. We humbly submit that the Keoladeo Ghana National Park (in Bharatpur, Rajasthan) is a man-made and man-managed wetland and is known as such nationally.

---||Pune||Pune: IMD forecasts more rainfall, thunder activity till Saturday||PUNE: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday forecast convective rainfall in the city till Saturday and cautioned citizens to avoid being outdoors during the intense thunder and lightning activity. On Monday night, the city was lashed with sharp spells of rain. But the amount of rain differed from one area to another. For instance, Lohegaon received the highest amount at 37mm in 24 hours till 8:30 am on Tuesday, followed by Lavale (31.5mm) and Shivajinagar (29.8mm). A bulk of the intense rains in various areas was concentrated in a half-an-hour to 45-minute period. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD-Pune, said, “These are convective rain associated with local instability. Moisture has been reaching various parts of the state from south Maharashtra. During daytime, temperature is high, which can cause formation of cumulonimbus clouds, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours. These clouds are thunder clouds that cause convective rain. Such rain usually lasts for half-an-hour to an hour.” Kashyapi said Pune city also has a forecast for partly cloudy sky, becoming generally cloudy towards afternoon and evening, light to moderate rain with thundery activity and lightning for the next few days. Monsoon in Maharashtra is currently weak and no strong system is present to influence rain in the state. “However, there is enough moisture incursion occurring over the state via the easterly winds that are pulling moisture from a system over the Bay of Bengal. This system over southwest Bay of Bengal is making the winds turn, especially over towards the southern part of Maharashtra. Easterly winds are thus bringing in moisture to south Maharashtra from the Bay of Bengal. Another system, an upper air cyclonic circulation over the east central Arabian Sea, is pumping in moisture to our state,” he said. The IMD is still expecting fairly widespread rainfall over parts of the state from October 5-9. “There is also isolated heavy rain warning for Konkan-Goa and Madhya Maharashtra till October 9. The ghat areas of Pune, Nashik Kolhapur, Sangli, Solapur and Satara may also experience thundery activity and isolated heavy rain till October 9,” Kashyapi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/imd-forecasts-more-rainfall-thunder-activity-till-saturday/articleshow/86792922.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Pune: Land dearth affects plan to give five acres to war widows||PUNE: Only 20 out of total 300 martyred soldiers’ widows, who had applied for the state government’s land scheme, have so far benefitted from it owing to unavailability of land for irrigation purposes, said officials. No war widow in Pune district has received land from the state government under the scheme, claimed Major Subhash Sasne (retd), district sainik welfare officer. The scheme was announced in 2018 with retrospective effect for widows of martyred soldiers from the armed and paramilitary forces in the state. There are 1,292 war widows since 1947 who are eligible for getting five acres of land under the scheme. Only 300 such widows, mostly from Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and Raigad districts, have so far applied for land. “Availability of land parcels is a major impediment in implementation of the scheme. Many proposals are stuck simply for this reason,” state department of sainik welfare’s director of militarisation Lt Col R R Jadhav (retired) told TOI. “There are 125 war widows in Pune district. Of them, 43 have applied for land compensation,” Sasne added. Asked why there are so fewer applicants when the number of eligible widows is much higher, Jadhav said, “Some of the widows have passed away, while some others are not keen on tilling land. We have taken up their cases with the administration of respective districts.” The sainik welfare department has also asked the district collectors to furnish a report on availability of land in their respective districts. Apart from five acres of land, widows or parents (in case of a bachelor) of soldiers get Rs1 crore compensation from the state government and Rs1 crore from the central government, said officials from the sainik welfare department. Sharmila Tupare, widow of Sena Medal (posthumous) awardee Naik Rajendra Tupare, got a land parcel under the scheme at Chandgad tehsil in Kolhapur district. “I had applied for land compensation and received a plot near our native place. Now, we can grow or cultivate seasonal crop,” Sharmila said. Balku Mane, father of Sena Medal (posthumous) awardee Sepoy Savan Mane, got land at Varul village in Shahuwadi tehsil in Kolhapur district. “We have been allotted an irrigated land, and we are now growing cash crop on it,” said Balku. A senior official from the department said district administration officials told them they have only ‘gayraan’ (grazing) land within their limits and a maximum of them do not have irrigation facilities. “Such land will not be useful for the widows. As such, many proposals are pending,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/land-dearth-affects-plan-to-give-5-acres-to-war-widows/articleshow/86792926.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Mumbai||BMC asks citizens to suggest way out on PAP units issue||MUMBAI: After facing flak over its controversial plan to issue credit notes to builders for constructing homes for Projected Affected People (PAP), the BMC has invited suggestions from the general public, private landowners, developers and concerned stakeholders for making available PAP tenements. Recently, after a controversy, the BMC had cut down its plan to construct 12,000 units for PAPs across Mumbai by giving out credit notes instead of money to contractors. The BMC has now decided to construct only 4,000 PAP units in Chandivali by ‘cashless’ means which will cost it around Rs 2,498 crore. This amount will be paid to a private builder by way of credit notes, land Transfer of Development Rights and construction TDR. The BMC won’t have to shell out any money for the project. TimesViewAt a time BMC is facing a cash crunch, the idea of giving out credit notes may help it save money, but this concept needs to be discussed and requires detailed financial study. Handing out credit notes can lead to BMC losing sight of the need to curtail expenditure in the future and use of credit notes may become rampant. The BMC must carry out a thorough financial review of the credit note system before going ahead with this project.The BMC said in a statement that various state agencies like SRA, Mhada and MMDRA had given the BMC 2,113 PAP units since 2015. The BMC currently needs 36,229 units to house PAPs. The BMC said only 2,000 PAP units can be constructed on its own plots. “Out of these 3-4 plots, 700 PAP tenements can be constructed on the BMC plot at Worli, for which tenders have been invited. Similarly, the tendering process for Dahisar and Bhandup for 1,000 PAP tenements has started. Thus BMC can construct only 2,000 tenements on own plots,” the BMC said. The BMC said that facing a cash crunch, it had decided to go cashless for its close-to-Rs 9,000 crore mega project to construct housing for PAPs. For the first time, BMC was to give out credit notes to contractors who were to construct 12,000 units for housing PAPs. Out of the Rs 9,000 crore, around Rs 6,000 crore was to be paid through credit notes, while the rest would have been TDR. As per the plan, land owners who own land parcels reserved for PAPs or housing for the dishoused had to come forward and offer their lands to the BMC. The BMC said it had also asked the state urban development department about its credit note scheme and pointed out MMDRA had already implemented a similar scheme. “We had received applications for construction of PAP units at 7 zones in Mumbai (24,000 units). One zone was dropped and proposals for the rest were examined. However, since rates were exorbitant, the UD department was referred, which stated the procedure was appropriate. We conducted a rate analysis by verifying the actual agreement value of transactions in these areas from the Inspector General of Registration and Stamps (IGR). We found the rates were only feasible for one zone in Chandivali for 4,000 units,” said a civic official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-asks-citizens-to-suggest-way-out-on-pap-units-issue/articleshow/86795391.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

A meeting was held at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR-CCARI), Old Goa, on Tuesday by the institute’s fruit scientists along with agriculture officials and prominent mango farmers to form the association. The GI application needs to be jointly filed by farmers and the institute. There were about 45 mancurad mango farmers that attended the meeting on Tuesday. “We will give all the technical support to the farmers. Our target is to see that the area under cultivation for mancurad mangoes expands so that commercial orchards come up in the state. Simultaneously, efforts are also being made to get a GI tag for the variety,” principal scientist, horticulture, ICAR-CCARI, A R Desai said. Efforts will also be made to tap important commercial varieties like the Hilario, mussahrat and Xavier among others, and hopefully apply for GI status for them as well. “Farmers will be able to get premium price for their mangoes once the production level increases. It will also yield value added products, which can be showcased as Goan products derived from the local mango varieties. We have also envisaged a strategy to market freshly processed pulp to other states, and overseas,” Desai said. Training sessions will be conducted for farmers for capacity building and more farmers and entrepreneurs will be roped in the newly formed association to ensure that the endeavour to give Goa’s mangoes GI status is achieved. “Not only farmers, but vendors and entrepreneurs can also be a part of the association. To file the GI application, a group of farmers who have been growing the crop for a long time must step forward,” Desai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/agri-institute-on-mission-to-get-gi-tag-for-mancurad-mango/articleshow/86795470.cms||Nida Sayed

KHC said that the excessive interest in a glamorous past with precious objectification of things like crown, gun or sword would lead people to a falsified consciousness of the nostalgic past. KHC general secretary Sebastian Joseph said that the heritage scam discussed widely these days in Kerala basically looks at the issue from the point of view of usual cheating and fraudulent practices, which is dangerous. He said that promotion of critical history that properly teaches heritage from a perspective of democratic value base, incorporating heritage of the rich and the poor, right from early school days is the need of the hour. “Heritage collection and institutionalisation drive through heritage museums have added a fictional dimension to history. People with a profit motive all over the world have come in search of artefacts just for the sake and for exhibition. This leads to trafficking of cultural heritage items and sometimes to the duplication of such items to satiate demands from a customer clientele belonging to upper classes in the society. Fantasy matters most in such heritage accumulation, not history,” Joseph said. KHC president Rajan Gurukkal, antiques are past goods, and those using them as curios are antiquarians. “Antiquarian approach is too sentimental to be archaeological. An archaeological object is legally not an object of trade. There is abuse of history and archaeology,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/khc-sees-an-abuse-of-value-of-heritage/articleshow/86795443.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Road rage: Three held on charge of assaulting lawyer, her husband||PUNE: The Bharati Vidyapeeth police on Monday arrested three men after a lawyer lodged a complaint accusing them of assaulting her and her husband on Sunday night during a quarrel after the trio’s car brushed her vehicle at Ambegaon Budruk. Senior inspector Jagannath Kalaskar and his team from the Bharati Vidyapeeth police arrested Ritesh Vijay Kondhare (30) of Bibvewadi, and Nilesh Shrimant Thorat (32) and Omkar Suresh Tambe (26), both residents of Padmavati, in connection with the incident. “Kondhare is a criminal on police record and he has body offences registered against his name,” Kalaskar said. In her complaint, the lawyer said she and her husband were going to Katraj in their car. A car behind them tried to overtake and brushed against their vehicle, she stated. Her husband then questioned Kondhare and his friends in the other car, leading to an argument. She said the suspects then grabbed the lawyer’s husband and abused him. They attempted to assault her husband using a sharp weapon but she shielded him and sustained deep cut to her hand, according to the complaint.  The trio picked up a cricket bat from their car and assaulted them, the complaint stated. The suspects also smashed the windshield of the lawyer’s car. Police said the lawyer was discharged from a hospital after being treated. A case for offences of attempt to murder, mischief and voluntary causing hurt has been registered against the three men.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/road-rage-3-held-on-charge-of-assaulting-lawyer-her-husband/articleshow/86792950.cms||---
---||Pune||Listing of suspended int’l flights baffles passengers||Pune: Wagholi resident Sushant Uniyal, who wanted to go abroad on a holiday with his wife, visited a travel portal early last month and found a direct SpiceJet flight to Dubai. Without wasting time, he spent Rs15,000 for two tickets on October 2. What awaited the couple at the airport on the departure date was a rude shock. “On arrival at the airport, I was told that the flight did not exist. Airline officials tried to get us a connecting flight from Delhi, but in vain. Our flight was rescheduled to October 31,” Uniyal said. “An airline official said a full refund had been initiated. We had booked hotels for our stay in Dubai for over Rs1 lakh. I had to spend Rs75,000 to book an Air India flight from Mumbai to Lucknow and then to Dubai the following day. I ended up spending a lot more than I had thought,” he said. SpiceJet had a direct flight from Pune to Dubai before the pandemic. Though the scheduled international flights are suspended till October 31 by the aviation authorities, the listing of such flights has been confusing many flyers. In Uniyal’s case, a SpiceJet spokesperson said, “The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) announces the extension of restrictions on the international scheduled flights on a month-on-month basis. The airline announces the cancellations once we get the revised notice from the government. SpiceJet is providing a full refund to passengers in such cases.” Flyers were, however, not convinced. “A full refund is not enough. Many times, flyers, who are not aware, book flights and also hotels. Why would airlines show that these scheduled flights are available for bookings in the first place when the DGCA has been suspending the scheduled operations since months now? They should wait for the DGCA’s order stating that scheduled international flights have been reopened,” a frequent flyer told TOI. At present, only special international flights under agreements between specific countries are being allowed to fly. Pune, before the pandemic, had two scheduled flights to Dubai operated by SpiceJet and Alliance Air. Both the flights have been suspended since the pandemic hit. No special international connections from Pune have started too. Aviation analyst and expert Dhairyashil Vandekar said, “The DGCA is expected to play the role of a watchdog to ensure such things do not happen and passengers’ interest is always protected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/listing-of-suspended-intl-flights-baffles-passengers/articleshow/86792953.cms||Joy Sengupta

The septuagenarian Parliamentarian, who has passed over the mantle of JMM’s leadership to his son Hemant, largely remains confined behind the walls of his government mansion in Morhabadi because of his health. However, Tuesday was a rare occasion when he chaired the Jharkhand Colliery Mazdoor Union’s (JCMU) meeting in the capacity of its president. Even though he made occasional public appearances, Shibu last chaired a meeting in March 2020 when the JMM’s central working committee met to analyse its performance in the 2019 state assembly polls. Party sources said Shibu is looking at strengthening the JCMU’s organizational structure and breathe new life into it. Even though JCMU held considerable sway over the workers of Coal India Limited’s subsidiaries operating in Jharkhand, its presence is on the wane in recent years. In its meeting, JCMU condemned the Centre’s move to open the coal sector for commercial mining. It also passed a resolution demanding that the CIL subsidiaries functional in Jharkhand must compensate the displaced families as per the 2013 land acquisition laws of the Centre and provide compensation which is four times the current valuation of their land. “The JCMU will strengthen its presence in coming days and fight in the interests of the coal workers,” the resolution read. Recently, JCMU suffered a hit after its incumbent vice-president Mathura Prasad Mahto, who is also the Tundi MLA, and several office-bearers accepted posts in different coal workers’ unions without prior approval of the party. JMM had sent show-cause notices to Mahto and all other JCMU office bearers in connection with the issue. JCMU secretary Vinod Kumar Pandey said, “Mathura Mahto has submitted his reply and a decision on it is pending with the president. The other office bearers are also sending their responses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/shibu-chairs-meet-of-jmm-colliery-workers-union/articleshow/86793348.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||700 vacancies in govt schools to be filled soon: Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren||RANCHI: As many as 238 young men from various tribal communities and Scheduled Caste groups who underwent skill development training at Prejha Foundation's Gurukul in Jamshedpur and Khunti district were handed over appointment letters by chief minister Hemant Soren in Ranchi on Tuesday morning. The men have been hired by their recruiters for a minimum monthly salary of Rs 15,000. The men, trained in welding, plumbing, carpentry and other technical trades, have been hired by prominent companies such as Shapoorji Pallonji, Automotive Excel and Vilas Javdekar, the foundation said in a statement. Soren handed over the appointment letters in a ceremony hosted by the department of ST, SC and backward class welfare at the Project Building auditorium in Dhurwa. Speaking on the occasion, Soren emphasised that his government is on its course to fulfill its promise of generating employment for the state's youth in the ongoing calendar year. He also said that there will soon be a formal announcement to fill up the vacancies for 700 teachers in the government-run schools. "So far, we have recruited over 600 doctors, given jobs to 900 ANMs and nurses and 24 district sports officers. We have, for the first time in 20 years, also provided direct recruitment to 100 sportspersons. Over 150 young men were given permanent employment by the ACC Cements in Chaibasa while we brought back several women who were working in low paid jobs in apparel factories across the country and provided them with well-paid jobs in Jharkhand," he said. Soren, however, underlined that government jobs will not be available for each and every aspirant. "Therefore, it is important for you to use your skills and start enterprises of your own. Today, you all are going out of the state in search of employment. But I want to see you employing people in Jharkhand in coming years," he added. Prejha Foundation, which is acting as a special purpose vehicle of Jharkhand government for imparting skill training and employment to the state's underprivileged youth, claimed to have trained over 15,000 youngsters in its 28 Gurukuls statewide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/700-vacancies-in-govt-schools-to-be-filled-soon-hemant/articleshow/86793043.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Guv seeks legal opinion on tribal council rules||Ranchi: Raj Bhavan and CMO in Jharkhand are on a collission course as governor Ramesh Bais has decided not to let go of the issue of curtailment of the governor’s power in nominating members to the Tribes Advisory Council (TAC). Bais is seeking legal opinion and waiting for the file related to TAC Rules 2021 which was notified by the Hemant Soren government on June 5 this year. Talking to TOI at Raj Bhavan on Tuesday, Bais said the governor is constitutionally the custodian of tribal rights in Schedule V states. “I believe that no government can tamper with the spirit of the Constitution and any changes to constitutional provisions like TAC and its working cannot be brought in by the state government, through simple legislation,” he said. Bais was interacting with media persons at Raj Bhavan to share his vision for development of the tribal state and its people. He said TAC advises the governor on issues of importance for the welfare and development of tribal population and nomination of its members is an important task. “According to the provisions, 16 members for the council are nominated by the government while the governor nominates four. “It is not a matter of ego, as I had kept it aside the day I joined political life but as a custodian of tribal rights in Schedule V area, it is my duty to see that the Constitution is applied in letter and spirit,” he said. Bais admitted that the file related to the notification issued by the government was summoned by the outgoing governor, Droupadi Murmu, but it was delayed and then returned. “I am waiting for the file and also seeking legal opinion to take up the matter properly,” he said. Bais, however, stressed that he is not in favour of any clash with the government or chief minister. “I am on a constitutional post and none of my acts should be partisan. I have met the chief minister on a few occasions I was convinced that he too wants to work for the progress of the state for which the Raj Bhavan wants to be a facilitator,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/guv-seeks-legal-opinion-on-tribal-council-rules/articleshow/86793193.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
