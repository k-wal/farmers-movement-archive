While Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had reached Lucknow and was about to leave for Kheri, BSP general secretary SC Mishra, too, was about to leave in the night itself. But both of them have been stopped. "It is not a house arrest situation, but they will not be allowed to leave for Lakhimpur. We are keeping a close watch on them," said a senior police officer supervising the cordons around the houses of the opposition VIPs in Lucknow. "We will not allow any of the opposition leaders to head for Lakhimpur from Lucknow as their visit can spoil the situation there," he said. Reports said cops were also deployed outside the residence of Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-sc-mishra-stopped-in-lucknow/articleshow/86737680.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Congress MLA Sherman Ali in 2-day police custody over ‘martyr’ jibe||GUWAHATI: Congress MLA from Assam’s Baghbar constituency, Sherman Ali Ahmed, has been charged with “provocation with intent to cause riot” and “promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion” for his disrespectful remarks against the martyrs of the Assam Agitation (1979-1985). The court of chief judicial magistrate, Kamrup (Metro) on Sunday sent him to two-day police custody. The police had asked the court for 10-day custody. The MLA was arrested late on Saturday night from the MLA hostel in Dispur. Rustom Raj Brahma, officer in-charge of Panbazar police station, said, “We have arrested him under sections 153 and 153A of IPC. We asked the court for 10-day custody but were given two. We can say more once we have interrogated him.” On the charges slapped on Sherman, Gauhati High Court advocate Anupam Sarma said, “A person, if convicted under section 153A of IPC, can be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three years, or with fine, or both. This is a non-bailable section.” “But section 153 is a bailable offence. However, a person, if convicted under this section, can be sentenced to a year in prison or fined or both,” the advocate added. The court on Sunday directed the police to make arrangements to ensure appropriate medical treatment for Sherman as he is a “cardiac and diabetic patient”. The direction was given by the court after the advocate asked the court on behalf of his client.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/cong-mla-in-2-day-police-custody-over-martyr-jibe/articleshow/86738057.cms||Mukut Das
---||Lucknow||Lakhimpur-Kheri violence: Akhilesh Yadav seeks Yogi Adityanath's resignation||LUCKNOW: Launching a scathing attack on BJP over the Lakhimpur incident, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday demanded chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s resignation. He will visit Lakhimpur on Monday to meet the family members of the victims. Akhilesh said the incident exemplifies the atrocities of the ruling party and its intention to crush the agitation against the three farm laws. “I spoke to farmer leader Tejendra Singh Virk who was injured in the incident and is hospitalised. There is only one demand now: the chief minister should resign,” Akhilesh tweeted in Hindi. “The manner in which farmers heading for a peaceful protest were knocked down by a car of the son of the minister of state for home only explains the arrogance that has crept into the ruling party leaders. Such incidents will drive BJP to a point where people will start opposing their leaders at every public function and gathering,” Akhikesh said. Meanwhile, SP leader Prof Sudhir Panwar said the killing of farmers agitating peacefully in Lakhimpur exposed the failure of the government and apathy of BJP towards farmers. “Farmers are in deep anguish and feel cheated. SP president has rightly demanded the resignation of Yogi Adityanath,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-akhilesh-yadav-seeks-yogi-adityanaths-resignation/articleshow/86738112.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Venkaiah Naidu stresses on water conservation||GUWAHATI: Noting the importance of rivers and their rejuvenation, vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu has asked the Centre and the state government to include lessons on the importance of water conservation in school curricula. Naidu, who arrived in Guwahati on Sunday on a tour of the northeast, began his trip by inaugurating the Heritage-cum-Cultural Centre on the banks of river Brahmaputra here that once used to be the base camp of the Ahom Army that resisted the Mughals from entering vast parts of Assam in the 1671 battle of Saraighat. The Mahabahu Brahmaputra River Heritage Centre was inaugurated in the presence of governor Jagdish Mukhi, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and other dignitaries at Panbazar. Naidu noted the legacy of the hillock in the heart of Guwahati city where the heritage centre is located as it was the base camp of the all-powerful Ahom general, Lachit Borphukan. Later, Naidu inaugurated the northeast’s first-of-its-kind PET-MRI wing at the State Cancer Institute in Gauhati Medical College Hospital. He said the medical profession should be taken as a mission and not for commission. “Do it with passion for the sake of the nation,” he urged the medical fraternity. Chief minister Sarma said the PET-MRI wing will greatly augment cancer treatment in the region. Set up with a total project cost of Rs 62 crore, this has been India’s fourth such PET-MRI machine installed at a government hospital equipped with “time of flight” tech. “This machine is faster than PET-CT and essential for advanced cancer research activities,” said Sarma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/naidu-stresses-on-water-conservation/articleshow/86736116.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Retaliation was swift and the angry farmers reportedly beat four BJP workers to death before setting their vehicles on fire. No FIR had been registered in either case till the time of filing this report. “Eight people have died — four were farmers and four BJP workers. Senior officials are working out what further action will be taken in the case. It is likely that the FIRs will be registered from both sides. A transparent investigation will be conducted. The situation is peaceful and under our control,” Nighasan sub-divisional magistrate Om Prakash Gupta told TOI. Three companies of Police Armed Constabulary have been sent to the area and internet services, locals said, have been suspended. ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar had left for the village along with IG (Lucknow range) Laxmi Singh. “The situation is peaceful and under control,” Nighasan SDM Om Prakash Gupta said. The protest goes back to a statement allegedly made by Teni at a public meeting at Sampoornanagar in Lakhimpur Kheri last week, a purported video of which had been doing the rounds, in which he is heard saying, with reference to the farmers’ protest, “Fix yourselves or face me. I will fix you in a matter of minutes. I am not just a minister or an MLA or an MP. Those who know me from before I became a legislator would also know I never retreat from challenges.” Bharatiya Sikh Sangathan president Jasbir Singh Virk said farmers were ready to stage a black flag protest at the Maharaja Agrasen Sports Ground helipad when Teni and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya got there to address an event on Sunday. “But they didn’t arrive, and the farmers learnt they had changed their plan and were taking the road. My farmers saw it as a success and were marching back,” he added in a video statement. The CM said, “Senior officials including ADG law and order, IG are investigating the incident from the spot and controlling the situation. Action will be taken against whoever is found guilty. People are requested to stay at home and help the administration in maintaining peace in the area. They should wait for the investigation report before reaching a conclusion”. One of the protesters, Gagan Chattha, told TOI, “It was a narrow road where we were protesting. Teni’s son arrived in a vehicle followed by two other SUVs. When a few farmers waved black flags at his vehicle, his car sped up and another deliberately ran over the farmers who were doing so. Many of us jumped out of its path — the vehicle ran over almost every person on the 200-m stretch.” Teni didn’t respond to TOI’s calls for a comment. Earlier in the evening, he denied all allegations in an interview with a news channel. He said that “anti-social elements among the farmers” had started pelting stones at BJP workers, a vehicle’s driver died and his vehicle turned turtle on farmers, killing two on the spot. “Then, the farmers beat four BJP workers to death and set the vehicles on fire. The farmers who died were from Nanpara in Bahraich, not even from Lakhimpur Kheri. That indicates it was a planned act. Anti-social elements were hiding among farmers”. At least two farmers who died were not from Bahraich, TOI confirmed — Nachattar Singh, 60, from Lakhimpur Kheri and Lovepreet Singh, 20, from Chokdha farm in Lakhimpur Kheri’s Majhgai. Gurpej Singh, 26, also an eyewitness, told TOI, “We had blocked the road when the minister’s vehicles ran over us farmers. I managed to get out of the way but my nephew Lovepreet couldn’t. He died. A few metres ahead, the vehicle was stopped and the minister’s son Monu (Ashish) Mishra stepped out, pistol in hand, and managed to escape with the help of policemen.” The two other farmers who died were Daljeet Singh, 35, and Gurwinder Singh, 19, farmer leaders told TOI. Where they were from could not be confirmed. When the vehicles were stopped, the farmers caught the rest of the party workers in the cars. “We saved three men and handed them over to police after questioning. All three were from Allahabad and said they work for minister Teni,” said Chattha. Another protester, Vikramjeet Singh, told TOI, “Terai Kisan Mahasabha president Tejinder Singh Virk was seriously injured in the head and legs. He has been hospitalised and is critical.” Additional SP Arun Kumar Singh told the farmers, “My farmer brothers, I promise you that action will be taken against whoever is responsible”. Teni denied the allegations against his son in the interview, saying, “My son was at the venue since 11am, where many government officials were also present. He didn’t leave the venue for a second. At the wheel of my vehicle was a driver and in the car were three party workers. They died a tragic death … I have video evidence to prove my son was not there and he will join any investigation needed”.

---||Guwahati||Congress pins hope on indigenous parties||GUWAHATI: After the “Mahajot” floated by the Congress in 2021 assembly polls sank following differences with the AIUDF and BPF, the grand old party has renewed its mission to win the upcoming byelections by riding on the indegenous sentiment propagated by two newest regional parties — Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Raijor Dal (RD). Assam PCC president Bhupen Borah on Sunday formally announced his party’s decision to offer the high-profile Majuli seat in upper Assam to the AJP. The Congress also announced to hand over Bhabanipur to the Raijor Dal, led by peasant leader Akhil Gogoi in a news conference here. While Bhabanipur will go into bypolls on October 30 along with four other seats in the state — Gossaigaon, Tamulpur, Thowra and Mariani — bypolls in Majuli will be held next. Known as the land of satras (Vaishnavite monasteries), Majuli is a focussed seat for the BJP-led government which has vowed to protect indigenous culture and identity from “aggressors”. For the saffron party, lots are at stake here as Majuli was being represented in the state assembly by former chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal since 2016. Sonowal vacated the seat recently as he was elected to the Rajya Sabha after being inducted as a cabinet minister in the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. “Today we have sent the names from the candidates’ panel for Thowra, Mariani, Gossaigaon and Tamulpur seats to the Congress high command. But we are happy to formally announce that Majuli has been left to the AJP led by Lurinjyoti Gogoi and Bhabanipur for Raijor Dal,” said Borah. He said three to four candidates’ panels for each constituency have been recommended to the AICC. Borah, however, said the Congress is still waiting for a final decision from Raijor Dal regarding its offer to give away Bhabanipur to Akhil’s party. Badruddin Ajmal’s AIUDF won from Bhabanipur in the last assembly election but legislator Phanidhar Talukdar joined the BJP later. As minority votes are now a determining factor in Bhabanipur, though the area was an important nerve centre of the anti-foreigners movement (1979-85), Raijor Dal insiders said it has little or no confidence of winning from here. “Congress wants Raijor Dal to accept our offer as we want to take both the parties on board to defeat the BJP,” Borah said, adding that Congress will wait for Akhil’s “positive response” till the last minute before filing nominations. Though Akhil is adamant on fielding his close aide Dhaijjya Konwar from Thowra in Sivasagar, Borah said they cannot surrender the seat from where Congress won the last election just three months ago. AJP president Lurinjyoti, a face of the anti-CAA movement in Assam, urged all anti-BJP parties to field one consensus candidate for each seat. The AJP and Raijor Dal are believed to have ruined the prospects of the Congress in the northern and upper Assam region in the last assembly polls where the two parties had split a significant chunk of anti-BJP votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/cong-pins-hope-on-indigenous-parties/articleshow/86736198.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Guwahati||Woman gets bail within 24 hours of knocking down 8 workers||GUWAHATI: A 29-year-old wedding planner and former model was granted bail within 24 hours of her arrest for allegedly knocking down eight PWD workers with her speeding car while driving in an “inebriated” condition in Guwahati on Saturday. Questions were raised on the role of police after she managed to secure bail so soon. Meanwhile, the labourers are currently undergoing treatment in GMCH, and the condition of one of the victims is stated to be critical. A Femina Miss India finalist, 2016 and a resident of of Beltola Survey, Rajkanya Baruah was driving her car while the night curfew was in force, claimed the traffic police on Saturday. However, she dismissed the allegations through a series of Instagram posts on Sunday and said no case has been registered “for hit and run” or “drink driving” against her. A senior police officer at Dispur Police station told TOI, “We produced the woman before a local court, which granted her bail. A case under section 279/338/294/353 of IPC was registered in this regard. We have added the section based on the FIR details. We can’t comment on the court order.” Asked why she was not booked under section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act for “drink driving”, as well as violation of Covid-19 protocol under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act and Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, police blamed the “loopholes” in the FIR, which was filed by the traffic police. However, traffic police official Robin Phukan said, “Prima facie she was drunk. Let us wait for the rest result.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/woman-gets-bail-within-24-hours-of-knocking-down-8-workers/articleshow/86737066.cms||Rokibuz Zaman
---||Bhubaneswar||Son betters dad as BJD retains Pipili, wins by bigger margin||BHUBANESWAR: The ruling BJD on Sunday continued its winning streak in Pipili with the party’s candidate, Rudra Pratap Maharathy, registering a resounding victory in the byelection to the assembly constituency in Puri district. He won by a margin of around 20,916 votes. BJP finished second, while Congress forfeited its deposit. The BJD secured 53.60% votes compared to 50.66% votes in the 2019 assembly election despite party president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik not hitting the campaign trail. On the other hand, some BJP heavyweights, including Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan and party’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra had conducted roadshows in Pipili for their candidate, Ashrit Pattanayak. BJD’s Rudra won by a bigger margin than his father, Pradeep Maharathy, had in the 2019 polls (15,787 votes). Pradeep’s death last year made the byelection necessary. It was an emotional moment for the junior Maharathy as the result was announced on a day that marked the first death anniversary of his father. After the party’s victory, Naveen took to Twitter to thank the people of Pipili for supporting the BJD and also congratulated the workers and leaders. “BJD is your party and is always dedicated to your service,” the chief minister tweeted. Rudra, a postgraduate in management, also expressed his gratitude to the people and appealed to them not to celebrate the win owuing to the pandemic. Since the time counting begun earlier in the day, the BJD maintained a comfortable lead. Though BJP’s Ashrit Pattanayak gained lead in some rounds towards the fag end, he could not fight back as the total winning margin was huge. Pattanayak, however, improved upon his 2019 performance by securing 42.04% votes (76,056) compared to 41.62% votes (72,731) he had garnered in the last assembly poll. The performance of Congress further deteriorated in Pipili with party candidate, Bishwokeshan Harichandan Mohapatra, barely managing to get 4,261 votes, which accounts for 2.36% of the total votes polled. This is less than the 5.63% votes it had secured in the 2019 assembly polls. Pipili has traditionally been a BJD stronghold with the party not having faced a single defeat since the time it started fighting assembly polls in 2000. Poll observers said Naveen’s popularity, sympathy for the late Maharathy and the well-oiled election machinery of the ruling party helped BJD sail through it. After the 2019 polls, this is the fourth byelection win of the ruling BJD. While the byelection has set the tone for the panchayat polls scheduled to be held early next year, some recent bypoll results indicated that Odisha will witness a two-way fight between BJD and BJP in the future with Congress no more in the race barring in a few western and Kalahandi-Balangir-Koraput districts. BJP president Samir Mohanty also thanked the people of Pipili for giving more votes to the party compared to 2019 and said the party will work hard for the interest of the people of Pipili. Congress leader Suresh Routray alleged misuse of black money and machinery by the ruling party to win the bypoll.

---||India||Bhowanipore gives Didi biggest assembly poll win||KOLKATA: Voters in south Kolkata's Bhowanipore on Sunday gave their "ghorer meye" (daughter of the house) Mamata Banerjee the mandate she needed to continue as Bengal CM in the form of her biggest-ever victory margin of 58,835 votes in an assembly poll. Trinamool also retained the Jangipur and Shamsherganj seats. "There were so many conspiracies against me. The people of Bhowanipore have given a befitting reply to those conspiracies and the conspirators...You have inspired me to work harder,” she said, basking in the afterglow of a comeback just five months after a rare poll setback in Nandigram. “They sent 3,500 central forces to this small constituency. But the people of Bhowanipore have given an answer on behalf of Bengal and India,” Mamata said in her seven-minute-31-second victory speech, punctuated with chants of “Didi, Didi” from the crowd. Jakir Hossain won Jangipur for Trinamool by a staggering 92,480 votes while Amirul Islam emerged victorious in Shamsherganj to maintain the party’s strength of 213 in the 294-member assembly. Party seniors said the ease of Mamata’s victory, more than anything else, would help set the agenda for the four bypolls later this month and the civic elections after that. The Bhowanipore win was the first time since 2014 that Trinamool had led in all eight wards of this multilingual and multicultural seat, giving Mamata the ammo to respond to BJP’s jibes that her party is overly dependent on specific voter blocs. The CM didn’t lose the opportunity to emphasise this point in her first remarks after the victory. “Every ward has given us a lead. This is a seat where Hindus stay with Muslims and Sikhs and Bengalis stay with Gujaratis, Punjabis, Oriyas, Biharis and people from UP. I thank every one of them,” she said. For Mamata, the victory margin of 58,000-plus votes bettered her 2011 vote tally of 54,213, also in a byelection. The margin was also more than double of Trinamool’s April 26 victory by 28,719 votes, when it had trailed in two wards (Chakraberia-Paddapukur and Alipore). Mamata got 71.9% of the total votes cast, leaving only 22.2% for BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal. BJP had garnered a vote share of more than 35% barely five months ago. CPM also took a body blow, getting only 3.5 % of the vote share and losing its deposit in a seat labelled “mini India” during the bypoll campaign. Mamata stressed all these points and more in her speech from the lane outside her Kalighat home, flanked by her sisters-in-law, nephew and party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and his school-going daughter. The backdrop was a giant photo-collage that supporters had put up a few minutes earlier. Emblazoned across the collage was the coinage “Modishahsurmardini (slayer of the Modi-Shah asura)”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bhowanipore-gives-didi-biggest-assembly-poll-win/articleshow/86739998.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Foreign minister S. Jaishankar pointed to the “tactical compromises” the US might be making in Af-Pak — both vis a vis the Taliban and Pakistan. Acknowledging for the first time, mildly reproachfully, that India had been kept in the dark about the details of the US-Taliban deal, Jaishankar told an event in Washington, “I think to some degree, we’ll all be justified in having levels of concern. And to some degree, the jury is still out.” Jaishankar’s reference was to the classified portions of the US-Taliban peace agreement in Doha, two annexures of which were not shared — not only with India but will the US’ partners as well. According to sources, these secret portions included military actions that the US committed to in Afghanistan. There is deep disquiet in India about the details of the secret portions of the agreement that could have an impact on India. “When I say levels of concern, there were commitments which were made by the Taliban at Doha...The US knows that best, we were not taken into confidence on various aspects of that.” The upshot of this was that US actions threw Afghan civil society and the Ashraf Ghani government under the bus, as the Taliban swept into Kabul in mid-August. “We have been victims of cross-border terrorism from that region and...that has shaped in many ways our view of some of the neighbours of Afghanistan. How much the US shares that view and where is it that the US makes its tactical compromises, that is for the Americans to figure out.” India faces a challenging diplomatic-security situation post the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. This relates not only to the legitimacy of the Taliban government in Afghanistan, it also relates to Pakistan’s relative positioning vis a vis Afghanistan, China and now, the US, that could have a bearing on India’s security space. This week, US deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman will visit India followed by Pakistan, a script that hasn’t been followed in the recent past. She follows a similar path struck by CIA chief Bill Burns who was here a few days ago. For the present, US officials have indicated this would involve evacuations, but sections in the Indian establishment feel that given US’ intelligence vulnerabilities in Af-Pak, the US-Pak engagement may grow. However, there is a growing clamour in Washington to call Pakistan out for its role, with a new Bill introduced in the US Congress that directly mentions Pakistan and calls for an “assessment of support by state and non-state actors, including the government of Pakistan, for the Taliban between 2001 and 2020.” Top security sources in the Indian government are convinced the Afghanistan situation will get considerably worse — certainly for Afghan civil society. These are already signs of abuse of women, removing them from employment and education, suffering of minorities etc. This is directly related to how the Taliban took control of Afghanistan. This is already playing out badly in the internal politics of the Democrats in Washington. First, a realisation that the main reason the Afghan government folded as it did was that there was virtually no space for it in the Doha deal. Officials said one escape clause for the US could have been reneging on the deal if the Taliban-Afghan talks failed. They did, largely because the Taliban was not interested. But the Biden administration stayed in the deal, which, an increasing number of security experts now describe as a “weak” deal. A second point of concern in India is the number of weapons left behind by the departing US troops for the Taliban to use. Given their parlous control and an economic crisis, India is worried that these weapons could find their way to armed criminals and terror groups, potentially causing havoc. However, unlike the last time, the India-US relationship has evolved to a place that now sees both countries at least exchanging notes on Afghanistan, though there are many areas where India does not agree with the US. Those concerns, sources said, have been made clear to the Biden administration as well. The UN’s credentials committee is expected to meet in November to take a call on giving the UN seat to the Taliban. The Taliban have already named their spokesperson, Suhail Shaheen to the job. The other check to wholesale acceptance of the Taliban has been the UNSC resolution 2593, which sets down conditions for Taliban’s acceptability and committed the international community to it. Even if the UN decides to grant the UN seat to the Taliban, there will be other hurdles, particularly their international travel. India chairs the Taliban sanctions committee in the UNSC — since many members of the Taliban government are under UN sanctions, these would have to be lifted before they can travel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/classified-parts-of-us-taliban-doha-deal-have-india-worried/articleshow/86740441.cms||Indrani Bagchi

Vanlalfaka Ralte, SP of Kolasib district, told media that Fayaz Rehman Mazumdar, 30, a resident of North Hawaithang village in Cachar district, had hanged himself inside his prison cell. Mizoram police arrested Fayaz at the inter-state border in Kolasib district on September 28 after he allegedly produced someone else’s Covid negative test report and claimed it to be his. Ramandeep Kaur, SP of Cachar (in Assam) also said there were allegations that Fayaz was producing fake Covid test reports at the border several times. “He repeatedly did that despite several warnings. Mizoram police recently arrested him and informed us about it. He was produced before the court and sent to custody. As he was arrested under violation of Covid-19 protocols, the charges against him were strict. We do not know whether he was suffering from any mental health issues, but as per reports, he died by suicide,” she said. Meanwhile, suspecting foul play, the Silchar Truck Drivers’ Association demanded a high-level probe into the “mysterious” death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/probe-assam-drivers-death-in-mizoram-jail-truckers-union/articleshow/86740870.cms||B B Goswami
---||India||Navjot Singh Sidhu reiterates his demand; shortlist for DGP done: CM Channi||CHANDIGARH: Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu again demanded a replacement of Punjab’s police chief and advocate general on Sunday, saying otherwise the party will suffer a loss of face. Hours later, CM Charanjit Singh Channi reminded that the names of 10 police officers have already been sent to the Centre. He asserted that a “good” officer will be appointed as the director general of police (DGP) after consulting Sidhu, ministers and MLAs once the state government receives three shortlisted names from the Centre. “Demand for Justice in Sacrilege cases and for arrest of main culprits behind the drug trade brought our Govt in 2017 & Due to his failure, People removed the last CM. Now, AG/DG appointments rub salt on wounds of victims, they must be replaced or we will have No face!!,” Sidhu tweeted. The development comes three days after Sidhu and Channi held a meeting, following which it was decided to set up a coordination panel for prior consultation on all major decisions of the state government. Talking to reporters in Morinda on the sidelines of a government function, Channi said a regular DGP is yet to be appointed when he was asked about Sidhu’s demand for changing the state police chief and the advocate general. “I have told Sidhu sahab and he also knows that the names of the police officers who have completed 30 years in service have been sent to the Centre for the appointment of a DGP,” he said. “The party work is being looked after by Sidhu sahab. We should both work in coordination and we are doing so. If anything is not being liked, then we have set up a coordination committee where we can discuss it,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/navjot-singh-sidhu-reiterates-his-demand-shortlist-for-dgp-done-cm-channi/articleshow/86740952.cms||---

Truss said that she is keen to strike more deals along the lines of AUKUS – the trilateral security alliance between Australia, the UK and the US, which is widely seen as a counter-balance to China. “We want to work with our friends and allies to create more economic agreements and security agreements. AUKUS is about protecting trade routes and shipping routes specifically with Australia but I want to look at arrangements with India, with Japan and with Canada to expand that security support in the same types of areas,” Truss told The Sunday Times in her first major interview since taking over her new role as the foreign secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-want-pacts-with-india-to-counter-malign-actors/articleshow/86741003.cms||---

As on Sunday morning, 50.3% of Himachal’s adult population had received both shots, government data revealed. That’s nearly double the national average of 26.3%. The state had achieved 100% first-dose coverage in the last week of August. Nationally, 70.1% of eligible Indians have till date been vaccinated at least once. Kerala has the next best vaccination record with 92.7% first-dose coverage and 41.6% fully vaccinated adult population. Delhi comes third, having achieved 39.8% full vaccination and 80.9% first-dose coverage. Meanwhile, UP has so far administered at least one vaccine shot to 59.4% while just 14.7% of its adult population has got both doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/another-first-50-of-himachal-pradesh-adults-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/86741243.cms||---
---||India||India’s weekly cases dip 22%, sharpest fall since mid-June||A big drop in Covid-19 infections in Kerala has led to the sharpest fall in weekly cases recorded in India since mid-June, with the country reporting less than 2 lakh cases in the seven-day period for the first time in nearly seven months. India recorded less than 1.56 lakh fresh Covid cases in the week ending Sunday (September 27-October 3), a 22.2% decline over the previous week's tally over 2 lakh. A sharper percentage drop in weekly cases was last recorded in June 14-20, 15 weeks ago, when the cases had fallen by 29.5%. In absolute terms, this week's case count was the lowest since March 8-14, close to seven months ago, when a similar number of cases (nearly 1.56 lakh) were recorded as the second wave of the pandemic spread in the country. The steep decline in Covid cases has come about due to Kerala numbers falling sharply. The state recorded 90,291 new cases of the virus during the week, a 25.6% drop from the previous week's tally of 1.21 lakh. This is the first time in 11 weeks that the state has reported less than 1 lakh cases in a seven-day period ending Sunday. This the third week of declining cases in Kerala, indicating that the post-Onam wave of infections in the state was firmly on the wane. The state, however, continues to account for a majority of new cases in the country. In the current week, Kerala's share in national cases was 58%, down from close to 61% in the previous week. At the peak of its latest wave, Kerala accounted for close to 70% of all cases in the country. Cases continue to rise in Mizoram although the rate of increase is now slowing down. Meanwhile, India reported 1,860 deaths from the virus in the week, a dip of 7% over the previous seven days. This was the lowest weekly toll from the pandemic since March 15-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-weekly-cases-dip-22-sharpest-fall-since-mid-june/articleshow/86741336.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

If everything goes as per plan, the vaccine will be introduced in the immunisation programme by October 15-20,” NK Arora, chairman of the Centre’s Covid working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), told TOI on Sunday. The three-dose needle-free ZyCoV-D vaccine, manufactured by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, is the first vaccine in India that has received emergency use authorisation (EUA) for being administered to people aged 12 years and above. The vaccine is based on the plasmid DNA technology and follows a three-dose regimen with a 28-day gap between each dose.“Since it is a three-dose vaccine, we need to ensure availability of one crore doses each month for the next three months,” Arora said. Developed in partnership with the department of biotechnology, ZyCoV-D is a first-of-its-kind DNA vaccine that produces the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 to elicit an immune response. It is an intradermal vaccine that must be applied using a ‘needle-free injector’, which the manufacturer says will help in reducing side effects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/zydus-cadilas-vaccine-rollout-likely-in-2-weeks-final-checks-on-ntagi-chief/articleshow/86741364.cms||Umesh Isalkar

We are looking for possible receivers in the area. A search is underway,” he added. The arms were dropped around Saturday midnight. “Some villagers were awakened by the sound of a flying object, suspected to be a drone, and informed cops. Police teams rushed to the spot and seized the package wrapped in yellow polythene, with a handle tied using a nylon thread,” said the ADGP. In the past one-and-a-half years, security forces have recovered a huge number of arms, ammunition and explosives that were dropped using drones. “These include 16 AK-47 rifles, three M4 US-made rifles, 34 pistols, 15 grenades and 18 IEDs including three big ones,” said an official, adding that even currency notes were dropped in some of these sorties. Drone sightings along the international border in J&K have increased after the drone attack on Air Force Station Jammu on June 27. Following the strike, the sale, purchase and use of drones for personal purposes was banned by 10 J&K districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jammu-police-recover-drone-dropped-arms-ammo/articleshow/86741425.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

An NIA spokesperson said the raids were carried out at 9 places in Poonch district with the assistance of the J&K Police, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) in a case registered on December 9, 2016. The cross-LoC trade was started in 2008 as part of confidence-building measures (CBMs) between India and Pakistan, but on April 18, 2019, India had indefinitely suspended trade at two points along the LoC following reports that it was being misused for smuggling weapons, narcotics and fake currency. "The trade was based on a barter system and third-party goods were not allowed. The case being probed by NIA is related to large-scale transfer of funds from Pakistan to India through the import of California almonds and other items via the Cross-LoC Trade Facilitation Centres (TFCs) located at Salamabad in Baramulla district and Chakan-Da-Bag in Poonch district. These funds were purportedly being used for fomenting terrorism/separatism in Jammu & Kashmir," the spokesperson said. "It was found during the investigation that some of the traders having excess imports were channelising the surplus profit to terror organisations while others are suspected to have links with terrorist organisations," the NIA spokesperson said. "During the searches on Sunday, documents, digital devices and other incriminating materials were recovered from the premises of the suspects."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cross-loc-trade-case-nia-conducts-raids-across-jk/articleshow/86741434.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The HC had last Tuesday asked Banerjee to decide on the petition to disqualify Roy, under the anti-defection law, by October 7. Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari had filed the petition against Roy, who had switched over from BJP to Trinamool. While the hearing was pending, the speaker appointed Roy the PAC chairman. Banerjee consulted legal opinion following the HC directive and said he was mulling moving the Supreme Court this week. Sources hinted that some top lawyers were going to represent the speaker as he wanted to point out that the HC was making an attempt to exert its power on the legislature and the HC was overstepping its jurisdiction in issuing directives to the speaker. The HC bench of acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Rajarshi Bhardwaj had said that in case of failure to meet the deadline, it would decide further course of action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-speaker-plans-to-move-supreme-court-against-high-courts-order-on-mukul/articleshow/86741504.cms||Debashish Konar

According to a late PTI report, Rahul met Sangma and the party’s state president Vincent H Pala along with Meghalaya in-charge Manish Chatrath and AICC general secretary K C Venugopal at his residence in Delhi on Sunday. The party shared pictures of the leaders together after the meeting. While Sangma left Shillong for Delhi, Congress announced the names of its candidates for bypolls to three assembly seats ahead of its rival parties. Responding to speculation about Sangma being on the verge of quitting the party along with some legislators, Meghalaya PCC chief Pala had claimed on Saturday that these were “mere reports” and that “such news” would not affect the party’s performance in the October 30 assembly bypolls to three vacant seats. “As of now, I don’t think we will have a problem going into the election,” said Pala, a three-time Lok Sabha member representing Shillong constituency, even as he maintained that there were no differences between him and Sangma. Pala, the newly appointed PPC president also said he had spoken to Sangma and got the impression that the latter had a problem with the way the PCC president was appointed and not him as an individual.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shillong/ex-meghalaya-chief-minister-adds-to-congresss-list-of-woes/articleshow/86741525.cms||Manosh Das

Considering the reports that children may be more susceptible to the novel coronavirus disease in the third wave, extra beds are being created to treat the paediatric cases. The health department is setting up 140 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants in hospitals having more than 50 beds to cater to 100% of ICU beds and 50% of non-ICU beds. Despite the ongoing uncertainty over the timing and impact of the anticipated third wave, the state seems to be bracing for the worst scenario. There was a sharp increase in the number of Covid-19 cases during the second wave, particularly those seeking oxygen and ICU care. The second wave placed an unprecedented strain on the healthcare system in Andhra Pradesh with the shortage of liquid medical oxygen at the hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-preparing-over-50k-o2-icu-beds-for-third-wave/articleshow/86735799.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

An officer from the ACB said the complainant’s wife filed a case against an illegal money lender. “Mali had demanded Rs40,000 from the complainant to file a chargesheet in favour of his wife’s complaint. Later, he agreed on Rs30,000,” the officer said. He said after receiving the complaint, a trap was laid near the police station. “We caught him red-handed, accepting the money,” he said.

In the video, whose authenticity could not be verified, Khattar is addressing the office-bearers of the Haryana unit of BJP’s Kisan Morcha at his residence here on Sunday. “Some new farmers’ organisations which are emerging need to be encouraged. If we have at least 1,000 volunteers in north-western districts, you need to take up sticks... don’t worry about bail. You will have the best training and would emerge as senior leaders after spending a few months in jail,” he says in the video. Reacting to the video, AICC general secretary Randeep Surjewala tweeted: “If the CM of the state only talks about breaking up the society and abolishing the law and order system, then law and constitutional rule cannot prevail. BJP’s anti-farmer conspiracy has been busted today. ” In a press statement, BKU (Charuni) chief Gurnam Sigh Charuni said: “Khattar asked BJP workers to prepare a fauj (army) of men, attack the agitating farmers...such a provocative statement from a man sitting on the chief minister’s chair is shameful.” However, officials in the CMO termed the video as a false propaganda by the opposition against the CM. “In fact, this is a doctored video and only that portion which could put the CM and government in a bad light has been shown. Otherwise, the (CM’s) message was to tell workers to be conscious and disciplined and to ensure that they don’t take the law into their hands,” said an official spokesman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/create-force-in-districts-to-counter-stir-khattar-clip-sparks-row/articleshow/86741725.cms||Manvir Saini

---||Business||Pandora Papers: Illegal riches of world leaders ‘exposed’||Nearly 12 million documents purportedly throwing light on the secret, ‘ill-gotten’ wealth of the rich and famous, including Indians, were made public on Sunday as part of the ‘Pandora Papers’ probe. A trove of nearly 12 million documents purportedly throwing light on the secret, and allegedly ill-gotten, wealth of the rich and famous, including Indians, was made public on Sunday as part of the infamous “Pandora Papers” investigation. The website of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which had been collating the data since 2016, termed the probe that enveloped politicians and billionaire business magnates across the globe “an offshore data tsunami”. A total of 2.94 terabytes of files came from companies hired by wealthy clients to allegedly create offshore structures and trusts in tax havens such as Panama, Dubai, Monaco, Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. The names that the papers claim to expose include 330-odd politicians of more than 90 countries — from people in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle to close aides and financial backers of Pakistan PM Imran Khan. “My govt will investigate all our citizens mentioned in the Pandora Papers & if any wrongdoing is established we will take appropriate action. I call on the international community to treat this grave injustice as similar to the climate change crisis,” Imran tweeted late Sunday. “Just like the East India Company plundered the wealth of India, ruling elites of developing world are doing the same. Unfortunately, the rich states are neither interested in preventing this large-scale plunder nor in repatriating this looted money,” he said. According to a BBC report that quoted the latest set of leaked papers, former British PM Tony Blair and his barrister wife Cherie did not have to pay £312,000 in stamp duty when buying a £6.45m London townhouse. The couple had bought the property as an office for Cherie's business in 2017 by buying the offshore firm that owned it, the report said. The ICIJ also claims to have data on at least 500 Indians and their alleged links to offshore companies, trusts and foundations. Most of the Indian entities under the scanner had allegedly set up offshore bases with the help of a Panamanian firm. The Pandora Papers investigation also purportedly reveals how banks and law firms work closely with offshore service providers to design complex corporate structures. “The files show that providers don’t always know their customers, despite their legal obligation to take care not to do business with people who engage in questionable dealings,” the consortium’s website says. Ahead of Sunday’s disclosures, the Panamanian government wrote to the ICIJ, saying it feared the new exposé would further taint its reputation. “The damage could be insurmountable,” the Panamanian government said in the letter, sent through a law firm. The letter warned against "any publication” reinforcing "a false perception” of the country as a possible tax haven “will have devastating consequences for Panama and its people”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/pandora-papers-illegal-riches-of-world-leaders-exposed/articleshow/86742023.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: 2 women Maoists lay down arms in Koraput district||Bhubaneswar: Two women Maoists on Sunday surrendered before director general of police (DGP) Abhay in Koraput, taking their number to 18 this year alone. In the latest incident, Debe Podiami and Gita Podiami decided to lay down arms after being allegedly tortured by their seniors for several months. They chose to surrender before the DGP during his visit to Koraput and Malkangiri on Sunday. “They were disillusioned with the conduct and behaviour of the senior leaders. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s frequent appeals, the rehabilitation policy for surrendered Maoists and development work in the region have prompted the Maoists to join the mainstream,” a senior police officer said. Debe (32), an area committee member, was allegedly involved in at least seven major attacks on security forces in Malkangiri district between 2006 and 2021. She had joined the CPI (Maoist) Kalimela area committee as a party member in 2005 and underwent a training on the use of firearms in 2007. She was first given a .303 rifle and later an INSAS rifle. Gita (22) was a party member of the Andhra-Odisha Border Military Platoon, a wing of the Maoists. She was inducted into the CPI (Maoist) in 2018 in Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee. Though she belonged to Chhattisgarh, she was engaged in Maoist-related offensives in Boipariguda and Machhkund in Koraput district. She was allegedly involved in four major attacks on security personnel between 2018 and 2021 in Malkangiri district. The DGP inaugurated the Jodambo and Kalimela police stations in Malkangiri district. “Today, @DGPOdisha inaugurated Jodambo PS building. A landmark for @odisha_police. This PS was earlier functioning from Chitrakonda. It was shifted last year to Jodambo. Now this PS building will help in rendering service to the people of #SwabhimanAnchal,” tweeted Odisha Police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/2-women-maoists-lay-down-arms-in-koraput-district/articleshow/86742250.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

The vehicle, along with the ganja, has been seized, he added. After procuring the ganja from across the district, the smugglers were transporting it to UP via Raipur, Chhattisgarh, when the police seized the contraband. The accused duo, both residents of Aligarh, have been identified as Ravi Singh and Raju Singh, the driver and the helper of the truck, respectively. Further investigation into the case is on, the police added. The massive seizure of the contraband has proved that Odisha still remains a major supplier of marijuana across the country. On August 23, the police seized around 2,149kg ganja from four places, while 700kg of the drug was seized from two places in the district on August 27. The SP added that crackdown on illegal ganja transportation from the district is one of the priority areas of the Gajapati police. “Accordingly, we have instructed all the police stations to keep strict vigil on the illegal transportation of the ganja in their respective areas. The drive against illegal transportation of the contraband will continue,” he added. In a similar incident, the police seized around 306kg ganja, packed in six bags from roadside at Salaguda under the Gochhapada police station limits in Kandhamal district on Sunday. The accused persons fled the spot on seeing the police. On Saturday, the intelligence wing of the excise department arrested two persons of Rajasthan while smuggling ganja from Ganjam district to Nagpur, Maharashtra, in a truck via Berhampur. Around 500kg of ganja, valued at around Rs 50 lakh along with the truck, was seized from the duo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/2000-kg-ganja-worth-1-cr-seized-2-held/articleshow/86734374.cms||Hrushikesh Mohanty

In its statement, the military said the attack took place in the Spinwam area of North Waziristan, and that an operation was underway to strike back against the militants. The group claimed responsibility in a statement, saying it had ambushed a “raiding party” in the area. TTP operates in the tribal belt bordering Afghanistan. Around 6,000 TTP terrorists are said to have sanctuaries in Afghanistan’s east and west, besides the border with Pakistan. The attack came even as TTP announced a three-week ceasefire late on Friday.

In its statement, the military said the attack took place in the Spinwam area of North Waziristan, and that an operation was underway to strike back against the militants. The group claimed responsibility in a statement, saying it had ambushed a “raiding party” in the area. TTP operates in the tribal belt bordering Afghanistan. Around 6,000 TTP terrorists are said to have sanctuaries in Afghanistan’s east and west, besides the border with Pakistan. The attack came even as TTP announced a three-week ceasefire late on Friday.

As the Taliban’s interim government failed to win a global recognition, an article in the state-run Global Times on Saturday said: “China and Pakistan must cooperate to persuade the Taliban to establish an open and inclusive government and implement a moderate domestic and foreign policy”.Written by Liu Zongyi, secretary-general of Research Centre for China-South Asia Cooperation at the government-run Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, the article reads: “At present, the verbal expression of the Taliban is very different from that in the past, but we do not know what specific policies they’ll champion in the future... Taliban are now facing a series of challenges. First, the unity of Taliban itself. Second, whether the Taliban can establish an inclusive government.” The article also criticised the premise among the strategic analysts that the seizure of power of the Taliban is a success for China and Pakistan. “They believe that the successful seizure of power by the Taliban is a strategic failure of the US, the West and India. The reason why they have this faulty interpretation is mainly due to their geopolitical-competition thinking and zero-sum game thinking,” it said as it criticised the US move to form the Quad along with India, Japan and Australia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/inclusive-taliban-govt-doubtful-china-agency/articleshow/86742326.cms||---

The exams were conducted in two shifts – 9am to 12 noon and 2.30pm to 5.30pm – for two compulsory papers. An IIT-Guwahati zone official said the exams passed off peacefully at all the centres. In Bihar, IIT aspirants appeared for computer-based test (CBT) at 20 centres in Patna. The rest of the 20 centres were in Ara, Aurangabad, Bhagalpur, Biharsharif, Chhapra, Rohtas, Darbhanga, Gaya, Muzaffarpur, Purnia, Samastipur and Sheikhpura. According to the candidates, the mathematics section was tough, lengthy and tricky. The chemistry and physics sections were moderate, they said. Sahil Kumar Singh, who appeared for the exam at a centre at Patliputra, said, “Chemistry was a balanced section as questions were asked equally from organic and inorganic chemistry from classes XI and XII. There were some tough questions in physics. Keeping in mind the previous year’s papers, I was expecting the mathematics section to be easy. However, this section was tricky and lengthy.” Vaibhav Vishal, who was among 18 candidates to secure AIR 1 in JEE-Main, said the papers, overall, were moderate. “Chemistry was the easiest section in both papers. The first paper of physics was easy, but the second one was a little tricky. Mathematics section was moderate to tough in both papers,” he added. Shambhavi, another aspirant, said, “The first paper was moderate to difficult. Mathematics section was quite lengthy. In physics, most questions were asked from Class XI. The physics section was tough and mathematics questions were lengthy in the second paper.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jee-advanced-10k-appear-at-40-centres/articleshow/86735573.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Chandigarh||PGI concludes 5th update on gastrointestinal emergencies||Chandigarh: The fifth gastrointestinal emergencies update at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGI) concluded on Sunday. Prof Vivek Saraswat from Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI), Lucknow, spoke on the management of post-surgery bile leaks. Leakage from bile duct can occur during surgery for gall bladder removal, especially in difficult cases., he said. The need for appropriate patient and procedure selection, timely identification of leaks and referral was highlighted. He also discussed about the role of percutaneous drainage and endoscopic bridging of bile leaks. Dr A C Anand from Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Bhubaneshwar discussed the management of patients with fever and jaundice. Many common tropical infections, including malaria, dengue, scrub typhus and typhoid, can present with fever and jaundice, he said. He spoke on the importance of identifying and treating the underlying infection and on keeping a watch for development of liver failure. Prof Ajay Duseja from the PGI spoke about the importance of correctly diagnosing and managing patients with acute chronic liver failure. This is a recently described entity where patients who have underlying prior liver disease may develop jaundice, altered behaviour or risk of bleeding due to new insults like infection. Dr S K Garg spoke on management of patients with traumatic pancreatic injury. It is common after roadside accidents for cases to present with pain in abdomen, he said. Direct forceful impact of a bike or bicycle handle while deaccelerating, leads to injury to the pancreas. This can further lead to pancreatitis, pain in abdomen, decrease in blood pressure, formation of fluid collections in the abdomen and infection. Role of computed tomography and MRI to identify the site of injury was discussed. Dr Rajesh Puri from Medanta, Gurgaon, discussed about role of endoscopy in internal drainage of collections and bridging of pancreatic leaks. Prof Uday Ghoshal from SGPGI, Lucknow spoke on the management of patients with acute diarrhoea. He highlighted the need for hygienic food handling and intake of oral rehydration solutions (ORS). He discussed about alarm symptoms such as decreased urine output, poor mentation, blood in stools and persistent diarrhoea, mentioning the role of antibiotics in certain settings. Prof Govind Makharia from AIIMS, New Delhi, spoke on the management of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. He emphasised on the importance of antibiotic stewardship. He told how immunocompromised patients and patients on antibiotics may be more susceptible to clostridiodes difficle — an infection that results from disruption of normal, healthy bacteria in the colon, often as a result of antibiotics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-concludes-5th-update-on-gastrointestinal-emergencies/articleshow/86737438.cms||---
---||Patna||Chirag won’t get formidable candidates for bypolls: Pashupati Kumar Paras||PATNA: A day after the Election Commission (EC) directed both the factions not to use the LJP name and its election symbol, bungalow, in the byelection for Kusheshawar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats, Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras on Sunday said his nephew Chirag Pawan would not get a formidable candidate to contest the October 30 bypolls. The Union minister also said the EC’s interim order as a right step. Paras said the LJP was part of the NDA and he would campaign for its candidates in the byelection. Chirag has announced to field his candidates from both the seats against JD(U) and RJD. “The matter is still pending in the court of the commission. I am of the firm believe that the EC’s decision would be in our favour as the majority is with me. Five of the six party MPs have reposed faith in my leadership. Even the Lok Sabha Speaker accepted me as the floor leader of the LJP in the lower House,” Paras said. The Union minister was in Patna on Sunday to invite former CM and HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi to the first death anniversary of his elder brother and LJP founder late Ram Vilas Paswan on October 8, which is coincidentally the last date of filing nomination papers for the bypolls. Earlier in the day, Chirag, without mentioning his uncle’s name, tweeted, “The greed of power of some party leaders weakened my father Ram Vilas Paswan’s movement for uplifting the deprived in the society.” The Jamui MP, however, hastened to add that if the EC’s interim order is to be considered, it has given thought to his argument. Sources said both Chirag and Paras had written to the EC in June staking their claim over the party symbol. The LJP is a recognised party in Bihar with the symbol, bungalow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-wont-get-formidable-candidates-for-bypolls-paras/articleshow/86735790.cms||Ramashankar

---||Business||Full-fledged revival of investment cycle may be few months away: Bank of Baroda||Bank of Baroda has been the first of the nationalised banks to have completed the amalgamation of two smaller banks with itself. The bank’s experiences in the merger have helped other consolidating public sector banks to draw their strategy. In an interview with TOI, MD & CEO Sanjiv Chadha speaks of the road ahead... How has the second quarter been in terms of business? There have been challenges in credit growth — the investment cycle in particular — for the last few years. Even today capacity utilisation is about 70% and it’s only when it moves up to 80% that you get a serious round of investments. We are seeing some investment in brownfield projects in companies that have gone through an ownership change. We are seeing large capacities in areas like renewable energy. We also have a large investment in electric vehicles. We are seeing progress in going beyond green shoots. For this to gather momentum and become a full-fledged revival of the investment cycle, we might be a few months away. On the asset quality side, do you see more clean-up happening? There has been a broad-based improvement in the corporate credit cycle, which we have seen for the last few quarters. Corporate slippage has had come down dramatically compared to what was the case in the previous quarters. Challenges in retail and MSME have got accentuated during the pandemic. Overall, in terms of credit quality for banks, I think we should see an improvement notwithstanding the challenges that we saw with the second wave. When do you expect RBI to start normalising its monetary policy? I think there are two pieces to the monetary policy stimulus. One has been in terms of rates and the other has been in terms of liquidity. So, you would expect that the liquidity piece will start getting normalised first. Change in the rate cycle is a few quarters ahead. The distortions in risk pricing due to liquidity surplus should get sorted and we should start seeing credit risk that way it would be in normal times. You have launched a new digital platform BoB world. What does this mean for customers? Covid has brought a broad and deep transformation and nearly twice the number of customers visiting the branch, now use the app. So rather than being an adjunct to the bank, it will be the bank and the other parts of the bank will become an adjunct. The thought was to enable everything that can be done in the branch within the app. Therefore, we got down to see what should be the design, branding and positioning of the app. BoB world will be the primary interface at the centre of the bank. What is the effort that has gone into the back-end? The bank has been making investments and was identified as the best technology bank of 2021 by the IBA. The integration (of Dena and Vijaya Bank) on a common platform after the merger gave us a robust base to build this strategy. How scalable is the core banking platform for digital? Today we 13 million customers using bob World which is a very robust platform and scalable. For the future cloud computing will be a very important element as this will help scale up not only in terms of users but also multiple fintech partners on the platform. Will bob World be a super app like SBI’s Yono and are you integrating the subsidiaries? The way the app is being positioned that you can save, borrow, invest and pay. All four capabilities are in the app and are being scaled up every day. In addition to the regular transaction, we are having things like airline ticket booking and comparison shopping across merchants to bring the cheapest proposition to the customers. The other important thing is the benefit programme which depends on the category you choose in terms of the balance you would like to maintain. How do you as a 100-year bank plan to attract millennials? The marketing campaign is squarely aimed at millennials. The design is something they will find appealing. They can open the account entirely online through video KYC and the account will have benefits including Amzon Prime. Will you be part of the account aggregator platform? It is a conversation that we are still having. But having a platform of this sort gives you a very powerful lever to make sure you can profit from certain engagements. Will BoB World be restricted to retail? We’re starting off with retail with about 95% of all retail services now available on mobile. The logical next step is to fashion it for other segments. On the corporate side are there any gaps in digital banking that you will fill? The primary banking channel for banks is mobile. Not too far ahead the mobile phone is likely to become an important piece particularly for MSME and that is what we will target next in Bob World. How do you plan to reach unbanked areas and push the financial inclusion agenda? It’s a matter of great pride for us that while we have a 6-7% share in banking. Our share in Jan Dhan Yojana is 15%. So one piece of service delivery will be digital but that may not be relevant to people who are on the other side of the digital divide. We have a very aggressive programme for increasing our business correspondent and increase their number from two for every branch to five BCs for every bank branch that we have. We want to double the BC outlets to 50,000. Would you be hiring people? The amalgamation has brought about efficiencies, but we have not shed people. Redeployment will help in filling marketing and other vacancies. We will continue to recruit specialists. For instance, we are now recruiting wealth relationship managers. We may also recruit for specific skills like digital banking. But there may not be much of an increase in the headcount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/full-fledged-revival-of-investment-cycle-may-be-few-months-away-bank-of-baroda/articleshow/86738691.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||Bihar: IIIT-Bhagalpur to prepare course material in Hindi||BHAGALPUR: The IIIT-Bhagalpur will prepare course materials in Hindi language for the engineering students from rural background with less exposure to English language. The step has been initiated following a survey of a section of students facing difficulties in technical institutions across the nation and subsequent recommendation by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and the Ministry of Education, Government of India, to introduce the course in Hindi language for at least one year in the higher educational institutions.  IIIT-Bhagalpur director Dr Prof Arvind Choubey said the faculty members and resources persons were preparing the course curriculum in Hindi language. “It’s a challenging task in view of the translation of technical words and explanations in Hindi. We are also trying to prepare online lessons in Hindi to help students,” he said. It may be mentioned here that the Delhi Hindi Sahitya Sammelan, in reference to Article 343 of the Constitution, had been advocating for introduction of study in Hindi language for at least one year in the higher educational institutions in the country and had petitioned to the PM in March 2021 in this regard. The PMO referred the issue to the Ministry of Education and after discussions with the experts and academics, a directive was issued on September 21, 2021 regarding mandatory introduction of courses in Hindi in higher educational institutions immediately.  Dr Prof Choubey, in reference, said that IIIT-Bhagalpur is perhaps first at country level to have initiated the steps to introduce Hindi at the technical institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/iiit-bgalpur-to-prepare-course-material-in-hindi/articleshow/86736373.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Covid-hit CA beats cytokine storms, lung ruptures||AHMEDABAD: Covid-19 pandemic saw many patients on recovery path suddenly collapsing and then some unbelievable turn arounds where patients came back from the brink. Case of Naman Maheshwari, a 26-year-old chartered accountant, might become a textbook case of what all can go horribly wrong with a corona patient and still he makes a miraculous recovery. Mahehswari has spent almost half a year in the hospital — 155 days to be precise till Sunday — and has lived to tell the tale. With sheer resilience and determination to live, the young professional from Rajasthan has beaten almost every known Covid-19 complication and has finally started walking and talking. He will be discharged and sent home soon. Maheshwari has survived not one but two cytokine storms, three punctures in his severely damaged lungs and even morbid secondary fungal and bacterial infections. He also got the highly debilitated viral infection Guillain-Barré syndrome. He has spent nearly four months in the ICU out of which he was hooked on to the ventilator for over three months. His mother Sunita recalls it all started with a simple body ache and fever. “After his grandmother, Naman tested positive on April 23. He became breathless and we had to admit him in a Udaipur hospital before things worsened and we rushed him to Ahmedabad,” says Sunita who has stayed put with her only son at Epic Hospital since April 28. Naman experienced a cytokine storm in the beginning of May and was administered Tocilizumab. Next month, he again suffered the dreaded inflammatory reaction – which has proved fatal for many – but recovered. “His is like a textbook case of what all can go wrong – he got multiple secondary infections including fungal and bacterial, got barotrauma or lung rupture three times and even underwent a laparoscopic procedure to remove part of a highly affected outer layer of his lung,” says Dr Ajay Jain, pulmonologist and critical care specialist at Epic Hospital. “By August, he also developed Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) where the immune system attacks the nervous system and makes muscles weak and numb.” In all, Naman spent nearly four months in ICU and over three months on a ventilator. Due to his condition, a tube was inserted from his throat to stomach to provide him with a liquid diet. He still needs oxygen, but now he can move around on his own, take his food orally and also talk for a limited time. The doctors credit his family as his rock-solid support system that made the difficult calls to agree for the medical procedures. “It has been an extremely painful and difficult journey. But from the start, I had convinced myself for a long haul in hospital. I didn’t count days or complain about my condition. I had faith in doctors and God. The episode has brought me much closer to my parents who are around since April, praying for my recovery,” says Naman. “I just have one message for all – don’t take Covid lightly. Don’t let your guard slip. If not Covid, there might be something else some years down the line. Follow hygiene rules and exercise restraint for some more time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-hit-ca-beats-cytokine-storms-lung-ruptures/articleshow/86736722.cms||Parth Shastri

The public sector lender is adopting a strategy similar to SBI, which is working to integrate all services on its Yono platform. Bank of Baroda MD & CEO Sanjiv Chadha told TOI that post-pandemic, the bank has seen a surge in digital transactions and twice the number of branch visits are happening on the app. “So rather than being an adjunct to the bank, it will be the bank and the other parts of the lender will become an adjunct.

In addition to regular transactions, we are having things like airline ticket booking and comparison shopping across merchants to bring the cheapest proposition to the customers,” said Chadha. The bank plans to extend use of the app from retail to businesses as well. For the financial inclusion and to reach out to people who do not have digital access, the bank is also doubling the number of business correspondents to 50,000. “It’s a matter of great pride for us that while we have a 6-7% share in banking. Our share in Jan Dhan Yojana is 15%. We have a very aggressive programme for increasing our business correspondent and increase their number from two for every branch to five BCs for every bank branch that we have,” said Chadha. The bank will however not be increasing its headcount as it has realised some efficiencies following the amalgamation of Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank, which will enable the lender to redeploy staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bank-of-baroda-bets-on-super-app/articleshow/86738324.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||New campus of Simultala school to be completed by February ’23||PATNA: The Simultala Awasiya Vidyalaya (SAV) in Jamui will get state-of-the-art facilities with new permanent campus. The residential school has been running on a makeshift campus since its inception in 2010. The state government has sanctioned around 31 acre land for the new campus. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, who visited the school, told this newspaper on Saturday that all the SAV teachers are on ad hoc basis and several posts are vacant. “By following the prescribed process, the department will appoint teachers on vacant posts. I felt progress was not the way it should have been since its establishment. Once the permanent campus is ready, the infrastructure problem will be resolved,” he said. “Despite limitations, the teachers have maintained its reputation and its students perform well in the Bihar board exams every year,” he said. Additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar, who also visited the school, said its permanent campus will be ready by February 2023 by utilising funds to the tune of Rs75 crore. “Classrooms, administrative block, academic section, laboratories, playground and hostels are under construction. The students said they also wanted a swimming pool and multipurpose gym, so it will also be incorporated in the construction work,” he said. “The campus has a few old buildings, including the one where Swami Vivekanand had spent 20 days in 1897, when he was ill. We have decided not to demolish that structure and slightly change the layout. That building will survive as it will be retrofitted and we will turn it into a modern building to convert into a museum in his honour,” Sanjay said. He said the state government has sent a proposal to the finance department for creation of posts in a regular manner. “As the SAV is a substitute to Netarhat Residential School, now in Jharkhand, and has been developed on the same lines. SAV is registered under the Society Registration Act, 1860. it has a governing council headed by the minister and the executive council headed by ACF education. We are also in the process of constituting the executive committee because the last nomination was made in 2015,” he said. “Teachers already working there want to be given the first chance for regular appointments while the students want adequate umber of quality teachers and food,” Sanjay said. The school first hit the headlines in 2015, when it produced 30 out of the 31 top-10 rank holders in Class X board exams. It runs classes from VI to XII. Every year, 120 children, including 60 girls, get admissions in Class VI by qualifying written examination conducted by the Bihar School Examination Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/new-campus-of-simultala-school-to-be-completed-by-february-23/articleshow/86735226.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Kolkata||After court ruling, transwoman civic volunteer looks forward to being a cop||Kolkata: The fight of a 28-year-old Kolkata Police civic police personnel, the first transperson in its civic police ranks, has paved the way for transpersons to apply as Kolkata Police officers. Pallabi Chakraborty, who has been trained to handle medical exigencies, now works out of the Kolkata Police Training Academy (KPTA) in Howrah’s Dumurjola. A Calcutta University graduate, Chakraborty will now approach the West Bengal Police Recruitment Board to introduce a third column in the gender category to allow transpersons to apply. Chakraborty, who worked with the Maidan police after her recruitment in February 2019, said, “When I applied for the civic volunteer post, I had downloaded the application form and submitted the hard copy. I had written transgender in the gender category and was recruited as the first transperson among civic volunteers in the Kolkata Police ranks. I wanted to apply for the Bengal police constable recruitment examinations too, but the online applications didn’t allow a third-gender option. It was the same for the Kolkata Police officers’ recruitment.” It was then that she decided to move Calcutta High Court. During the HC hearing, state counsel Sutapa Sanyal told the court that the Bengal government will allow transpersons to appear for the Kolkata Police officers’ examinations. Chakraborty said there are other aspects to her ongoing fight to gain recognition for transpersons in police ranks. “For instance, my official ID card also needs a column to allow me to apply as a transwoman. In Maidan police station, I worked as a woman civic volunteer. The second instance would be the police barracks, which are either for men or women. Now I stay in the women’s wing. My colleagues and seniors are extremely accommodative and supportive, but these things need to be factored in for the long-term changes,” she said. “If you look at the Supreme Court’s 2014 NALSA judgement, and the 2019 Transgender Rights Act, it asks that transgenders be extended the rights like other backward classes. OBCs have an age relaxation criterion. This needs to be extended to transgenders too,” Chakraborty said. “It isn’t important whether I finally get to appear for the Kolkata Police officers’ examinations. But if others are allowed to take it, this is an encouraging beginning. I have read that Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Odisha and Rajasthan are also trying to recruit transpersons in their police ranks,” Chakraborty added. TOI had in 2018 reported how Chakraborty had broken social taboo while driving in the city as a transgender chauffeur. In 2019, she appeared for the civic volunteers’ examination. According to her HC affidavit, Chakraborty was born male. She realised she suffered from gender dysphoria and declared her name and gender as a transwoman before an Alipore court in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-court-ruling-transwoman-civic-volunteer-looks-forward-to-being-a-cop/articleshow/86737371.cms||Saibal Sen

Party state president Somu Veerraju on Sunday said BJP has taken the Badvel by-election as a prestige issue and party cadre should be ready to face the battle. The decision is significant in the wake of the BJP’s alliance partner Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan’s decision not to enter the fray. Pawan said they would neither field nor back anyone in Badvel election in view of YSRC’s decision to field the wife of the deceased legislator. The BJP lost its deposits in the Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election when it had the backing of Jana Sena. BJP central leadership is believed to have advised the state unit to contest the election notwithstanding the result and votes polled. — Samdani MN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/bjp-to-enter-fray-for-badvel-bypoll/articleshow/86737397.cms||Samdani MN
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: No luring voters with freebies, warns YSRC||AMARAVATI: In a welcome move, the ruling YSRC has directed its leaders and cadre to not distribute cash or gifts to the electorate ahead of and during the Badvel by-election. The party leadership is said to have made it clear that no financial assistance will be extended from the party to lure the voters. The party leadership added that they won the recent Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election without going for distribution of cash or gifts and the same should be followed in Badvel. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, during a strategy meeting with senior ministers and legislators of Kadapa district, had observed that taking the welfare schemes being implemented by the government to the public is sufficient to garner the support of voters. He, however, instructed the senior leaders not to be over-confident in handling the elections. He asked the party legislators to ensure that party cadre knock at the doors of voters in the constituency at least thrice before the campaign ends. Jagan also told the leaders to explain to each and every voter during the campaign the welfare schemes that were launched after their government came to power. Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy, party strategy group head and minister in-charge for elections, held a closed door meeting with legislators and other ministers to chalk out the action plan. State government advisor and party general secretary, Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, is believed to have shared the views of the chief minister. He said there would be no question of pumping funds for the sake of the by-election. “We need to focus on bringing as many beneficiaries of our welfare schemes as possible to the polling booth. That will do the rest,” Sajjala is reported to have said. Meanwhile, the party is likely to intensify its campaign after the filing of nomination by the party candidate, Dr Dasari Sudha, on October 7. All the key leaders drafted for the by-poll duties have reached Kadapa and started moving into the mandals assigned to them. Chandragiri legislator and government whip Chevireddy Bhaskara Reddy has been deputed to Gopavaram mandal, which the party lost in the recent ZPTC elections. He is reported to have discussed with the local leaders the reasons for the defeat of the party nominee in the ZPTC elections. Sources said Chevireddy found internal groupism in the mandal as the reason for the defeat of the party nominee. He held discussions with local leaders and asked them not to repeat the mistakes. He made it clear that anti-party activities will not be tolerated. Chevireddy has also readied a list of leaders with specific tasks and has told local leaders he would visit all villages in the mandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/no-luring-voters-with-freebies-warns-ysrc/articleshow/86737343.cms||Samdani MN
---||Business||RBI’s disputed circular cut delinquency: Study||Mumbai: An internal study by the central bank has revealed that borrower delinquency reduced after the RBI’s February 12, 2018 circular requiring banks to initiate insolvency within six months of default but deteriorated after the circular was struck down by the Supreme Court in April 2019. The study was highlighted in an article by RBI executive director Saurav Sinha, which is part of an e-book published by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India. The article said that insolvency should not be the last resort, comparing a stressed asset to an ice cube with any delay in resolution melting away value. The article has said that a disquieting aspect for the RBI is the time taken for commencement of resolution from the time of filing application. In the article ‘IBC — A banking regulator’s perspective’, Sinha has pointed out that the study showed that notification of IBC alone did not result in any material change in behaviour of borrowers. The article notes that the most positive impact on the credit culture was by the erstwhile February 12 circular, which resulted in increases in curing of defaults. The upgrades in the SMA-1 (special mention accounts or loans that are in default but not yet NPAs) improved to 18.6% from 5.8% before the circular. Interestingly, the upgrades came down significantly after the Supreme Court declared that the erstwhile February 12 circular was ultra vires to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 even though it recovered after the RBI issued rules incentivising early initiation of IBC. Sinha has said that for the impact of IBC to be felt, the RBI needs to leverage the bankruptcy code in its resolution framework. While some commentators see bankruptcy as an extreme step, the article has said this is not the case. “It is a disconcerting notion that IBC is seen as a last resort of resolution by many stakeholders including various banks — something that has to be thought about only after all other avenues have been extinguished. The RBI believes in the well-used analogy of a stressed borrower being similar to an ice cube taken out of the refrigerator — the longer it remains unprotected, the more ice melts into water and is lost,” the article said. The article concludes with the expectation that the recently-introduced pre-packaged insolvency resolution process for small business is extended to all borrowers and is used in difficult resolution involving non-cooperative lenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbis-disputed-circular-cut-delinquency-study/articleshow/86738205.cms||Mayur Shetty

Arjun got nervous on sighting a police patrol car and fell down from the same sports bike (carrying forged registration number) at Ambedkar Chowk under Patrakar Nagar police station area while trying to escape on Sunday evening. Police helped Arjun assuming that he might have been hurt. But he started sweating when police asked him to show the bike’s papers. Patrakar Nagar police station SHO Manoranjan Bharti said Arjun lived with cousin Ashish Yadav (26) in Patna. “Ashish had lodged an FIR for theft of the white sports bike (BR-38V-4141). An insurance claim was made. Arjun told police that they were about to receive Rs2.6 lakh insurance money within a fortnight,” he said. The SHO said the bike was registered in the name of Jayesh, who is a medical student in Nepal. Quoting Arjun, he said the insurance money was to go to Jayesh’s bank account. “Jayesh’s role is under suspicion. Arjun has been arrested. Ashish is traceless. All are natives of Narpatganj in Araria. Both are unemployed. The duo had brought the bike to Patna six months back,” Bharti said. Arjun knew a trader, Mukul Ranjan, in Forbesganj having the same sports bike. “They started using Mukul’s bike registration number after changing the colour to black from white. However, the engine and chassis numbers remained the same,” he said. The SHO said Arjun initially misguided the police saying the bike belonged to Mukul. “Mukul was contacted through Araria police. He showed us his bike at home through a video call. After that Arjun confessed that they had lodged a fake FIR of theft to claim the insurance money,” he said. Bharti said investigation was on to ascertain if they were part of a major insurance racket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/one-arrested-with-stolen-bike-before-getting-insurance-money/articleshow/86736205.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Prasad, the BJP MP from Patna Sahib, suggested AAI-Patna to study the technical feasibility and other requirements for the extension of Patna airport runway in coordination with the district administration. During the meeting of the Airport Advisory Committee (AAC), Prasad advised the DM to study the various options for extension of runway to meet future requirements of the airport. “Explore the possibility of extending Patna metro rail connectivity up to the city airport,” he said. The MP was briefed about the changes brought out in the existing terminal building and ongoing infrastructure development works. He appreciated the efforts of AAI-Patna and advised all the stakeholders to cooperate in making the airport passenger-friendly. Prasad, who is also the chairman of AAC of city airport, discussed the drainage issues and traffic flow outside the airport premises with the officials. Land acquisition for extension of runway of Bihta airport and its development plans were also discussed. Apart from the DM, airport director Bhupesh C H Negi, senior officials of AAI-Patna, Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma and traffic SP D Amarkesh attended the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/acquire-land-for-taxi-track-at-patna-airport/articleshow/86735500.cms||Faryal Rumi

Cadet Ashutosh Kumar of Nalanda Sainik School was adjudged the best speaker. Nalanda DDC Vaibhav Srivastava, who was the chief guest, thanked the school management for organising such a useful programme.

---||Patna||JD(U) takes a jibe at Tej Pratap over ‘Lalu in captivity’ remarks||PATNA: The feud in Lalu Prasad’s family is growing as the RJD chief’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav on Saturday alleged that his father was held “hostage” in Delhi. While addressing an event of the Chhatra Janshakti Parishad in Patna, Tej Pratap said, “Despite getting bail months ago, my father is still being held hostage in Delhi.” Tej also alleged that some people in the party are “dreaming of becoming the RJD’s national president.” The comment is being considered as the reference to his younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and sister Misa Bharti. Lalu is recuperating at the residence of Misa, a Rajya Sabha member. Reacting to his elder brother’s remarks, leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi, on Sunday said the “captivity” allegations do not match with his father’s personality. “Lalu Ji served as Bihar CM and the railway minister. He was also behind having two prime ministers in the country. He also got Lal Krishna Advani arrested. Therefore, the allegations levelled that he was being held “hostage” do not match with his personality,” Tejashwi said. Taking a jibe at Tej’s statement, JD(U) spokesperson and MLC Neeraj Kumar said though it is an internal matter of Lalu’s family and his party, “the law is ready to help Tej Pratap if he seeks any assistance in the matter”. Neeraj said the JD(U) has ideological and political differences with Lalu, “but it is unacceptable if someone holds him hostage”. The JD(U) leader said CM Nitish Kumar has already passed the Bihar Maintenance and Welfare of Parents & Senior Citizens Rules to provide financial security, welfare, security of life, alimony and protection to senior citizens in the state. Under the rules, one has to make an application before the sub-divisional officer. Tej Pratap feels sidelined in the RJD and has vented his ire on several occasions earlier. He formed the parishad a few weeks back after his differences with RJD state president Jagadanand Singh over removal of Akash Yadav as the Chhatra RJD state president. “Recently, I spoke to my father and requested him to stay with me in Patna and look after the organizational works of the party. When my father lived in Patna, the main gate of our residence used to be open and he met the common people in the outhouse … My father is unwell. There are four to five people in the party who are dreaming of becoming RJD’s national president. Do not need to name them as it is known to everyone. He (Lalu) was released nearly a year ago from jail but is still being held hostage,” Tej Pratap said at the Parishad event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-takes-a-jibe-at-tej-pratap-over-lalu-in-captivity-remarks/articleshow/86735755.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Kolkata||Thunderstorm, rain lash city pockets||Kolkata: A thunderstorm with frequent lightning strikes hit Kolkata on Sunday afternoon, leaving parts of the city drenched. A brief spell of rain, triggered by the thunderstorm, swept through south Kolkata while the central and northern parts of the city received light rain. There could be more thunderstorms in Kolkata and south Bengal on Monday, but the weather may remain relatively dry subsequently, said the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). A low-pressure trough extending from Bihar to Odisha has been supplying moisture to the region. “Over the last two days, Kolkata has remained dry and warm, and this heating pulled in moisture from the trough. This triggered the thunderstorm in Kolkata and other districts of south Bengal. It will continue till the system remains active. We expect it to move away by Tuesday,” said RMC director G K Das. Kolkata received almost double the normal volume of rain — 96% more — in September and Gangetic Bengal recorded 31% excess rain so far this monsoon, from June 1 to September 30. While Kolkata’s overall rain count this monsoon has been 31% above normal, Bengal received 15% excess rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/thunderstorm-rain-lash-city-pockets/articleshow/86737296.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

All that may soon become history as the next-gen compact models under development vie for top-of-the-line AI driven driver assist and connected car features that are currently available in the soon-to-launch premium SUVs like the MG Astor and Mahindra XUV700. These SUV-type features include AI-driven programs like driver drowsiness assist, camera and sensor-assisted lane driving, personalised cockpits, connectivity through smartphones and smartwatches for a bouquet of entertainment and information features. According to tier-1 drivetrain and component major Bosch, these features have now attracted the interest of the mass market small car companies that are developing their next generation models as well. “There are enquiries in the B-segment space and there are concepts being worked on as companies try to match the aspiration for ride experience with the willingness to pay for features like this. The head start in the market has been in the UV1 and UV3 segment (SUVs priced under Rs 15 lakh) where we are seeing clear traction so they are the pilots for these technologies,” said Sandeep N, executive director & head of sales-mobility solutions, Bosch Ltd. Auto industry sources said Suzuki and Toyota’s next geneartion under development models are among those looking at features like these. “The technology will see rapid proliferation because it has become very cheap so in the next generation of compact models many of these features will be added on. Already these features have become quite common in compact cars in Europe,” said automotive expert Hormazd Sorabjee. Industry insiders say the proliferation of these new-age features will go from B-segment compact SUVs down to the more mass market hatchback cars. “OEMs are already offering some connected features through mobile phone apps like locking-unlocking, light beam and horn adjustment, geo and time zoning etc. These features are now on offer in B-segment sub-4 metre SUVs like Nissan Magnite, Hyundai Venue or Tata Nexon but the penetration of ADAS features like advanced lane assist or driver monitoring are still low. Indian customers value connected features more,” said Ravi Bhatia, president JATO Dynamics. According to Bhatia, the features currently being adopted include adaptive cruise control, automatic parking, automotive head-up display, blind spot monitor, driver monitoring system, forward collision warning, lane centering and lane change assistance, automatic emergency braking and brake assist system and traffic sign recognition systems. “So far only XUV700 and Astor qualify for Autonomous Level-2 features but sub-Rs 20 lakh cars like the Kia Seltos already offer driver assist features like the overtaking sensor,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/compact-cars-to-get-fancy-with-ai-features/articleshow/86736577.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

On the first day, the team has chosen 18 pandals on the first day that are located either close to busy crossings or are visible right from the road. A few of them - including one in Behala -- had last year struggled to cope with the rush. The team will be led by Joint CP (Headquarter) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar. The cops plan to start their inspections from Bosepukur Sitala Mandir at Kasba before visiting Ekdalia and Bqabubagan. While Deshapriya park will be a major stop, Badamtala Ashar Sangha at Rashbehari and three pujas at Haridevpur will also be inspected by noon. The senior officers will then travel to Behala and visit Barisha Club and Natun Dal before stopping over at Suruchi Sangha. The second half will see inspections at Mohd Ali Park, Santosh Mitra Square and College Square in central Kolkata before heading to Kumartuli Park in north Kolkata. On Sunday, the local OC and the traffic guard OCs met the organizers of these 18 pandals - especially those in Behala and south Kolkata -and asked the organizers to share their plans. Police sources said that while several pujas - mostly the middle budgets and smaller ones - are reducing the sizes of their pandals. However, for a few the cops suggested a wider entrance to ensure that the idol is visible from a distance and the holding area in the barricaded zone does not become too crowded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dwaipayan-puja-inspection/articleshow/86737478.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Earlier, TDP had announced Dr Obulapuram Rajasekhar as its candidate. TDP president Chandrababu Naidu held several rounds of discussions with state leaders and Kadapa district unit leaders before finalising the candidate. The TDP decision came a day after Jana Sena decided not to contest the by-election. TDP state president K Atchannaidu told the media that the politburo decided to honour the tradition of not fielding candidates against the kin of deceased sitting legislators. “This tradition was started by TDP and it will continue the practice in Badvel. Since YSRC has decided to field sitting Dalit legislator Dr Venkata Subbaiah’s wife following the death of Dr Subbaiah, TDP will not contest the election,” said Atchannaidu. Previously, YSRC had not fielded its candidate in Nandigama by-election held after the death of TDP legislator Tangirala Prabhakara Rao soon after the 2014 election. Prabhakar’s daughter Sowmya got unanimously elected in the by-election. Similarly, TDP reciprocated the move by not fielding its candidate in Allagadda assembly by-election caused by the death of YSRC candidate Bhuma Sobha Nagireddy. Sobha died in a road accident soon after the election but emerged victorious posthumous.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/tdp-not-to-contest-badvel-by-election/articleshow/86737485.cms||Samdani MN

The pandemic has left many families impoverished due to job losses and reduced income, and students from these families are finding it difficult to not only purchase devices, like an Android handset, to attend classes, but are also unable to afford high-speed internet. Last year, alumni and teachers of Jadavpur University and Sidho-Kanho-Birsha University in Purulia had raised funds to help needy students of the previous batch bridge the digital divide. “The students come from different backgrounds and varying economic conditions. We can’t expect every student to have a separate room where he or she can attend classes without disturbance. There are issues of network availability, stability of power and access to dev-ices. We have to recognize the challenges that students face,” said teacher and counsellor Jonaki Mukherjee. Digital hurdles are primarily affecting those students who live in remote areas, in the districts. Sabang resident Snehansu Dutta, a final-year student of Maulana Azad College, is facing data issues almost every day during his classes. “I can’t switch on the video as it leads to buffering and even the voice breaks. Most of the classes are scheduled at noon, when network coverage is poor. I’ve shared these issues with my teachers,” he said. Then, there are others who don’t switch on the video due to a different reason. Subrata Khatua, another final-year student of Maulana Azad College whose father is a driver, keeps the video off during class because there is no separate room at home where he can attend his lessons without disturbance. “My mother has to do her daily household chores and it is embarrassing if she walks around when the video mode is on,” he said. Bethune College principal Krishna Roy said, “It is natural for some students to feel shy and hesitant about video lest their humble homes are viewed by others. Usually, we get extremely meritorious and talented students from low-income groups. Our teachers have noticed that, in the live classes, many of them don’t want to switch on the video as they don’t have a proper backdrop.” What is encouraging though is that most college students are regularly attending online classes now. Principals and teachers concur that the rate of acceptance of the new system of learning has increased. College authorities in remote areas have also made arrangements to distribute study material among students who don’t have access to the required gadgets. Pradipta Mukherjee, assistant professor at Hiralal Mazumdar Memorial College for Women, said, “We had noticed a tendency among students to switch off the video and to chat. So, we instructed them to keep their audio and video modes off during classes.” He said that study materials were the only way to reach out to students in every corner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-face-old-e-class-issues-in-new-academic-yr/articleshow/86737262.cms||Poulami Mukherjee

---||Business||RBI may absorb some surplus cash||MUMBAI: The RBI is expected to follow a divergent strategy when it comes to interest rates, which are at a historic low and dealing with the Rs 10 lakh crore of surplus liquidity sloshing in the banking system. In response to the pandemic, the central bank had reduced the (repo) rate at which it lends to banks to a low of 4% and also flooded banks with funds to ensure that they kept lending. Now with macroeconomic indicators improving the central bank may like to have a better grip on liquidity even as it continues to keep rates low and reassure markets that there will be no shortage of funds. Banks are unanimous in their view that the central bank will adopt a status quo policy and continue to hold the repo rate at 4%. It is also widely expected that the central bank will continue to maintain an accommodative stance. However, many are now veering to the view that the central bank may absorb some of the surplus liquidity floating around to begin normalisation of the pandemic stimulus. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during October 6-8, 2021. Incidentally, in the previous policy, MPC member Jayanth Varma had said that the reverse repo rate at 3.35% was too low and he was not in favour of it. Last week, the RBI surprised markets by fixing the seven-day reverse repo cut off at 3.99%, which was higher than expected and very close to the policy rate of 4%. The move by RBI has prompted Citi to forecast that the central bank will hike its reverse repo rate next week (rate at which the RBI borrows from commercial banks). If it does so, the RBI will be the first central bank to signal rollback of the emergency measures during Covid. According to Bank of Baroda MD & CEO Sanjiv Chadha, there are two parts to the monetary policy stimulus — rates and liquidity. “You would expect that the liquidity piece will start getting normalised first. Change in the rate cycle is a few quarters ahead. The distortions in risk pricing due to liquidity surplus should get sorted and we should start seeing credit risk that way it would be in normal times,” said Chadha. What this means is that a reduction in liquidity will not make any change to the top-rated borrowers. It is also unlikely that any lender would touch home loan rates, which are seen as the safest loans. However, the gap between what the top-rated borrowers and the lesser rated ones pay may widen. For retail borrowers, the good news is that banks have actually reduced rates last week in a bid to grow market share when home buying picks up during the festive period. The reason why lenders are keen on growth is that the corporate investment cycle is yet to pick up. “Even today, capacity utilisation is about 70% and it’s only when it moves up to 80% that you get a serious round of investments. We are seeing progress in going beyond green shoots. For this to gather momentum and become a full-fledged revival of the investment cycle we might be a few months away,” said Chadha. He added that investment was being seen in brownfield projects and in companies that have gone through an ownership change. There was also some fresh capacity in renewable energy and electric vehicles. “We expect the RBI to acknowledge the favourable macro developments by increasing its growth forecasts, and slashing inflation projections. Still, the MPC is expected to keep policy rates steady, though it could signal a ‘live’ December policy meeting,” said Barclays Bank economist Rahul Bajoria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-may-absorb-some-surplus-cash/articleshow/86738157.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||People suffered due to poor healthcare facilities: Tejashwi Yadav||PATNA: RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Sunday slammed the state government for its failure to provide medical facilities to the people during the second wave of the Covid pandemic earlier this year. Speaking at a programme, ‘Doctors’ dialogue with Tejashwi’, organised at the RJD office, Tejashwi alleged that even beds were not available in government hospitals during the pandemic. Referring to the recent Niti Aayog report, the leader of the opposition in the state assembly said that it exposed the hollow claims of the government about healthcare and medical facilities in Bihar. “Though the government had one year to prepare for the second wave, it did precious little to cope with the situation,” he added. Taking a swipe at the government’s callousness towards appointment of doctors and paramedical staff, he said there were vacancies, but no appointments were made. As a result, people had to suffer a lot, he alleged. The former deputy CM, however, lauded the efforts of the medical cell of RJD for its initiatives to help the Covid victims. “Hamne satta mein nahi rahne ke babjood abhutpurv karya kiye (We did exceptional work despite not being in power),” he told the gathering. In response to a dentist’s query, Tejashwi said, “Let us sit on a dharna to draw the government’s attention. Scores of people are suffering from toothache and other related problems due to supply of unfiltered and contaminated water through municipal taps.” Another doctor raised the issue of non-appointment of veterinary doctors in the state since 2017. Tejashwi replied, “Chaliye humlog saath saath lathi khaten hai (Let us receive lathi blows together).” Tejashwi said he was not interested in ‘ghisi-piti’ talks. “We have ‘mass capital’. The party now needs to have ‘brain capital’,” the Raghopur MLA said. He claimed that the RJD promoted youths and women in the party. “We fielded youths and women in the state assembly election held last year. The RJD list of candidates contained the names of doctors and professors as well, he added. Tejashwi reiterated the demand of caste-based census in the country in the larger interest of the people belonging to lower strata of the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejas-people-suffered-due-to-poor-healthcare-facilities/articleshow/86735806.cms||Ramashankar

Last year, when local train services remained suspended for seven months, the total deaths on tracks reported by the Sealdah Government Railway Police (GRP) division was 490. This year — when local train services were shut in May are yet to resume — the number has gone up to 562 till August. In contrast, Howrah GRP that reported 543 deaths in 2020 have recorded 539 deaths till August this year. That is an achievement given Howrah GRP logged a record 1,194 unnatural death cases in 2016. Bengal has witnessed 15,733 unnatural death cases between 2016 and August 2021. The highest contributors have been Sealdah and Howrah GRP zones with both contributing 5,460 and 5,440 cases respectively. Bengal had brought down crime within the railway police zones. Data reveals, from 2,046 crimes in 2016 to 1,613 crimes in 2019 and barely 695 in 2020-21, efforts made by GRP and RPF to bring down deaths on tracks has not achieved the desired rate of success. An overall analysis of data shows that Howrah has been steadily reducing the number of unnatural deaths. In 2018 there were 1,074 deaths here. In 2019 there were 14 less cases and the numbers this year are now likely to be slightly higher than last year. In comparison, Sealdah logged 1,123 cases in 2016, 1,071 cases in 2018 and 1,114 cases in 2019. “Sealdah GRP has a thicker population to cover and runs through the greater part of the city. Naturally, trespassing is higher,”explained a GRP officer. Special drives by both Indian Railways and the GRP seem to have failed to reduce the loss of life. “Eastern Railway makes periodic announcements and carries advertisements against clicking selfies on tracks. We use posters on platforms, distribute of pamphlets and stage plays to spread awareness,”a senior officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/first-8-months-of-2021-log-more-railway-deaths-than-in-2020/articleshow/86737553.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||After the ’84 riots, Sikhs faced pressure to move on, says author||There is a constant cycle of sectarian violence in human history and the only hope of ending it is by embracing each other’s pain,” says Sarbpreet Singh, author of the critically acclaimed Night of the Restless Spirits.Singh was speaking in the context of a discussion on ‘Revisiting horrors of 1984 Pogrom’ with authors Arjun Raj Gaind and Radhika Oberoi at the Times LitFest on Sunday. However violence unacknowledged also perpetuates itself and the fact that the 1984 pogrom remained largely absent from public memory for a long time has been accepted over the years. Singh attributed this to a complex issue within the community which was compelled by a sense of pain, shame and guilt to bury the horrors. There was also a pressure to move on which, he says, was done systematically by those in power that prevented any catharsis for the community.The pogrom also attacked the Sikh identity in a very physical way, Oberoi said, recounting instances where physical symbols like long hair were targeted. Amongst the most common attacks were turbans being removed and hair hacked or set on fire. Gaind — whose book The Anatomy of Scars is based on personal memory and recollections around the events of 1984— said that the beard in his book is a metaphor for how the world perceives identity and to tackle the great hypocrisy of being open—minded and close-minded at the same time.To watch live, visit www.timeslitfest.com||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-the-84-riots-sikhs-faced-pressure-to-move-on-says-author/articleshow/86737487.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Over 91% of the population has been inoculated with the first dose. Of the 27.9 lakh eligible population, 25.47 lakh had received the first dose.Coimbatore collector G S Sameeran has urged people who are due for their second dose to come forward to take the vaccine and get fully protected against Covid-19.Like last week, the number of people who took their second dose outnumbered those who took their first dose. Out of the total 81,454 people inoculated on Sunday, 49,583 got their second dose and 31,871 their first dose.The vaccination drive started with 1.5 lakh doses at 558 places. However, the response remained lukewarm right from the beginning of the day.“Possibility of rain and extended weekend were termed as one of the major reasons for less turnover,” said C G S Manian, organiser of Namma Kovai, who was coordinating the inoculation driver at VOC Park. “As colleges are reopening for first year students, families could be on tour,” he said.There were roughly two lakh eligible people for the second dose in the beginning of the day, but only a few of them turned up at the camps.Deputy director of health services P Aruna said adequate measures were taken to remind people on vaccination camps. “Panchayats also made arrangements to create awareness. Though there was a decline in the number of people, we are hopeful of covering them in the coming days,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/32-of-population-administered-second-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine/articleshow/86739808.cms||---

A Pollachi-based poultry feed production unit had booked the consignment.Seventy workers were involved in unloading, which went on till Saturday afternoon. The train left Pollachi goods shed at 4.45pm and arrived at Podanur station at 6.30pm on Saturday. Electrification enabled the goods train to reach Pollachi without engine change at Podanur, the official said. “This saved valuable time and reduced the occupation of path by the goods train for change of electric engine to diesel engine on the busy Coimbatore route. This also optimized use of crew. Earlier, crew change was required from electric to diesel engine.”The train was operated within 10 days after senior railway officials inspected the electrification work on the 43km single line section and deemed it fit for passenger and freight services. The section was approved by the commissioner of railway safety in Bengaluru for freight and passenger train operation in the last week of September.Rail users have urged authorities to resume passenger service in the section. “We expect resumption of passenger train service on the route at the earliest as freight service has resumed,” said B Mohan Raj, secretary of Pollachi Train Passengers Welfare Association. “While only a few passenger train services were resumed after gauge conversion, electrification of the section took more time, making passengers to rely on road transport.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/freight-train-service-resumes-in-podanurpollachi-section/articleshow/86739791.cms||---

Pathak alleged in a statement that while the Prime Minister has given ‘call after call’ to clean cities, the Delhi unit of his own party has completely failed in the field of cleanliness. He said that he was listening to the PM, who has given a message to promote cleanliness and launched a campaign, saying that there are mountains of garbage in cities, which need to be cleaned. Pathak said that in the city where the PM lives, the municipal corporations have been ruled by the BJP for the past 15 years and their main job is to keep the country’s capital clean. He said that there are three huge mountains of garbage in Ghazipur, Bhalswa and Okhla. “Prime Minister, the BJP sitting in the municipal corporation of Delhi for the last 15 years is pretending to clean these mountains of garbage. The report of 2020 says that the corporation is not able to process as much garbage as it has coming in,” he said. Meanwhile, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that sanitation workers of all three civic bodies of Delhi are working hard to keep the city as clean as possible, but AAP leaders have been constantly insulting their hard work by calling Delhi a dirty city. Kapoor said that the height of both Bhalswa and Ghazipur sites have been reduced by the civic bodies and had Delhi government provided special funds for the work, the garbage dumps might have further depleted. He also alleged that the Delhi government repeatedly withholds municipal funds. The AAP government has, on earlier occasions, refuted allegations of withholding municipal funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-making-capital-filthy-alleges-aap/articleshow/86737465.cms||---

Taiwan, a democratically governed island that is claimed by China, has complained for more than a year of repeated missions near it by China’s air force, often in the southwestern part of its air defence zone close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands. On Friday, Saturday and again on Sunday, Taiwan's defence ministry reported that China’s air force had sent aircraft into the zone, with 39 on Saturday alone, the highest reported number to date. “The US is very concerned by the People’s Republic of China’s provocative military activity near Taiwan, which is destabilising, risks miscalculations, and undermines regional peace and stability,” state department spokesman Ned Price said. The US has an abiding interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and will continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a “sufficient self-defence capability,” he said. Taiwan’s foreign ministry said China was increasing tension in the Indo-Pacific region. China has yet to comment on its activities, and it is not clear what may have caused Beijing to decide to mount the missions, though Friday was the country’s National Day, a patriotic holiday that marks the founding of the People's Republic. It has previously said such flights were to protect the country’s sovereignty and aimed against “collusion” between Taiwan and the US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/us-raises-concerns-after-china-flies-100-warplanes-over-taiwan-in-3-days/articleshow/86742376.cms||---

Ananda - who was initially admitted at a Park circus nursing Home - was transferred to SSKM Hospital when his condition had worsened. Since then, Ananda has been fighting for his life. Ananda works in the Japanese cousulate. The incident was reported around 5.45 am even as one of the victims had got up early in the morning to charge his mobile phone in a socket located right next to the kitchen. The Family members and friends have said that they have not broken the news of Ananda's death to either Kiran or Shivam so far. "They are admitted to the woodburn ward of SSKM. Their recovery might be hindered if they listen to such news,"said one of them. The forensic experts said this was the fourth such gas cylinder related explosion in the city the past year and have appealed to all households to check diligently if the gas pipe has leakages. They have also asked households to change gas pipes according to norms. "A vapour cloud explosion occurs when a sufficient amount of flammable material is released, mixes with air, and is ignited. This is avoidable if proper measures are taken," said an expert. “Any little spark or ignition is enough for the cloud to burst. The expansion of this vapour happens horizontally. That is exactly what happened in this case. The blast did not affect the ceiling at all but blew away the walls," he added. Vapours were formed due to leakage in gas, which exploded as the house occupant plugged the charger of the mobile," said joint CP (Crime) Murlidhar Sharma, quoting FSL sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dwaipayan-death/articleshow/86737563.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

About 110km from Coimbatore city, Valparai is a hill station in the Anamalai hills known for tourist spots and tea estates. Besides the natives of Valparai, people from north India are residing there. They have to come all the way to Coimbatore or Pollachi railway station to book a train, the MP said. “Many of the guest workers, who are not familiar with online booking, travel for a day to book train tickets. As there is no rail connectivity in Valparai, people have to come to Pollachi or Coimbatore railway stations to board trains,” he said. The demand for a railway ticket booking counter is over a decade-old and the Southern Railway must consider the request, which will benefit a large population, Sundaram added.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pollachi-mp-seeks-railway-booking-counter-in-valparai/articleshow/86739859.cms||---

---||Varanasi||Mafia had a free run in previous govts: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||Gorakhpur: Launching a blistering attack on Samajwadi Party, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said land mafia enjoyed a free run during the previous government and were trained in grabbing public land. Addressing a gathering after inaugurating and laying foundation of 300 development projects worth Rs 524.07 crore in Siddharthnagar district on Sunday, the CM said, “Land mafia had encroached public land during previous governments but after coming to power in 2017, we freed more than 64,000 hectares of land encroached by land mafia across the state. Our government did not hesitate in bulldozing the mansions built illegally by the mafia forcefully on the encroached land of the poor.” The CM’s remark comes in the backdrop of the government’s recent action against land encroached by mafia dons Mukhtar Ansari and Atiq Ahmad. The Ram temple is getting constructed in Ayodhya and neither the SP government which had ordered firing on Ram Bhakts nor the Congress party would have done this. Recalling an incident, Yogi said that 17 years ago, a Divyang girl was murdered in Siddharthnagar but the deaf and dumb government at that time was not listening to the cries of people. “I had come to Siddharthnagar to fight for the right to justice of the Divyang girl. Those who used to suppress the voice of the people were later given a befitting reply by the public of Uttar Pradesh,” he added. Enumerating the development work, welfare projects and achievements of the state government, CM Yogi said, “Since after independence, no government thought of constructing a medical college in this district. The medical college in Siddharthnagar will start admission of students in this session. People are getting free ration and farmers are getting 1.5 times MSP of their produce. We waived the loans of farmers after coming to power. People are now getting a proper power supply.” “The work of the government is to ensure public welfare. Now, the poor are getting benefits of welfare schemes and those who try to usurp them will go to jail. We believe in the slogan ‘Sabka saath sabka Vikas, given by PM Modi ji,” he said. The chief minister said he often wonders what would have happened to migrant workers and the poor if Covid-19 pandemic had struck during the SP, BSP or Congress regime. “Our government provided free ration, health kits and also gave ration cards to those who did not have them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/land-mafia-had-a-free-run-during-previous-govts-cm/articleshow/86736726.cms||Arjumand Bano

Cops from Gandhidham A Division police station said that they had received a telephonic complaint from a citizen that a garba program has been organized at Nexus club in Gandhidham. Based on the complaint, police went to check at the club and found that several people had gathered at the club for the program. Police said that all Covid-19 guidelines were violated as many people had not worn masks and no social distancing was maintained. Since the club’s manager Deepti Asher and the organizer of the program Sagar Kanani had not obtained any permission for the program, an offence of violation of public notification was registered against them. The duo was arrested on Sunday.

---||Delhi||Crowd thins at Delhi's Ghazipur site, but protesters say they will stay||NEW DELHI: Ghazipur border, which had witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of farmers camping there over the past few months to protest against the three agri laws, looked uneventful on Sunday with merely 70 protesters being in sight there. While some farmers did not seem pleased with being denied permission by Supreme Court to protest at Jantar Mantar, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders said none of the 478 protesting groups under them had moved the court with any such plea. Dharminder Mukerian, SKM leader and general secretary of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Youth Federation, said, “Nobody from the Morcha made a plea in Supreme Court to hold protests at Jantar Mantar.” Amriq Singh, a protester at Ghazipur border, said, “We have endured winter and left our families behind at home to protest on the roads at Delhi’s borders. Nearly 600 farmers have sacrificed their lives. It’s not out of choice. We are fighting for our children’s future and the entire India’s. We have blocked only one carriageway of NH-9. Why is the court blaming us for troubling people by causing traffic snarls? We had left space on both sides for people to commute easily.” “The protest will continue. We are sitting at the borders because we have not been allowed to enter Delhi. Police have sprayed farmers with water cannons. After the government heeds our demand to recall the three farm laws, we will also leave. Why is nobody asking the bigger questions? Farmers represent the entire country,” added Amriq. Mohabbat Singh, a 70-year-old farmer from Shamli in western Uttar Pradesh, echoed similar sentiments. “Even during Bharat Bandh, we made sure that ambulances were not stopped. We also cooperated with police in clearing traffic congestion at Ghazipur border. We are not sitting on protest to trouble people, but to be the voice of all farmers in securing their future,” said Amriq. Jitendar Singh Sandhu of Bharatiya Kisan Union asked why had police barricaded the entire road near Murga Mandi in Delhi and Khoda in UP when they had only blocked one carriageway of NH-9. SKM leader Tajindar Virk and a group of people sitting in a van, who had arrived from Uttarakhand, also said the protests would continue in cooperation with Delhiites. The protesters claimed that the police barricading was “a conspiracy to choke the traffic at Ghazipur border and put the blame on the farmers”. Some people from Punjab claimed that while traffic congestion was prevalent to some extent at Singhu and Tikri borders because of the protest by farmers, it was by no means a reality at Ghazipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/crowd-thins-at-ghazipur-site-but-protesters-say-they-will-stay/articleshow/86737516.cms||Zumbish

Track the pollution level in your cityExperts said that PM10 is the lead pollutant due to dry air coming from northwest India. However, they added that the air quality is likely to deteriorate further by the end of this week. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “With persistence of a similar condition, AQI will remain in the moderate category for the next three days.” According to Air Quality Early Warning System, also under the Union ministry of earth sciences, Delhi’s air quality may deteriorate from October 7, but remain in the moderate category. Dipankar Saha, the former head at CPCB’s air laboratory, said, “Delhi has entered into the winter season. It starts with intrusion of winds from north-northwest direction and during this period, the wind intrusion is in recessive condition. The dry season and accumulation of local emissions cause deterioration of air quality.” The Met department has forecast that rain is unlikely in Delhi for the next seven days. Meanwhile, some parts of Delhi received light rain on Sunday night. The maximum temperature recorded on Sunday was 36.2 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal. The minimum temperature settled at 26.6 degrees Celsius, five degrees above normal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-in-winter-season-aqi-to-worsen-by-end-of-week/articleshow/86737557.cms||---

But what makes the cityscape unique? An exhibition titled ‘Ahmedabad Collective’ by the Ahmedabad chapter of Indian Institute of Architects (IIA), tries to find the answers to this question. The collection of works of 21 city-based architects encompasses several elements such as 3D models, architectural plans, and real site pictures. The exhibition was inaugurated on Sunday at CREDAI building near Sindhu Bhavan Road. It is open for visitors on Monday, celebrated as the World Architecture Day. Vatsal Joshi, the chairman of the IIA Ahmedabad chapter, said that they have tried to bring together works of the likes of Vastu Shilpa, HCP, and Associated Architects. “The idea is to give a glimpse of the work carried out in the past few decades and the design philosophy behind it,” he said. “Ahmedabad has contributed immensely to the field of architecture, and such an initiative will go a long way in creating a community,” said Bimal Patel, the president of Cept University. “An architect may win accolades, but for him or her, the best compliment would be appreciation from fellow architects.” Surya Kakani, whose work is presented at the exhibition, said what sets Ahmedabad apart is its appetite for fearless experimentation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/finding-grammar-of-abad-architecture/articleshow/86737600.cms||---

---||Delhi||Mixed feelings over farmers blocking Ghazipur border||NEW DELHI: There’s more to what meets the eye at the Ghazipur border that has been barricaded for the past over 10 months due to farmers protesting against the three agri laws. While commuters and shopkeepers across Delhi-NCR have reportedly been affected by traffic woes owing to closure of the borders, they have given a mixed reaction over the issue. On Friday, Supreme Court had told a farmers’ body that citizens had an equal right to move freely and what was the point in continuing with the protest as a plea had been filed challenging the farm laws. Hira Singh, an Uber driver from Vinod Nagar, said, “I mainly ferry passengers from Noida. To commute from Noida Sector 62 to Delhi, I have to cross the Ghazipur border. As one side of NH-9 is barricaded, the route that earlier took 15 minutes now takes more than an hour due to the diversions in place, especially during peak traffic hours.” Apart from the UP-Delhi carriageway of NH-9, police have also barricaded the entire road under the flyover that stretches from Murga Mandi to Khoda. As a result, people commuting towards Kaushambi and Vaishali from Delhi have to take a detour and enter Ghaziabad from the EDM side or Anand Vihar ISBT. Moreover, as the other side is also barricaded, those coming from Indirapuram side have to go all the way to the Ghazipur landfill site and then rejoin the highway near the Murga Mandi. Asked about the sealed road, Uttar Pradesh Police said it was required for diverting traffic. Constable D Chauhan, who was stationed at the site, said, “Since the Uttar Pradesh-Delhi carriageway of the highway is blocked by the farmers, the route under the flyover has been blocked for diverting traffic.” Wilson Singh, an engineer who travels from Dwarka to Noida for work, said, “I have been avoiding NH-9 ever since the protests began over 10 months ago. I use DND Flyway to enter Noida now as it is more convenient. The traffic diversion at Khora from under Ghazipur flyover adds half an hour to the commute. Had police done away with the Khoda-Murga Mandi barricading, the traffic chaos would have been much lesser.” Fruit sellers at the vegetable and fruit mandi near the border have expressed dismay over the traffic snarls. Mohammad Sakir, who has been selling fruits near the mandi for the past 28 years, said he had seen a stark reduction in customer footfall in the last 10 months due to the traffic diversions. “Humara dhandha aadha ho gaya hai. Supply bhi der se aata hai kyunki sabke liye rasta band ho gaya hai. (Our business has suffered a loss of 50%. Even goods are delivered late since the route has been closed for everyone),” said an irked Sakir. However, another shopkeeper, Mohammad Khalil, who had a roadside stall near the mandi, said, “We receive the supplies at night, so traffic is not an issue for trucks coming at that hour. I don’t face much of a problem as I can walk to the mandi. It’s business as usual for me.” Several shopkeepers in the colonies adjoining the border seconded Khalil’s version on supplies being delivered to them at the same pace. Tarandeep Singh, who owns a hardware shop at Lakshmi Nagar, said, “Why are we blaming the farmers for blocking roads and causing traffic woes? Why are we not looking at the large number of police barricades and waterlogging? Goods are being supplied on time because trucks travel at night. Across Ghaziabad, I have not heard of any losses because of the alleged traffic issue. I do not agree with weighing rights of farmers over rights of citizens just because they have blocked one carraigeway of the highway to protest. I find the allegations an exaggeration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mixed-feelings-over-farmers-blocking-nh-9/articleshow/86737532.cms||Zumbish

This amount will be paid to the roadways by the government and apart from this, the state will also pay the amount due for taking approximately 15,000 buses from private operators that will be paid between Rs 4,000-5,000 per bus which were used for providing free travel to REET candidates. “A total of Rs 16.63 crore was the actual revenue for the period between September 20 to 30 when various competitive examinations were held in Rajasthan. This is only for the roadways which we will get from the government. The amount that is to be given to the private bus operators is separate from the roadways,” said an official. Private bus operators who deployed around 15,000 buses for free travel of REET candidates said a lot of the vehicles remained vacant and there weren’t enough candidates especially in Jaipur. The roadways had also deployed 3,500 buses for the purpose. Anil Jain, president, Bus Operators Association, Rajasthan said, “No mini buses were used and only the larger capacity were used. For every vehicle the government will give us between Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 along with per kilometre charges. We are expecting that the fund will be released to us in a week’s time. We will get paid for every vehicle that was given by us for the examination irrespective of the number of candidates which availed the service or not.” Also like elections, petrol coupons were provided to bus operators, which might be adjusted at the time of final payment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rsrtc-spent-rs-17cr-for-reet-aspirants/articleshow/86739894.cms||---

Ravat decided to teach the family a lesson. He kidnapped and murdered the child out of spite,” a senior police officer said. Ravat was picked up on Saturday after the police activated their informant network and received a tip-off. He was booked for murder under the IPC.

---||Delhi||High Delhi University cutoffs bother EWS aspirants||NEW DELHI: Last year, despite several cutoff lists and special drives, close to 5.6% of the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) seats remained vacant at Delhi University (DU). One of the key reasons was the high cutoff for the category and non-availability of EWS certificates due to the Covid pandemic. This year, too, the first cutoff for the category, declared on Friday By Delhi University, is just 0.50-0.75 percentage points less than the unreserved category. The cutoff for the other backward classes (OBC) category in most popular colleges are either higher or similar to that of the EWS category. For instance, at Hindu College, the general cutoff in history (Honours) is 99.5%, while it is 98% for the EWS category and 98.5% for OBC. Last year, for EWS and OBC, the cutoff was similar at 97.5%, while it was 98.75% for the unreserved category. At Hansraj College, the general cutoff for philosophy stands at 98 per cent; for EWS, at 95 per cent; and for OBC, at 97 per cent. Last year, the cutoffs were 96.5 per cent, 96% and 95.75%, respectively. At Janki Devi Memorial College, an off-campus college, the general cutoff for economics is 96.5 per cent and 95 per cent for both EWS and OBC. In 2020, it was 97% for general candidates, 96.5% for EWS and 95% for OBC. “For the EWS category, we get fewer students, hence the percentage of seats is also less for them. In the OBC category, the seats are more, and we also get enough candidates,” said S P Agarwal, principal of Ramanujan College. “The changes in the cutoffs are made later as per the admission trends,” he added. This year, Agarwal hoped, it will not be difficult to fill the EWS seats as the certificates must have been made by now. Humanities courses usually see more changes than commerce and science courses. The 10 per cent EWS reservation was implemented at DU in 2019 and the remaining 15 per cent in 2020. For the OBC non-creamy layer, 27 per cent seats are reserved. “Aspirants who have applied under the OBC category have good scores compared to EWS candidates. We tread cautiously in fixing the first list. Depending on the admissions in the first two lists, we will know the real situation,” said another principal. However, Kumar Ashutosh, teacher at College of Vocational Studies, felt the EWS cutoffs were still high. “In my tourism department, the EWS cutoff isn’t kept unreasonably high. Last year, it was difficult to fill the seats,” he said. For the BA in tourism, the EWS candidates need 86.5% as against 90% for general candidates. For OBC, it is 85%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/high-cutoffs-bother-ews-aspirants/articleshow/86737635.cms||Shradha Chettri

Williams has joined Andhra Pradesh senior cricket team as its coach for the upcoming season. The 48-year-old southpaw cricketer had been looking to switch roles and take up coaching assignments. “I recently completed level II coaching at the National Cricket Academy (NCA). Taking up an assignment as a coach was a part of the course. I had approached a few state cricket associations and finally zeroed in on Andhra Cricket Association,” Williams told TOI. It is his first job as a coach of Ranji cricket team outside BCA. When asked why he opted for coaching, Williams said, “As a selector my job was a fulfilling one, but I wanted to play a role in nurturing cricketers. Coaching is the best way I can make a difference.” Williams had contested BCA polls in 2019 and got elected to the grounds and infrastructure committee. Williams began his first-class career in 1995-96 and went on to play 124 First Class matches in his 15-year-long stint. He scored 7,492 runs at an average of almost 40 that included 19 centuries and 42 half-centuries. His performance with the bat in Irani Cup in 2001 brought him in the spotlight and he was selected in the Indian team for the South Africa tour soon after. He was also selected for the England Test series but he couldn’t make it to the playing eleven. Williams called it a day and announced his retirement from cricket in 2011. He was a backbone of the Baroda Ranji team for a long time and later served as Ranji selector too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/former-baroda-skipper-to-coach-senior-andhra-cricket-team/articleshow/86737630.cms||Tushar Tere

Meena had demanded a CBI probe into the REET paper leak for a fair inquiry. Meena alleged that the CMO and the education department were involved in REET paper leak. He even claimed that a big Congress leader was behind the incident, but the government was trying to suppress the evidence. Kirori said, “Education minister Govind Singh Dotasra has asked for the proof of paper leak. When the question paper was found in mobile phones of the accused around one-and-a-half hour before exam, where is the need for proof. There is evidence that the answer sheet was also sent to Gangapur exam centre on the day of examination which is against the norm. Answer sheet is never sent to the exam centre but to the examiner later. It also shows that RBSE secrecy wing is involved.” “The head of RBSE secrecy wing G.K. Mathur was once found guilty by the ACB in influencing the merit of aspirants in some government examination. Along with Mathur, Umesh Sharma, who heads the D.S. Science Institute, Gangapur, was also allegedly involved in REET paper leak from Sawai Madhopur. When Mathur was found guilty once by the ACB, then why he has been given responsibility of secrecy wing at RBSE after his retirement. Mathur and Sharma are involved in REET paper leak,” said Meena. He alleged that Batti Lal Meena, a prime accused who is absconding, has links with a top Congress leader. Hence, the SOG is not able to find him as the strings are further attached to Laxmangarh MLA Govind Singh Dotasra. “There is an urgent requirement of a CBI probe as the state machinery is not fit to investigate. I will also reveal the name of the top Congress leader soon. The CMO and education department are involved not just in REET but also in sub-inspector and hunior engineer exam paper leak this year,” said Meena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/reet-paper-leak-bjp-mp-meena-wants-cbi-probe/articleshow/86739978.cms||---

Admissions under the first cutoff list will begin on Monday. The declaration of special cutoffs is subject to availability of vacant seats in the programme and college. A circular issued by the university stated that the special cutoff would be the last declared cutoff of the respective college and course. For example, if for college A, the first cutoff for BSc (H) mathematics for a specific category was 98% and the college did not declare a second and third cutoff list, but later seats remain vacant, then the special cutoff for the course would be 98%. No movement would be allowed during the special cutoffs. Candidates who have secured admission in any of the earlier three cutoff lists would not be allowed to participate in it. “Candidates can apply to a single programme and college by ensuring they meet the required eligibility condition and declared special cutoff. Merely applying under the special cutoff does not guarantee admission to the candidate. No grievances will be entertained in case a candidate fails to apply or pay the fees (if approved) within the stipulated period,” the circular stated. Once the fifth cutoff would be released, vacant seats for each programme in colleges would be displayed on the website of the university. The circular mentioned, “Candidates who could not seek admission or had cancelled their admission in any college during any preceding cutoffs for any reason till the fifth cutoff (including special cutoff) and were, therefore, not admitted, but meet any of the preceding cutoffs, shall be considered for admission under the special drive, provided seats are available in the said category.” Once candidates take admission, they would have to sign an online declaration stating that all information provided by them is correct. If after taking admission in the first list, a student wants to change the course or college, a cancellation fee of Rs 1,000 would be levied. The college fee would be adjusted automatically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-admissions-from-today-special-list-after-3rd-cutoff/articleshow/86737658.cms||---

However, this year, preparations for Dasara doll arrangements and exhibitions are in full swing. Ranganath V, a retired tahsildar and writer, who is a resident of Vijayashripura said, like every year he is arranging the Dasara dolls this year too. “Every year, people arrange Dasara dolls. Last year, fewer people did it as they were worried about inviting people over to see these idols amid Covid scare,” he explained.Rangath said the idols are generally arranged in nine steps. “We have around 150-200 dolls,” he said.Sudha Kini, a resident of Vidyaranyapuram, who has been displaying Dasara dolls for the last ten years said, she has begun preparations. “As my children and grandchildren are also here, all are working together in cleaning the dolls, finding replacements for the broken ones etc. I have no plans to invite many people. Only close family and friends will be invited to see he arrangement this year,” she said.“Bombe Mane” organised by the RamsonsStores in the heart of the city is one of the major attractions for both tourists and the locals. The 17th edition of this show was launched recently. According to Raghu Dharmendra, the curator of this arrangement, locals are coming in a good numbers. “We are expecting visitors from Bengaluru at the time of Dasara,” he said.Like Mysuru, Dasara dolls are arranged by many families in other districts like Shivamogga, Kodagu, Hassan, etc. “It is part of our Dasara tradition,” said Ranganath who has authored a book on the Dasara celebrations in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/this-dasara-doll-displays-reach-new-creative-heights-in-old-mysuru/articleshow/86735294.cms||---

I am confident of exposing them all by December 31. The grip of the agencies around former home minister Anil Deshmukh might tighten by this month end itself,” said Somaiya while addressing the media on Sunday morning. When questioned on the allegations about a senior Shiv Sena leader spilling the beans about his party colleague to detractors, Somaiya hinted there were many within the party who seemed to be working against each other. He also questioned the government on slow action against those facing corruption charges. Last month, Somaiya registered a complaint of cheating and money laundering against Maharashtra minister Hasan Mushrif at the Murgud police station in Kolhapur district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-involvement-of-mva-netas-in-40-scams-will-be-exposed-by-dec/articleshow/86740036.cms||Manoj Badgeri

He has been on the run since September 20 and the multiple attempts to trace him by the police didn’t yield any results. The police said that a team has been sent to Rajasthan. “We have been working on several inputs and a team is in Rajasthan to track Jain down,” said D S Chauhan, ACP (crime) who is part of the special investigation team (SIT) that is supervising the case. Chauhan said that they are also trying to trace Alpu Sindhi who is a witness in the rape case. “It is important to get his statement in this case,” Chauhan added. Jain and Raju Bhatt were booked on September 19 for raping the girl who was under training at the former’s CA firm. Bhatt was arrested by the cops some days ago from Junagadh and he is currently on police remand. The investigators have also questioned Taher Piplodwala, a resident of Godhra, whose name had appeared in the girl’s diary. The police said that the girl had met Taher during a train journey two years ago and she had noted his name and address at that time. “Taher said that she had called him a few times but they had never met,” the police said.

---||World||Israel makes Covid booster jab must for ‘fully vaccinated’ tag||JERUSALEM: Israel on Sunday introduced new rules for determining coronavirus vaccination status, making a booster shot a requirement for full inoculation and vaccination passports. After pioneering booster shots for everyone 12 and older, Israel is believed to be the first country to condition the validity of vaccination passports on having got a booster. Israel said it would soon cancel the vaccination passports of over a million people, mainly those who are eligible for, but have not yet received, a third vaccination shot. To be considered fully vaccinated in Israel people must meet one of the following criteria: be 12 or older and have received a booster shot at least a week ago; be within six months of having received a second shot; or be within six months of having tested positive for Covid. The booster shots are Pfizer vaccinations. In Israel, a Green Pass — a digital or paper vaccination certificate — is required for entry to public spaces, including restaurants, hotels, clubs, cultural venues and large private gatherings. Unvaccinated people can only gain entry with a proof of a negative rapid test carried out at an authorised test station, which is valid for 24 hours, or a negative PCR test valid for 72 hours. The change in policy came after Israeli health officials and experts identified a significant waning of immunity in people five or six months after their second Pfizer dose and after studies indicated the effectiveness of the booster shot in preventing severe disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israel-makes-covid-booster-jab-must-for-fully-vaccinated-tag/articleshow/86742380.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan University to hold MPAT exam on October 29||JAIPUR: After a gap of three years, Rajasthan University will hold MPAT examination for MPhil and PhD seats on October 29. Last MPAT was conducted in September 2019 after which the pandemic became a hurdle for conducting the exam as per schedule. MPAT is conducted for PhD and MPhil admissions. This year, 324 seats for NET+JRF and 354 seats for teachers have been allotted for which students will register. Seats for NET+JRF are usually for students who are still studying and teachers’ candidates are people who are already in a job as assistant professor without PhD. Rashmi Jain, RU faculty and conveyor for MPAT said, "This year after pandemic we will conduct our first MPAT. In last three years, JRF students and teachers’ candidates had to give separate exams. That process was time consuming. This year, everyone will give exam on the same date." Moreover, separate research aptitude tests were conducted for science students and arts/commerce students. This year, only one research aptitude exam will be conducted for all the students. Recently, more than 100 enrolled faculty members of Rajasthan University were promoted which increased 200 seats for PhD. But, these 200 seats will be added in next MPAT exam as some more procedures have to be completed. "Some professors will be retiring within six months who cannot take new PhD admissions. Many other approvals are needed from the vice-chancellors’ office. It would have taken us more than 15 days to complete the entire process so we issued the MPAT exam dates. MPAT exam will be conducted next year for these additional seats," said Jain. One important change has been made this year in MPAT exam. For NET+ JRF students who earlier used to get 10% extra marks will now get just 10 marks. Similarly, for students who have done MPhil from university will get seven marks extra in the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ru-to-hold-mpat-exam-on-oct-29/articleshow/86740008.cms||---

Officers believe a more visible police presence in communities is essential to combat crime. Hence officers of all police stations across the city have been directed to do the exercise of calling names of all policemen of respective police stations in public places to check their presence. Usually, it was being done in the police station by the inspector every evening. The inspector used to check what is the situation irrespective of beats from the policemen and assign them duties for night and the next day. The city which has a population of over 11 lakh has 18 law and order police stations, five traffic stations and one exclusive all-woman police station. According to the plan, every inspector of the station must take the roll-call in a public place especially in places of public movement like circles, junctions, and streets so that there is increased visible police presence. Every day personnel attached to law-and-order police stations have to do the exercise in different places in their respective jurisdictions. It means that at 18 different places police will be visible in groups to the public. Officers believe that the public will come to know about police work and their presence. Besides instilling confidence in public, the exercise would act as a deterrent to miscreants. Since the roll-call is taken in the evening hours, this will also help police check any criminal activities after dusk. Police commissioner Chandragupta said all police inspectors have been directed to conduct roll-call in public places. The initiative was launched on Wednesday. Cops to keep a close watch As Mysuru Dasara is round the corner, police are not taking any chance with regard to public safety. After the gangrape and jewellery shop heist and murder, movements of outsiders are being closely monitored. Surprise visits to hotels and resorts to verify the details of visitors will be done. As a procedure, all hostels and resorts have to collect valid ID cards from guests to check their authenticity and submit it to local police stations. The Foreigners’ Regional Registration Office too shares details of foreign nationals staying in Mysuru with local police. Officers have been directed to monitor their activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/cops-conduct-roll-call-at-public-places-to-increase-visibility/articleshow/86735322.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Cast vote only on merit, NCCL chief Kailash Jogani to members||NAGPUR: The newly elected president of Nagpur Chamber of Commerce Limited (NCCL), a major trade guild in the city, has tried to break away from the convention by appealing to members to cast their vote only on merit. Chartered accountant Kailash Jogani, who was elected NCCL president last week, in his taking over speech, said businessmen are not aligned to any specific political party. Jogani has asked the members to shed the party affiliations during the upcoming civic polls and vote only on the basis of merit. “It’s time that political affiliations are set aside and only a candidate’s merit is considered. This can start with the civic polls at least, because we need good leaders for the city’s development. Micro-level issues of the city are directly dealt by corporators,” he told TOI. “Apart from taking up business-related issues, the traders should also think from a citizen’s perspective. Most of the business establishments are located in East Nagpur. There is major scope for this part to be developed as compared to the western localities,” he said. Jogani said NCCL has 2,000 direct members and after clubbing those from associate bodies, the number comes to over 4,000. He has also asked the traders to maintain a debt-free business and maintain enough own funds, which can be used as working capital. He asked them to keep away from Hundi financiers, whom the traders have been traditionally depending on for funds. “The private lenders end up charging not less than 15%, if all the add-ons are considered. This leaves the traders drained of funds. Instead, the money can be raised from the banking channel, which offers loans at much lower rates. This will help in keeping a healthy balance sheet,” he said. “A number of businesses have a high debt to equity ratio, mainly because of dependence on costly private finance. Bank loans are easily available,” he added. Jogani said the chamber of commerce will also press for early completion of developmental projects going on in the city and raise the issue of bad roads, which is dogging the commuters these days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cast-vote-only-on-merit-nccl-chief-to-members/articleshow/86740043.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mysuru||Cotton growers in Chamarajanagar and Mysuru rejoice as price doubles this year||MYSURU: Cotton growers in Chamarajanagar and Mysuru districts are all smiles again as they have got bumper prices for their crop this year. The price of cotton has doubled when compared to previous years. Last year, they sold it for Rs 60 per kg and now prices range between Rs 110 and 130, said Nagarajappa, cotton grower in Gundlupet taluk of Chamarajanagar district. Farmers of the two districts have been cultivating Cotton in around 28,123 hectares. It is cultivated in Gundlupet taluk, a few pockets of Chamarajanagar and Hanur taluks in Chamarajanagar district, HD Kote, Hunsur, Saragur and Nanjangud taluk in Mysuru district. Currently, the state government announced the minimum support price of Rs 5500 per quintal. The 140-180 day hybrid BT Cotton crop varieties like Bahubali, Puli and Minerva, which were sown in rain-fed areas during pre-monsoon showers are reaping bumper prices after the harvest in September. As most textile industries are situated in Tirupur and Erode in Tamil Nadu where raw cotton is processed and the yarn exported to Bangladesh, local traders sell raw cotton to them after buying from regional farmers. “Most of them have bid goodbye to traditional cotton varieties and opted for hybrid BT cotton as it is disease-resistant and yields sooner. Local farmers will get more price if the government establishes a market for them locally, which will also avoid the role of middlemen,” farmer leader Kurubur Shanthakumar told TOI. Speaking to TOI, joint director of agriculture Dr Mahantheshappa said many farmers were cultivating cotton in old Mysuru region till recently in about 60,000 hectares. But now it is down to about 30,000 hectares due to labour problems and unseasonal rain. The textile industry is bouncing back and the low yield due to weak monsoon are some of the reasons attributed for the bumper prices for cotton this year, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/cotton-growers-rejoice-as-price-doubles-this-year/articleshow/86735343.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Urdu, Persian experts hired for resolving old land deeds||Jaipur: The states local bodies have sought the assistance of language experts to comprehend old land records (bahi khata) written in Urdu and Persian for Shahar-2021, a special campaign to resolve land issues. The state government is focusing on issuing lease deeds to people living in old abadi (population) and walled city areas. However, apart from lacking a legal title to their property, most of the residents have old documents written in Urdu and Persian. This has become a major challenge for local bodies in the state. Adviser to the state government and former principal secretary, GS Sandhu, who is spearheading the campaign, said owners with land records of 1901 had applied to procure lease deeds. As the records were written in Urdu and Persian, the department had hired experts and students from the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Arabic and Persian Research Institute in Tonk. Sandhu said, "This is possibly happening for the first time in the country. We will set an example by granting lease deeds to ancient properties’ owners." As towns in Rajasthan came up during the time of erstwhile princely states and some of them are centuries old, including Jodhpur, Udaipur, Kota and Jaipur, most of the residents were issued permissions or entitlements. As the influence of Urdu and Persian was prevalent during those times, the land records were also issued in those languages. An official said, “Most of the old documents of the erstwhile princely states up to 1953 are in the possession of state archives department.” During the last few years, the department has digitised over 20 lakh old pattas in seven cities of Rajasthan. "These records will come handy in detecting forged documents or in clearing doubts about old documents, once they are translated," the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/urdu-persian-experts-hired-for-resolving-old-land-deeds/articleshow/86740064.cms||Ajay Singh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Encroachments reduce green cover inside Aarey, increase human activity||MUMBAI: The recent spate of leopard attacks on humans at Aarey Colony after a gap of four years and the finding of a leopard cub at a construction site has not gone unnoticed in government corridors. State Environment minister Aditya Thackeray raised concern on the increasing urbanisation in forest areas referring to the finding of a cub separated from its mother outside the Aarey metro car shed site early this week. He raised the issue at a Wildlife Week programme last week, bringing back focus on increasing human presence and activity in Aarey. Mumbai’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park in its last leopard census almost three years ago had reported 41 adult leopards. Of these nine were reported in Aarey Colony, with which it shares a boundary and which is spread over 3,000 acres. Aarey at any point is believed to be home to four or five adult leopards, including a small number moving between Aarey and Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP). The leopard has the highest level of protection under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The global authority on the natural world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, lists it in the near threatened category. But the animal is an adaptable species and commonly lives in close proximity to human settlements and farmland, say experts. Krishna Tiwari, founder of NGO Forest and Wildlife Conservation Society. said leopards in Aarey Colony are used to the sound and lights. Despite a high density of the big cat population, the environmentalist pointed out that there are very few man-animal conflicts. The Warli tribe which lives inside Aarey, avoids conflict with leopards. They understand the behaviour of the animal based on traditional knowledge that is passed down over generations, say biologists. However, it is the proliferation of slums on the fringes of the Aarey-SGNP stretch which has now reduced natural cover and brought the shy animal into more conflict with humans. In recent months, the chief executive officer of Aarey Dairy was arrested while accepting bribe to allow slums inside Aarey. During the lockdown, several acres of trees were cut to make way for more unauthorised structures. “The leopard (which has been blamed for attacks) may have been curious as there is high human pressure in Aarey,” said Tiwari. The big cat is known to be comfortable with the presence of humans provided they can conceal themselves in vegetation and are left undisturbed. This is a point that underscores the surge in human activity in the area. However, successive governments have failed to relocate slum dwellers or even shift cattle sheds out of Aarey despite a Bombay High Court order. Tasneem Shaikh, member, Aarey Conservation Group said large scale developments in Aarey Colony may not be easy to undo but the focus must be on keeping green areas tranquil and intact. Activist Amrita Bhattacharjee of the Aarey Conservation Group also observed that illegal constructions within the green zone of Aarey Milk Colony have increased over the years, which leads to encroachments, tree cutting and increase in human population. “The dairy development authority of Aarey undertakes demolition drives on illegal shanties and other structures, but the way human numbers have risen, it leads to frequent man-animal conflicts as seen last week. Hence, illegal constructions must be curbed,” said Bhattacharjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-encroachments-reduce-green-cover-inside-aarey-increase-human-activity/articleshow/86740070.cms||Clara Lewis

IPS officials have headed the drug control administration, civil supplies department and legal metrology for several years. However, in the past two to three years, commissioner or controller or director posts of these departments are being held by IAS officers. Several IPS officers who are promoted or transferred or have come back from central deputation are waiting for postings. The chatter among bureaucratic circles is that IAS officials in these posts will be replaced by IPS officers again. IPS officials of IG, Additional DG Rank posts are keen to be posted somewhere instead of being kept waiting. New CEO for Election Commission Once the Huzurabad bye-election is done and dusted, Telangana may get a new chief electoral officer (CEO) for the election commission. A little birdie says the present incumbent Shashank Goel is planning to go on central deputation before completing his term as CEO. The 1990 IAS batch officer was appointed as CEO, Telangana in March, 2020 and has completed one-and-half years. Karimnagar Bidda for top Genco post? It appears the state government is keen on bringing SCCL chairman and managing director N Sridhar to TS Genco on a permanent basis. The 1997 IAS batch officer has already completed his deputation to SCCL and has been continuing for the past seven years. It is learnt CM KCR wants to utilize his services in TS Genco, as SCCL set up a thermal power plant at Jaipur in Mancherial district and SCCL has plans for solar power plants. Moreover, the present TS Genco and Transco CMD D Prabhakar Rao is not keeping well. KCR wants Karimnagar Bidda to take over Genco post, our sources say. Currently, Prabhakar Rao is on leave for 10 days and Sridhar is holding fort. Cross voting Generally cross voting happens during crucial bills in Parliament, or for indirect elections like Rajya Sabha and MLC elections etc. But the TRS got more than its strength (votes) and secured all the four directors posts in Nalgonda-RangaReddy Milk Products Mutually Aided Cooperative Union (Mother Diary) elections held a couple of days ago. The ruling TRS has 217 votes (societies under Narmul), four directors got 255, 243, 232 and 219 votes respectively. Nalgonda district minister G Jagadish Reddy, who is election in-charge for TRS, had managed to clinch some votes from Congress (has 61 votes), BJP, CPI and CPM parties. Vanishing Act Move over vanishing acts we see in Bollywood and Tollywood movies since our childhood. Our elected representatives from the TRS had first-hand experience of the vanishing act performed by finance minister T Harish Rao. Several TRS MLAs had plans of meeting Harish after the question hour in the Assembly on Friday, but they were left bemused to know that Harish, who replied two answers in the House, was already on his way to Huzurabad located 170-km away from Hyderabad, even before they came out after the Question Hour to meet him. Now, that tells us how crucial the Huzurabad by-poll is for chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. Eyes firm on Hyderabad AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi is reportedly not happy with some of the party corporators. The grapevine in old city is that some of the corporators have joined hands with town planning officials of GHMC. What left the eyebrows raised was the ultimate salvo from the Hyderabad MP when he cautioned the corporators in his inimitable style. "Do not to take me for granted because I am away from Hyderabad on political tours to other states. Wherever I am, my eyes are always on Hyderabad. Don't think I will not know anything. I get every piece of information. One more complaint against you, and you all know that I have the best of treatments for it," he said. Intimidating security One look at the security personnel on duty for 1999 batch IPS officer, Stephen Ravindra, you may wonder is something wrong? The Cyberabad CP’s security team continues to flaunt assault weapons, whereas his predecessors, including VC Sajjanar, Sandeep Shandilya, V Naveen Chand and CV Anand used to consciously avoid having gunmen with assault weapons around them at the office to ensure that visitors are not intimidated. Long wait into the midnight hour Several IPS officers waited eagerly till late in the night on September 30, looking for new GOs from the GAD on the day when DG Rajiv Trivedi retired from the service. Though ADG (L&O) Jitender was given additional charge of Rajiv Trivedi's DG Prisons & Correctional Services post, to the disappointment of many, the much-awaited orders for transfers and new postings they were looking for never came. Senior IPS officers CV Anand, Vijay Kumar who reported to the government after coming from the central deputation from CISF and IB, are yet to be given new postings. Former Karimnagar CP VB Kamalasan Reddy also has not been given a new posting. Tailpiece Physician, heal thyself, is an adage that can aptly be applied to Rajanna Sircilla collectorate officials. During the recent heavy rains, the collector Anuraag Jayanti had to move out of the collectorate premises for an inspection of the areas which had got inundated. The tragedy was that the area near the collectorate itself had got inundated as there was no way the collector could come out of the newly-constructed premises in her car. And so, a tractor was requisitioned. The collector and officials sat in the tractor to be brought out of the collectorate premises. That was not all. Officials, protective of the collector, as they were, also saw to it that there was an earth mover right behind the tractor. Because if the tractor also were to get stuck, the earth mover could give it a push.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-confidential/articleshow/86737815.cms||---

The NBA is granted to universities which fulfil all conditions laid down by a collaboration of several international agencies. The achievement would enable several Forbes 500 companies to hire from the RTU. Also, students from NBA institutes get preference to work in USA, Europe and Australia. The status is granted after a rigorous process involving inspections. “Now, the RTU is eligible to claim for funds under DST, AICTE and other international funding agencies for carrying out research on various subjects. Another benefit is that degrees of our students don’t need to be verified by the employee or any agency,” said RA Gupta, VC of RTU. Gupta expects that the status will invite students from far off places and will shoot up the merit list. The next aim of RTU is to invite the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) for grading, which will further help them in getting more funds for infrastructure development and research. Subjects which have been granted NBA status are mechanical, electrical, civil, computer science, electronics instrumentation, information technology, industrial engineering and electronics engineering. All eight branches were inspected and accorded the status independently. All eight departments have been inspected thrice by the NBA team. Inspections gauged the quality of education, student-teacher ratio, facilities, teachers experience and placements of students. “The status will set to help affiliated colleges, which will also be considered for projects by the various funding agencies,” said Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rtu-tech-courses-get-tier-1-accreditation/articleshow/86740149.cms||---

However, the airline confirmed that there was no mishap involved, with the plane being an old, scrapped aircraft which had been sold by Air India and was being transported by the plane’s owner. “This is a deregistered, scrapped aircraft of Air India which has been sold by us. This was transported last night by the party. Air India has got no connection whatsoever with the aircraft under any circumstances,” said an Air India spokesperson. Viral video: Air India plane stuck under overbridge in DelhiIn the video, vehicles can be seen passing through one side of the highway, while the other side appears to be largely blocked by the aircraft. The nose of the aircraft and half of its body have also crossed underneath the foot over bridge before the top half gets stuck. A Delhi airport official, when contacted, said no flight or active aircraft had been involved in any incident. “The aircraft certainly does not belong to the Delhi airport’s fleet and in the video, it is being transported without any wings. It appears to be a scrapped plane and the driver may have made an error in judgement while transporting it,” the official said. In a similar incident in 2019, a truck carrying an abandoned India Post aircraft had got stuck under a bridge in West Bengal’s Durgapur, with the driver being unable to judge the height of the bridge correctly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/scrapped-plane-on-its-last-journey-gets-stuck-under-fob/articleshow/86738039.cms||---

---||World||UK NRIs protest Pakistan’s ‘violence on minorities’||LONDON: British Indians took part in a silent vigil across 40 towns and cities of the UK on Saturday as part of an appeal to end violence against minorities in Pakistan, especially Hindu girls. Crowds gathered in cities likein Leicester, Edinburgh, Leeds and Slough, distributing pamphlets about the allegedly forced conversion of Hindu, Sikh and Christian girls in Pakistan. “The situation of Hindus and other minorities in Pakistan is increasingly dire,” the organisers, Insight UK, a movement of British Hindu and Indian communities, told TOI. “They face regular kidnappings, forceful conversion, attacks and persecution. Each year over 1,000 minor Hindu girls are abducted, forced to convert, married to people twice or thrice of their age or pushed into the sex trade. Some seminaries teach that forcibly converting Hindu girls is equivalent to the greatest religious duty. Minorities in Pakistan face the threat of blasphemy laws.” Protest erupts in the UK over forced conversion in PakistanIn 1947, Pakistan had a minority population of about 31%. Of these, around 24% — or 7.5 million — were Hindus. In 75 years, the minority population has dwindled to 4%, of which Hindus account for 1.6% or 2.5 million people, Insight UK said. The organisation is lobbying with British MPs to raise its concerns with Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, minister for South Asia. It wants the UK government to raise the issue with Pakistan and urge the Indian government to ensure that citizenship applications of minorities from Pakistan who’ve taken refuge in India are expedited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-nris-protest-pakistans-violence-on-minorities/articleshow/86742398.cms||NAOMI CANTON

As per the Met department, these areas are likely to receive heavy rainfall at some places along with thunderstorm, lightning or gusty winds. Parbhani and Hingoli districts are also expected to witness such extreme weather conditions on Monday, whereas Latur and Nanded districts are likely to get light to moderate rainfall. Shriniwas Aundhkar, director of APJ Abdul Kalam Astro Space and Science Centre, said the local weather conditions coupled with the withdrawal phase of the monsoon could produce rainfall in parts of Marathwada till October 7. “The intensity of showers is not likely to be as severe as observed in the recent past. The region could expect clear skies around the middle of the next week,” he added. While the rain fury — especially heavy to very heavy rainfall observed in September — has already damaged crops on over 25 lakh hectare in Marathwada, besides claiming around 91 lives since June 1, another round of incessant showers could spell further doom for the region. As per official data, Marathwada has already received 1046 mm rainfall, 152% of the expected showers.  During the corresponding period last year, the region had received 827 mm showers that is 120% of the expected rainfall activity. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/another-yellow-alert-for-4-marathwada-districts/articleshow/86733813.cms||---

Addressing the gathering at the inauguration of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Theme Park in Nashik, Gadkari said that NMC should map pollution levels in the next five years. “There are numerous ways of tackling sound pollution. My ministry is already taking steps to replace blaring horns that add to sound pollution. Such horns will be replaced with melodius sounds of Indian musical instruments so they cut down on noise pollution,” Gadkari said. He urged the NMC to take the lead in reducing air pollution in the city. “Our aim is to cut down on imported fuel, hence I urge NMC to convert all its vehicles on CNG that will not only save money required to buy fuel but also help reduce air pollution and improve the quality of life here. The corporation’s buses can also be run on CNG,” Gadkari said. Gadkari also called on farmers to convert their tractors to run on bio-diesel and CNG so that pollution in the rural areas also reduces. On water pollution, Gadkari asked NMC to take up solid and liquid waste management programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/gadkari-asks-nmc-to-tackle-pollution/articleshow/86733795.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The oxygen plant is the first such in the tribal talukas of Nashik district. The plant will be a life saver in tribal areas as it will eliminate the need to travel to the district headquarters in search of oxygen-supported beds. Inaugurating the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plant in Kalwan sub-civil hospital, Patil said that after the health sector faced several issues due to shortage of oxygen during the peak of the second wave, the government has now ensured every district becomes self-sufficient in production of oxygen. “Installing the PSA in the tribal areas only underlines the manner in which the government is paying attention towards the health of the local population. With the oxygen plant raised here, the people, who may require the same, will no longer have to go to cities in search of beds and they need not pay to get treatment at private hospitals,” the minister said. The minister also congratulated the sub-civil hospital for administering over 20,000 vaccine doses in tribal blocks. On Sunday, Kalwan taluka had 11 active Covid cases. One patient was admitted to the hospital, while ten others were under home isolation. The highest number of active cases in Nashik rural was 203 in Sinnar taluka, followed by 126 in Niphad taluka and 107 in Yeola taluka. The rural areas have 650 active cases, while Nashik Municipal Corporation has 276 active cases. In all, the district has 957 active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/first-o-plant-in-nashiks-tribal-area-inaugurated/articleshow/86733822.cms||---

He inaugurated city gas station in Khanimpur, 8 CNG station and industrial connection at Parag milk dairy and also distributed registered certificate of PNG service among five women consumers on the occasion. In the evening, CM Yogi reached Khanimpur and took complete information about PNG service from Torrent company officials and gave instructions for speedy work for PNG supply in Kushinaagr and Santkabir Nagar. Gorakhpur has become the first district of Purvanchal to have PNG service now. Speaking on the occasion, CM Yogi said the PNG is inexpensive and safe option in comparison to LPG as the meter will show the consumption of gas and the theft of gas in the cylinder will be ruled out. The gas consumption will reduce by around 35-40% in kitchen with PNG in comparison to LPG, he said. “PNG is inexpensive and a safe option. PM Modi gave free connection in the country and now cooking gas will reach to the kitchen on the lines of water supply and by the month of March 10,000 families will get Torrent PNG connection in Gorakhpur. It is not only a cheaper alternative to LPG but to also to petrol/diesel and is also pollution free environment friendly,” said the CM. “During second wave of Covid we saw the importance of oxygen plant. Many people took advantage of it and started black marketing of oxygen cylinders. PM Modi has given us 127 oxygen plants and in total 547 oxygen plants will be operational in UP of which 490 plants are ready including 13 Torrent oxygen plants. In the coming time oxygen will be produced from atmosphere,” CM Yogi said. The chief minister thanked Torrent company and the company officials told that the 13 oxygen plants of the company are in Azamgarh, Mau, Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Kanpur Dehat, Sant Kabir Nagar, Muradabad, Basti, Barabanki, Kushinagar and 3 plants in Agra district.

---||Hubballi||Exodus of leaders leaves JD(S) floundering in North Karnataka||Dharwad: Notwithstanding the protestations of the leadership of the JD(S) to strengthen the party in North Karnataka ahead of the next assembly elections, the regional outfit appears to be losing ground. Discontentment appears to be rife in the ranks of the party in the region; the manner in which the party is being run has displeased many prominent leaders, who are growing increasingly sceptical about the party’s prospects. Consequently, many of them are leaving the party, with their followers in tow. Recently, former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy headlined the Janata Parva and the JD(S) Mission Workshop, aimed at rejuvenating the party machinery across the state. However, these ambitious initiatives have failed to stem the exodus of popular leaders from the party. The announcement of the schedule for the byelection to Sindgi and Hangal assembly seats, the former of which the JD(S) had won in 2018, must have galvanised the party machinery in North Karnataka. The regional outfit had won two seats in Vijayapura in 2018 – MC Managuli had triumphed in Sindgi, while Devanand Chouhan had emerged victorious in Nagathan. With the JD(S) still dilly-dallying over its candidate for Sindgi, Managuli’s son Ashok has jumped ship to join the Congress, which has already declared his candidature from the seat. Political observers in the region pointed out that both Managuli and Chouhan’s victories in Vijayapura had more to do with sympathy, than with the strength of the JD(S). Vijugouda Patil, Bagewadi MLA Shivanand Patil’s brother, left the JD(S), unhappy with the high-handed manner in which the former PM’s family ran the party. Son of veteran Congress SV Patil Managuli, Somanagouda Patil, who lost the 2018 assembly election to Bagewadi by a narrow margin on a JD(S) ticket, is slated to join the BJP on Tuesday. The JD(S) is floundering rudderless in the district, as a result. The party has no visible presence in neighbouring Bagalkot, Belagavi, Haveri and Gadag districts either. Kumaraswamy, who rented a house in Hubballi, which he said would serve as his base while he strengthened the party in North Karnataka, has hardly been seen in the region. Chairman of the legislative council Basavaraj Horatti, a seven-time MLC who has turned the West Teachers’ segment into his citadel, was the party’s most prominent face in North Karnataka. However, observers pointed out that his success in the hustings was owing to his stature as a leading figure among his teaching brethren. He joined the JD(S) to secure a cabinet berth, and had stayed with the party till he was elevated as the Chairman of Legislative Council. Former Navalgund MLA NH Konaraddi, meanwhile, resigned as the JD(S) general secretary in the wake of the party’s dismal performance in the recently concluded Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) polls. Senior leaders in the district such as Rajanna Koravi, Sanganamulla, Ramanand Shenoy, Mohan Arkasali, disgruntled with the party top brass, which they accuse of not extending sufficient support, have all quit the regional outfit. In fact, Koravi, who left the JD(S) ahead of the HDMC polls was elected to the civic body’s council on a BJP ticket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/exodus-of-leaders-leaves-jds-floundering-in-north-karnataka/articleshow/86713573.cms||---
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Former Shiv Sena MLA Subhash Sabne all set to join BJP||AURANGABAD: In what could be a setback to the Shiv Sena and the ruling MVA government, former Sena MLA Subhash Sabne is expected to join BJP and contest the bypoll for the Deglur assembly seat in Nanded district. Sabne, who had represented the seat from 2014 to 2019, met the leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis during his tour of flood-affected areas in Nanded district at Narsi on Sunday. Following the meeting, Sabne and Fadnavis toured the Biloli area in a common vehicle. Later, Sabne revealed that he was leaving the Shiv Sena and criticised PWD minister Ashok Chavan and MVA constituents Congress and NCP for ‘weakening’ the Shiv Sena. “I have been with Shiv Sena since 1984 and witnessed six elections. However, I am fed up with the autocratic working style of Chavan. The party leadership always loved and supported me,” said Sabne, who also referred to the recent incident when he was allegedly manhandled while staging a political demonstration. Coming down heavily on Chavan, Sabne said Congress leaders had forgotten that their party could be revived only with the blessings of the Sena after the formation of the MVA government. “Many leaders feel that Shiv Sena should quit the MVA government now. If I ask my voters to vote for Congress during the bypoll, what would I request them in 2024 elections,” he reasoned. Earlier, Chavan, who is the guardian minister of Nanded, had said that Sabne would not revolt as he is a “true” Shiv Sainik. Post criticism from Sabne, the Congress has also hit out. “Sabne is free to join BJP if he is tempted to become an MLA, but he should not unnecessarily target Chavan and other leaders. He has secured a ticket from BJP first and then he is going to join the party, which shows his moral standards,” state Congress vice-president Amaranath Rajurkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ex-sena-mla-sabne-all-set-to-join-bjp/articleshow/86733836.cms||Prasad Joshi

The company said the willingness to secure smartphone was rising, but most consumers still regard it as unnecessary. The updates to ‘Total Security’ includes a webcam protection feature. “Many people use laptops these days, including children, especially as classes have gone online due to the pandemic. Snoopers and hackers often sneakily activate webcams and often the families with blackmail, using inappropriate pictures or private moments captured through the webcam. Many targets do not report the issue, mostly due to stigma attached to it,” Sneha Katkar, lead product manager of Quick Heal, told TOI. The update also features a function that scours the internet — and the dark web — for personal data, and alerts users in case of a breach, suggesting active mitigation measures. Quick Heal has also deployed an anti-tracker measure to monitor cookies. Katkar said most data breaches — email addresses and banking information et al — occur on smartphone applications that lack two-factor authentication. “There is a ways to go for people to understand why cybersecurity is a necessity for smartphones. Many download the free version of our antivirus software on their phones, which shows a willingness to secure their phones. However, awareness of cybersecurity in mobility is still less than ideal,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/smartphone-security-is-still-an-afterthought-quick-heal/articleshow/86737957.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Pune||A platform and social network just for podcasts||Pune: The idea for PODTUBE.in — described as both a platform and social network just for audio content — was born out of “a gap” in the current social media environment. “Right now, you can’t share audio content directly onto platforms Facebook or YouTube unless you convert it into a video clip. That is where we felt there was a gap, especially with the development of audio content recently,” Bijoy Banerjee, founder of BBCOM consulting, which developed the platform, said. Banerjee launched the platform mid-2021, which now has thousands of registered users and hundreds of engagements per post. The platform does not commission any content on its own, but provides a platform for content creators, the vast majority of whom use it free of cost. The podcasts feature everything from parenting to financial literacy to the work of Indian classical music legends, as well as the occasional deep-dive into recent, headline-making events. Also popular is the art of storytelling, from ancient Indian and overseas fables, to even original stories published and read out by users on PODTUBE. Banerjee himself has a podcast on the platform, titled ‘Under the Hood’, in which he talks about stories and people out to make a difference. The most recent episode of the podcast talks about Suryakant Bhandepatil, who helps rescue kidnapped children, and whose own child was once kidnapped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/a-platform-and-social-network-just-for-podcasts/articleshow/86737992.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Several cyclists and also children participated while holding placards that read `BMC, Stop Destroying Powai Lake' and `Mumbai's Crocodiles Are Our Pride. BMC You Are On The Wrong Side!' among others. Activist Amrita Bhattacharjee commented: ``We are totally against the cycle track because Powai lake's area will further reduce if the cycle track is built. Stones and debris are being dumped into the lake for its construction; which will lead to flooding in future, while also affecting the crocodiles, fishes and other dependent biodiversity of the waterbody.'' Activists of Muse Foundation group also collected signatures of the participants, in order to write back to the authorities that the people are against the cycle track project, as it will further harm the environment. ``Several trees have already been cut down for the cycle track, while more greenery will also be destroyed for this project. We want to urge the BMC to come here and see how the basking area of crocodiles, and the place where they lay their eggs, will be concretized due to this disastrous plan of cycle track,'' said Tabrez Ali Sayed. Earlier, environmentalist D Stalin of Vanashakti NGO had petitioned in the NGT against the proposed cycle track at Powai lake.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan mining royalty touches new high in first half of FY 2022||JAIPUR: In what may come as a relief to the revenue-stressed state government, royalty collections from mining activities have increased to Rs 2,410 crore in the first six months of the current financial year. The collection is higher by Rs 474 crore compared to the same period in 2019-20, the non-Covid year. Compared to 2020-21, the Covid year, the royalty collection improved by Rs 589 crore in the first six months. A senior official of the department said the whole value chain — from mining, royalty collection and curbing illegal trade — have contributed to the increase in royalty collection. In fact, the department has gained Rs 21 crore additional income as penalty from people carrying out illegal mining and transfer of minerals. “Initiatives like auction of lease plots, allocation of blocks for bajri mining, tight surveillance of illegal mining, and monitoring at the top level have yielded results which is evident in the royalty revenues,” said Subodh Agarwal, additional chief secretary, mines and petroleum department. Agarwal said in the current financial year, over 4,744 cases of illegal mining has been registered and over 400 FIRs have been filed. “We have seized 4,818 vehicles and equipment engaged in illegal mining so far in the current year and collected penalty of Rs 36 crore. Out of this 21 crore has been received from illegal mining of bajri, its transportation and storage,” added Agarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-mining-royalty-touches-new-high-in-1st-half-of-fy22/articleshow/86740224.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Housing shortage forces BMC to give cash to the project-hit||MUMBAI: With the BMC facing a massive shortage of homes for housing project-affected persons (PAPs), it has decided, for the time being, to give out cash compensation to them instead of flats so that they make way for infrastructure projects. The BMC requires around 36,000 units to house PAP families. Its proposal is to give cash, based on market rates of probable flats, to tenants on BMC land who are hit by projects and even to affected slum dwellers. “But the proposal will not be for all PAPs. This will only be for extremely vital projects. The projects that are categorised as extremely vital will be decided by the municipal commissioner,” said a senior civic official. He said the BMC will arrive at a total of around 50,000 PAP families over the next two years. The official explained that as part of the cash compensation scheme, those PAPs living in structures before 1964, known as tolerated structures, will be given compensation based on market rates. “This will be one point two times the ready reckoner rates of the area. However, for slums it will be 75% of ready reckoner rates or Rs 30 lakh, whichever is higher,” the official said. After a major controversy, the BMC recently cut down on its plan to construct 12,000 units for PAPs across Mumbai by giving out credit notes instead of money to contractors. The civic body will now construct only 4,000 PAP units in Chandivli by ‘cashless’ means, which will cost it around Rs 2,498 crore. This amount will be paid to a private builder by way of credit notes, land TDR (transfer of development rights) and construction TDR. The BMC won’t have to shell out any money for the project. In April, municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal had punched holes in the BMC’s controversial plan to give out credit notes instead of money to contractors to construct housing units for PAPs. BMC officials said they have allotted 24,493 units to PAP families in the recent past. Soon, they are expecting 819 units in Chembur. As many as 3,828 units in Mahul are not being allotted to new PAPs due to court orders. “The timelines of major projects have been hit due to non-availability of PAP housing. If PAP housing units are not constructed, the city’s infrastructure development will slow down and come to a halt. We will get PAP units from Mhada and SRA, but it won’t be enough and the BMC will have to find out more ways to generate PAP housing units,” the official said. Samajwadi Party MLA Rais Shaikh said giving cash compensation will incentivise the construction of illegal slums. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said the BMC must construct more PAP units but there should be a detailed study of the credit note scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-housing-shortage-forces-bmc-to-give-cash-to-the-project-hit/articleshow/86740293.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Hubballi||Homecoming: Kharge given rousing reception||Kalaburagi : Opposition leader in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, was given a grand welcome when he returned Kalaburagi after two-and-a-half years on Saturday. Kharge had not turned up at Kalaburagi after his defeat in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. He got elected to Rajya Sabha after which he was elected as the opposition leader. Thousands of Congress workers took him in a 15km procession from Kalaburagi airport to the city. He first visited Sharanabasaveshwara Temple and Khwaja Bande Nawaz dargah, after which he addressed a public rally at Jai Bhavani hall near Rajapur. “I was defeated not by the people of Kalaburagi, but by the wrongdoings of Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and RSS,” he said, adding that he believes in only ethical politics based on morality. “BJP will not tolerate if Dalits and the poor stay united. How many Dalits and people from backward classes are given power by Modi and Yogi?” he asked. But Congress, while ensuring social justice, has given power to leaders of all communities, he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/homecoming-kharge-given-rousing-reception/articleshow/86713643.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Sea of shoppers on last weekend before Mahalaya, traffic crawls||Kolkata: The weather having improved, this weekend saw huge crowds and sales at the traditional markets of the city like New Market, Hatibagan and Gariahat, throwing traffic out of gear. The common scene that a sea of people had been jostling with each other and long queues of cars outside each of these markets brought vignettes from the puja shopping days in pre-Covid times. As for sales, shop owners and hawkers said that they had not only crossed the 2019 figures but also had to place fresh orders since this year’s stocks had been exhausted by this unprecedented demand. The shop owners inside New Market, for once, did not complain that shoppers stopped at the hawkers’ corners. Last weekend, the shops at New Market had reached 70%-80% of the 2019 sales. This weekend, they have crossed that mark. “Last year, we had suffered heavy losses due to the damages caused by the cyclone, Amphan while the Covid scare kept people away. This year we prayed hard for a good turnaround. The rain played a spoilsport but finally, people were back, braving the rain. This weekend, we have hardly had any time to breathe,” said Vinay Mangalani, proprietor of Bombay Silk Stores. At New Market, saris and dresses were top selling items but accessories, cosmetics, jewellery and crockery were also sold well. “Usually, it is during Diwali that we do good business but this year there is a spurt in crockery sales as well. This is probably because people had kept off buying such things last year. They are buying these items now,” said Shyamal Sasmal at Marvel, a crockery and kitchen accessory store at New Market. At Sreeleathers, around 9am, there was a long queue of people waiting for the shop to open its shutters. The store manager said that additional helpers were hired to handle the puja rush. At Gariahat, the crowds of several shops spilled on the roads on Sunday. The employees of the shops like House of SL ( a footwear mall near Triangular Park) helped people queue up outside. “The sales picked up a pace late. This weekend, we have exhausted the stocks and placed fresh orders from the weavers at Fulia and Shantipur” said a spokesperson at Mabesha. Hawkers were happier too. “We had anticipated such rush and opened by 10am on both Saturday and Sunday. Household linens and furnishings, saris and dresses were the top selling items and we have done better than 2019,” said Purna Samanta, a home linen seller outside Basanti Devi College. Some shoppers said that the only difference between 2019 and this year was the masks on every face. “Otherwise, it was the same push, nudge and high decibel at Gariahat. Last year, the scare had kept me off. This time, I had to buy a pile of puja gifts and I spent at least three hours at Gariahat,” said Anasuya Banerjee, who runs a dance academy. Shoppers thronged sari shops dotting the two sides of Bidhan Sarani from early hours. “On seeing the crowd at Hatibagan, we opened early and had good sales,” said the manager at Dalia, a popular sari shop. At Hatibagan, the crowd swelled and by afternoon, it was difficult for vehicles to ply on the road.  “In north Kolkata, people prefer to come in the evening for shopping. By noon on Sunday, it seemed that the entire north Kolkata had turned up at Sovabazar and Hatibagan,” said Ajoy Dutta, a paper merchant. Cops took to some quick fix solutions to keep the traffic moving on Gariahat and Hatibagan. Traffic crawled on the stretches of MG Road, JL Nehru Road, SN Banerjee Road and Rabindra Sarani. “The biggest challenge with shoppers is jaywalking. We removed the bus stops on Brabourne Road, MG Road, Esplanade and RR Crossing and allowed people to board buses at the crossings,” said an officer from Howrah traffic guard. At New Market, the south traffic guard removed the parking opposite Grand Hotel from early evening to increase road space. No cab was allowed to stop for long at the Lindsay Street entry. “We created a special channel at the New Market entry point for cabs. Two sergeants were deployed. At Gariahat, cops switched to the manual mode of traffic control for the crossing,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sea-of-shoppers-on-last-weekend-before-mahalaya-traffic-crawls/articleshow/86738033.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, there are 21 categories of disabilities. The state has identified eight categories, including blindness, low vision, people cured of leprosy, hearing impaired, locomotor disability, mental retardation, mental illness, and dwarfism. Director and joint secretary of the department, OP Bunkar, said all people, who will be identified and issued disability certificates during the campaign by the health department shall become eligible for the pension scheme. “Despite announcing during the budget that the divyang pensioners will be listed under the below poverty line category, the state has not notified it. Moreover, on the issue of notifying 21 categories of disabilities, the state government has not amended the pension rules yet. This shows negligence and irresponsibility of the officials,” said Hemant Bhai Goyal, vice-president of the Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh. An official of the department, requesting anonymity, said, “Now, there are eight categories of disabilities in the state.

---||Aurangabad||Sena would have been decimated in 2019 without BJP alliance: Chandrakant Patil||Aurangabad: BJP state president Chandrakant Patil on Monday sounded the poll bugle for the Deglur assembly bypoll by launching an attack on the Shiv Sena. “Benefitting from the alliance with the BJP, the Shiv Sena could win 56 seats in the 2019 assembly polls. It would have been decimated if there was no alliance and would have struggled to win even five seats,” he said, at a gathering in Nanded where former Sena MLA Subhash Sabne formally joined BJP. Stating that BJP would recreate the magic of the Pandharpur bypoll at Deglur too, Patil said the MVA alliance partners cannot stop BJP’s winning streak, which, he said, involves a win in the battle for the post of sarpanch for 6,500 gram panchayats and a victory in the Krishna sugar mill polls. “The voters in Maharashtra had voted the BJP to power in the previous assembly poll with the party getting 1.42crore votes in 164 seats. It was better than the tally of Sena, which had secured 94 lakh votes in 124 seats. The NCP could win 92 lakh votes while the Congress got 84 lakh,” he said. Earlier, Sabne once again criticised the Congress leadership in Nanded, which, he said, had a single-point agenda of humiliating the local Sena leaders since the formation of the MVA government. Nomination for the Deglur bypoll can be filed till October 8, and withdrawal is allowed till October 13. The polling is scheduled on October 30 and the vote counting is on November 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sena-would-have-been-decimated-in-2019-without-bjp-alliance-chandrakant-patil/articleshow/86761559.cms||---

The three MoUs include the Women for Climate initiative, Cities for Forests campaign and the E-Bus Mission. The climate action plan is being formulated by the civic body, along with the state environment ministry, and the World Resources Institute (WRI) India, which has been engaged as a technical partner for this process. “The Women for Climate initiative will develop women’s leadership in environmental protection and conservation initiatives in Mumbai. The Cities for Forests MoU on forest conservation, restoration and management has been signed by 57 cities around the world on September 22. A public awareness campaign will be launched to promote this initiative in Mumbai, as well as to encourage public participation,” the BMC said in a statement to the press. The E-Bus Mission is an agreement under the Transformative Urban Mobility Initiative (TUMI) to upgrade BEST buses. The civic body said that WRI, an international organisation, would bring crucial experience to the table when it comes to planning the growth of BEST’s fleet of electric buses. “It will provide easy technical guidance for BEST to convert from traditional buses to electric, as well as encourage at least five small towns to adopt electric buses in the future,” the BMC stated. WRI will help plan which routes e-buses should ply on, the timing and frequency, and all other aspects that can take this service to maximum passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-women-forests-e-buses-crux-of-bmc-climate-plan/articleshow/86740332.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Kolkata||Surge in footfall at malls, parking zones crammed||Kolkata: More than a lakh of shoppers streamed into different malls across the city on Saturday and Sunday. Most of the store owners at the malls said that they had either reached the 2019 pre-puja sales figures or crossed it. They heaved a sigh of relief at this comeback and said that things started looking positive finally. Though all these malls have parking lots, those spaces were full for several times in the day. This forced the shoppers to look for space to park their cars outside the malls. Kolkata Police made special arrangements to handle the surge. At malls like City Centre 1 and South City, the footfall touched one lakh on both Saturday and Sunday. At City Centre 2, it was around 90,000 on both the days. This was a growth of 30% since the last weekend. Mall officials said that Gandhi Jayanti being on a Saturday, all offices were closed and this gave an impetus to shopping, which bettered on Sunday. They are expecting the crowd to surge throughout next week, the last one in the run-up to Durga Puja. At South City, apart from anchor stores that got the maximum footfall, the food business did extremely well, despite it being a dry day, said spokesperson Deep Biswas. The mall has nine levels of parking and can accommodate 1,250 cars. However, the parking lot became full several times in the day and shoppers had no option but to look for parking space on Anwar Shah Road. “I anticipated this, so I walked with my husband all the way from our Lake Gardens residence,” said Amrita Majumdar. At City Centre 1, arrangements were made with the Bidhannagar Police to help shoppers park their cars outside the mall. Shoppers were seen parking as far as Central Park and then walking into the mall. “We were surprised when the footfall jumped to nearly one lakh on Saturday and crossed this mark on Sunday. We expect the trend to continue over the next weekend too,” said a spokesperson of Ambuja Neotia group that runs the mall. At City Centre 2 located at Newtown, the footfall was 80,000 on Saturday and nearly 90,000 on Sunday. “We have seen a growth of 15% in sales too as compared with the sales in the same month of 2019 and are very encouraged,” said the spokesperson. On Saturday, Acropolis mall saw encouraging footfall and business while on Sunday, there was a slump for about two hours from 1pm as there was a heavy localised downpour, said mall head, K Vijayan. “We have done very well in the segments of clothes, footwear and mobile phones this time and are definitely reminded of 2019. Our food business has done well too this weekend. We hope to get the shopping crowd throughout next week,” he said. The numbers coming back to the malls is encouraging but there is still scope for improvement, said Quest spokesperson, Sanjeev Mehra. “We expect this surge to improve further during Diwali,” he added. Shoppers had a harrowing time to find parking spaces in the evening. Cops at Jadavpur traffic guard said they would request the authorities of a mall located on Anwar Shah Road to increase the parking space temporarily||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/surge-in-footfall-at-malls-parking-zones-crammed/articleshow/86738078.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The accused, 39-year-old Sudhanshu Sharma, was looking for buyers to sell off the biscuit when he was detained by the police and later arrested. Shankar Dutt Sharma, superintendent of police (Jaipur rural), said an FIR was lodged at Kotwali police station in Delhi wherein complainant Satya Ranjan informed that he owned a jewellery shop called M/S Dalbir Sons.

Though geographically Goa is a smaller state, it has 68 species of rich and varied orchids that add to the natural glory of the state. Orchid flowers are mono-symmetrical as both halves of the flower mirror each other. Among the flowering plants orchids usually trick their pollinators into pollinating them and stick the pollinarium (structure in orchid flower which becomes attached to an insect during pollination) onto the animals before they even realise that they got tricked. Without the nutrients from the mother plant, orchid seeds take help from the environment in the form of a special fungi to germinate. All orchids are perennial herbs that do not have any permanent woody structure. Mandar Datar a well-known botanist who has been studying diversity of orchids told TOI, “Goa has 68 orchid species belonging to 28 genera of which 42 are epiphytic and 26 are terrestrial, 28 species are endemic of which 23 species are endemic to the Western Ghats. Distribution of orchids in Goa is concentrated mainly in the Western Ghats, which showcase 86% of the total orchid species.” He further said, “Among all the protected areas, the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in Sattari was found to be rich in orchid diversity with 39 species, followed by Bhagwan Mahavir Dharbandora and Cotigao (Canacona) Sanctuaries.” Though Goa occupies just 2% area of the Western Ghats, it is host to 7% of the endemic flowering plant species of the Western Ghats. The botanists VD Vartak in 1966 reported some orchids, RS Rao in 1986 recorded 21 species whereas botanists Mandar Datar and Lakshminarasimhan recorded 34 species of orchids from Goa. Suryakant Gaonkar a wildlifer from Bhuipal in Sattari said, “Mining, deforestation for developmental purposes, rampant encroachment are posing danger to pristine forest habitat thereby threatening the orchids.” Orchids are important components of the environment that play a role in the ecosystem to keep it vibrant and alive. They are indicators of the health of the ecosystem. In Goa Aerides (Draupadi Veni) and Rhynchostylis retusa (Seetechi veni) are appreciated as a symbol of sanctity and are used for their medicinal value. There is a need to create awareness for conservation of orchids and their gene pool in their natural habitats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-68-species-goa-scores-with-a-rich-orchid-diversity/articleshow/86738277.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Thane||Maharashtra: Palghar’s famed Wada Kolam rice gets GI tag||THANE: A variety of rice widely grown in Wada in Palghar district of Maharashtra has been given a ‘Geographical Indication’ (GI) tag, which will give it a unique identity as well as wider markets, a senior state agriculture official said on Sunday. Divisional agriculture joint director Ankush Mane said Wada Kolam rice got the GI tag in a meeting held in Mumbai on September 29. Wada Kolam, also known as Zini or Jhini rice, is a traditional variety grown in Wada tehsil of Palghar, with the grain being off white in colour. It is priced between Rs 60-70 per kilogram in domestic markets and has a sizable demand overseas as well, officials said. Anil Patil, a third-generation Wada Kolam farmer, said some 2,500 people are engaged in cultivating this variety in 180 villages in Wada taluka. Earlier, on September 29, the Alibaug white onion was given the GI tag, bringing worldwide recognition to its unique sweet taste, no-tears factor, as well as its medicinal properties. “It boosts immunity, helps with insomnia, blood cleaning, blood pressure and heat-related ailments,” said Karuna Navalkar, whose efforts were specially mentioned during the GI tag process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-palghars-famed-wada-kolam-rice-gets-gi-tag/articleshow/86740369.cms||---

Anti-monopoly and data security crackdowns starting in late 2020 have shaken the industry, which flourished for two decades with little regulation. Investor jitters have knocked over $1.3 trillion off the total market value of e-commerce platform Alibaba, games and social media operator Tencent and other tech giants. The party says anti-monopoly enforcement will be a priority through 2025. It says competition will help create jobs and raise living standards. President Xi Jinping’s government seems likely to stay the course even if economic growth suffers, say businesspeople, lawyers and economists. The crackdown reflects Xi’s public emphasis on reviving the party’s “original mission” of leading economic and social development, said Steve Tsang, a Chinese politics specialist at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.

---||World||China curbs political control of internet giants in bid to cut its reliance on West||BEIJING: The ruling Communist Party is tightening political control over China’s internet giants and tapping their wealth to pay for its ambitions to reduce reliance on US and European technology. Anti-monopoly and data security crackdowns starting in late 2020 have shaken the industry, which flourished for two decades with little regulation. Investor jitters have knocked over $1.3 trillion off the total market value of e-commerce platform Alibaba, games and social media operator Tencent and other tech giants. The party says anti-monopoly enforcement will be a priority through 2025. It says competition will help create jobs and raise living standards. President Xi Jinping’s government seems likely to stay the course even if economic growth suffers, say businesspeople, lawyers and economists. The crackdown reflects Xi’s public emphasis on reviving the party’s “original mission” of leading economic and social development, said Steve Tsang, a Chinese politics specialist at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. He said it could also help Xi politically if, as expected, he pursues a third five-year term as party leader. Chinese leaders don’t want to reimpose direct control of the economy but want private sector companies to align with ruling party plans, said Lester Ross, head of the Beijing office of law firm WilmerHale. “What they are worried about is companies getting too big and too independent of the party,” said Ross.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-curbs-political-control-of-internet-giants-in-bid-to-cut-its-reliance-on-west/articleshow/86742417.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Vaccination drive to continue in private hospitals during Durga Puja||KOLKATA: Even as private hospitals in Kolkata have decided to continue vaccination during the Puja, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), which has been inoculating around 25,000-30,000 recipients a day at its clinics and mega centres, is yet to take a decision, triggering a fear among the hospitals that they may be swarmed by those eager to take the shot during the festival, which offers a four-day leave from work. While the KMC rules allow vaccination centres to remain shut on Sundays and other public holidays, a final call is expected within a week. “Even though civic health clinics operate during the festival, the vaccination drive has started only this year. A final decision may be announced in a circular to be issued by the civic board chairman Firhad Hakim in a week,” said a KMC health department official. Private hospitals have decided to continue with the vaccination during the four days of Durga Puja from October 12 to 15. Some private hospitals, though, said that they could be shortening the hours, depending on the crowd. “We are going to operate normally and all our three counters — one each for Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V — will be functioning as usual. The crowd may grow since we have observed that more people are queuing up for vaccination on holidays. On October 2, which was a national holiday, the number of recipients had doubled from an average of 170 to 361,” said Peerless Hospital CEO, Sudipta Mitra. The vaccination will continue “uninterrupted” at AMRI Hospitals during the festival, said CEO Rupak Barua. “There will be no change in our schedule and everything will run as usual. We don’t expect a dip or a spurt in numbers during the festival,” said Barua. AMRI has been vaccinating more than 600 people across its three units and off-site centres. Medica Superspecialty Hospital, too, expects a swell in the crowd for vaccination during Puja and plans to stay open. “Our experience says that people prefer a non-Sunday holiday to take the jab. Durga Puja offers a perfect window, especially for the elderly, who often have to depend on others to take to them to a vaccination centre,” said Medica chairperson, Alok Roy. Medica has been vaccinating more than 400 a day. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) will “continue with vaccination like normal days” during the festival, according to zonal head R Venkatesh. “If we see low footfalls during the first two days, we will have fewer counters for the remaining days,” added Venkatesh. The KMC has been operating its vaccination centres from its 144 clinics and 50 mega centres. Many prefer to take the shot on a non-working weekday. That is why, the queues of people for vaccination may lengthen during the festival, said Mitra. “We are yet to draw up a puja roster but so far there’s no plan to alter the vaccination programme. There would be many who are waiting for the puja holidays to take the shot,” said Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-drive-to-continue-in-pvt-hosps-during-puja/articleshow/86738130.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Jaipur||High auto fuel taxes bring sales down by 30% in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The hike in fuel prices has put an extra burden on household budgets in the state which has the highest tax levies on auto fuel in the country. The state government levies the highest VAT in the country on both petrol and diesel. Vehicles entering or travelling through the state avoid buying fuel because of the high rates causing tax loss to the government. Sunit Bagai, president of Petroleum Dealers' Association, said, “The state is losing 30% of auto fuel sales because of high taxes compared to neighbouring states. Passenger vehicles and goods carriers fill up in other states before entering Rajasthan as the rates are cheaper. On the other hand, the state is taxing the common man to compensate for the loss.” The state government brought down the VAT on petrol and diesel in February this year by 2%. After the reduction, the chief minister and other political leaders in the state put the blame on Centre for the high fuel rates. In fact, even after reducing VAT rates on petrol and diesel to 36% and 26%, respectively, the existing tax is still higher than any other state in the country. Besides VAT, the road cess also needs to be reduced, Bagai said. The hike in diesel prices increases rates of every other commodity as the transportation cost goes up. On its part, the Centre has resisted pressure so far to bring down central taxes on fuels. Instead of reducing taxes, it is trying to bring fuels under GST.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/high-state-auto-fuel-taxesbring-sales-down-by-30/articleshow/86740442.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Nagpur||Around 400 schools in city expected to reopen from today||Nagpur: Around 400 schools in the city are expected to welcome students back to classrooms from Monday, in line with the permission from authorities allowing the same. This will be the first time this academic session that city schools will host offline classes. Before this, schools only in rural areas (Std VIII-XII) were permitted to operate. While city schools get the same leeway, rural ones have also got permission to start Std V-VII. As per information received from Vaishali Jamdar, deputy director of education (Nagpur division), 426 schools may reopen from Monday. Of this, 353 are private schools, while the remaining are run by NMC, said Jamdar. District education officials held a videoconference with schools and advised them about the standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be followed. Chintaman Vanjari, Nagpur district education officer, said, “Schools have been briefed and all safety protocols will be followed.” Since schools in rural areas have been functioning for almost three months now, education officials are convinced that it won’t be a big challenge. A junior education officer, who was coordinating with schools, said, “All principals interact with each other on WhatsApp groups of their school associations. Some are in rural, some in urban, so everyone is learning from the other. For the department, the experience of operating schools in rural areas is already there, hence nothing wrong in expecting a smooth transition.” Many more schools will reopen later in the week or post festive season. Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh), said, “We will open a day later because on Monday we have scheduled meeting with all stakeholders.” There are many like Tiwari who are first trying to complete the reopening formalities like sanitization, briefing all staff on protocols etc. Principal of a grant-in-aid school said this time, reopening is not such a big challenge. “We had all opened up in the last academic session. In fact, we had quite a long spell of reopening from November, before everything was shut down as the second wave hit us. Every single school has the experience on reopening and staff is trained to handle all SOPs,” said the principal. While there are over 1,500 private schools in Nagpur, not all have Std IX-XII classes. “Some have sections only till primary or the higher levels are registered under a separate Unified District Information on School Education (UDISE) number,” said an education official. The UDISE is like Aadhaar number for schools. “Hence, the reopening numbers may seem less but technically we can’t have 100% reopening as those class levels don’t exist in that school,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/around-400-schools-in-city-expected-to-reopen-from-today/articleshow/86740257.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

This has affected the health services at the GMCH with the daily number of major operations carried out dropping slightly, said the authorities concerned. “While fewer planned major operations could be performed due to the strike by the resident doctors, emergency operations and other health services remain unaffected at the GMCH. We have roped in the teaching faculties and senior resident doctors to fill the void formed by the absence of the resident doctors,” said GMCH superintendent Dr Kashinath Choudhary. Around 5,000 doctor members of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) are on an indefinite strike to press for fee-waiver and incentives towards Covid duties. The MARD held a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at Mumbai on Monday afternoon. MARD vice-president Dr Pranav Jadhav said the CM sounded positive during the meeting. “We have a scheduled meeting with Maharashtra medical education minister Amit Deshmukh on Monday evening. Based on the outcome of the meeting, we will take a call on the future course of action,” he said. Among other demands, MARD wants the construction of new hostels for resident doctors across the state and renovation of the existing hostels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/doctors-stir-affects-daily-major-surgeries-at-gmch/articleshow/86761581.cms||---

The accused, Rakesh Dhulap (27) from Lanja, was to sell the scales, said the police. It is illegal to hunt or sell body parts of a pangolin as the species is protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. However, its meat is in demand for consumption and for “medicinal” purpose while the scales are used in superstition activity. Sources said that a rising number of cases of poaching of the pangolin in Ratnagiri district could be an indicator of a wildlife racket. Officials did not specify monetary value of the scales as laws do not permit this. The pangolin scales weighing 4.3kg were found in a bag. The motorcycle and cellphone of the accused have been confiscated and he has been sent to police custody till Tuesday, said Hemantkumar Shah, crime branch inspector, Ratnagiri. A criminal offence has been registered, said Dinkar Surya, assistant inspector at Ratnagiri rural police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-1-held-with-4kg-pangolin-scales-officials-hint-at-poaching-scam/articleshow/86740453.cms||Umesh K Parida
---||Delhi||North Delhi corporation’s Rani Kheda waste plant operational||NEW DELHI: Making arrangements for processing the entire construction and demolition (C&D) waste generated in the area, North Delhi Municipal Corporation has made its Rani Kheda C&D plant operational. Officials claimed that C&D waste had started coming to the plant and work to process 1,000 tonne of waste daily would begin as soon as the machines are set up. Currently, North DMC has a C&D plant operational at Burari with a processing capacity of 2,000 tonne of waste every day. “On an average, 2,200 tonnes of waste is generated in the area daily. Of them, we are able to process 2,000 tonne at Burari. But we needed arrangements to meet the current, as well as the future requirements so this plant was in the pipeline for a long time,” a North DMC official said. “Due to the Covid pandemic, generation of C&D waste has been reduced as development projects are fewer in number. We are expecting the waste generation to increase by the end of this year when construction activities resume,” he added. Developed through a new technology, the plant at Rani Kheda will be pollution-free as a separate set of machinery would be installed to settle down dust particles and keep material semi-wet. “There would be a machine installed to sprinkle the water constantly and depending on requirement. This would help the dust mitigation regularly. Considering the issue of dust pollution increases during winter season, this arrangement would help in utilising all C&D waste from roadsides as well as reducing dust problem,” the official explained. The by-products of the C&D plant would include stones, bricks, tiles and soil. “The concessionaire can sell these items to the government agencies or others for utilisation in various development projects. We are expecting to make this project fully operational by October end,” said the official. For the convenience of the general public, the civic agency has identified sites for dumping of waste generated from houses during the construction work. “However, for material in larger amounts, the civic agency asked to dump it directly to plant and pay some prices also. But people often dispose of the waste on road sides or open sites leading to pollution and inconvenience,” the civic official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corpns-rani-khedawaste-plant-operational/articleshow/86738188.cms||Vibha Sharma

Most of these were parked near the bus stand and its rear side. People, including shopkeepers and traders of the areas where these buses used to pick up and drop passengers, have hailed the action by the minister. Warring has announced that on Monday he would start a WhatsApp number on which transport complaints could be lodged. Warring, who was on his maiden visit to Ludhiana after becoming the transport minister, went to the main bus stand and began inspecting the private vehicles, especially the sleeper coach buses parked outside the stand. The moment he began the surprise inspection, many buses’ drivers drove away from the spot. In some cases, drivers and conductors of such buses disappeared. Warring said, “Days of the bus mafia, which was born under the previous SAD-BJP government rule, are numbered. This mafia will be wiped off the state and bus operators complying with the rules and operating honestly need not fear. If anyone breaks the laws, evades taxes or harasses or fleeces passengers, he will face strict action, even if he is ‘well-connected’.” “I received complaints that several private operators here were plying buses illegally from spots near the Ludhiana bus stand and they often fleeced passengers by overcharging and also harassed them by misbehaving or not running buses as per schedule. So, I came here to check the situation myself and found many buses breaking rules. In order to ensure easy lodging of complaints against wrongdoings by bus operators or their staff, I will launch a WhatsApp helpline number on Monday,” Warring added.Regional transport authority (RTA) Narinder Singh Dhaliwal said, “About 25 buses have been impounded for offences like plying without documents or permit and non-payment of taxes among other things. Majority of those impounded were found parked near the bus stand and were scheduled to ply long routes.”Meanwhile, some passengers, who had bought tickets for the buses that were impounded, looked hassled as the booking staff fled the spot. They neither got back ticket money nor an alternative arrangement to travel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/in-raja-warrings-crackdown-on-transport-mafia-25-buses-seized/articleshow/86735778.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Metro line, flyover to go parallel for half km||NEW DELHI: Apart from a first-of-its-kind double-deck viaduct and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) first cantilever bridge across Yamuna, the Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor of DMRC’s Phase IV project will also see the first-time use of ‘integrated portals’, which will support both the Metro viaduct and a road flyover running parallel for nearly half a kilometre. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said that the integrated flyover-cum-metro viaduct structure, along with a vehicle underpass, is being built near Soorghat in north Delhi, in association with Delhi government’s Public Works Department. “This PWD flyover and vehicle underpass are part of a proposed elevated road along Yamuna river parallel to the Ring Road between the Wazirabad flyover (Signature Bridge) and Ring Road near DND,” Dayal said. The corporation will erect ‘integrated portals’, on one side of which the Metro viaduct will be placed and on the other side, the PWD flyover used for vehicular movement will be constructed. Similar kinds of structures have been used by DMRC earlier in many locations where it is not possible to erect a pier (pillar) directly beneath the viaduct. It is then that structures with two piers with a span on top are constructed and the viaduct is supported by the span. Dayal said a total of 21 portals with an average width of 26 metres and height of 10 metres will be erected. In addition, a vehicle underpass shall also be constructed below these portals, which will cater to movement of vehicles coming from Outer Ring Road. While the width of the Metro viaduct will be 10.5 metres, the road flyover moving adjacent and parallel to it will be a three-lane road of approximately 10 metres width. “This proposed PWD flyover shall run adjacent to the existing flyover, which is currently operational from Wazirabad to ISBT near Soorghat. Delhi Metro will construct the portals and the Metro viaduct over it and PWD will erect the superstructure for flyover on the already constructed portals in future,” Dayal said. “In addition, the underpass will be constructed by DMRC for traffic movement from Outer Ring Road towards Signature bridge. This underpass shall merge with the road on the other side of Najafgarh drain,” he said. The Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor will complete the ‘ring’ of the Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar), making it the country’s first ring corridor with a length of about 70 kilometres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-line-flyover-to-go-parallel-for-half-km/articleshow/86738370.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||MC proposes to produce 10MW energy from Tajpur Road waste dump||Ludhiana: For the disposal of garbage lying at Tajpur Road dump as well as the garbage being collected daily, the civic body has finally prepared a detailed project report (DPR) to be submitted to local bodies department for approval. The civic authorities are planning to implement the Okhla model in the city, which envisages that energy can be produced from waste. The authorities have proposed that 9MW to 10MW energy can be generated from the garbage at Tajpur Road. The city is generating nearly 1,100 to 1,200 tonne of garbage from households daily. The officials claimed that with this much garbage, they can generate at least 6MW energy, but in proposal they have made provision for more, keeping in mind future projections. According to the proposal, wet waste will go for composting and dry will go for energy generation. DPR consists of two parts — one is to carry garbage from secondary collection points to main dump and second is processing of garbage into energy. As far as door-to-door garbage collection is concerned, civic body is planning to implement Chandigarh model and garbage will be lifted through e-rickshaws. While giving the information about the solid waste management plant, joint commissioner Ankur Mahindroo said, “The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has an agreement with state government to purchase the electricity produced through such measures, so we will also be able to sell energy generated through waste.” He said there was some difference between cost paid by PSPCL and cost in energy generation, but now the MC house has agreed to bear that difference. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “We are ready with DPR and it will now go for the approval from government after which tenders will be floated.” He said plant will be installed at Tajpur Road dump, as there is space there. Notably, since February 4, the processing of garbage was stalled at Tajpur dump after MC had terminated the agreement with A2Z Waste Management Company and since then garbage is being piled up at the dump. 5 metric tonne of legacy waste to be processed The civic body is also going to start processing legacy waste that is lying at the dump for many years now. In the survey conducted by the civic body, it was revealed that around 22 metric tonne of legacy waste is lying there. Initially, 5 metric tonne will be treated through bioremediation and the rest would be cleared in phases if found successful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mc-proposes-to-produce-10mw-energy-from-tajpur-road-waste-dump/articleshow/86735843.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Congress high command nod to tie-up with ‘like-minded’ parties||PANAJI: After months of dodging the issue, Congress on Sunday finally said that its high command has given the go-ahead for an alliance with like-minded parties in Goa for the 2022 assembly elections. Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao and senior election observer for Goa, former Union minister P Chidambaram, have been tasked with commencing talks and thrashing out the modalities for the alliance. Rao and Chidambaram will commence a six-day tour of the state from October 8, when they will meet various stakeholders, political party representatives and non-political functionaries too. With this, the ball will be set rolling for an alliance, sources said “The Congress high command has asked us to talk to like-minded parties and like-minded individuals to... finalise things. The last meeting we had in Delhi, all the leaders were there, Chidambaram was there and that was the mandate given,” Rao told reporters. Rao said that the contours of the alliance would be announced closer to the election dates, but hinted at a tie-up with Goa Forward Party along the lines of the “informal alliances during the municipality elections”. For Margao municipal council, opposition leader Digambar Kamat and GFP chief Vijai Sardesai came together and their alliance defeated BJP’s determined bid to wrest power in South Goa’s commercial capital. “I don’t want to name any particular party or individual but we are in talks. It should be in the interest of Goa. It should be a stable government. We can’t have this kind of repetition again where it leads to instability,” said Rao. “Like minded parties which believe in secular philosophies, we are ready to talk to them.” NCP and GFP have been calling for opposition unity to take on BJP in the 2022 polls. In the same breath, Rao said that the arrival of “money power, muscle power” in Goa is a dangerous trend as it will aid BJP in the coming elections. He said that the Trinamool Congress and Aam Aadmi Party were offering anywhere between Rs 15 lakh to Rs 15 crore to induce former MLAs, ZP members and even municipal councillors. “There are two forces working. One force is a fascist force of BJP, which wants to completely control this country... the second is parties, which are operating here to ensure that BJP wins, they are not working here to see that they win or the secular front wins,” said Rao. He claimed that there is a nation-wide “big conspiracy” to see that the secular votes are divided and Congress weakened. “If you look at it, all these other new political parties are trying to encroach upon the Congress because they don’t have their own faces, they don’t have their own candidates,” said Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-high-command-nod-to-tie-up-with-like-minded-parties/articleshow/86740561.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: October 8 meet to discuss work on Satara-Kagal highway||KOLHAPUR: District guardian minister Satej Patil will chair a meeting of public representatives of the constituencies through which the Satara-Kagal stretch of the Pune-Bengaluru National Highway 48 passes on October 8. The meeting will suggest modifications in the detailed project report (DPR) for the six-laning of the stretch. Hatkanangale MLA Raju Awale wrote a letter to the sarpanches of the villages along the NH-48. It provided details of the date of the meeting and this was confirmed by the guardian minister’s office. Shiroli stretch of NH-48 falls in Awale’s constituency. “As per the instructions of Union minister Nitin Gadkari, the meeting has been scheduled on October 8 to suggest changes in the project. Therefore, I invite suggestions from the village heads so that necessary changes can be made in the six-laning work and the issue of the inundation of the highway does not arise in the future,” he said. Officials from all three districts — Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara — and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will attend the meeting and make final changes in the project design. The suggestions will include ways to avoid the inundation of the highway during the flooding of the several rivers that pass along the road stretch. During the recent floods in July, the crucial Satara-Kagal section was shut for several days due to waterlogging at some locations such as the entrance of Kolhapur city and at Shiroli. Gadkari on September 25 laid the foundation stone of six-laning of the Satara-Kagal stretch, which is 127.15km in length. The cost of the project is Rs 4,479 crore. The project aims to lessen the traffic congestion along the stretch. Earlier, the public representatives suggested doing away with existing concrete elevations and instead replacing them with pillar elevations to ensure smooth passage of flood water. All suggestions will be incorporated in the final plan. The highway will operate smoothly even during floods, assured Gadkari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/oct-8-meet-to-discuss-work-on-satara-kagal-highway/articleshow/86761630.cms||---

The submission was made when a plea seeking removal of encroachment in front of a property came up for hearing before the court. Justice Rekha Palli issued notice and sought response of Delhi government, DCP (south), Hauz Khas, on the petition filed by the property’s owner. The court asked the authorities to file a status report and listed the matter for further hearing on October 8. Advocate Anupam Srivastava, representing the city government and DCP (south), submitted that the authorities are conscious of their duty and have already planned to remove the illegal encroachment on October 4. He said it is necessary to have requisite police assistance to carry out the drive and assured the court that police will render the necessary help to Delhi government’s PWD to carry out the drive on Monday. The court also issued notice to the person who has carried out the alleged unauthorised construction and whom the petitioners have not been able to identify. The plea said that during the Covid-19 pandemic, somebody trespassed and illegally constructed a temple on public land, that is a footpath, at Bhishma Pitamah Marg, right in front of the petitioners’ property. The petition claimed that taking advantage and shelter of the illegal construction, people gather there and indulge in rowdiness and gambling and the encroached structure impedes full access to the petitioners’ building.

A cash-strapped Pune Cantonment Board has not been able raise sufficient funds to start the repairs, necessary for the safety of residents of Pune Cantonment who visit the market daily, and for the stall owners. Pune Cantonment Board’s (PCB) chief executive officer Amit Kumar said that the total cost of the work was Rs2.5 crore, and they were unable to initiate the work because of paucity of funds. “We are supposed to deposit Rs1.25 crore with the district administration to get the remaining funds of Rs 1.25 crore from it. However, we were unable to generate these funds. We had told all the vendors operating in the market to pay the pending rent charges worth Rs25 lakh, but they have failed to do so till date,” he said. Pune Cantonment's MLA Sunil Kamble said that Rs 25 lakh from his MLA funds have been sent to the cantonment board recently. “I have also conducted two meetings with vendors and the cantonment board authorities in the past. However, there is no progress on the project so far. I will conduct another meeting with them,” he added. Kumar said they had received the funds from the MLA and were waiting for Rs25 lakh from the vendors. “ The board will deposit the remaining Rs75 lakh from its budget,” he added. Manzur Shaikh, president of the traders’ association of the market, said that they had paid Rs23 lakh to the PCB, so far. “Many traders are facing problems in the market due to the pending repairs. The Cantonment board must show more involvement in this project to complete at least the basic repairs at the earliest. Stall owners have been running their businesses in a poor condition from these stalls,” Shaikh said. Shashikant Pardeshi, who runs a fish stall in the market, said he was now operating from the open areas because of the damage to the fish section. “We have paid all rent dues to the cantonment board. The market is in a bad shape. It needs greater attention to get a basic working standard,” he said. Regular visitors too said the cantonment board was not making enough efforts to spruce up the market. They said that the market was an unsafe place and needed a complete overhaul. Samir Shaikh, a regular visitor to the market, said, “The board does not have any control over the market's daily functioning. There is no discipline among vendors operating at this place. They do not maintain hygiene. If we point it out it, they are rude,” Netraprakash Bhog, lawyer and an old resident of the Pune Camp, said that the cantonment board is responsible for lowering the standards of this market. He said, “Over the years, it has not paid enough attention to keep the market in a good condition. Once upon a time, the place was known for its cleanliness and architectural value. Now, it is unhygienic and chaotic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shivaji-market-pride-of-pune-cantt-awaits-funds-for-spruce-up-after-fire/articleshow/86738395.cms||Sandip Dighe

The residents had complained about water and power supply disconnection. “The health officer, primary health centre, Chimbel, may consider the grant of the supply of potable water and electricity to the residents of the flats in the Mudras Mansion at Santa Cruz on payment of the appropriate fees and on the said applicant undertaking to continue to pay the bills from time to time, failing which the PWD and the electricity department will be free to disconnect the supply,” stated the chairperson of the commission Justice U V Bakre and member Desmond D’Costa. There was a common water connection to the building which had been obtained in the name of the owner of the plot, Mukundraj Mudras in 2018. The building has eight flats and the PWD and water connection was disconnected due to arrears of bill. Mudras had also applied for temporary disconnection on March 12, 2020 citing the reason that all the co-occupants of the building are not contributing towards the units consumed for the common utility. The electricity department placed the meter under temporary disconnection. Aggrieved by this, some residents had approached the human rights commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pay-arrears-to-restore-power-water-supply-st-cruz-bldg-residents-told/articleshow/86738407.cms||---
---||Goa||Education department to Goa govt: Allow offline exams for Class X, XII||PANAJI: The directorate of education has written to the state government recommending that exams for Classes X and XII are held in the offline mode, said a senior official at the chief minister’s office. The government will soon take a call on this, he said. The directorate said that the exams should be conducted following Covid-19 protocols including masks, body temperature checks, sanitisation and limited seating capacity. The official also said that the directorate has recommended to the CM that in villages where Covid cases are negligible, schools should be allowed to start physicial classes. Last week, the state’s Covid-19 expert committee decided to recommend to the government to reopen schools for Classes IX and X, as well as higher secondary schools. However, it said that a plan of action in the form of appropriate SOPs would have to be drawn up by the government before deciding on the reopening. Schools, too, would have to be given time to prepare, committee member Shekhar Salkar had said. The members felt that lower classes should not be opened. “However, parents can decide if they want their children to attend classes online. The option should be given to them. All SOPs will have to be developed by the government, the expert committee can’t do it as we don’t know the structure of the schools,” he had said. The state teachers’ association is in agreement with the expert committee on starting schools. The teachers state that they want physical classes to begin for students of these higher classes as soon as possible, as students have already lost out on a lot of time. On September 19, after almost six months, the state government lifted the state-level curfew imposed in view of Covid-19, and has put restrictions to limit the spread of Covid-19. The state government’s new order had permitted schools to reopen, subject to issuance of separate standard operating procedure (SOP) by the education department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/education-dept-to-govt-allow-offline-exams-for-class-x-xii/articleshow/86740584.cms||Murari Shetye

As Dasara festival is about to start from October 7, temple authorities are busy making necessary arrangements. Queue lines, rest houses for the pilgrims and prasadampadu counters have already been constructed. Officials are expecting around 2 lakh devotees for darshan. Arrangements are being made for free food distribution. Meanwhile, the temple authorities are worried about the poor response to the online darshan tickets. Officials had placed 10,000 tickets per day for online purchase. But devotees reportedly didn’t show interest in buying them. “As per the Hindu Aagama, one visits a temple when he/she is extremely happy or in some problem. Most of the visits are unplanned. Insisting us to make online reservations for darshan tickets is against our religious beliefs. The endowments department is bound to provide darshan facility to devotees who visit temples. But officials are imposing restrictions in the name of Covid-19. Happy that devotees taught a lesson by showing disinterest in buying online tickets for Dasara darshan,” said Chikkala Rajanikanth, Hindu Yuva Shakti (HYS) state president. Now, the temple trust board has changed its decision and decided to arrange darshan ticket counters at multiple points in queue lines. “We have decided to sell darshan tickets in offline mode by arranging counters. This decision is to facilitate darshan. As announced earlier, only 10,000 devotees will be permitted for the darshan during the festival days, including online and offline reservations. And devotees have to follow the mandatory Covid-19 protocols,” trust board chairman Paila Sominaidu said. Temple authorities have procured around 2 lakh masks and also set up thermal screening points and hand sanitation points at multiple locations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ten-ticket-counters-to-enable-durga-darshan/articleshow/86738390.cms||Venu Lanka

Yash Pal is 61 now, too old to work the fields, making the rounds of courts for 19 years since then and keeping handwritten records of every failed attempt. “I sold off my nine-bigha land for Rs 25 lakh to take up the case in court — nine times in the Supreme Court and 11 in the (Allahabad) high court. I had sold off everything I owned,” Yash Pal told TOI. “The eight cops (accused in the case) would never turn up or fight the case at the same time. Each would appeal against a verdict in turn, so the case kept dragging on, from lower courts to higher courts … I hope this time, I get justice.” Last Thursday, the Supreme Court imposed a fine of Rs 7 lakh on the UP government, saying, “The laxity with which State has proceeded in the present case speaks volumes of how State machinery is defending or protecting its own police officers … Normally, we are slow in entertaining petitions directly filed in this Court but in the extraordinary circumstances of this case, we have entertained this petition to ensure that justice be given to the petitioner, which has been denied for about two decades.” Singh had moved the apex court under Article 32 (the right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed). It was only last month, after the SC issued notices, that two of the accused were arrested. “What will I do with the money? I know what to expect. The accused will try and delay things again. They have been doing that and it’s why I would keep running from the court in Delhi to the one in Allahabad every month, trying to prove my son’s innocence and that it was a staged encounter,” Yash Pal said. That day, 19 years ago, Pradeep had left for his aunt’s place in Delhi. “He did not return. The following morning, we started looking for him,” Yash Pal said. “When we approached the police, they said he had been killed in an encounter after he was caught in a robbery. We had everything we needed at the time. He was so happy to have been admitted to an engineering college. He had no reason to steal anything.” As he fought his cases, he said, he kept receiving threats. “But I had to keep fighting for my child.” His daughter is married and another son has just started his own small business. What Yash Pal never allows out of his sight is his small notebook, in which he has written down the cases he has fought. The scribbled list ends at number 36, the one in SC now, which he hopes will be his last in the long battle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/sold-all-to-fight-case-says-dad-of-boy-killed-in-fake-encounter-19-yrs-ago/articleshow/86735999.cms||Ishita Mishra

At 35.8 of 100 persons, SAS Nagar has the highest number of fully-vaccinated residents, followed by Hoshiarpur (29.6), Pathankot (25.8), Jalandhar (25.5), SBS Nagar (24.5), Rupnagar (21.7) and Ludhiana. In Mansa, just 9.1 per 100 persons of the entire population have received both the doses.With 60.7 persons per 100 of the entire population having received the first dose here, Ludhiana is at the third position in Punjab. SAS Nagar is at the top (84.8), followed by Pathankot, SBS Nagar (both 61.4), Hoshiarpur and Ludhiana (both 60.7) and Jalandhar (60.6). In Sangrur, just 38.8 per 100 persons of the entire population have received the first dose.The data of the last two months shows that 16.2 of 100 persons of the entire population had received both the doses till September 10; 14.2 till August 31; and 13.1 till August 12. There has been a 7% increase from August-end till October 2. Ludhiana had 48.4 per 100 persons of the entire population who had received the first dose till September 10 and 42 till August 31. There has been around 20% increase in the first dose beneficiaries since August-end.In Punjab, 48.4 persons per 100 have received the first shot and 16.8 the second.The health department officials said the number of vaccinated persons per 100 eligible ones has witnessed a major rise.An official said, “As majority of the eligible persons has received the first dose, the number of the fully vaccinated will increase. We were receiving good number of vaccines till recently, but for some days, the supply, especially of Covishield, has not been sufficient.”Officials said the number of persons who are eligible for vaccination (above 18 years old) is around 26 lakh in the district. “It is vital that the percentage of fully vaccinated eligible persons should increase. If it rises to around 70%, then there are more chances of herd immunity.

Rs 50 lakh will be paid to the claimant of the insured person under the insurance scheme. Speaking to the media here on Sunday, Dr Jayalal said the medical profession, which is linked with the welfare of the common man, has been taken for a ride by successive governments in the last two decades through their misplaced priorities and poor budgetary allocations. “The commercial establishments and industries are getting various sops and incentives in the name of ease of doing business. But the governments are regulating the medical profession with stringent non-reforming regulations,” said Dr Jayalal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/implement-insurance-scheme-properly-ima/articleshow/86738422.cms||---

The upgrade comes ahead of the commissioning of the Margao-Curchorem (Sanvordem) double-tracked route SWR. The pre non–interlocking works will be carried out from October 3 to 8. Non-interlocking works will be carried out on October 9 and 10 on the Margao-Curchorem section, SWR sources said. The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CSR) recently granted authorisation for the opening of commercial services of passenger and freight traffic on the Margao-Sanvordem section. Non-interlocking works pertain to shifting of station master’s signalling apparatus from one system to another. “During this period, signalling operations shift to manual mode for the existing line, completely or partially. The idea is that train services should largely continue during the period without compromising on the safety aspect,” chief PRO, SWR, Aneesh Hegde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rail-board-plans-track-upgrade-hits-swr-trains/articleshow/86740609.cms||---

Around 200 nursing students will be trained at the proposed college. Pune Municipal Corporation’s health department runs 52 out-patient departments (OPDs), two mobile hospitals, and 18 maternity homes. Kamla Nehru general hospital and Naidu Hospital are being operated by the civic body. “We have seen how the health system collapsed during the pandemic. Though the administration could control the pandemic, it took months of preparation. Many people lost their lives in this period,” said Rajashree Shilimkar, a member of the committee. Archana Musale, another committee member, said work on a civic-run medical college is under way now. “If a nursing college is attached, it will help provide trained staff to the health department and strengthen the civic health infrastructure,” said Musale. According to PMC officials, the municipal medical college will commence operations soon. PMC is conducting walk-in interviews for professors. Bharatratna Atal Bihari Medical College has been given final approval and the admission process will start begin in December.

The wildlife conservationists working extensively in the tiger corridors, wildlife sanctuaries and tiger reserves of Telangana attributed the increasing risk of poaching to the forest department’s decision to hide information about the big cats, especially after the death of two tigers that happened in 2018 and 2019. “This decision of the forest department to hide the information about tiger population is further endangering their existence in Telangana. When you hide the information, there won’t be any transparency, there won’t be any checking, and nobody will follow-up,” said SK Sandeep Reddy Poncharam, a wildlife conservationists and tribal educator, who has been working in the region since 2005. In Eturnagaram, Reddy said that the developmental activities and commercialization of the forest areas, especially to benefit the non-tribals who come to witness the Sammakka Sarakka jatara every year are also among the reasons behind the shrinking of forest area and increase in poaching activities. Experts also said that despite acquiring the status of wildlife sanctuary, the wildlife sanctuaries in the state have no special privilege for these forest areas. “There are no dedicated wildlife wardens and conservators,” a wildlife conservationist pointed out. As per the All-India Tiger Estimation 2018, there are 26 tigers in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wildlife-conservationists-questionsteps-taken-to-protect-forest-tigers-in-t/articleshow/86740631.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Goa||Goa: Green body nod to cricket stadium, but asks for urban forest around site||PANAJI: The Goa state expert appraisal committee (Goa-SEAC), an advisory environmental body to the state government, has given its go-ahead for the Goa state environment impact assessment authority (Goa-SEIAA) to clear the Goa Cricket Association’s proposed stadium project at Dhargalim. The Goa-SEAC has, however, recommended that a precondition for approval should be set that the GCA develop an urban forest within the stadium complex. The GCA is constructing the stadium on a plateau in Dhargalim, which will involve the loss of 850 trees. It has said that it will compensate for the loss of trees by planting more than 2,500 others, but the Goa-SEAC has recommended development of an urban forest. “The committee has decided to recommend the proposal for grant of prior environmental clearance to the Goa-SEIAA. The project proponent has to comply with the following general conditions: The project proponent should develop an urban forest with local species in and around an area of at least 2,000 sq m,” the Goa-SEAC has said. The project is coming up on a 1.89 lakh sq m area, where the built-up area will be around 48,000 sq m. The stadium will have seating capacity of 32,000, with parking for more than 3,000 vehicles. “The project proponent will provide a landscape bed of 600mm wide x 600mm deep, along the periphery of the plot, to carry out the plantation. The treated water from the sewage treatment plant will be pumped through high flow drips on these beds to prevent outflow of treated sewage water outside the premises,” the Goa-SEAC has said. It has recommended that charging points for electric vehicles should also be provided inside the stadium. The stadium project should be allowed to begin operations with a construction of minimum five years for maintenance of its sewage treatment plants, the Goa-SEAC has recommended. The GCA has said that the project will include two sewage treatment plants, besides solar panels to make the stadium energy efficient. The Goa-SEAC noted that while the association has submitted an ecology and biodiversity report, a report on the faunal diversity of the plateau will be required before any construction can begin, a condition which has been accepted by the cricket association. The environment body has also suggested that the stadium should include provision for rooftop water harvesting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/green-body-nod-to-cricket-stadium-but-asks-for-urban-forest-around-site/articleshow/86740637.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

School van owners, who spoke to TOI, said with a cap on seating, it was impossible to operate considering the high cost of fuel and vehicle maintenance. Milind Sawant, a school van owner and operator who turned to autorickshaw driving full time, recently tried restarting his van which has been parked at one spot since March 2020. “My vehicle has stalled. While two parents contacted me, the 50% seating capacity means earning any profit is impossible,” said Sawant, adding that he has offered to drop a limited number of students by autorickshaw and some parents are considering it.  “All vans need proper maintenance, which will against cost a lot. And with the rising fuel costs, it is impossible for to ply school vans again with few students to ferry,” said another van operator, who said he has also turned to driving and autorickshaw and is ready to transport one-two students if parents contact him. “However, transporting school children in autorickshaws is illegal and I can get into trouble with the police,” he added.  Raju Latamble, who owns around 250 school buses, told TOI that only schools owning buses will operate them. “With just 50% of the bus capacity allowed, we might not break even considering the maintenance expenses and fuel costs at an all-time high,” added Latamble. Another bus owner said schools should pay them in advance. “I am trying to bring back my employees — drivers, conductors and the female bus attendants — who took up other jobs. They have asked me to give them in writing that I will be pay advance salaries even if schools suddenly close again,” said the transporter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/few-private-buses-vans-may-run-amid-high-fuel-operating-costs/articleshow/86738465.cms||Joy Sengupta

Schools will reopen for classes from Std VIII to Std XII in urban areas and from Std V onwards in rural areas. Parents said they were cautious and would exercise precautions while sending their children to school. Authorities said nearly 60% parents on an average have given their consent to send their children to school. Meanwhile, teachers are also ready to welcome back their students and start on an informal note by acclimatising them initially and then begin academics after a week. As many as 256 schools under Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) are ready to welcome students back with all safety precautions and a time-table for the next two weeks which will be lighter on academics. Meenakshi Raut, education officer at PMC, said, “The sanitisation activities and other arrangements in all our schools are complete and now our teachers are waiting to welcome them. The attendance might be average on the first day but it will definitely improve from the second week onwards.” Principal of Sanskriti School in Bhukum, Damini Joshi, said they have a detailed SOP going beyond what is laid down by the government. “Our priority will be to bring the children back to school and offer them a safe and healthy environment. As for mid-term exams for Std X and Std XII, they will be conducted offline. This exercise will help prepare the students for the boards,” she added. Principal of HDFC School, Amruta Prabhu, said that the school was conducting online examinations and hence they would reopen after the exams were over. Prabhu said, “It would create confusion if we reopened in the middle of the online exams. Most parents requested that we reopen after the exams are over so we decided to reopen after Dussehra, around the second half of the month.” The Akshara International School also decided to reopen after their ongoing mid-term exams are over. Principal Sonali Balwatkar said, “We are still taking consent from parents regarding the reopening and the exams are going on so we would reopen only after October 15.” In rural areas the schools had started for std VIII onwards a month ago. Chief executive officer of Pune Zilla Parishad, Ayush Prasad, said, “We are expecting a good turnout for the classes that are reopening from Monday onwards. Our higher classes are going on smoothly and infrastructure wise we are already prepared for the reopening.” Uddhav’s AddressChief minister Uddhav Thackeray will address teachers and students on Monday under the ‘My student, my responsibility’ initiative’. The CM wants schools to ensure that all SOPs are followed so that schools do not have to shut down again, said a state official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pupils-returning-to-school-filled-with-first-day-cheer/articleshow/86738437.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Traders call to promote Palasa cashew in global market||VISAKHAPATNAM: Cashew processors and exporters in the state have urged the Union commerce and industry ministry to take steps to promote and export Palasa cashew. Palasa and Kasibugga in Srikakulam district are the biggest cashew processing centres in the state with over 300 processing units. All units together produce over 60,000 kilos of cashew kernels per day and have an annual turnover between Rs 250 to Rs 300 crore. While Palasa cashew is famous for its rich taste and unique flavour, traders have failed to export it to other countries. Cashew manufacturers in Srikakulam have been importing raw cashew from Ghana, Ivory Coast, Benin, Tanzania, Indonesia and other countries through the sea route. Speaking to TOI, president of Industrial Estate and owner of a cashew processing unit, Palasa, Malla Rameswara Rao said the Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) is the agency to help the cashew industry with exports. “But we observed that APEDA has been extending its services to Kerala and cashew traders from AP are not getting any support to export quality cashew kernels to other countries. If we get support from the APEDA, we will export cashew kernels,” Rao added. The Palasa cashew industry requires over 7,000 to 8,000 tonnes of raw cashew nuts every year. Cashew growers in Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts manage tosupply only 30 to 40% of this requirement. “Due to the shortage of the raw material in the local market, we have been importing it at Rs 125 to Rs 140 per kg dependingon the quality of the nuts to continue the legacy of the Palasa cashew industry,” traders added. “Recently we met commerce secretary BVR Subrahmanyam in Vizag and urged him to promote Palasa cashew in the global market by creating the scope for export,” Rao added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/traders-call-to-promote-palasa-cashew-in-global-mkt/articleshow/86738488.cms||Nalla.Babu

Of them, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) administered over 10 lakh doses. Around 9.21 lakh doses were administered in Pune rural, which was solely dependent on the state vaccine supply. In the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits, 4.52 lakh doses were administered. The district’s three units — Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and Pune rural — recorded their best monthly vaccination figures in September. A PMC official said good vaccine supply and inoculation at private hospitals resulted in better monthly vaccination figures. Vikas Dhakane, the PMC’s additional commissioner, said, “The consistent supply made sure we clocked our best ever monthly vaccination figures. If this supply remains steady, we are sure we can vaccinate maximum people in a minimum duration.” Abhay Tidke, the additional district health officer, said apart from the regular vaccine supply from the state, the vaccine donation via the CSR funds helped the drive pick up pace. “More mega vaccination drives and special vaccination drives are going to be a part of the inoculation drives this month,” he said. On Sunday, around 29,145 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district, which took the total number of doses administered to 1.07 crore. Of them, 72.49 lakh were given the first dose, while 35.16 lakh took the second dose. According to the district health office, October would see the highest number of vaccinations as the state had promised to supply more doses than it had in September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-24l-vaccinated-in-district-in-september/articleshow/86738494.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Goa||No boats, no nets: In Talpona, youth catch fish by leading them into a trap||POINGUINIM: At this time of the year when the intensity of the rain subsides and the Talpona river level drops, youths and enthusiasts start fishing in the river’s mid-stream stretches. The unique thing is — they practice a rare fishing method called ponn’nn. Groups of youths guided by seniors in their respective areas — Gotcamolem, Ardhofond, Borkoifond and Cornomolem near Bhatpal — are already at work for the short, but challenging fishing season. It is an innovative fishing method that uses a mix of eco-friendly and specially-crafted materials and there is absolutely no use for boats or nets. The concept is simple. Erecting two barriers or bundhs physically in the river’s strategic stretch is all this is required to channelise the river flow — the water level is not even knee deep — and the fish lands blindly into the trap. The first barrier or the bundh is erected partly with monsoon waste — tree debris and some mud and stones on either side. Only a small gap is kept to allow the water to flow into the main trap. “The bundh work (of the first barrier) has been completed,” a group member Michael Pereira said. The work requires patience and hard work. The part-timers may even find themselves tearing their hair, as heavy rain and increased water flow may wash away the barrier. “The bundh has to stand strong and it is tedious work to fortify it for four to five days,” a participant Ackroyd Fernandes said. “Often, it collapses with the flow and the boys have to devote their time to maintain it and fortify it,” Peter Fernandes, a veteran with 25 years of experience, said. While the bundh is being erected, simultaneous work to prepare the trap or tatt in local parlance — a flat iron bar, woven with wire mesh has to be carried out by members. This year, five youths have been engaged in fishing at Gotcamolem. “Preparing iron tatt costs anything between Rs 8,000 and Rs 12,000,” a youth Niraj Kankonkar said. Once ready, a tatt is erected on the downstream side of the bundh and the fish swims with the flow to fall, as easy prey, on the tatt. But fishing is more productive at night and in rotation, they keep a vigil over the catch. “We have to spend the night in the river or else otters may pop out of water and take our catch,” Trifen Fernandes said. Though the use of the iron bar with mesh may have been added in recent years, the fishing practice has sustained since hoary past. “Our ancestors handed over the expertise to us,” a senior citizen from Ardhofond Rosario Barreto said. The method is prevalent in Goa’s remote areas though the materials used may be different. In Canacona, it is practiced only in Talpona river, as the depleted river flow in some stretches facilitates this practice. After toiling for over a week, they finally reap the fruit when the fish catch lands on the tatt. “We hope to recover our investment this year,” Fernandes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-boats-no-nets-in-talpona-youth-catch-fish-by-leading-them-into-a-trap/articleshow/86740671.cms||Albert Fernandes

As a result, no jeep could ply leaving hundreds of tourists disappointed. Incessant rain in areas surrounding the falls late Saturday not only raised the level of the river but also intensified the current in the rivulet. Additional principal chief conservator of forest (APCCF) Santosh Kumar said that though the water level was high since Saturday morning, the forest department had formally opened the tourist season at Dudhsagar to meet the annual commencement date of October 2. A member of the Dudhsagar Tour Operators’ Association (DTOA) Tribolo Souza said that the damage to the temporary road left many tourists disappointed as they had to return without visiting the falls. Hundreds of tourists had gathered at the DTOA booking counter since morning, he said. As a sign of rekindling hope, the scenic Dudhsagar waterfalls saw a rise in tourists footfall on day one of the new season. While 140 tourists could visit the falls, over 500 could not get jeeps as the forest department allowed only 20 to ply due to the high water current in the rivulet. “The water level and current in the rivulet are high due to rain in ghat areas. Considering safety, we have restricted the jeep number to 20 per day,” Kumar, who is also the chief wildlife warden of the state, told TOI. On the first day of last year’s season the waterfall had seen a weaker start with a mere 110 visitors. In 2019, the falls had registered 315 visitors, but last year’s numbers were the lowest since the falls opened to the public in 1989. The pandemic took footfalls down by a whopping 80%. Comparatively, the 2018 season was quite good as 1,127 people had visited on day one of season opening. Overall, in 2020, only 1,73,476 tourists visited the falls, that too only domestics. The falls closed for tourists on May 7. The earlier season between October 2, 2019, and till closure on March 15, 2020, a total 10,75,556 tourists, including a major share of foreign nationals, visited falls, as per data maintained by the forest department. Currently 431 jeeps are registered with the state wildlife board to ferry passengers to the foot of the Dudhsagar falls. The Goa State Wildlife Board has, however, restricted the number of jeeps that can operate to 240. The jeeps ferry visitors to the waterfall via a kutcha road deep within the Bhagwan Mahaveer sanctuary. He said that resumption of tourist jeeps will be decided as per the water flow in the rivulet. Last year, too, the situation was the same and we had to begin the season from October 25, Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rain-washes-away-road-to-dudhsagar-hundreds-of-tourists-left-disappointed/articleshow/86738718.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

The accused took help of their friends. Ten of them have been booked for murder, police said, adding the suspects will be nabbed soon. The incident took place in Uttar Pradesh's Meerut on Saturday. According to the police, the woman belonged to a different caste and her family was against the marriage. She had recently informed her family about her relationship which enraged her brothers. The family put pressure on her to marry someone else of their choice. A complaint was filed by the woman's "husband" following which an FIR was registered against the accused. The complainant claimed that she succumbed to her injuries after being badly beaten and was hurriedly cremated by her family. On Sunday, station house officer of Bhawanpur said that 10 people have been booked under IPC sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and 147 (for rioting). “We had started questioning members of the family and became suspicious as they were trying to hide something. Police teams are now trying to nab the suspects,” the SHO added. In the FIR, the complainant claimed that he had "married the woman at a temple in July". He alleged that his "wife" was receiving life threats from her brothers and killed by them for marrying him. “We got married once she turned 18 in July. They came to know about it. Her family cremated her before I could call the cops,” the man said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-brothers-cousins-friends-kill-woman-for-marrying-man-from-a-different-caste/articleshow/86736072.cms||Ishita Mishra

A: Yes, I plan to renovate ration shops in my constituency, shift some of them to permanent buildings, and if they are over two kilometres away from a specific place, I plan to establish part-time ration shops so that people do not have to travel long distances for their rations. Q: What are your achievements during your previous term? A: Places under Madurai corporation limits reeled under water scarcity. I took steps to deepen the tanks in these places and bring water from Periyar channel to fill them so that the groundwater got recharged. Also, during the Covid first wave, I purchased four vehicles to spray sanitizers and disinfect all the residential areas with Rs one crore from my MLA fund. I purchased the vehicles from BHEL in Trichy. Q: Covid was the time when people’s representatives were forced to act. What did you do? A: I provided two kilogram of rice for every household in the village limits. In the city, people found it difficult to get vegetables, so I made arrangements for vegetables to be delivered at the doorstep. Q; As minister what plans do you have for Madurai? A: Yes, in this city of Meenakshi which is known for tourism, I also plan to develop the Vandiyur tank by coordinating with Madurai North MLA K Thalapathy and make it a tourist spot. It will be deepened, strengthened and beautified. This is a long-pending plan, which I hope to make a reality. —————— MLA: P Moorthy: Constituency: Madurai East.

Two local residents, who were near the spot, sustained minor injuries. The langar khana is located outside the southeast of Jama Masjid. The open court with a cloister around it was used as a community kitchen to feed the poor during the Mughal period. Conservation assistant (Agra circle), Kalandar, told TOI that five 'chajjas', around 2m long and 35cm wide each collapsed from a height of 10m. He said, though lightning conductors were installed in the complex, the actual cause will be known after a proper inspection. “We will visit the site tomorrow with engineers to assess what exactly happened,” he said, adding the area is not open for tourists, but locals enter the place, which is about 25m from the Buland Darwaza. Nazruddin, who was present there, claimed the lightning struck and the stones fell from the top. “Two teenage boys who were sitting there sustained minor injuries. They were sent to a primary health care centre for treatment," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/lightning-strikes-langar-khana-at-fatehpur-sikri/articleshow/86736141.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

According to the health department sources, 48 people suffering from fever and dengue-like symptoms have died in the district in the last one month. Out of these, 38 were children. Till Sunday afternoon, there were 240 dengue cases in Agra. Due to lack of facilities in government centers in rural areas, over 4000 people are bedridden in their houses. A resident of Hanuman Nagar locality under Pinahat block, ten-month-old Golu was suffering from fever for the last four days. His father Ramshaya said, “We got him medicines from a private clinic as no doctor was available at the government centre. On Saturday evening, his condition worsened. We rushed him to a private hospital in Fatehabad where he died on Sunday morning.” Resident of village Jodhpura, five-month-old Adarsh died on Saturday evening. His father Pintu Kumar said, “On not getting the required treatment at the local government health centre, we consulted a private doctor and provided medicine as recommended. The condition of my son deteriorated on Saturday afternoon. He had high fever and was not able to open his eyes.

---||Pune||Pune: Officials audit over 22,000 Covid patients’ bills, reduce Rs 17.8 crore||PUNE: The district health department has reduced a whopping total of Rs 17.8 crore after auditing Covid-19 treatment bills till September 22. The authorities said more than 22,000 bills issued by private medical facilities were checked for fairness in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporation limits, as well as the rural areas. Interestingly, the highest number of hospital bills probed — more than 13,000 — were from the rural areas of the district. PCMC limits accounted for the highest reduction of final bill amount after more than Rs7 crore was adjusted. In Pune Municipal Corporation limits, 2,776 bills were audited — the lowest among the district’s three administrative units — which saw a reduction of Rs 6.21 crore. “We are probing all medical bills associated with Covid-19 from private hospitals and managed to reduce the maximum amount payable by patients. The pre-auditing practice, as compared to the earlier Rs 1.50 lakh slab, has helped in reducing the highest number of bills,” PCMC additional commissioner Vikas Dhakane told TOI. Earlier, only bills for more than Rs1.5 lakh were scrutinized. The Pune rural pockets has been very active on bills’ inspection and auditing front and, according to district health officials, is continuing this practice despite the drop in the number of Covid cases. Additional PCMC commissioner Abhay Tidke told TOI, “We have formed block-level teams – including officials from accounting department – across all 13 blocks. The bills, regardless of the amount, were checked for fairness. Many bills were reversed. In some cases, there were no changes at all.” The bill-auditing practice started last year after several Covid-19 patients and their relatives raised complaints of exorbitant bills being issued by private hospitals across the district. The errant hospitals were then made to refund the after experts found merit in their complaints. Officials said they found that the administrative charges and cost of personal protection equipment (PPE) kits levied by the hospitals to be exorbitant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/officials-audit-over-22k-covid-patients-bills-reduce-rs-17-8cr/articleshow/86738613.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Pune||Rollout of paediatric Covid vaccine by October 15-20, says N K Arora||PUNE: The national rollout of Zydus Cadila’s Covid-19 vaccine, ZyCoV-D, is going to take two more weeks. “Different batches of ZyCoV-D are currently undergoing a final round of quality checks at the country’s apex vaccine testing laboratory in Himachal Pradesh. If everything goes as per plan, the vaccine will be introduced in the country’s immunisation programme by October 15-20,” Dr N K Arora, chairman of the Centre’s Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, told TOI on Sunday. The three-dose needle-free ZyCoV-D vaccine, manufactured by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, is the first vaccine in the country that has received emergency use authorization (EUA) for being administered to people aged 12 years and above. The vaccine is based on the plasmid DNA technology and follows a three-dose regimen with a 28-day gap between each dose. “Since it is a three-dose vaccine, we need to ensure availability of 1 crore doses each month for the next three months, so that those who have received the first shot get the two more doses in the specified timeframe,” Arora said. Developed in partnership with the department of biotechnology, ZyCoV-D is a first-of-its-kind DNA vaccine that produces the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 to elicit an immune response. It is an intradermal vaccine that must be applied using a ‘needle-free injector’, which the manufacturer says will help in reducing side effects. A total of seven adolescents from Pune have received three shots of ZyCoV-D as part of the countrywide advanced human trials that concluded in July this year. “ZyCoV-D is the world’s first DNA vaccine. It has a three-dose schedule. It is given with a special needle-free injector as it is to be given intradermally (below the skin) and not intramuscularly. It will be the first vaccine to be used in paediatric population above 12 years in India,” Bharati Hospital’s medical director and chief paediatrician Sanjay Lalwani said. The Central Drugs Laboratory in Himachal Pradesh’s Kasauli has been authorised by the Centre to ensure quality control in vaccines, including the Covid vaccines. Pune-based National Centre for Cell Science and Hyderabad-based National Institute of Animal Biotechnology have recently got the status of National Control Laboratory for vaccine testing and quality control. In all, six vaccines — Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik V, Moderna, J&J and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D — have been granted EUA in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rollout-of-paediatric-covid-vaccine-by-october-15-20-says-n-k-arora/articleshow/86738541.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The Bund Garden police said the theft occurred during the intervening night of Friday and Saturday. Police valued the stolen trees at Rs8,000. Senior inspector Yashwant Gawari of the Bund Garden police told TOI, “The complainant, Lieutenant Colonel Tapan Sagwan, said he and his family members went to sleep at around 11pm on Friday. However, when he woke up the following morning, he found the four sandalwood trees chopped and stolen.” Gawari said a spot assessment showed that the suspects cut the barbed wire fence to enter the garden area of the bungalow. Following this, they cut the four trees and ran away, leaving the stumps and branches behind. “No one heard any commotion or noise from the tree cutting activity. Despite high security in the area, the bungalow had no security guard or CCTV camera,” the senior inspector said. A similar incident occurred recently where six sandalwood trees worth Rs48,000 were chopped and stolen from an army unit in Camp and the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF). The police are not ruling out the possibility of involvement of the same gang in all these thefts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-sandalwood-trees-stolen-from-camp-bungalow/articleshow/86738549.cms||---

DCP (Special Cell) Sanjeev Yadav said the hit squad leader, Anuj, disclosed that jailed gangster Deepak Teetar, a close confidante of slain criminal Jitender Gogi, had given him the contract to eliminate the septuagenarian. The deceased, Attam Singh, had a dispute with a property dealer over land in Kanjhawala. The dealer approached Teetar and paid to have Singh eliminated. Anuj shot Singh in the head outside his house in November last year. Singh was a refugee from Afghanistan who had come to India 28 years ago. He was one of the senior members managing Anandpur Dham Gurudwara in Karala and also dealt in real estate near the religious place. Local cops will probe the matter further. The squad had not only killed gangster Sunil Tajpuria’s henchman in January, but also shot his cousin, Kunal Maan, in Alipur in March. This enraged Tajpuria, who then stepped up his efforts to murder Gogi. They also helped gangster Kuldeep Fajja escape from custody in March from GTB Hospital. Last year, the gang carried out three killings in July and August, including that of a Delhi Police constable’s son and a witness in the murder case of Tajpuria’s aide. Last month, they had fired shots at a Tihar Jail superintendent. In the last one year, they looted multiple liquor shops and departmental stores. They also looted a liquor shop in Bahadurgarh in June and another in Rohtak in September this year. In September, they had also looted two stores in Narela. On September 29, they gunned down gangster Shama, a rival of mobster Lawrence Bishnoi, in Muktsar, Punjab after receiving instructions from Canada-based Goldy Brar. In August, they committed a double murder in Asaudha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/7-murders-including-that-of-gurdwara-head-cracked-with-the-arrest/articleshow/86738568.cms||Raj Shekhar

Police say the recent reforms, brought in with a view to reducing accidents, have yielded good results. SP Malika Garg took the initiative to analyse the road accidents by involving other departments like transport, municipal administration, roads and buildings. As many as 55 black spots were identified where more number of accidents are taking place. Police, along with other officials, visited these spots to find out the reasons for frequent accidents. They took up corrective measures at these places by setting up speed-breakers, solar blinkers, radium stickers and warning signs. Malika Garg said that with the recent initiatives, the rate of road accidents has significantly come down. She observed that the monthly average accidents which stood at 126 in the district has now come down to 108. The average fatal accidents stood at 53 and it has now come down to 28. The average deaths due to road accidents per month used to be 59 and it came down to 29 in September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/fatal-road-accidents-in-prakasam-dist-drop-by-50/articleshow/86738546.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||World||PIO student-led stir reverses ban on diversity books in US||Edha Gupta and Christina Ellis, two high school seniors in York County, Pennsylvania, were furious when they read last month in a local paper that their teachers had been effectively banned from using hundreds of books, documentary films and articles in their classrooms. The list, which was created in 2020 by a diversity committee in the Central York School District, was meant to serve as a resource guide for students and teachers as they grappled with the racial and social turmoil that followed the murder of George Floyd. It included a documentary about James Baldwin and a statement on racism by the state’s association of school administrators. It also included kids’ books like “A Boy Called Bat,” about a third grader with autism and “I Am Rosa Parks”. But what began as an effort to raise awareness somehow ended with the materials on the list being banned from classrooms by the district’s school board in a little-noticed vote last November. Some parents in the district had objected to materials that they feared could be used to make white kids feel guilty about their race or “indoctrinate” students. “I was ready to go to battle,” said Ellis, 17. She and Gupta, 17, recruited other students to wear black T-shirts to school in protest. They created signs that read “Diversity is our strength” They began protesting every day before school. They started writing letters to the editor and reading excerpts from the banned books on Instagram. The controversy drew national media attention. Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King Jr, and some of the authors whose books were on the list voiced support. On September 13, the school board met to discuss the list but again voted to keep the materials from being used in class. The students continued their protests. Less than three weeks after the students began their campaign, the board met again, on September 20, and temporarily lifted the freeze. The board said that its November 2020 vote was not intended to be a ban, but rather an effort to give a curriculum panel time to review the materials. Jane Johnson, president of the school board, said that while the board recognised the importance of diversity, it was concerned about materials that “may lean more toward indoctrination rather than age-appropriate academic content.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pio-student-led-stir-reverses-ban-on-diversity-books-in-us/articleshow/86742570.cms||---

Since the Spaniard's arrival last season, the ISL has been played behind closed doors due to rising Covid-19 cases in the country. Ferrando had the first taste of Indian fans during the Durand Cup semifinals against Bengaluru FC in Kolkata and later in the final against local I-League side Mohammedan Sporting Club. There were over 30,000 fans cheering for Mohammedan at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan (VYBK) on Sunday, but Goa emerged winners. Not surprisingly, Ferrando loved the atmosphere. “To be honest, the most important thing for me is the atmosphere and I hope the situation of the pandemic is better so that we can see full stadiums and people enjoying football,” Ferrando said after the match. Goa’s last two games in Asia’s oldest competition went into extra time. They had arrived with a strong squad with all their four foreigners including captain Edu Bedia, Ivan Gonzalez, Alberto Noguera and Jorge Ortiz, who suffered an injury in the team’s opening game. Although Goa were favourites right from the start, Ferrando treated the tournament as pre-season. It gave him an opportunity to field youngsters and bring the best out of them. Forwards Devendra Murgaonkar and Muhammed Nemil made the most of their chances. Devendra finished as the joint top scorer with five goals while Nemil netted four times. “We like to play good football, but it's necessary to play strong opponents like Mohammedan. Happy because in this case my team was able to improve. We have one month now in Goa and we hope to play good football. It is my dream to win this trophy (ISL),” said Ferrando. Goa is one of the most consistent teams in the ISL, but the title has eluded them on two occasions in the past after losing the final. Last season, Goa lost to eventual champions Mumbai City FC on penalties in the semifinals. Edu, who won the Golden Ball for being the best player in the Durand Cup, is hopeful he can lift another trophy soon in his fifth season with Goa. “I’m very happy for the team. I think this moment will increase the confidence after we win this trophy. Now it's time to celebrate this trophy and then prepare for the ISL,” said Edu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-winning-durand-cup-fc-goa-keen-on-dream-isl-triumph/articleshow/86761694.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

This has been evidenced by the recent siphoning of funds from the body. The partition of assets of this famed academy, part of Schedule 10 of AP Reorganisation Act, remains a bone of contention between the two Telugu states. A case is also pending before the Supreme Court in connection with the disputes with funds to the tune of Rs 340 crore in bank deposits lying undivided between the two states. Telangana government had approached Supreme Court following a high court order regarding the division of assets, properties, and personnel. The court had ordered that the distribution of assets and properties be completed withi two months. A file pertaining to the distribution formula is said to be pending with CM K Chandrasekhar Rao and the case is scheduled to be heard by Supreme Court on October 6. Before the case was brought to Supreme Court, two key meetings were held between officials of both states but no solution was arrived at. This year, officials from Telangana and AP suggested that assets be divided as per the normal formula — 52 (AP) to 48 (Telangana). However, during court proceedings, AP contended that the same criteria be used for AP higher education council be applied to the Telugu institution. “Now, we have to see how the case progresses. Especially, in light of recent incidents,” said a source close to proceedings. Telugu Akademi was an initiative of former PM PV Narasimha Rao and was led by several luminaries of Telugu literature. However, after the bifurcation, Telangana did not select a full-time director for this wing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telugu-akademi-still-contentious-for-t-ap/articleshow/86740727.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Civic poll fever unsettles Tenkasi||TENKASI: With just two days left for the rural local body polls in Tenkasi district, electioneering has reached a feverish pitch in the newly formed district. With each voter poised to elect a village panchayat ward member, panchayat president, union councillor and district panchayat councillor, campaigns have been intense. However, violations of electoral and Covid-19 norms have also been high. At K R Colony, a calm residential locality in Kuthukalvalasai panchayat a kilometre away from the district collectorate, more than a dozen candidates and hundreds of campaigners move about with speakers blazing on vehicles several times a day. The noise level goes up when another candidate enters the area. Seven candidates each are contesting for the post of panchayat president and panchayat union councillor apart from contestants for the district panchayat councillor. On Saturday, none of the campaigners TOI saw wore a mask, leaving many residents worried as the campaigners knock at every door and don’t leave till voters receive their pamphlet. When quizzed about the mask, one candidate said it was meant for people to recognise him. However there was no justification why others did not wear one. Residents’ welfare association president Subbaiah and secretary Mohanadass get special attention as candidates refuse to leave without honouring them with silk shawls, hoping they would help them bag the nearly 450 votes in the locality. “I got over half a dozen shawls on Saturday,” Mohanadass said. J Aleesha, 32, was furious on seeing a campaign poster affixed on her store without her permission, and tore it off. There were houses with posters of multiple candidates. While candidates have to obtain residents’ nod to affix posters on their walls, few care to do that. Most residents don’t remove posters fearing consequences for the next five years. Caste plays a crucial role in these polls too. Kasiviswanathan, a local DMK functionary, said the SC reserved panchayat has 60% nadar voters and 20% each of dalit and thevars. I Kaniammal who is on the fray for panchayat president post hopes to net her community’s votes as well as of her husband’s nadar community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/civic-poll-fever-unsettles-tenkasi-folk/articleshow/86738596.cms||M K Ananth
---||Kochi||Kerala: 30,229 seized vehicles rusting away under police custody||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As many as 30,229 vehicles that have been seized in connection with various cases are rusting in the compounds of police stations in the state, as per the records of the home department. The vehicles that are occupying various police stations, excise and forest department offices have been rusting after being exposed to all types of weather. Moreover, they have occupied a major share of public space and are also posing a threat to the environment. Many of them have been lying there for years, which could not be released either because of pending cases relating to the vehicles or have been unclaimed after being abandoned by those who had used them for illegal activities. In a meeting of senior department heads, including secretaries of home, transport, taxes, forest and law that was recently held by chief secretary V P Joy to find a solution for disposing of the seized vehicles, it was also stated that as many as 1,059 vehicles seized by the excise department under the Abkari Act, and approximately 100 vehicles seized by the forests and wildlife department were ready for auction. It was decided to explore whether the government can auction the vehicles in the event of neither the owner nor the first or third parties not coming up with insurance claims. A similar order was issued by the government of Odisha to dispose of such vehicles. The Centre has already come up with the draft national vehicle scrapping policy, which is currently under the examination of the ministry of law and justice. Once it is notified, all vehicles that are more than 10 years old can be scrapped. Earlier in 2017, the police had decided to simplify the procedures for releasing the vehicles that have been seized in connection with official duties. According to the instructions issued then, the police, instead of seizing the vehicles under the section 207(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, need to seize only the registration certificates of the vehicles and issue receipts. This will be applicable to offences, including driving without licences, driving by minors and using the vehicle without permit, as prescribed under the section 66(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act. In the case of vehicles that have not paid taxes under section 11 of Kerala Motor Taxation Act, the vehicle should be released immediately after the production of the receipt of payment of tax. In the offences like rash and negligent driving that cause injury to others, since the inspection by a motor vehicle inspector is not required, police should release the vehicle after inspecting the vehicle documents and preparing the mahassar. In case of vehicles that are involved in accidents, police should release them after examining all the documents and completing the procedures relating to the vehicle, if the vehicle need not be produced before the court. In case of vehicles that are found abandoned, after examining the details, if the vehicle is not involved in any criminal offence, they should be returned after completing the formalities. The circular was then issued by the state police chief based on complaints that the police are unnecessarily keeping the vehicles even booked under petty cases in custody for a long time. The vehicles seized are categorized into six types — vehicles seized as material objects in criminal cases, abandoned vehicles, vehicles involved in traffic accidents, vehicles seized in relation to sand mining and smuggling, vehicles seized in excise cases and vehicles seized by MVD and handed over to police for custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/30k-seized-vehicles-rusting-away-under-police-custody/articleshow/86736163.cms||KP Saikiran

The deceased were identified as Onguri Arjuna Rao (50) and his son Ajay (15). According police, Arjuna Rao and Ajay used to take their buffaloes for grazing in the nearby farms. As they did not return home in the evening, the family members went in search of them and found them dead near the fence. The scene suggested that they came in contact with the fence when they tried to cross it. They apparently failed to notice that an 11 KV live wire had come in contact with the fence. “Unaware of the fact that the fence had become a live circuit, they tired to cross it as they would usually do, said sub-inspector G Rambabu. A case has been registered and further investigation is on. Police are investigating whether the live wire accidentally fell on the fence or the farm owner intentionally did it.

In June, Madurai Corporation had dug up the road to lay drinking water pipeline, but the pit was not closed and instead filled with little soil. Subsequently, the pit would often get filled with water after rainfall, many residents complained. Thayir market, one of the vegetable markets less than half a kilometer away from the Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple, occupies a major portion of this road. The Secretary of the Thayir market vegetable vendors association, K Ammaiyappan, said, “Even before the rains started, traders began to throw vegetable waste into it and it became a permanent sewage-cum-garbage pit, which is a breeding spot for mosquitoes now.” Three dumper bins on this road are always overflowing and the traders continuously make a request for them to be cleaned twice a day to the civic body, he said. Stray cattle forage on the overflowing garbage creating a menace, he said.  He added that they were slowly getting their lives back on track after Covid-19 pandemic, but the condition of the road is spoiling all their business. To avoid the ditch, people park their vehicles on the road, which adds to the problem and creates a traffic jam. Neighbouring roads like East Perumal Maistry Street, Chittrakara Street, and East Veli Street are also in bad state, but this is one road, which everyone wants to avoid if they can help it, is affecting our business, said K Subramanian, a trader. Corporation Commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan said that restoration of the work was partly done and that they would take up the cleanliness drive on this stretch soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dug-up-pits-of-east-marret-st-turn-into-sewage-cum-garbage-dumps/articleshow/86738580.cms||---

Officials and activists have urged the residents to be be cautious with rains lashing Madurai intermittently. “Those living especially on the outskirts of the city and villages must be cautious during rainy season when being in their garden or farms, especially during early morning or night. Further, delaying treatment for snake bites by brushing it off as insect bites must be avoided and any bites must be checked at once,” said P R Vishwanath, an animal activist. A forest department official meanwhile said that so far, there have been no instances of snakes venturing in Madurai city areas. “However, usually by monsoon season, we do get more such calls.

The court noted that four separate replies have been filed on behalf of CGST — east, south, west and north — and apparently, in the replies, all the four commissionerates from CGST are attempting to pass on the buck to SGST. It said that on the last date of hearing assistant commissioner, appearing on behalf of SGST, had claimed that they have already initiated action at their end not only against the alleged delinquent firms but also against their employees. It added that she had categorically insisted that information was duly shared by them with CGST and yet CGST was not inclined to initiate any action against the remaining 202 firms out of 486 firms. “From the replies filed today on behalf of CGST, a very sorry state of affairs is revealed. Evidently, as per the claim of CGST, SGST is not even aware of the correct address of the CGST offices. Regretfully, none is present today on behalf of SGST. The court is in pain to observe that instead of initiating an appropriate action against the delinquent firms in the matter, wherein as per the claim of Delhi Police, a tax evasion of Rs 940 crore is involved, the authorities are involved in blame game,” additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana said in the order. The court noted that unfortunately, none was present on behalf of SGST and even no reply has been filed on behalf of chairperson, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs. It directed the SGST commissioner to file an affidavit regarding the action initiated by them in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-slams-gst-officials-for-blame-game-in-tax-case/articleshow/86738664.cms||Usha Das

The crowds, mostly tourists from the state, are uncontrolled during weekends. There were at least 150 people at the Erumai Chavadi private falls on Sunday afternoon. While this is just the number of people waiting in queue for their turn to stand under the water falls, an equal number was waiting in the parking lot. With water just little more than a shower in the falls, there were close to a dozen trying to sneak in so that their money is not completely wasted. No one was wearing a mask. “It is not worth Rs 100,” lamented B Murugaraj from Dindigul. He spent Rs 2,000 for 20 people who had come with him in a mini bus. An entry of fee of Rs 100 per head is also applicable for those who don’t want to bathe but just want to have a glimpse of the falls. Some even returned without getting wet as they were uncomfortable with the huge crowd. A parking fee of Rs 100 is also collected for every car. Even as more than 100 cars, vans and mini buses and double the number of bikes headed towards the falls in an hour, there were no policeman or patrol vehicle to check the crowd. Locals said that vehicle movement is high on the road during weekends due to the closure of the Courtallam Falls. Heavy traffic on the narrow road is also causing accidents. “May be the virus (Covid-19) will affect only those bathing in the government controlled falls and knows it should not spread among those bathing in the private falls,” said Kumar, owner of an eatery near Courtallam Main Falls. Tenkasi SP R Krishnaraj said that the police cannot check the movement of private vehicles on private properties such as falls and resorts. When pointed out that the private resorts and properties are taking Covid-19 norms for a ride and fleecing the public, the SP said that police personnel will be deployed to check such violations. In the last week of September, news had spread that the district administration has permitted bathing in all the Courtallam falls from October 1. However, the district administration issued a statement calling it a rumour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/courtallam-shut-private-waterfalls-see-big-crowds/articleshow/86738611.cms||M K Ananth
---||Kochi||Kerala: Monson Mavunkal may have invested his cash||KOCHI: Despite ‘antique collector’ Monson Mavunkal claiming that he had spent the entire amount he got by duping others to maintain an extravagant lifestyle, crime branch sleuths probing the financial fraud case are yet to rule out the possibility that he may have invested the funds elsewhere. CB has not been able to put together a solid money trail in the scam. Sources said that Mavunkal, during his custody period, claimed that he had nothing in his account. But investigators aren’t taking this claim at face value, but have intensified the probe to find his investments. A source with the investigation team said that it was too early to rule out other possibilities and believe the accused’s version. After CB’s six days of custodial interrogation ended on Saturday, Mavunkal was presented before the additional chief judicial magistrate court in Ernakulam. He was remanded in judicial custody. Monson was arrested for duping six persons and taking Rs 10 crore from them after showing them a forged bank account statement which stated that he had ‘lakhs of crores’ in his account. Monson sought their money to get this amount, which was blocked by ‘FEMA’, released. The accused had allegedly promised them high returns if they gave him their money. But, official sources said that only Rs 50 lakh was actually transferred via bank and the rest was given in cash. Also, Rs 50 lakh was transferred to the accounts of Monson’s employees. This could make it all the more difficult for the investigation team to track the money. Meanwhile, CB is likely to seek his custody on Monday in the case registered against Mavunkal for duping a Thiruvananthapuram-based craftsman who made him sculptures. The man was not paid the promised amount. On Saturday, CB sleuths seized nearly four sculptures from Monson’s Kaloor home. As per the complaint, the person was only paid Rs 7 lakh while Monson owed him Rs 80 lakh. There are two more cases against Mavunkal, one for impersonating the chairman of a TV channel and another for cheating a Pala-based businessman of Rs 1.7 crore. Sources said the TV channel case was more complicated and there were more co-accused. The other case is similar to the original case as the businessman was duped by Monson by showing off his high-end lifestyle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/monson-may-have-invested-his-cash/articleshow/86736178.cms||---

Inaugurating a month-long, statewide addiction-free awareness campaign on the occasion of the 152nd Gandhi Jayanthi day celebrations here, the minister said that addiction-free programmes would be organized in over 20,000 wards in local self-governments across the state with public participation. He added that a sustained campaign needs to be carried out to create proper awareness against addiction and such a campaign should take the message down to the ward-level by enlisting the support of all sections of the society to achieve the goals set out by it. “We are living in times when even children fall prey to this evil. This will seriously affect the future generations. The activities of Vimukthi Mission should reach to all educational institutions in the state as our ultimate aim is to root out this menace,” the minister said. Stating that addiction to intoxicants has reached a dangerous level as it has begun to affect the social consciousness and mental health of its victims, the minister said that tackling this challenge was vital to build a healthy society. Presiding over the function, transport minister Antony Raju said the authorities of educational institutions should take utmost care to ensure that students would not get access to addictive substances. “We should also be alert to efforts by vested interests to sabotage programmes against addiction. This has to be properly factored in while planning and carrying out the campaign,” he said. In the function, the excise minister also released a CD of short films on the awareness programmes conducted by Vimukthi Mission. A series of programmes will be held across the state during this month highlighting the consequences of addiction to drugs and intoxicants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/soon-edu-institutes-to-have-vimukthi-clubs/articleshow/86736189.cms||---

Sanjay, who completed the first phase of his padayatra on Saturday, began the campaign for Huzurabad with Rajender on Sunday. The BJP high command announced Eatala’s name on Sunday along with candidates for the bypoll in Maharashtra’s Deglur (SC) and Mizoram’s Tuirial (ST) seat. “Rajender is a staunch supporter of Telangana and fought hard for statehood. But chief minister KCR did nothing. TRS dismissed Rajender after using him. Will CM resign if BJP wins?” Sanjay asked. Addressing the meeting, Rajender claimed that the TRS administration was waging a hostile campaign against him. “From making up false letters to threatening me, they are doing everything. But people will teach the pink party a lesson,” he stated. Warning that the constituency would erupt if was attacked, he said, “TRS is betting on strength and money power. But I am banking on people and I have courage,” he remarked. Earlier in the day, the BJP state president went to the Bhagyalakshmi temple in the Old City. He stated that the BJP was ready to beat the pink party in Huzurabad and directed the rank and file to concentrate on the byelection. On Monday, the BJP will have a gathering of workers from Huzurabad constituency to decide on their bypoll campaign strategy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-you-step-down-if-eatala-wins-sanjays-bypoll-challenge-to-kcr/articleshow/86739627.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||TRS up 2-1 as T gets ready for 4th bypoll||Hyderabad: The contest in Huzurabad will be the fourth bypoll after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao-led TRS stormed back to power in the December 2018 assembly elections. The ruling TRS has won two of them, BJP one and the Congress none. While the BJP lost deposit in the bypolls to Huzurnagar as well as Nagarjuna Sagar, it won the Dubbak seat much to the shock of TRS and Congress’ chagrin. Now, the formal announcement of Eatala Rajender as BJP candidate has drawn the battle lines between the TRS and the saffron party in Huzuranagar. But the possibility of a triangular contest has not been ruled out if Congress puts up a good show. Though the Congress has not won a bypoll since 2014 in Telangana, it is going all out to make a mark in Huzurabad, a seat it has not won in the last 30 years. “The TRS and BJP are banking on money power. But I have the support of the youth and unemployed. It is going to be a triangular contest,” Congress candidate Balmoori Venkat told TOI. A senior leader in the BJP admitted the importance of the bypoll for the saffron party as a victory would help the party project itself as the main opposition to the TRS ahead of 2023 assembly polls. “Eatala Rajender is a formidable candidate and also has the sympathy of voters. A win in Huzurabad will level the bypoll score at 2 each with TRS. The BJP cadre is knocking every door and urging people to give justice to Eatala,” said a senior BJP leader. On his part, finance minister T Harish Rao, who is leading the TRS campaign, has been telling people that a victory for Eatala would not fetch them anything as he would remain in opposition. The TRS refrain has been that the party would be in power for two more years and a victory would ensure development of the state and possibility of ‘Dalit Bandhu’-like scheme being extended to other communities too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-up-2-1-as-t-gets-ready-for-4th-bypoll/articleshow/86739578.cms||Roushan Ali

That’s why they termed them as the single-largest threat to internal security. They have continuously conducted military operations against the Maoists, but the heroic people retaliated under the brave leadership of People's Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA).

Congress functionaries said that earlier too KCR had announced that a Dalit would be made CM but backtracked on his promise after winning the election. “At least this time, he should fulfil his promise,” said one Congress functionary. Terming the recent Dalit Bandhu scheme as an election stunt, AICC Telangana in-charge Manickam Tagore on Sunday said that the chief minister should follow up on his promise of a Dalit chief minister if “he has concern or love for the SCs.” “Congress has made a Dalit as the chief minister of Punjab, a Dalit as leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha and a Dalit in Bhatti Vikramarka as floor leader in Telangana assembly. KCR should strip KTR of municipal administration portfolio and give it a to a Dalit,” Tagore demanded. “Congress is a pro-Dalit and pro-poor party. KR Narayanan was the first Dalit president of the country and credit of elevating to him to the top position goes to Congress,” Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy said. The TPCC chief charged Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government of going on a selling-spree of public sector undertakings including the historic Vizag Steel Plant. “SCs, STs and BCs will lose reservation rights due to privatisation of PSUs. On the other hand, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has given permission for private universities which will not follow the rule of reservation,” Revanth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-kcr-should-follow-up-on-promise-of-making-dalit-cm/articleshow/86739727.cms||---

Revanth visited hospitals and residences of party leaders, students and unemployed youth who were injured in the alleged police lathicharge on them. He sought to assure the youth that the party will stand by them until they get government jobs and that the Congress will give tickets to youngsters to contest elections, depending upon their hard work for the party. “We gave Huzurabad bypoll ticket to Balmoori Venkat, NSUI state president, for his hard work,” Revanth said. “It looks like chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is deriving sadistic pleasure by letting lose the police force on students, youth and the unemployed. There is no doubt that these sections will bring down the KCR government soon,” he said. Several members of Congress, Youth Congress and NSUI on Sunday burnt the effigies of CM KCR in protest against the alleged police lathicharge on the youth and Congress members on Saturday. They paid floral tributes to the statue of BR Ambedkar and prayed that good sense prevails on KCR to fill up all the two lakh vacancies in the government sector without further delay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/congress-to-lodge-complaint-with-sc/st-panel/articleshow/86739499.cms||---

Cops also seized a scooter from him. According to inspector S Raghavendra, Daniel was an addict and began peddling cocaine a few years ago after coming in contact with Delhi-based Nigerian peddler John Paul. Daniel was arrested once earlier by Langar Houz police in October 2020, the inspector said. Daniel had gone back to peddling after coming out of prison recently.

But the drug couriers’ addiction — to Bollywood — is making dialogue possible. Two of the accused have learnt to speak Hindi owing to their obsession with Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan blockbusters. The other five have built the capacity to understand Hindi, if not spout dramatic lines in it. The seven were nabbed during a mid-sea operation on September 18 by the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and the Indian Coast Guard. “We have been interrogating the accused persons for about five days. Their native language is Persian,” said an ATS officer aware of the interrogations. “But because they are Bollywood enthusiasts, communication has not been a problem.” The officer added: “Two of them speak Hindi and five understand it enough to respond to questions.” The officer said that the interrogators were astounded when they first encountered the Hindi proficiency of the accused. Their Hindi, of course, is a variant — Hindustani, a dialect enriched by Urdu. Hindustani is Bollywood’s lingua franca. Earlier, the dialect had been adopted by Mahatma Gandhi.The seven Iran nationals are Ismail Pridadi, Abdul Sattar Mahlum, Rahim Bakhshi, Qadar Bakhshi, Khalid Jagdal, Doormohammed Faiz, and Hamidullah Bakhshi. Sources in the ATS said that the seven were sent by their boss, Imam Bakhsh, to deliver the consignment to Sri Lanka. But as the security and marine agencies were on alert in Sri Lanka following a few big drug seizures, the crew were told to sail into Indian waters. The cache was to be delivered in Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/iran-drug-crew-bollywood-addicts-give-dope-in-hindi/articleshow/86736273.cms||Ashish Chauhan

In retaliation, Congress, the biggest ally of RJD in the state, also decided to contest on both the seats. Congress had earlier expressed its desire to contest from its traditional Kusheshwar Asthan seat, which it had lost by a margin of around 7,000 votes in the 2020 assembly election. It had recently sent a five-member team to Darbhanga district to get people’s feedback before finalizing a candidate there. But its plan received a major jolt after RJD state president Jagdanand Singh announced Arun Kumar Sah and Ganesh Bharti as the party’s official candidates from Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan seats, respectively. “We have almost finalized our candidate for the Kusheshwar Asthan seat. We will hold a meeting tonight to finalize the name for Tarapur seat,” Bihar Congress president Madan Mohan Jha told TOI over phone on Sunday. Asked whether Congress has a formidable candidate in Tarapur, Jha said several prospective candidates approached the party leaders after the RJD announced its candidates from both the seats. “However, a final decision regarding contesting from both the seats will be taken by the party’s central leadership,” he said. To a question, Jha said, “In Congress, the candidates for any election are decided by the party’s high command.” Contrary to Congress’s claim, RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari told TOI that his party’s national president Lalu Prasad finalized the candidates for both the constituencies only after holding deliberations with the top leaders of all allies, including the Congress. Sources said Lalu personally spoke to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and AICC in-charge for Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, before finalizing the RJD candidates. The RJD’s move, however, invited sharp reactions from the NDA. “Today, the RJD once again showed its status to the Congress. The Congress high command should immediately break up its tie with RJD to save its face to some extent,” former Bihar CM and HAM(S) president Jitan Ram Manjhi said. "RJD is nervous with the way Congress is trying to come out of its shadow. Joining of former CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar is an attempt in the same direction. RJD is now over cautious. It’s not that RJD has ignored the Congress but also ensured that Tejashwi doesn’t share dais with Kanhaiya. The UPA alliance no longer exists in Bihar,” BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand told TOI. Bypolls to Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur seats were necessitated following the death of JD(U) MLAs Shashi Bhushan Hajari and Mewalal Choudhary, respectively. JD(U) has fielded Aman Bhushan Hajari, the son of Shashi Bhushan, in Kusheshwar Asthan, and Rajiv Kumar Singh from Tarapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rift-in-ga-as-rjd-names-candidates-for-bypoll-seats/articleshow/86736325.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Delhi||Four hitmen of gangsters’ ‘alliance’ held, police manage to avert gang wars in Delhi||NEW DELHI: In the first major crackdown on an alliance forged by top jailed gangsters, Delhi Police’s Special Cell has arrested four shooters of a hit squad that had arrived in the city to avenge Jitender Gogi, who was killed by his rivals in Rohini District Courts Complex. With the arrests, police have averted gang wars that were to be executed over the next few weeks. On the target was gangster Sunil Tajpuria, apart from the henchmen of his associates who helped him kill Gogi. The shooters, belonging to the Gogi-Lawrence Bishnoi faction, were working on the instructions of Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar, who was coordinating with Bishnoi, Kala Jathedi and Gogi’s deputy Deepak Teetar. The hitmen, involved in over 20 murders and 30 cases of extortion, robbery and carjacking, were tracked down by a team led by DCP Sanjeev Yadav, comprising ACP Sanjay Dutt and inspectors Man Singh and Anuj Tyagi. “Shooter Anuj had a Rs 2.2 lakh reward on his head, while Sagar Rana carried Rs 1 lakh. The other two, Harsh and Sumit, had Rs 75,000 and 50,000 bounty on them, respectively. Nine pistols, including an American Taurus, Turkish Zigana and Chinese Star, apart from 123 cartridges and two cars have been seized,” said Yadav. They have been taken on remand for 10 days. The quartet, who are in their mid-20s, was on the run after killing a gangster in Punjab two days ago. They were being tracked by Special Cell after their links with the alliance surfaced. TOI was the first to blow the lid off this alliance in May during the homicide probe involving wrestler Sushil Kumar. “While the Gogi gang formed an alliance with Jathedi, Bishnoi, Sampat Nehra, Ashok Pradhan and Hashim Baba, the Tillu Gang was supported by Neeraj Bawana, Sunil Rathee, Naveen Bali, Nasir, etc,” Yadav said. Apart from Tajpuria, who is on remand with Crime Branch, the arrested men had planned to kill shooters of Bawana and Bali gang — Monu Bajitpuriya, Vishal Maan and Naresh Tajpuriya. “It was learnt that the shooters would come to Prahladpur or Khera village in outer Delhi. A grey Baleno was spotted and the team followed it. As the criminals tried to speed away, police blocked their way and cornered them. However, shooters in a second car managed to flee, but left their i10 behind. They are being traced,” said the DCP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/four-hitmen-of-gangsters-alliance-held-police-manage-to-avert-gang-wars-in-city/articleshow/86738815.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Bareilly||4 farmers, 4 BJP men killed as UP protest turns violent||BAREILLY: Cars that were part of Union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra Teni’s convoy allegedly mowed down four farmers during a black flag protest at Tikunia in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday afternoon — the farmers alleged the minister’s son Ashish Mishra was leading the convoy, which Teni denied. Retaliation was swift and the angry farmers reportedly beat four BJP workers to death before setting their vehicles on fire. No FIR had been registered in either case till the time of filing this report. “Eight people have died — four were farmers and four BJP workers. Senior officials are working out what further action will be taken in the case. It is likely that the FIRs will be registered from both sides. A transparent investigation will be conducted. The situation is peaceful and under our control,” Nighasan sub-divisional magistrate Om Prakash Gupta told TOI. Three companies of Police Armed Constabulary have been sent to the area and internet services, locals said, have been suspended. ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar had left for the village along with IG (Lucknow range) Laxmi Singh. Police didn’t confirm the number of those injured though farmers said 12 were injured by the speeding cars and 50 in lathicharge. The protest goes back to a statement allegedly made by Teni at a public meeting at Sampoornanagar in Lakhimpur Kheri last week, a purported video of which had been doing the rounds, in which he is heard saying, with reference to the farmers’ protest, “Fix yourselves or face me. I will fix you in a matter of minutes. I am not just a minister or an MLA or an MP. Those who know me from before I became a legislator would also know I never retreat from challenges.” Bharatiya Sikh Sangathan president Jasbir Singh Virk said farmers were ready to stage a black flag protest at the Maharaja Agrasen Sports Ground helipad when Teni and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya got there to address an event on Sunday. “But they didn’t arrive, and the farmers learnt they had changed their plan and were taking the road. My farmers saw it as a success and were marching back,” he added in a video statement. CM Yogi Adityanath issued a statement late on Sunday night, saying, "It is an unfortunate incident and the government will deeply investigate the reasons behind the incident and disclose all the anti-social elements and punish them. Senior officials including ADG law and order, IG are investigating the incident from the spot and controlling the situation. Action will be taken against whoever is found guilty. People are requested to stay at home and help the administration in maintaining peace in the area. They should wait for the investigation report before reaching a conclusion.” One of the protesters, Gagan Chattha, told TOI, “It was a narrow road where we were protesting. Teni’s son arrived in a vehicle followed by two other SUVs. When a few farmers waved black flags at his vehicle, his car sped up and another deliberately ran over the farmers who were doing so. Many of us jumped out of its path — the vehicle ran over almost every person on the 200-m stretch.” Teni didn’t respond to TOI’s calls for a comment. Earlier in the evening, he denied all allegations in an interview with a news channel. He said that “anti-social elements among the farmers” had started pelting stones at BJP workers, a vehicle’s driver died and his vehicle turned turtle on farmers, killing two on the spot. “Then, the farmers beat four BJP workers to death and set the vehicles on fire. The farmers who died were from Nanpara in Bahraich, not even from Lakhimpur Kheri. That indicates it was a planned act. Anti-social elements were hiding among farmers.” At least two farmers who died were not from Bahraich, TOI confirmed — Nachattar Singh, 60, from Lakhimpur Kheri and Lovepreet Singh, 20, from Chokdha farm in Lakhimpur Kheri’s Majhgai. Gurpej Singh, 26, also an eyewitness, told TOI, “We had blocked the road when the minister’s vehicles ran over us farmers. I managed to get out of the way but my nephew Lovepreet couldn’t. He died. A few metres ahead, the vehicle was stopped and the minister’s son Monu (Ashish) Mishra stepped out, pistol in hand, and managed to escape with the help of policemen.” The two other farmers who died were Daljeet Singh, 35, and Gurwinder Singh, 19, farmer leaders told TOI. Where they were from could not be confirmed. When the vehicles were stopped, the farmers caught the rest of the party workers in the cars. “We saved three men and handed them over to police after questioning. All three were from Allahabad and said they work for minister Teni,” said Chattha. Another protester, Vikramjeet Singh, told TOI, “Terai Kisan Mahasabha president Tejinder Singh Virk was seriously injured in the head and legs. He has been hospitalised and is critical.” Additional SP Arun Kumar Singh told the farmers, “My farmer brothers, I promise you that action will be taken against whoever is responsible.” Teni denied the allegations against his son in the interview, saying, “My son was at the venue since 11am, where many government officials were also present. He didn’t leave the venue for a second. At the wheel of my vehicle was a driver and in the car were three party workers. They died a tragic death … I have video evidence to prove my son was not there and he will join any investigation needed.” (With inputs from Aakash Ahuja in Rudrapur)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/8-die-in-violence-during-farmers-protest-in-up/articleshow/86736300.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: This Theni tribal village keeps Covid-19 at bay||MADURAI: The Muthuvan tribals of Muthuvakudi village in Bodinayakanur, Theni, have coped well with the Covid-19 pandemic by following isolation measures early enough and by sticking to their indigenous diet. Not even one person in the village comprising 35 families has so far contracted the infection. Located above the Kottakudi hills, Muthuvakudi is in a reserved forest. “Freshwater crabs and Turkey Berries are our common traditional food that we took regularly since the Covid-19 pandemic began so as to prevent cough and cold,” said Thangappan, a native of the village. Turkey Berries or ‘Sundakkai’ were fried or simply mixed with greens and eaten. Muthuvan tribal women said they spent most of their time during the lockdown period inside the home and prepared kashayam of ginger, turmeric and pepper and consumed it for building immunity. The tribals had also moved inside to search for food in the forest to mitigate the suffering during lockdown periods. Another villager, Ramadurai, said the village had a meeting with all people in the settlement and decided not to go out to towns, and also not to allow anyone from outside to enter it. “If we go to purchase essential groceries and vegetable items, we keep the person in isolation in a hut for two days in order to identify symptoms,” he added. Around 25 Muthuvan tribals took part in an awareness camp organized at their village by the department of communication, Madurai Kamaraj University and National Council for Science and Technology Communication, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, on Friday. Dr S Nagarathinam, Head, department of communication, MKU, said the indigenous knowledge of tribals will always help communities overcome extremely difficult situations, even the pandemic. “Our aim was to interact with the tribal community and create awareness about Covid-19 and post Covid-19. However, it was surprising to see their understanding and knowledge,” he added. During the programme, Dr J Ilamurugan, a doctor, said that the willingness of the tribals to understand the new situation is remarkable. All those above 18 years of age among Muthuvakudi tribals had already taken Covid-19 vaccination too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tribal-village-keeps-covid-19-at-bay/articleshow/86738811.cms||---

---||Trichy||Students’ role vital in getting NEET exemption for TN: MP||Trichy: The role of the student community in consolidating the voice against the national eligibility-cum-entrance test (NEET) for selection to MBBS course is vital to getting exemption for Tamil Nadu from the test, said speakers at a state-level conference organised by Students’ Federation of India (SFI) here. Members of Parliament, educationalists and writers who attended the conference said the conduct of the test invades the state’s autonomy and demotivates medical aspirants. DMK Rajya Sabha MP Tiruchi Siva said there is a perception that only Tamil Nadu is opposing the entrance test, which must be changed by mobilising anti-NEET protesters from other states. Unity among NEET opponents was the need of the hour. “If we can achieve a solution in the pro-jallikattu movement, why not in NEET? SFI’s role is vital to gather support across India. We must bring back education under the state list,” he said. He claimed that the AIADMK government did not take dedicated measures to get an exemption for the state. General secretary of the state platform for the common school system, Prince Gajendra Babu, said the Union government has to uphold the spirit of federalism by giving exemption to Tamil Nadu in NEET. “Even before the jallikattu movement, Tamil Nadu students have attracted the attention of the country by challenging the authoritarian approach on various occasions including the controversial three-language policy in the 1960s. Only the student community can keep the dissent against NEET alive until the Union government backs off,” Madurai MP Su Venkatesan said. Pointing to statistics, the CPM MP said that about 63% of childbirths in Tamil Nadu are happening in government health institutes whereas it is only 31% and 27% respectively in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/students-role-vital-in-getting-neet-exemption-for-tn-mp/articleshow/86738850.cms||---

---||Trichy||Turnout dips in Trichy, Madurai||Trichy/Madurai: The state government’s fourth mega vaccination drive failed to yield the desired response in the nine central districts mainly due to the rain at many camp locations. Despite the hardships, special camps vaccinated 2.65 lakh people in the region on Sunday, 65,310 of them in Trichy. In Madurai district, 67,096 people received the vaccine, though the number was less compared to the previous drives. According to Madurai district health officials, 37,836 got the jab in rural areas and 27,428 in urban areas. As many as 1,832 beneficiaries got their jab in government hospitals. “However, there has been a slight decline in those queuing up on their own to get the vaccine,” said a health official. Health minister Ma Subramanian said at Trichy that the coverage in district was 63%. “Although the wet weather may impact the vaccination drive, we will conduct consultation meetings with district administrations to plan the next camp accordingly,” he said. No vaccination camp will be held on Monday to provide breathing time for the health staff involved in the programme. He said people requiring vaccination for emergency purposes will be attended to at medical college hospitals. The state has about 13 lakh doses of vaccines in hand, he added. The minister appreciated Ariyalur, Pudukottai and Nilgiris districts for the special focus on vaccinating expectant mothers and those with disabilities. In Trichy city, about 23,000 people were vaccinated. A sanitary department employee identified as S Alangaraj provided free food for 200 people vaccinated at the Maduram school ground. In Theni, 33,000 beneficiaries received the vaccine. About 54% of adult population in Theni district has received the first dose and 19% both doses. Minister Ma Subramanian inspected the vaccination camps at Palanichettipatti and Cumbum and and camps near the checkposts in border areas where screening is being done for those travelling from Kerala. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/turnout-dips-in-trichy-madurai/articleshow/86738876.cms||---
---||Trichy||Slow progress of NH road widening work irks Trichiites||Trichy: The poor progress in the widening work of the Trichy-Pudukottai national highway passing through Trichy has irked the residents and commuters. Although the civil work for the Rs 69 crore projectbegan10 months back, little progress has been made. As either end of the road was dug for the project, residents in the adjoining settlements have been facing connectivity issues while two-wheeler riders find the commute risky. The 10km stretch of the NH commencing from TVS tollgate near Trichy-Chennai NH passing through Subramaniapuram, Kottapattu and Gundoor was identified to have five blackspots witnessing frequent fatal accidents. Subsequently, the Trichy project implementation unit (PIU) of the state highways unit in January evicted the encroachments on the highway for the project. The highways department planned to convert the first 4 km of the 10 km stretch from TVS tollgate for establishing a paved shoulder road covering Subramaniapuram. The remaining portion was touted to get a four-lane road with a centre median. The proposal exists only on paper with little developments made, residents complained. “During night hours, the dug part of the road is invisible. There are no safety mechanisms such as reflective stickers and sandbags to caution the commuters, no adequate lighting too,” Navid Ibrahim, a frequent commuter, told TOI. Service roads were promised for Subramaniapuram and Trichy airport stretches within a year. However, as almost 10 months have passed since the construction work commenced, the residents are skeptical of project completion in the assured timeframe. The state highways department officials were unavailable to comment. “There is no support from the officials to execute the work, there are few more encroachments to be removed,” a source involved in the road project said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/slow-progress-of-nh-road-widening-work-irks-trichiites/articleshow/86738894.cms||Deepak Karthik

Speeding by the bike was the likely cause. While bike rider survived as he was wearing a helmet, the pillion-rider without it was not so lucky, police said. Chaitanya Verma (22), who died, and his brother Ganesh Raju (24), are students of bachelor of business management in different colleges. They were heading to a drive-in for dinner when the accident happened at 6.45pm between Parvath Nagar and NIA office. “They started their journey from home and the accident happened about a km from the drive-in restaurant. There was no fault of the car driver and it looks that the bike was speeding. The bike is of 500 cc,” sub-inspector K Rajendra told TOI.While Chaitanya was killed at the spot, Raju escaped with minor injuries as he was wearing a helmet. The brothers hail from East Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh and stay in Borabanda.

---||Trichy||Case against couple for running illegal kids’ home||Trichy: Pudukottai police registered a case against a government school teacher and her husband on Sunday for operating an unauthorised children’s home in Pudukkottai district. Both the accused are absconding. Seven girls who were accommodated at the illegal home were shifted to an authorised children’s home in the district by the district child protection unit (DCPU) officials. Officials identified the accused as R Kalaimagal, 47, a teacher at a government school in Kudimiyammalai village. Along with her husband Rajendran she was operating ‘Dr Award Children Home’ in Kudimiyanmalai for about three years without informing the authorities that she is a government servant. Meanwhile, during a routine inspection DCPU found that Kalaimagal is a government school teacher. A notice was served to her as government employees were not allowed to operate children’s homes. The officials said that Kalaimagal voluntarily closed her home around two months ago. But, recently, the controversial home started functioning again after accommodating seven girl children aged between 10 and 16 years. “We received a complaint that the inmates were forcibly employed at construction sites and for agriculture works by the home. We sealed the home and relocated the girls to a government-licensed home on September 30. Based on our complaint, an FIR was registered against the school teacher and her husband on Sunday,” Gunaseeli J, district child protection officer, told TOI. The rescued girl children will be enrolled in a government school in Vellanur. The home was also receiving funds from people abroad to help the inmates. But, the fund was not properly utilised towards addressing the needs of the inmates, DCPU said. The district administration has ordered a freeze on the bank account of the trust. Pudukkottai police are on the lookout for the absconding accused. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/case-against-couple-for-running-illegal-kids-home/articleshow/86738911.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Tiger killed by poachers in Mulugu, 4 end in police net||HYDERABAD: A tiger died after it was caught in a snare laid by poachers in a deeply forested area of Telangana’s Mulugu district. Police and wildlife authorities said the killing took place two weeks ago, but police officers found the skeletal remains of a tiger, without the skin and nails on Sunday morning. According to the police, a search operation was launched on Saturday after they received information about a few people from Kodishala and nearby Guthikoya habitations of Tadwai mandal in the district going to Chhattisgarh to sell suspected body parts of a tiger such as skin and nails. “We started searching every vehicle going towards Chhattisgarh as soon as we received information and on Sunday morning, we came across four people in a car. When we checked the vehicle, we found one nail of a tiger which was ascertained by the forest officials,” Mulugu superintendent of police Sangram Singh told TOI. “We later seized the tiger skin as well from the poachers,” he added. Officials said the accused have accepted the crime during investigation. Further investigations revealed that the poachers who earn their livelihood from podu cultivation resorted to wildlife poaching for extra income. On noticing that a tiger was venturing into the forest area, the poachers laid traps at certain strategic locations and waited for the tiger to get caught in it. On September 21, one of the accused Madakam Mukesh found that a tiger had died in a trap laid by them and informed five others, who came and de-skinned the tiger, removed the nails and divided it among themselves. They, however, decided to leave the body in the same place where they laid the trap. “During the interrogation, the accused accepted the crime and gave us all the information about the area where they left the remains of the big cat in the forest. On conducting a combing operation, we were able to find some skeletal remains of the tiger,” said Singh adding that four people were taken into custody while five others are still absconding. According to the forest officials, pug marks of a tiger, believed to have come from Chhattisgarh were spotted on August 1 this year in Tadvai forest area of Eturnagaram wildlife sanctuary by officials while patrolling the area. The tiger had roamed the forest areas of Mulugu, Mahabubabad, Bhadradri Kothagudem and Warangal districts. “Coordination mechanisms were set in place between these four districts and active patrolling of forest areas was strengthened. Base camp watchers, animal trackers along with forest staff were deployed in tracking and camera traps were installed and movement of a tiger was monitored,” said chief conservator of forests (CCF), Warangal Circle, SJ Asha. “A case has been booked against all the offenders under the Wildlife Act, 1972, and further investigation is in progress,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tiger-killed-by-poachers-in-mulugu-4-end-in-police-net/articleshow/86740955.cms||Moulika.KV

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Resident doctors getting support, except from state government||NAGPUR: Resident doctors in all government medical colleges (GMCs) in Maharashtra who are on strike from the last three days for academic fee waiver and better hostels are getting increasing support from the other health professionals. After nurses and interns on Saturday, the on contract doctors and professors from the GMCs also extended their support to the agitating doctors. However, the state government is still not paying any heed to their demands. The minister of medical education was expected to hold a meeting with residents on Sunday but no such meeting was held till late night. “No meeting was held on Sunday. Our strike will continue tomorrow. We are planning to intensify the strike from 3.30pm on Monday,” said Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale Patil, president of the central committee of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD). Residents will withdraw their services from all out-patient departments, in-patient departments, diagnostic labs, casualty departments, essential planned surgeries and deliveries and also from the vaccination departments. “All types Of ICUs for both Covid and non-Covid patients will be provided by resident doctors in good faith. The other services will not be provided by us across the state,” Dr Dhobale added. Sources in the medical education department said the state government is not going to accept the demand of waiving academic fees of resident doctors. Instead, the government may waive TDS on their stipend and improve conditions in their hostels in order to end the strike. Residents, on the other hand, are firm on their demand for a written assurance of academic fee waiver. For common patients, the conditions at GMCs across the state are going to be more challenging now. Wait at the OPDs is going to be longer and it will be difficult to get services on time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/resident-docs-getting-support-except-from-state-government/articleshow/86734423.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Trichy||Rlys to resume one express, 2 passenger trains from Oct 7||Trichy: With the number of fresh Covid-19 cases coming down, Trichy railway division is planning to restore two much-awaited passenger trains from October 7. This apart, an express train will also be restored the same day. The trains have been suspended for several months owing to the lockdown. Mayiladuthurai-Trichy and Trichy-Dindigul passenger trains will start running on October 7 as special trains. Coimbatore-Mannargudi Chemmozhi express will also be restored on the same day as a special train, railway officials said. However, more than 10 passenger trains and a few more express trains are waiting for the railway board’s nod to be restored, officials said. The Trichy-Tirunelveli passenger is being restored up to Dindigul. Trichy-Karaikal and Karaikudi-Thiruvarur passenger trains were restored several months ago as special trains. In the case of express trains, Trichy-Chennai Rockfort, Karaikudi-Chennai Pallavan and Madurai-Villupuram are being operated as special trains for a long period. Thanjavur-Chennai Uzhavan, Thiruhendur-Chennai Chendur, Chennai-Rameswaram Boat Mail, Tambaram-Nagercoil Antyodaya, Rameswaram-Tirupati tri-weekly, Madurai- Chennai bi-weekly, Mayiladuthurai-Coimbatore Janshatabdi (except Tuesday), Rameswaram-Bhubaneswar, Banaras, Faizabad weekly trains have started running as special express trains. Now, the state government has given its nod to open schools. So, it is high time to operate the express trains immediately, A Giri, secretary of the Thanjavur District Railway Users’ Association, said. While welcoming the introduction of passenger trains, rail users appealed to the railways to operate passenger trains as passenger trains, instead of operating them as special trains. When contacted, a senior official from the operating department in the Trichy railway division said that at present the board has given permission to operate only these three trains. “We have written to the railway board asking to grant permission to operate passenger trains in all sections. Once we get the nod, we are ready to operate all the trains,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rlys-to-resume-one-express-2-passenger-trains-from-oct-7/articleshow/86738942.cms||---

The final voting figures however are likely to be a little higher. All three parties in the fray – the BJP, Congress and AAP – claimed victory after completion of voting. Barring a couple of minor instances of clashes between workers of political parties, the polling was peaceful in the state capital. For 44 seats of the GMC, a total of 161 candidates are in the fray, including 44 from BJP and Congress each and 40 from AAP, among others. Results of the GMC election will be declared on Tuesday. Voting began on a rather low key and most wards recorded less than 10% voting in the first two or three hours. However, polling picked up in the last four hours as queues were seen at most polling centres between 2pm and 6pm. Preliminary numbers said that ward No. 7- Kolwada-Vavol - registered the highest polling at 66.93% while ward No. 5 – Panchdev – registered the lowest polling figures of 35.86%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gandhinagar-voter-turnout-over-56-results-on-tuesday/articleshow/86736553.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||It’s a smooth ride to Cantt’s def areas, but civic roads in tatters||Secunderabad: While roads leading to defence institutions within Secunderabad Cantonment are dust-free and have proper traffic signs, the same cannot be said for roads leading to residential areas. The cantonment’s engineering wing said that they had taken up a marathon exercise to fill potholes and repair BT roads but many stretches in Bowenpally, Trimulgherry, Karkhana and Bolarum were yet to be attended to. “Soon after the rainy season is over, pothole filling and patch works will be taken up,” cantonment engineer Gopala Krishna Das told TOI. Locals in cantonment said that their taxes should be prioritised for two purposes — fixing roads and solving water problems. “It is unfortunate that we are living amid a lack of civic amenities,” said BN Dhanunjay, a resident of Diamond Point, Bowenpally. All this while neighbouring Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) maintains a network of footpaths along the city’s main roads. “We cannot find even a kilometre of straight footpaths,” rued 70-year-old S Anjaneya Reddy of Picket who owns apartments in Madhapur and Bolarum and pays property tax to both SCB and GHMC. “How much is the SCB spending on basic amenities,” he quizzed. “Forget about road widening plans. The roads in cantonment areas don’t even have proper footpaths. The SCB must develop that on priority for pedestrians,” said Phani Raj, a resident of Karkhana. Many resolutions on repair and maintenance have been passed during the year-long SCB meetings but the board is prioritising emergency repairs as a result of a fund crunch. Interestingly, while the Secunderabad Cantonment has a road network of around 500 km, the SCB does not have data on traffic hotspots. While road mishaps have occurred, the fatality rate compared to GHMC remains low. “Vehicles move at a camel’s pace due to the congested and narrow roads. Due to this, there is very little scope for road accidents,” said an SCB official. While commuters in GHMC experience a smooth ride on major roads, for the country’s second-largest cantonment, this still remains a far cry. Many residents of cantonment areas remain anguished over the pothole-ridden, dusty roads and feel that a merger of civic bodies could lead to an improved road network in their area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/its-a-smooth-ride-to-cantts-def-areas-but-civic-roads-in-tatters/articleshow/86738982.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||India||SC upholds hike in payout from 10 lakh to 2 crore for accident victim||CHENNAI:accidentA Supreme Court bench of Justices R Subhash Reddy and Hrishikesh Roy has dismissed an appeal filed by the National Insurance Company Limited against an order of the Madras HC that enhanced the compensation paid to the family of an accident victim by 1,700% from 10.4 lakh to 1.85 crore based on Form-16, salary slip and other tax papers filed by the victim’s family. On October 14, 2013, Subash Babu, a 35-year-old manager of a private firm, was killed in an accident while driving a car from Perumanallur to Erode. His wife and other family members who were travelling with him escaped with injuries. His wife, an eyewitness, told Tiruppur motor accident claims tribunal that a van which was going in front of their car turned right without showing any signal and their car rammed against the van and her husband died in the impact. The tribunal, however, fixed 75% contributory negligence on the victim based on police FIR, which blamed Babu for negligent driving, and awarded Rs 10.4 lakh as compensation by fixing Babu’s monthly income at Rs 20,000 per month. Aggrieved by the order, the family moved the HC. In August 2018, Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice Krishnan Ramasamy of the Madras HC quashed the order of the tribunal and held that since there was no rebuttal witness provided by the insurance company, the accident happened only due to the negligence of the van driver. Taking into consideration the victim’s tax records and pay slip, the court fixed the victim’s annual income at 12.3 lakh and computed the compensation to be paid by the insurance company as 1.85 crore. Agreeing with the HC ruling, the Supreme Court bench said, “In view of such evidence on record, there is no reason to give weightage to the contents of the FIR. If any evidence before the tribunal runs contrary to the contents in the FIR, the evidence which is recorded before the tribunal has to be given weightage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-upholds-hike-in-payout-from-10-lakh-to-2-crore-for-accident-victim/articleshow/86742611.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: As RT-PCR shows false negatives, doctors stress on new protocols to detect virus||HYDERABAD: With more cases of patients showing clinical symptoms of Covid-19 but RT-PCR tests coming back negative, hospitals have laid down new protocols to stop emerging variants from going undetected. “Although RT-PCR test is the gold standard, right from the beginning of the pandemic it has had a 20% false negative rate and relying on clinical symptoms along with the tests has been followed for a while now. While currently Delta and Delta Plus variants are being picked up by the existing testing methods, if any new variants emerge, then there is a probability that it may not be detected,” said Dr M Raja Rao, superintendent, Gandhi Hospital. In a study conducted at AIG hospitals, comparing RT-PCR positivity from nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) nasal swabs and saliva, doctors found that in hospitalised patients RT-PCR by NP/OP swabs showed 80% positivity. In patients who tested negative by NP/OP swab, if saliva was tested, the per cent positivity increases to 95%. “Emergence of viral variants that are no longer detectable by certain diagnostic tests is a real possibility due to the fact that the virus is constantly mutating. A negative RT-PCR result does not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consider negative RT-PCR result in combination with clinical observations, patient history, lab and radiological investigations and epidemiological information,” said Dr Nageshwar Reddy, chairman, AIG hospitals, after releasing a Covid-19 protocol guideline. Other experts say that of the four main variants of concern, beta and gamma can be sometimes missed. “However, cases can also be missed due to timing of tests, vaccination status of the individual as vaccinated individuals clears the load of the virus much faster compared to others, there is a high possibility of missing out the infection,” said Dr Kiran Madhala, healthcare expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-rt-pcr-shows-false-negatives-docs-stress-on-new-protocols-to-detect-virus/articleshow/86739005.cms||Amrita Didyala

While the initial visits will be to check if the schools have the required infrastructure, subsequent visits will be evaluating the situation with respect to students’ comfort and to get feedback on health and other issues arising in the schools. School teachers have been informed of the primary health centres (PHC) with which they have been mapped. Private English-medium schools authorities have also made arrangements. “The teams will start visiting schools from the first day to see if the arrangements made are satisfactory. They will ensure the schools understand what is required as per the Covid protocol,” said Sunita Dhangar, the NMC administrative officer. Nashik city has 223 schools for students of Classes VIII to XII, with roughly 1.10 lakh students in them. Most of these schools are private. In the rural areas of the district, the schools for these classes have already been functioning. In the rural areas, schools for students of Classes V to VII will also start on October 4. There are 1,093 ZP schools with 67,781 students, and 1,709 private aided and unaided schools with 2.4 lakh students. Here too, the education department has said that it would deploy teams to see if the schools were following all norms including linking with health centres — which would be the nearest PHC or sub-centre. Officials said the health of the students in the schools will be monitored through the respective health centres. “We would keep a track of teachers’ and students’ health through the health centres. Even if there is any case of Covid, the parents need not panic as all measures would be started immediately,” said Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, NMC’s medical superintendent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-zp-teams-to-assess-schools-reopening-today/articleshow/86734476.cms||Abhilash Botekar

In October last year, the SCB had passed a resolution for white-topping the road between Bapuji Nagar and Sowjanya Colony at Bowenpally on a pilot basis, but the project could not take off owing to lack of funds. “We did not adopt the white-topping technology as it is an expensive affair and the SCB is already in a financial crisis,” cantonment engineer, Gopal Krishna Das, told TOI. Cantonment engineers continue to follow decades-old methods to repair roads, and this gives only temporary relief to commuters as the roads begin to wear and tear again after a few weeks. “SCB engineers need to study the road repair technology by visiting either other cantonments or the GHMC in order to adopt the same technology in the cantonment. The SCB also needs to take the help of JNTU and civil engineering department for a detailed study of the road network,” T Sambasiva Rao, former roads and buildings engineer, said. S Dheeraj, a resident of Karkhana, said the SCB must hand over the entire cantonment road network to Hyderabad Road Development Corporation Ltd (HRDCL) for maintenance for a period of 30 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/white-topping-faces-roadblock-in-cantonment/articleshow/86738996.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Kolkata||Reverses trend in traditional weak points at Chakraberia, Puddapukur and Alipore||Kolkata: For the first time in over half-a-decade, Trinamool on Sunday swept to victory in all the eight Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) wards in Bhowanipore, considered a tricky constituency for the party as 44% of the electorate of the area are non-Bengali-speaking people. The party would usually hit a block in two of the wards, but it finally broke the jinx this time. This hurdle for Trinamool from this constituency was first revealed in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, when the BJP took a lead in the Bhowanipore assembly segment with 185 votes. “This time, the people of Bhowanipore voted us to victory in all the wards. Even in the 2016 assembly election, we had trailed in one or two wards, but not this time. I thank all of you for that. I sincerely thank the people of Bhowanipore and the entire country who had rooted for us,” said Mamata Banerjee after the election results were declared. She won by 58,389 votes, beating her own 2011 record of 54,213. Since 2011, Trinamool’s trouble point among the eight wards in the constituency has primarily been wards 70 and 74, where they had always trailed in assembly elections. In the Lok Sabha election, the situation worsened with the party trailing in six out of the eight wards. Back in 2014, Subrata Bakshi had lost the Bhowanipore segment under Kolkata South by 185 votes but was saved with a handsome margin in the other six segments to win the election. But this time, Trinamool won a lead of 1,782 votes at Ward 70, comprising Paddapukur and Chakraberia areas, and 4,979 votes’ lead at Ward 74, which covered the Alipore neighbourhood. In the 2021 assembly election, the party had trailed by 2,078 votes in Ward 70 and by 446 votes in Ward 74. “Didi and Abhishek Banerjee called me to her home on Sunday and personally congratulated me. She said I had finally given her a win from my constituency. Despite working very hard through the years, we had trailed from Ward 70 in the last three elections. In 2021, the trail was by 2,078 votes, in 2019, the deficit was of 4,500 votes and in 2016, the trail was of around 450 votes. But this time, I had promised her that we would win from this ward and I had kept my promise,” said Asim Basu, the co-ordinator of Ward 70. The trickier of the two wards was 74, where a majority of the electorate comprised non-Bengali speaking population living in high-rises of Alipore. Trinamool, which had consistently trailed from the area, had a dramatic turnaround with 4,979 vote recovery. The party reportedly changed its poll tactics while dealing with this ward and fielded fresh faces. Educated women, led by minister Firhad Hakim’s daughters Priyadarshini and Shabba, personally managed the door-to-door campaign this time. “We just did our bit for the party and our leader Mamata Banerjee in taking her message to high-rise residents. The rest was done by the people of this ward and we are sincerely thankful to them and consider it a blessing,” said Priyadarshini, who had visited every high-rise in the constituency during the election campaign. But while there was a large swing in margins in six wards of Bhowanipore, the two wards that have historically voted in favour of Trinamool in all the elections—wards 77 and 82—yet again threw up the largest margins. Ward 77, consisting of areas like Ekbalpore and Kidderpore, gave a margin of 21,679 votes and Ward 82, comprising Chetla and Gopalnagar, accounted for a margin of 13,111 votes with BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal. “We had a lower poll percentage from our area this time than that in the previous election but that didn’t stop us from giving a lead of 21,679 votes for the party,” said Serajul Karim, a senior party worker in the area. Banerjee’s home turf, where Trinamool had trailed in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections by 496 votes, was won by Sovandeb Chatterjee in the assembly election five months ago. Banerjee only consolidated this lead to 5,889 votes, the fourth biggest margin among the eight wards. Its neighbouring Ward 71 gave Banerjee a 6,099 vote lead and Ward 63 (counted first) gave a lead of 2,336 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/reverses-trend-in-traditional-weak-points-at-chakraberia-puddapukur-and-alipore/articleshow/86739020.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Mob vandalises church in Roorkee; 5 hurt||ROORKEE: An unruly mob, believed to comprise of right-wing activists, went on a rampage and vandalised a Roorkee-based church, attacking five persons during a Sunday prayer meeting. Two women, who had sustained injuries in the attack, and one other had to be rushed to Dehradun and are said to be in a critical condition. The attackers alleged that they suspected some religious conversion-related activities were going on in the area. After the incident, police personnel were deployed outside the church. A case has been registered against at least six identified persons and 200 others who were yet to be identified. Sources told TOI that the mob entered the church situated at the Solanipuram locality at 10 am and started abusing and thrashing people who were inside. Some of them were carrying wooden bars with them. "The prayer was about to begin. Around 10 people were present when the crowd, many of whom we recognised as members of Bajrang Dal and other right-wing groups stormed the church and started beating us and damaging the church property. We know most of the attackers as they keep threatening us to shut down the church. We demand strict action against them. We also want police protection to be provided to us,” said Priyo Sadhna Porter, pastor of the church. Police, on the complaint of Porter, have registered a case under sections 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class), 296 (disturbing religious assembly), 352 (vandalism), 395 (dacoity) and others of Indian Penal Code against a few officials of the BJP and VHP as well as 200 unidentified people. However, no arrest has been made so far, CO (Roorkee) Vivek Kumar said. Meanwhile, when queried about the incident, Adesh Saini, general secretary of district unit of the BJP, said, “We condemn the incident but it is also true that residents of the locality have been cautioning against religious conversions. Let the police investigate the case and the truth will come out.” Watch Uttarakhand: At least 5 injured as mob vandalised a church in Roorkee||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mob-vandalises-church-in-roorkee-5-hurt/articleshow/86736610.cms||Tapan Susheel

Starting August 15 this year, the Nashik city police had implemented the ‘No Petrol, No Helmet’ rule. Accordingly, bikers without helmets are not to be sold fuel at the petrol pumps. However, if a biker is willing to fill a form provided by the police and cite the reason why he/she is not wearing the safety headgear, he/she can be sold petrol. In the form provided by the police, the biker without helmet must mention details like name, address, phone and vehicle registration numbers, etc. and provide the reason why he or she is not wearing the helmet. The forms are then sent to the traffic police, who call the biker concerned and verify why s/he was not wearing the helmet. If the police find that the biker’s reason mentioned in the form is not genuine, a proposal is sent to the RTO to cancel his/her DL. So far, the police have sent proposals to cancel more than 700 DLs to the Nashik RTO. Police commissioner Deepak Pandey said that soon the police bandobast — which had been deployed at the petrol pumps to ensure that there is no argument between the petrol pump staff and bikers over the use of helmets — would be removed. However, the police would continue to maintain vigil and book bikers without helmets. Currently, a massive police drive is underway in which bikers without helmets are being stopped and taken to the city’s Children’s Traffic Education Park and counselled. The bikers are returned their vehicles only after they have attended the counselling session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-cops-send-proposals-to-suspend-700-driving-licences/articleshow/86734493.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Chacharwadi suffers from too much water||AHMEDABAD: Farmers of Chacharwadi village on the outskirts of motown Sanand in Ahmedabad district have a peculiar problem. They are unable to cultivate crops, not because of scarcity, but due to waterlogging. The root of the problem of Chacharwadi village is that the village lake has been encroached upon and filled up with soil after an industrial park was set up in the vicinity. With the natural flow of water from fields to the lake having stopped, most of the fields of the village remain submerged for more than half of the year. “This has become an annual problem which is getting worse by every passing year. Our fields will continue to remain submerged under even after the monsoon is over,” said villager Paresh Patel. Another farmer Mansukh Prajapati, who has filed a case in the high court as well, said that about 200 acres of land has been rendered useless for agriculture for more than half of a year. “I have handed over several applications to the collector. Until the lake is restored again, our problems will not end. And so I have again approached the high court,” said Prajapati. Earlier, the high court had asked the district collector to investigate. Based on the order, a boundary wall of the industrial park was pulled down, but the lake continues to be encroached upon. District collector Sandip Sagale said that he has appointed a team of officials to look into the matter and find a solution. “The report of the team is expected to be submitted in a month. Attempts are on to find a permanent solution to the waterlogging problem,” said Sagale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/chacharwadi-suffers-from-too-much-water/articleshow/86736627.cms||Meghdoot Sharon
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Rs 41 crore pandemic aid given to 66k construction site workers||NAGPUR: The state labour commission extended monetary benefits to the tune of around Rs41 crore to more than 66,000 construction site labourers and another Rs13 lakh to around 1,118 domestic helps to tide over the pandemic blues, especially stoppage of work leading to discontinuation of income. Sources from state labour commissioner’s office stated that about Rs6,000 each were paid to 66,000-odd construction site labourers in three instalments during the pandemic, after receiving their applications online. Many other allowances, too, were disbursed in the same period to the labourers who were registered with their board. Apart from the construction site labourers, the state labour commission also gave Rs1,150 as special Covid allowance to around 1,118 domestic helps who were registered with their board. Assistant labour commissioner Rajdeep Dhurve said the monetary benefits were disbursed directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries after their applications were accepted. “The government decided to dole out benefits to the construction site labourers and the domestic help as these two sectors were heavily affected during the pandemic-induced lockdown, jeopardizing their livelihood,” he said. Dhurve appealed to domestic helps and labourers to register themselves with their respective boards through the labour commissioner’s office. He added that several other benefits are disbursed through the state governments, saying that there was monetary assistance for marriage, maternity help, construction of houses and so on for registered labourers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rs41cr-pandemic-aid-given-to-66k-construction-site-workers/articleshow/86739086.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kolkata||Vote reduced to half, BJP blames it on ‘rigging’||Kolkata: The BJP on Monday alleged false voting, voter intimidation, violence on BJP workers and a partial administration led to its defeat in Bhowanipore. After the counting got over, it turned out the number of votes it won was reduced to almost half of it was in April in five months. The BJP’s candidate also pointed at a “weak organization” that she claimed had further impacted the poll performance. Assembly election BJP candidate Rudranil Ghosh had secured 44,786 votes or 35.1% vote share on April 26. The current Bhowanipore candidate, Priyanka Tibrewal, won 26,428 votes, which made up for 22.2% share. In the assembly election, Ghosh performed well in wards 70, 71, 74 and 63, where Tibrewal trailed in the bypoll. While Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar claimed 57% polling did not reflect a “popular mandate” in a democracy, Tibrewal blamed it on false voting . “We caught false voters at Khalsa School in Ward 70. It was the same in Ward 71. I lost by 121 votes in Ward 74. There are high-rises in that locality, where residents are my friends,” Tibrewal said. “We have seen the percentage of votes. Had they allowed people to vote, the result would not have been like this. At least 100 false votes were cast in each booth.” Accepting the result, Majumdar did congratulate Mamata Banerjee on her win, but he went on to say, “We have to ask whether the results truly reflect people’s mandate as only 57% of the people there went to cast their vote. Rest either could not or did not go out to vote, and that is a large number in a poll.” He claimed Trinamool wanted to “wipe out” BJP from Bhowanipore this time, but the voters’ response in the bypoll was “overwhelming”. In a press statement on behalf of the BJP, the party’s state vice-president Pratap Banerjee said the bypoll “held under an overbearing administration, with dark shadow of fear, intimidation”, was marred by “violence by Trinamool cadres”. “Sadly, the Election Commission did nothing to allay the fears of voters. The polls, particularly in Bhowanipore, were marred by rampant fake voting,” he said. While voter turnout at Bhowanipore this time was lower by nearly 9,000 (from 1,27,376 in April to 1,17,875 in September), Tibrewal secured nearly 22% votes compared to 35% votes Ghosh had won six months ago. Tibrewal, who accepted “her defeat gracefully unlike Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram”, on Sunday pointed at weakness in the BJP’s organization in Bhowanipore. “A leader does not win or lose a poll, but it is the organization that carries out the work. I must admit the organization was weak in Bhowanipore. We have to work hard on that. But if organizational strength means cheating and false voting, like that in Trinamool, we don’t want it,” Tibrewal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vote-reduced-to-half-bjp-blames-it-on-rigging/articleshow/86739046.cms||Rohit Khanna

They questioned the need to deduct Rs 25 from their salaries every month for creation of Telangana Haritha Nidhi or Telangana Green Fund. “We are condemning the state’s decision to deduct money for Haritha Nidhi from teachers’ salaries. The state has not taken consent of all teacher unions before announcing the deduction. This is undemocratic,” said M Srinivas, general secretary, Telangana Progressive Teachers Federation (TPTF). He said that some of the association members received a call from the chief secretary’s office seeking their consent, but added that before they had even responded, the chief minister made the announcement. “To address our concerns and pay us our dues, the state takes months together. They announce deductions even without a heads-up. How long are they going to continue to deduct the amount? How will the amount be spent?” questioned M Raghu Shankar Reddy, state president, Democratic Teachers Federation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/green-fund-move-irks-teachers/articleshow/86739033.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The estate department which had organised the vaccination camp had estimated a turnout of 500 vendors, farmers and also some citizens to get the jab. Most of the vendors and farmers come from far flung places at Laxmipuri on Sunday. The estate department had in advance made announcement about the vaccination camp and had asked potential beneficiaries to come with Aadhaar cards and valid phone numbers. Sachin Jadhav, chief estate officer of KMC said, “It was our first attempt to vaccinate vendors and farmers in the vegetable markets. We have not made vaccination mandatory as the whole excercise is voluntary. Most of the 50 beneficiaries were those up for their doses. We have asked regular vendors to come up with their Aadhaar cards on Monday. We are planning to start special vaccination camps on every Sunday at at least one mandi in the city.” Jadhav said that after speaking to vendors he learnt that many were misinformed about vaccination. “Some were of the belief that after vaccination one dies after two years. Some thought that after vaccination one gets bed-ridden for two to three days. We are going to speak to the leaders,” said Jadhav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/poor-turnout-of-laxmipuri-vendors-for-vaccination/articleshow/86734527.cms||---

The office of the chief electoral officer of West Bengal on the second floor of Balmer Lawrie Building on 21, Netaji Subhas Road, which is usually shut on weekends, opened its gates early on Sunday for the high-voltage verdict in the Bhowanipore assembly constituency. Votes for two other constituencies — Samserganj and Jangipur — were also counted on Sunday. Even though counting did not begin before 8am, and the first trends started coming in around 8.45am, the officials started arriving around 6am. A team of cops arrived around 6am and ordered the parked goods vehicles to move away. Guard rails were put up and cops started checking credentials of everybody walking into the building. The chief electoral officer is the link between the Election Commission of India and the state, and responsible for conducting free and fair elections and counting of votes. At the counting centre in Sakhawat Memorial Government High School, the excitement of the morning paled later in the day. Initially, there were a handful of BJP supporters outside the security zone of the school on Lord Sinha Road as candidate Priyanka Tibrewal entered the venue at 7am. She sat there the entire day as her margin of difference with chief minister Mamata Banerjee got wider with every round. By 10am, all her supporters on Lord Sinha Road had left, but she stayed at the venue till the final results at 2.30pm. In contrast, there was a rise in Trinamool supporters who tried to enter the security zone on bikes with abir and sweets for locals, journalists and cops. When they were allowed in by cops, the party supporters celebrated by sprinkling green abir in the air before heading to Kalighat to celebrate more.

Police registered cross FIRs in the incident and officials are probing the exact sequence of events. Police officials said three women teachers were going to a club on Kursi road when their driver inadvertently brushed their car against the car of the policeman. The woman said in her complaint that the man forcibly stopped their car. “He lost his cool and started beating the car’s bonnet with a stick. He demanded Rs 5,000 compensation from us. He then called his men who surrounded our car and started beating the doors and bonnet,” the complainant added. “Our driver Jagdish locked the car to save us as the man was very abusive and kept abusing us all through. He would have assaulted us if our driver had opened the door on being intimidated,” she said. “I cannot even write the abuses he hurled at us even though his car did not suffer any damage. I will never forget the incident in my life,” she added. Later, police lodged a cross FIR in the case when inspector Ramesh Chand Yadav filed a complaint saying a woman teacher’s car hit his SUV and her driver tried to run him over when he sought an explanation. “She called up someone and soon some men carrying pistols reached the spot. They tried to attack me, but I ran away to save myself,” he said. “She threatened to lodge a case of eve teasing against me,” Yadav claimed. ADCP, North, Prachi Singh said an FIR was registered against an unidentified man on charges of sexual harassment and rash driving while the inspector lodged a case of rioting, rioting with deadly weapons and attempt to murder. “The case is under investigation.

---||Hyderabad||Elderly helpline a hit in Telangana, maximum calls on Covid||HYDERABAD: The ‘Elder Line’ — a helpline for senior citizens — has been buzzing since its launch in the state. While it began operations in Telangana more than a year ago and subsequently in a few other states, the ‘Elder Line’ was launched across India last week by the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment. In Telangana, the helpline received 46,771 calls between October 2020 and September 2021. Maximum calls to the helpline came from Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Medchal Malkajgiri, accounting for 64%. Covid-related queries (47%) were at the top of the list, while many others called up to report abuse, pension problems and plea for rescue. However, only 1% callers dialled the number for emotional support. Men accounted for nearly three-fourths of the calls, seeking information or help. Of the nearly 3,500 calls related to Covid, the most common support sought was information on vaccination, facilities at vaccination centre such as wheelchair and water, Covid testing and reference to a doctor. While some elders trapped indoors without support sought help for transport, grocery and medicines. The maximum calls to report abuse were made between April 2021 and June 2021. Of these, 421 have been resolved, while 113 were under process, officials said. In one case, a distressed father’s call helped heal the constant friction with his son. “The father from Wanaparthy called up to complain against his son. He said that the son was not taking care of him and was abusive. Our field response officer (FRO) met the two. The issue was brought to the notice of maintenance tribunal (RDO). Both were counselled, which eventually worked well,” said B Shailaja, director, department of disabled and senior citizens. In another case, a retired Singareni employee from Peddapalli sought help to get back his self-acquired property from two sons. “His sons were living in his house, while he was made to stay in a shed. There was verbal and physical abuse too. The FRO visited him, informed the RDO. The RDO conducted an inquiry and has ordered the sons to vacate the house and hand it over to their father,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/elderly-helpline-a-hit-in-state-max-calls-on-covid/articleshow/86739092.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Kolkata||In a decade, CPM’s vote share drops from 20.4% to less than 4% in heart of Bhowanipore||KOLKATA: CPM’s vote share in Bhowanipore has plummeted from 20.4% in 2011 to 3.5% in the 2021 bypoll. In 2011, Mamata Banerjee contested a bypoll from Bhowanipore to be elected to the state legislature after Subrata Bakshi vacated the seat. The byelection was held to elect a CM. CPM’s Nandini Mukherjee, a senior JU academic, who was Banerjee’s opponent from the constituency, had polled 19,422 votes. A decade later, chief minister Banerjee contested another bypoll from Bhowanipore. This time, CPM candidate Srijib Biswas could garner a little more than 4,200 votes. “It was a bypoll to elect a chief minister for the second time (after Nandigram). The nature of the poll was different from others. This time, it turned out to be a binary battle, where the other opposing party (CPM) was projected by a section of the media as a decimated force. Religious polarisation has also gone up,” said Mukherjee. “In 2011, we noticed a sudden increase in polling after 1pm. Trinamool ministers started roaming around in the constituency. I will not be surprised if a similar trend was noticed this time.” The election in multi-lingual and multi-cultural Bhowanipore was not a binary battle even in 2016 assembly elections, when BJP’s Chandra Kumar Bose had garnered 19% vote share. Congress’s Deepa Dasmunshi had bagged 29% vote that year. “Even in 2016, CPM had secured a substantial number of votes in Bhowanipore and had a strong worker base there. Had the Forward Bloc councillor at Ward 77 worked with us, the result might have been different,” said Dasmunshi. According to CPM leader Rabin Deb, byelection was always tilted in favour of the elected party. “This is not an election to change the government. Also, it took some time for our workers to come to terms with the debacle in the assembly polls five months ago. At the same time, they were busy helping people out in the pandemic and natural disasters,” Deb said. “We were not even allowed to campaign on many occasions. We reported it to the EC but to no avail. Moreover, ministers like Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim were allowed to roam around on polling day.” CPM candidate Biswas felt the poll was thrust upon people who were not ready for it. “The extra votes Trinamool won was an erosion from BJP. Our votes stayed nearly the same. At some booths, the opposition won single-digit votes,” he said. In April, when Congress and CPM were in alliance, Congress’s Shadab Khan had 4% vote share. “This was a by-election and the candidate was the chief minister herself. That had an impact,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-a-decade-cpms-vote-share-drops-from-20-4-to-less-than-4-in-heart-of-city/articleshow/86739093.cms||Rohit Khanna

Candidates who appeared in the entrance test said that the difficulty level of JEE(Advanced) was very high as compared to the JEE (Mains) examination. Mathematics was toughest, chemistry was moderately difficult while physics was easiest of the three. “Questions from calculus and four questions asked from probability in the mathematic section were hell tough. I ran short of time trying hard to solve these questions. Maths was the toughest, followed by Chemistry and finally, Physics,” said a candidate Anant Chowdhury. He said in JEE (Mains), which is a qualifier for JEE (Advanced) I could easily score 98 percentile but this time the journey to my dream IIT-Mumbai seems tough. “I only found Chemistry section a balanced one as it had equal questions from class 11 and 12 syllabi. Questions asked from organic chemistry like that from Amines, Biomolecules, Oxygen-containing compounds were moderately difficult,” said candidate Abhinav Garg. Another candidate Suchit Swarup said, “Of the three sections, physics was an easy one. Question from current electricity, optics, rotation and modern physics was not that tough. If a candidate had practiced a lot of mock tests then similar questions asked in the examination would have been definitely practiced by him or her.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jee-advanced-held-many-find-tests-very-tough/articleshow/86740984.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In the rural areas, students of Classes V to XII will return to the schools. According to the authorities, since only a few villages have a few active cases, and most such patients are hospitalised, all schools and junior colleges will open. Shankar Yadav, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation’s school administrator, said, “All the 112 schools and junior colleges with 50,718 students will open on Monday. We have asked the schools to ensure that the teaching and non-teaching staff get at least one jab and those who have not taken any jabs and those who are up for the second doses get them as soon as possible. We have not made it mandatory for the staff to get the jabs as it may become an excuse for the teachers to stay away from work. We have found that 75% of the staff in Kolhapur city are fully vaccinated and 4% are yet to get the first dose. Around 1,200 employees work in 112 schools and junior colleges.” In the rural areas all 2,300 schools will open. The Zilla Parishad has planned for welcome kits for the students. “Each kit will have a sanitiser and a mask. The students will be allowed to attend classes in a staggered manner to ensure social distancing,” said Asha Ubale, the district education officer for primary schools. 50 schools in Solapur district to stay shut Fifty schools in four tehsils of the Solapur districts will remain shut due to the prevalence of Covid cases. The decision has been taken by Solapur Zilla Parishad. Dilip Swami, the CEO of Solapur ZP, said the schools in villages with five or more active cases will stay shut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-city-4-school-staff-yet-to-get-1st-jab/articleshow/86734573.cms||Abhijeet Patil

---||Kochi||Kochi Corporation imposes on-the-spot fines for dropping waste||KOCHI: With cases of illegal waste dumping in city going up significantly, Kochi Corporation authorities have started on-the-spot fines to punish those littering the streets and roadsides. As per the rules, the powers to prosecute those who dump waste rest on the corporation secretary. At the same time, junior health inspectors (JHI) conduct the patrolling to book those dropping litter. Those nabbed for littering are served a notice to appear before the secretary for a hearing before slapping fines. The time-consuming process has affected the effectiveness of the drive against littering and hence the corporation secretary has delegated the powers to slap on-the-spot fines on the culprits to the health inspectors. “The squads have stepped up patrolling. They have already booked several people for littering. For ensuring a clean Kochi, we are taking other measures such as installing CCTV cameras on vulnerable spots,” mayor M Anil Kumar said. The corporation has hired four vehicles for the squad in the city. “We will add four more quads. Two vehicles will be given to the officials patrolling in West Kochi area and two to those in Ernakulam city,” said T K Ashraf, chairman, standing committee for health, Kochi corporation. “In the past two weeks, the squads collected Rs 2 lakh as fine. The offenders face fines of up to Rs 2,000,“ Ashraf said At the same time, it has been alleged that it is the flaws in the waste collection system that is creating the trash pileups on the streets and water bodies. “There are complaints that waste collection is not proper in certain places. If there are only a few houses in a particular area, the workers who collect rubbish would stop going there regularly,” said K S Dileep Kumar, president, Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi. “Similarly, bins must be set up in hotspots. As of now, Kochi is a bin-less city. The idea seems to be that trash would be collected every day and it wouldn’t lie on the streets. But it is not practical in certain places. There should be waste bins in places like bus stations,” Dileep Kumar said. In the past two months, around half a dozen councillors were attacked for questioning waste dumping in Kochi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-imposes-on-the-spot-fines-for-dropping-waste/articleshow/86736687.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Nashik||Nashik: MSRTC to increase buses for school kids||NASHIK: The Nashik division of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) is expected to add more buses to its fleet, depending on the need for transportation of children to schools. MSRTC generally runs buses for night halt in the interior villages so that they can start early the next morning with students onboard from the villages to the schools. However, since schools have been closed, most such buses were also cancelled by the MSRTC. Now, with classes for Std V-VII also starting from October 4 and classes for Std VIII-XII already functioning, the MSRTC has received a few enquiries for bus services to which they are catering positively. “There are some enquiries at our depots in various talukas, especially from the villages located in remote areas, in tribal talukas. We are considering running the services for the students,” said Kailas Patil, divisional transport officer for MSRTC, Nashik division. The officer said that ever since classes for Std 8-12 started functioning physically, the MSRTC had received requests to start buses from the villages to schools. However, it was felt that some children would travel by personal vehicles, hence MSRTC buses did not receive much response. Even so, the MSRTC added about 15 buses to its fleet since schools started across district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/msrtc-to-increase-buses-for-school-kids/articleshow/86734589.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Opposition's minority appeasement a plot to trigger riots: UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh||LUCKNOW: UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh on Sunday said, Opposition’s concerted minority appeasement was nothing but a “well-planned conspiracy to trigger communal riots”, ahead of assembly elections next year. Singh specifically trained his guns at Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is scheduled to visit Varanasi, PM Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency, on October 10. “The state has not witnessed a single communal riot in over four years of BJP rule. Priyanka Gandhi kya danga karwana chahti hain? Unhein tushtikaran ki rajneeti band karni hogi (Priyanka should stop politics of appeasement),” he said, while speaking to TOI. He said, under BJP rule both Hindu and Muslims have been living in harmony and will continue to do so. The UP BJP president maintained politics of appeasement and compromising on national interests can only push the nation off the development grid. The Congress leadership has been calling the nationalist outfit like RSS as an organisation of ‘Hindu aatankwadi (terrorists),” he said. A strong critic of Congress, Singh had earlier, slammed the Congress leadership for deliberately framing Article 370 to appease minorities in Jammu and Kashmir. Singh’s attack came on a day when BJP faced an electoral setback in Bhabanipur bypolls in West Bengal, where CM Mamata Banerjee defeated BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal by a huge margin. The ruling party also found itself in a spot over a raging farmers’ agitation in Lakhimpur Kheri against new farm laws. At the same time, BJP took to twitter, saying the opposition was bound to find itself in political wilderness in the forthcoming 2022 UP assembly elections given its “past experiences” of unsuccessful alliances which were formed to stop the saffron party’s juggernaut. In an apparent reference to the coming together of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in 2017 assembly elections, BJP said the two ‘yuva netas do not even talk to each other these days”. Likewise, in 2019, ‘Babua’ (Akhilesh) and Bua (Mayawati) had joined hands, but now they share a bitter relationship. BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said, the Opposition was worried about its electoral fate in 2022 state polls. “They are unable to understand how to ensure BJP’s defeat. The entire opposition will be restricted to under 50 seats and BJP will register a win on 350 seats,” he said. BJP’s attack comes amid desertion in BSP camp in favour of the SP with former BSP Rajya Sabha MP and national general secretary, Veer Singh, defecting to SP camp on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oppn-minority-appeasement-plot-to-trigger-riots-says-up-bjp-chief/articleshow/86741009.cms||Pankaj Shah

The three other victims' mortal remains of whom were retrieved are lieutenant commander Yogesh Tiwari of Pratapgarh (Uttar Pradesh), lieutenant commander Anant Kukreti of Uttarakhand and Master Chief Petty Officer (MCPO) II Hariom. The bodies of three Indian navy officers and a sailor were recovered from the site of an avalanche at Mount Trishul on Saturday. A rescue team from Uttarkashi-based Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM), led by colonel Amit Bisht, is searching for the missing fifth naval climber and a porter. The team is being assisted by a ground team of the Indian army, state disaster response force and helicopters from the Indian air force. A 20-member team of mountaineers of the Navy came under an avalanche on October 1 morning less than 500 meters from the summit of Mt Trishul. The team had embarked on an expedition on September 3 from their naval base in Mumbai. On September 14, the team began trekking from Sutol in Chamoli, the closest point with a road to the base camp of Mt Trishul. According to the navy, officer Rajnikant Yadav was a member of Indian navy Everest expedition in 2017. He is credited with climbing the highest peak in India Mt Kamet (7756m) along with Mt Abi Gamin (7550m), Mt Kun (7077m) and Mt Stok Kangri (6023m). He also holds the Limca book of world record for covering maximum 11 mountain passes by cycling non-stop 900kms in 90 hours. He also holds the Limca book of national record for longest non-stop cycling 19450 km in 94 hours. Further, he was a qualified athlete in the world’s toughest cycling race across America and held second rank in Indian Ultra-cycling circuit in 2016. He had participated in several ultra-marathons. In a tweet, defence minister and Member of Parliament from Lucknow Rajnath Singh wrote, “Deeply anguished by the tragic death of four Navy personnel who were part of the Indian Navy mountaineering expedition to Mt. Trishul. The nation has not only lost precious young lives but also courageous soldiers in this tragedy. My heart goes out to the bereaved families of Lt Cdr Rajnikant Yadav, Lt Cdr Yogesh Tiwari, Lt Cdr Anant Kukreti and Hari Om MCPO II. My thoughts are with their families in this hour of tragedy. Praying for early locating of the remaining team members.” The expedition was being conducted as part of Swarnim Vijay Varsh celebrations, which marked 50 years of the Bangladesh Liberation War. “The expedition was being led by commander Vishnu Prasad and had 19 other members drawn from various units of the Indian Navy,” a defence statement said. Meanwhile, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has expressed condolences on the death of lieutenant commander Yogesh Tiwari who hails from Pratapgarh. The UP government has announced Rs 50 lakh ex-gratia for the family of the deceased officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-lad-among-four-naval-mountaineers-who-died-in-ukhand-avalanche/articleshow/86741001.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Request for qualification (RFQ) will now be accepted till October 21. The last date to submit the RFQ was September 29, an extension from the earlier deadline of September 14. This is the second time the corporation has floated the tender to set up the state-of-the-art solid waste management plant. A senior officer said the deadline has been extended following several queries from bidders at the pre-bid meet which the corporation is in the process of answering. Six bidders have shown interest in setting up the plant. In August, all the three bidders were disqualified as none were found eligible. Thereafter, the tendering process began afresh. The plant, estimated to cost Rs 200 crore, is expected to cater to the entire Tiswadi taluka. It will have facilities for recycling and sorting lines, segregation, bio-methanation and composting systems. In 2008, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) acquired the land at Bainguinim to set up the waste management plant, and in 2017, the land was handed over to the GWMC. A public hearing was held by the GWMC and the environment clearance was also obtained. At the time, the corporation had also invited RFQs for the proposed plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-extends-time-limit-for-bainguinim-plant-bid-again/articleshow/86739158.cms||---

Chairman of Child Welfare Committee Chandrashekhar Budhbhatti lodged a complaint after a video of Rajul Bhogayata ill-treating her 10-year-old stepdaughter went viral. According to police, Bhogayata had inflicted injuries with a heated iron pan on the girl’s legs. The girl’s grandmother had recorded the video of the ill-treatment and circulated it among her relatives to shame Bhogayata. The video was further circulated by one of the relatives. When Budhbhatti too came across the video, he asked an official to conduct an investigation. During the preliminary investigation, it came to light that the girl had eaten some savouries for which she was punished. Later, the woman tried to strangulate her and also threatened to kill her. In the past too, the girl was beaten up by her stepmother and was not given food. The girl’s grandmother was going to approach the police, but later Bhogayata promised that she would not harm the girl and a settlement was reached. However, by then the video had become viral and the Child Welfare Committee had started its probe. Based on Budhbhatti’s complaint, Bhogayata was booked for assault, criminal intimidation and violation of Juvenile Justice Act at Jamkhambhaliya police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/woman-faces-action-for-branding-stepdaughter/articleshow/86736747.cms||---

---||Lucknow||BJP to prop up Baby Rani Mauryato counter BSP, win over Dalits||Lucknow: Former Uttarakhand Governor Baby Rani Maurya, who was recently appointed the national vice-president of the BJP, has been assigned a task that is likely to ruffle BSP’s feathers. Amid speculations that Maurya could be propped up by the BJP to counter the influence of BSP chief Mayawati influence among Dalits, the party thinktank has chalked out a detailed tour programme to woo Dalit voters. According to party insiders, if the outreach campaign bears desired results, Maurya is sure to emerge as another Dalit woman leader after Mayawati. As per the programme details, Maurya would travel the length and breadth of the state with the onset of Navratri. “The campaign will continue till October-end. However, it is likely to continue in November,” former MP and BJP general secretary Priyanka Rawat, who is coordinating the campaign, told TOI. She said bigger welcome programmes could also be organised in the main districts of party’s six organisation regions – Lucknow (Awadh region), Varanasi (Kashi region), Gorakhpur (Gorakhpur region), Kanpur (Kanpur-Bundelkhand region) and Meerut and Saharanpur (West UP). She however, refused to divulge any further details and said Maurya’s itinerary would be ready in a day or two. However, party insiders said Maurya’s welcome programme would be organised in almost all the districts of the state with the beginning of Navratri. The welcome programmes are being designed in such a way that a buzz is created in the entire state. She will also stay in districts which are crucial in terms of elections. During the programmes, she is likely to be welcomed by the prominent BJP leaders of the districts concerned. “Progammes are being chalked out for the former Governor in an attempt to woo Dalits, especially Jatavs, who were the core vote base of BSP until 2019 Lok Sabha elections,” secretary of BJP’s SC Morcha, Rahul Kumar, said. Maurya’s sudden move to quit as the Uttarakhand Governor on September 8 had triggered a buzz that continued till Sunday when she held a press conference to announce that she decided to resign as it was her desire to get back to active politics. Maurya said she would shoulder any responsibility that the party would assign to her. Her resignation had sparked rumours which were finally laid to be rest by BJP chief JP Nadda who appointed her the national vice-president of the party. Before her stint as Uttarakhand Governor (2018-21), Maurya served as Agra mayor between 1995 and 2000. In 2007, she had also unsuccessfully contested from Etmaadpur assembly constituency on BJP ticket. She was defeated by BSP’s Narayan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-to-prop-up-baby-rani-mauryato-counter-bsp-win-over-dalits/articleshow/86741017.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

The accused Dinesh Joshi, who is a director of a school in Lodhika taluka, had called two girls in a room and forcibly hugged and touched them inappropriately a few days ago. He had called the girls to teach them some spellings. One of the girls told her parents about it and said that in the past too, Joshi had hugged other girls while they would be writing on the school’s notice board. The parents then informed other parents of the school about Joshi’s conduct. On Saturday, since the school was closed, around 100 parents reached Lodhika police station to register a complaint against Joshi. Meanwhile, Joshi’s wife Seema Joshi, who is the president of Mahila Morcha of BJP’s Rajkot district unit, learnt about the gathering of parents against her husband at the police station. Seema reached the police station along with BK Satya, former president of BJP’s Rajkot district unit. On reaching the police station, the duo tried talking to parents which made them even more furious. A huge ruckus ensued outside the police station over the duo’s intervention. Police had to finally calm the situation. Later, based on the complaint of the mother of one of the girls, Joshi was booked for molestation, criminal intimidation and under Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act too as the girl is a dalit. Police are yet to arrest the accused.

---||Lucknow||Houses of 50% dengue patients in Lucknow found to be mosquito breeding ground||LUCKNOW: Civic authorities are in the dock for their failure to check the spread of dengue in the city but it has been found that the common man is equally responsible for the menace. Out of the total patients who contracted dengue in the city in the last 30 days, the houses of at least 50% of them served as the breeding ground for the female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti – carrier of dengue virus – lays eggs in freshwater and even a small puddle can become its breeding ground. A health department survey has found Aedes aegypti larvae in the houses of 172 patients out of 347 reported from September 2 to October 2. “Our teams found that larvae were thriving in a number of places inside residential premises including rooftop, flower pots, gardens, containers, abandoned objects, drums, old tyres and desert coolers, among others,” said Dr KP Tripathi, the in charge of vector-borne disease unit. The localities where the houses of patients were located included Vipul Khand, Vivek Khand, Vijay Khand, Eldeco Colony, Indiranagar, Telibagh, Shardanagar, Salenagar, Alambagh, Nakkhas, LDA colony, Kanpur road, Turiya Ganj, Mahanagar and Rajajipuram. “Aedes mosquito’s egg hatch into larvae in less than a day and attains adulthood within a week. The breeding cycle is 10-12 days. People should regularly clean water sites in their houses. If it is not possible to drain out water, a little kerosene can be poured to kill larvae,” he said. TIMES VIEW Civic agencies as well as people need to be extra vigilant and check mosquito breeding grounds on an urgent basis. Civic authorities should not only carry out extensive anti-mosquito activities like fogging and anti-larvae spraying, but also make people aware that they should check accumulation of water in and around their houses and vicinity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/houses-of-50-dengue-patients-foundto-be-mosquito-breeding-ground/articleshow/86741030.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The state added 2,692 cases and 41 deaths, while Mumbai reported 570 cases and three deaths. Mumbai’s Sunday count was the highest since July 14 (619). With this, the total cases in the state rose to 65.59 lakh and the death toll touched 1,39,207. Mumbai’s tally rose to 7.44 lakh and the death toll reached 16,125. In Mumbai, three deaths on Sunday were among senior citizens. The BMC said all three had comorbidities. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said that the city was registering 30-50 admissions daily. “Around 10% of our positive cases are getting hospitalised. Given that Mumbai has 19,186 Covid beds, we are in a comfortable position,” he said. He said the death rate was under 1% and those succumbing to the virus are mainly people with comorbidities. Doctors say that although a majority of senior citizens are covered with at least one dose, the immune response to the vaccine in some may not be optimal due to pre-existing health conditions and age. As of Sunday, a little under 2,000 beds were occupied in the city. Critical cases were under 300. One of the deans said their focus has now shifted to non-Covid care completely as the load of Covid cases was being borne by the jumbo centres.

As a result rabies control and stray dog management will be handled by the Goa government from April 2023. “We are extending the collaboration with Mission Rabies for another year and a half, after which the department will continue the work of maintaining Goa as a rabies-controlled area. During this period, Mission Rabies will simultaneously train the department officials to carry out the surveillance and vaccination of dogs in Goa,” an official from the directorate of animal husbandry and veterinary services (AHVS) said. Currently dog catchers and volunteers involved in the project are from the Mission Rabies team. The team will soon submit plans and model for maintenance of the project to the AHVS department for the training programme. “The training will begin this year itself,” said Mission Rabies education director, Murugan Appupillai. “The Goa government will nominate some people to take up various tasks required by the project, following which, we will train those people. There will be representatives in both districts – north and south Goa who will be monitoring the programme in addition to the nodal officer for Mission Rabies. A team of veterinary doctors are going to be managing the tasks,” he said. From the time the MoU was signed between Mission Rabies and the state government in 2015, the team was allotted Rs3.48 crore (utilised till August 2020) towards rabies control in Goa. Till date, 5.4 lakh rabies vaccinations have been administered to dogs and nearly 10 lakh students and citizens have been educated with awareness campaigns on dog bite prevention and management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-set-to-take-over-rabies-vaccine-management-from-april-2023/articleshow/86739251.cms||Nida Sayed

Meenakshi told reporters on Sunday that the policemen accused of murdering her husband, continue to evade police arrest and therefore her and her family members’ lives are in danger. She further said that police killed her husband without any reason, hence there is a strong reason for them to kill her and her family members. She said, “It’s been more than 60 hours since the FIR was registered, but the accused policemen are still absconding.” The whole family is fearing threat due to inaction against the policemen, she said. “They killed Manish without any reason, and now they have reason to kill me and my family members. I have filed an FIR against them. I am fighting for justice,” she added. “We feel threatened. The accused policemen should be nabbed as soon as possible,” demanded a member of Meenakshi’s family. Manish had died after being allegedly assaulted by police at the Krishna Palace hotel in Ramgarhtal area of Gorakhpur late in the evening on September 27.

---||Chandigarh||Constitute cell of progressive farmers in state, Khattar tells partymen||Chandigarh: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday urged his party colleagues in BJP to constitute a cell of progressive farmers in the state. He said such farmers should be honoured and encouraged to act as trainers for at least five other farmers every year for which they would be paid too. The CM was addressing a meeting of the state executive body of BJP Kisan Morcha and farmers here. Agriculture minister J P Dalal, state president of BJP Kisan Morcha Sukhwinder Mandi were also present in the meeting. Khattar said a list of progressive farmers, whose per acre income was high, should be prepared at the district-level. In addition, such farmers who could become a source of inspiration for others should be included in the cell. In view of the monsoon season, the central government had decided to start the procurement of paddy from October 11, however, considering the farmers’ demand, the state government had started the paddy procurement with immediate effect, he added. His government during its seven-year tenure had always taken decisions in the interest of farmers and implemented ambitious schemes, Khattar claimed. When ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ scheme was implemented, there was resistance to it, but today farmers were joining in and taking advantage of it, he said. “The government has constituted 600 FPOs to double the farmers’ income and 78,000 farmers have joined them. There are plans to create 1,500 more such FPOs in the future which will benefit lakhs of farmers,” the CM added. By joining an FPO, farmers could start cold storage, mushroom production, bee keeping and more. They could even run their own small mandi together, he pointed out. He said farmers could also start online trading of their crops. The Haryana government has formulated many unique schemes which had been followed by the Centre and other states, like online transfer policy and appointments on merit basis, he claimed. He said sports teams from other states were conducting surveys regarding the medals won by the players of Haryana. Procurement started As per the instructions of the Haryana government, procurement of paddy has started in the state. According to the schedule, all the farmers are urged to bring their crop to the grain markets only after drying, cleaning and reducing the moisture content so that they can get a good price for the crop, the government has urged farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/constitute-cell-of-progressive-farmers-in-state-khattar-tells-partymen/articleshow/86741060.cms||---

So, they will spend Rs 21 lakh now to get feedback about quality of cleanliness in its lavatories, while nobody mentions anything about their quality of education! VNSGU syndicate has, however, applied breaks on the ambitious project and has put it on hold. “As part of Swachhata Abhiyan we are trying to monitor the quality of cleanliness in the lavatories of the university campus. However, it is not accepted by the syndicate yet,” said K N Chavda, vice-chancellor, VNSGU. Varsity has planned to install feedback devices in 320 lavatories on university departments, convention hall and administrative offices. For the device, it was to incur Rs 11 lakh cost and another Rs 10 lakh estimated for its internet connectivity. In the feedback mechanism, a response given by any user will be stored automatically in the university server and officials can keep watch on the hygiene. Those who are involved in cleaning of the lavatories will also have to insert details of cleaning done. Ironically, the seat of learning is yet to develop any internet-based transparent system in which students’ feedbacks are taken about the quality of education. “There is no transparent mechanism to check the quality of education in VNSGU. In the past, the proposal was rejected by the finance committee but it was again proposed to the syndicate,” said Bhavesh Rabari, former syndicate member. He added that teachers are being kept busy in administrative work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vnsgu-to-spend-rs-21-lakh-to-assess-lavatories-cleanliness/articleshow/86736886.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Leading the team is an old man, whose wrinkled hands are deftly working on his creations in a fascinating way. The amazing thing about the city’s oldest Ramleela is the fact that it hinges on this team, led by a Muslim man, Nisar Ahmad, who has been preparing effigies for the Patharchatti Ramleela Committee since 2002 and is also responsible for their yearly maintenance. Nisar, found working on the effigies of Lord Hanuman and demon queen Tadaka on Sunday, told TOI, “This art of effigy-making is my ancestral work, which, in fact, is an extraordinary example of communal harmony and brotherhood in the Sangam city.” “I have been making and maintaining effigies of all the prominent characters of Ramleela for the last 20 years,” he added. We are a dedicated team of 40-50 people, including carpenters and electricians, who work tirelessly to make Ramleela a grand show, said Nisar. “We get huge inner satisfaction from working on these Ramleela effigies as this gives a message of humanity and communal harmony” he added. From a life-size effigy of Lord Hanuman to beautifully decked chariots and traditional weapons, the 63-year-old and his team are an integral part of one of the oldest Ramlila celebrations in Prayagraj. Nasir, a resident of Chowk, has one assistant Ravi Kumar who has been working with him for the last many years. “I worked as a painter with 4th Battalion PAC, Dhoomanganj, for about two decades and then one day decided to dedicate my life to Ramleela,” says Nisar. Interestingly, Nisar also prepares Tazias for Muharram. “We start working on effigies about a month before the beginning of Ramleela and have a busy schedule till the last episode,” he said. “The entire month becomes very hectic for all our workers, but we get inner joy and peace by doing our work sincerely and gracefully,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/lko-muslim-artisan-who-works-on-ramlila-effigies/articleshow/86736851.cms||---

---||India||Drug co allowed cost of docs’ France meet as tax deduction||MUMBAI: The ‘nexus’ between pharma companies and doctors is often the subject of tax litigation. Evolutis India, a Mumbai-based private company, had filed an appeal with the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) as a sum of Rs 12.79 lakh, incurred by it during the financial year 2014-15, had been disallowed by the income-tax officer. These expenses were largely towards a workshop held by it in France and included the travel and hotel expenses of the doctors who attended. The Mumbai ITAT bench, which recently heard this matter, held that the Income-tax (I-T) officer was not justified in disallowing this expense. It was incurred by the pharma company, a distributor of ortho implants, “wholly and exclusively in the normal course of its business” and should be allowed as a business deduction. The fallout of any disallowance of expenditure is that the taxable income goes up, resulting in a higher tax outgo. Or, if the company is loss-making, it reduces the loss that can be carried forward to the subsequent eight years. Any loss that is carried forward reduces the tax liability of the future years. The I-T officer relied on a circular issued in 2012 by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) which states that any expenses incurred by a pharma company in providing “freebies” to doctors in violation of the regulations issued by the Medical Council of India (MCI) will be disallowed in the hands of the company. The ITAT bench was of the opinion that the travel, hotel and honorarium fees paid to doctors for participation in the overseas workshop could not be dubbed as a gift or freebies and brought within the scope of the CBDT circular. The crux of the order, which will have a far-reaching impact in similar cases, is that the ITAT bench said it is the medical doctors registered with the MCI who are bound by its code of conduct. The CBDT is divested of its powers to enlarge the scope of the MCI regulation by extending the same to pharmaceutical companies without any enabling provision either under the Income Tax Act or the Indian Medical Regulations. If it does so, it impinges on the conduct of the pharma companies in carrying out their business. In arriving at its decision, the ITAT also relied on decisions passed by various high courts. In an earlier case, of Liva Healthcare, reported by TOI on September 20, 2016, the Mumbai ITAT had held that the objective of overseas sponsored trips for the doctors and their spouses was to recommend its pharmaceutical products. It had disallowed such expenses in the hands of the company. The ITAT bench in its order dated September 23, commented that the tax tribunal in the earlier decision had incorporated the MCI regulations but had not elaborated or dwelt upon the issue as to how this MCI regulation, which was strictly meant for medical practitioners and doctors, could apply to pharma companies and others in the health sector industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/drug-co-allowed-cost-of-docs-france-meet-as-tax-deduction/articleshow/86742637.cms||Lubna Kably

---||Nashik||Nashik Municipal Corporation to start tarring roads to fix potholes||NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started tarring roads to repair potholes and stretches that were damaged due to the heavy rain across the city. The NMC has set a one-month deadline — up to October-end — to repair the potholes. Earlier, during the rain, the Public Works Department (PWD) of the NMC had used murum and construction waste to fill up the potholes. The potholes, however, resurfaced during the recent heavy rain, causing inconvenience to the citizens. Social activists and citizens had expressed their disappointment over the poor condition of the roads. They had urged the civic administration to repair potholes using tar instead. Shivkumar Vanjari, NMC’s city engineer, said it is difficult to undertake tarring work during the rain. “Hence, we temporarily filled up the potholes and will carry our reconstruction after the monsoon ends,” said Vanjari. “The rain has stopped for the past two days and we have started filling potholes using tar. We have set a deadline of October-end, to fill the potholes and repair damaged stretches of the roads,” said Vanjari. “We have earmarked adequate funds to repair potholes and finalized contractors through a tender process for all six divisions of the civic body. We were waiting for the monsoon to end,” he added. NMC officials said that the lability period is of three years after the construction of roads. Hence, it is the responsibility of the contractors to repair and maintain the roads during the liability period. The civic body will repair the roads once the liability ends. “The condition of the roads had deteriorated in various parts of the city due to the rain. We want the NMC administration to speed up the work and improve roads,” said Amol Patil, a resident of Nashik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-start-tarring-roads-to-fix-potholes/articleshow/86734665.cms||Tushar Pawar

He can’t wait to hear the sound of the school bell — something he hasn’t in the last 18 months. Like a date from his history book, he reels out the last time he attended school physically — March 12, 2020. “I can’t wait to meet my classmates,” says the teenager. “Online learning has gotten to me and I’m glad my parents understood the need to attend physical school.”  As educational institutes from classes 8-12 in urban areas and classes 5-12 in rural areas across the state reopen after the March 2020 lockdown, students, parents, teachers, schools and junior colleges will step into ‘trial and error’ learning against the backdrop of the pandemic. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will address teachers and students on Monday. Thackeray wants schools to ensure that SOPs are followed so that schools do not have to shut down again, said a state official. At Maratha High School, Worli, parents of students were shown around the premises on Sunday. “They were happy with our Covid preparedness,” said principal Hanuman Padmukh. “But the real test is on Monday when children return to school.”s Over 2,500 schools and junior colleges in Mumbai, having 5.13 lakh higher secondary students, are permitted to reopen from Monday. While over 750 civic schools and an equal number of aided schools are likely to open, many private unaided schools may take a week or two to commence physical classes. Educationists said they expect over 50% of schools to begin. State education officers have been directed to visit schools and upload photographs of “happy” children on social media platforms. Schools have put up posters welcoming children, balloons, flower decorations, rangolis and music will greet students back to classrooms. “The next few days will determine the success of offline education in the pandemic. Patience is the key for parents. Just allow students to step into schools,” said Ulhas Wadodkar, principal of Suvidyalaya High School, Borivli (west).  Teachers, who have also stayed away from in-person interaction with students are anxious and excited to get back after months. “I cannot wait to see my students in class. Once in school, we will be shouldering a major responsibility,” said Meenal Bhole, teacher at Vidya Bhavan High School and Junior College, Ghatkopar (east). The only worry schools have is children returning from their native towns and attending physical classes immediately. “We have asked students to quarantine themselves after returning from their villages before coming to school,” said Bhole.  Students like Pooja Gotecha, who has not seen a physical college, is nervous. “But I want to see what it feels like being in a college,” said Pooja, a class 12 commerce student of Raheja College. Pooja, a Mira Road resident, will take the bus to college. Her elder sister will accompany her on day one.  Deepali Darade, an ex-student and teacher at Shivaji Vidyalaya, Kalachowki, said that such is the excitement to have children back to school that her batch of 1996 contributed medical equipment to monitor students. Sanjay Upadhay, a parent, said he was waiting for schools to reopen. “We have to learn to exist with Covid. Children are the worst hit and I did not want my child to miss physical school,” said Upadhay, whose daughter studies in the Narayana E-Techno school, Andheri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-classroom-chatter-to-come-alive-again-as-schools-reopen-today/articleshow/86739289.cms||Sandhya Nair

The Yidan prize is an inclusive education award that recognizes individuals, or up to three-member teams, who have contributed significantly to education research and development. Banerji’s Pratham which has been working to improve learning levels in schools now aims to wipe out the problem of students being in school but not learning. The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) assessment approach by Banerji and her team in India, has revealed literacy and numeracy gaps among children who had already spent several years at school.  To close these gaps, her team’s ‘Teaching at the Right Level’ programme works with schools and local communities to provide basic reading and arithmetic skills, ensuring no child is left behind. This systematic, replicable model reaches millions of children annually across the country and is spreading around the globe. “Why do we find children in grade 4 still struggling to read? It lowers the productivity of the entire schooling system. What can be done to set kids firmly on the path early on? It’s not a new idea but with the Yidan Prize, we will shift to thinking about early years. Our New Education Policy too places importance of the continuum of the foundational stage,” Banerji told TOI. "We want to focus on early childhood and the early years of primary school and add a strong component that is family based and community based to it,” said Banerji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pratham-ceo-wins-yidan-prize-for-edu-research/articleshow/86739254.cms||Hemali Chhapia

But when Maharashtra finally received around 2 crore doses in September, many districts failed to exhaust them at the desired speed. On September 27, districts were in possession of nearly 38 lakh doses collectively. Contrary to its claims, the state managed over 10 lakh vaccinations only on seven days through September. It hit 15 lakh vaccinations only once in the entire month. In fact, the average daily vaccinations remained around 7.55 lakh doses, which is half the capacity claimed by the state. However, despite this, more than 2.5 crore people in Maharashtra are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said on Sunday. The state has an adult population of 9.14 crore, of which 27% has been covered with both doses. The state has covered 5.86 crore people (61%) with at least one shot. As on Sunday, Maharashtra has administered 8.36 crore doses, the second highest in the country after UP. Calling it a landmark for Maharashtra, Dr Vyas said there was optimism that nearly all willing to get vaccinated could be covered with a single shot by the end of the year. Hesitancy could be the only hurdle at this stage. “Generally, in such public health campaigns, last mile is the toughest and some pockets of vaccine hesitancy are likely to be there,” he told TOI. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has managed one of the highest vaccinations in the country and with the vaccine supplies improving, districts have been asked to scale up infrastructure. “We have vaccinated over 61% of the population with at least a single dose. Once we reach 70%-75% coverage, a herd immunity stage can be achieved which will lead to drop in transmission rate,” said Tope. Several district officials told TOI that the supply has streamlined only in the past one month and some of them planned to scale up now. “Prior to September, we dealt with more shortages than surplus supplies,” said a district official in Nanded. Dr Shivaji Pawar, district health official of Hingoli that has vaccinated the second lowest in the state, said they have 150 centres, which is adequate for a population of 15 lakh. The district had asked for one lakh doses to hold a special drive. They, however, took eight days to exhaust it, despite a whopping 59% of the population awaiting their first shot. A Solapur official said that they will not be adding centres, since the drive is now being taken to individual villages through ANMs, volunteers from political parties. A senior state official cited Mumbai’s example that has steadily expanded the number of vaccination centres while admitting that many districts haven’t managed to increase. “Districts keep on demanding additional manpower, although we have made it clear that the existing staff must be used more efficiently,” the official said. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said that a shorter turnaround time was as crucial as receiving vaccine stocks. He said that Mumbai manages to exhaust vaccine supplies of lakhs in 2-3 days. The state has been opening between 6,000-6,500 sessions daily. N Ramaswami, commissioner, National Health Mission, had told TOI recently that the state was trying to push the sessions to 10,000 daily by getting districts to either start more centres or add more sessions to existing centres. Anand Bang, joint director of NGO SEARCH in Gadchiroli, said that vaccination must be finished in a mission mode. “Now that we have doses, the state mustn’t wait for people to come to centres. Instead, take it to them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-pulled-off-its-vax-target-of-10l/day-only-7-times-in-sept/articleshow/86739346.cms||Sumitra Debroy

A notice to this effect has been published by the DCB. As per the notice, due to the spread of Covid-19 infection, this year, there would be no mela (fair) near the temple. Therefore, the shopkeepers and vendors have been instructed to not set up any shop near the temple during the Navratra. If such shops are found operating around the temple, strict legal action would be taken against the people involved, the notice warned. The Renuka temple in Bhagur sees thousands of devotees coming for darshan during the Navratra. The police usually have to divert vehicular traffic during the huge mela every year. However, like this year, last year too, there was no mela due to the pandemic. Officials said the number of Covid cases in the region is near nil and people’s indiscipline during such events should not lead to the spread of the Covid infection. That is why the popular annual mela has been banned this year too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ban-on-temporary-shops-near-renuka-temple-during-navratra/articleshow/86734728.cms||---

Last week, just one video call through Zoom with the district collector, while sitting in his village’s gram panchayat office, ended Rathwa’s woes forever. Rathwa has been promised assessment by the district administration and within a few days, he will also receive all official papers at his gram panchayat’s office through email. In a region where people have to climb hillocks to just make a phone call or have to wade through waters of ravines and forests to reach to a nearby motorable road, the new initiative of the district administration has come as a big boon for the people like Rathwa, who live in the villages on the borders of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. The district administration, in the first such initiative of Gujarat, has brought all gram panchayats on the digital map so that citizens do not have to stretch till district or taluka headquarters. “All gram panchayats have laptops and broadband connection, so we have asked them to create their separate email addresses. Whatever issues or problems citizens will have, it will be reported to us through email from gram panchayats and their problems will be resolved accordingly,” said district collector Stuti Charan. All necessary papers and documents will also be sent in the digital format. “We have created a back-end process for this so that maximum work is done without papers for the convenience of people,” said Charan. Once the issues are resolved, the documents or certificates will also be sent to the applicants on WhatsApp or through email at gram panchayat. The monthly ‘Swagat’ program of all districts where collectors hear issues of people directly will also be held through Zoom. “Citizens can either connect through their phone from their homes or from the gram panchayat office,” Charan told TOI. “It is difficult to travel all the way till Chhota Udepur as our village is not properly connected and we also have to spend a lot of money. But this way, our work is done very comfortably,” Rathwa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/tribal-districts-gram-panchayats-get-e-connectivity/articleshow/86737022.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Delhi||60 lakh people now fully vaccinated in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded zero deaths due to Covid-19 and 33 fresh cases with a positivity rate of 0.07% on Sunday. The day also witnessed the number of Delhiites who are now fully vaccinated cross the 60 lakh-mark, or 40% of the total population of the national capital that is eligible to get vaccine doses against Covid-19. The 33 fresh cases recorded on Sunday were from 50,631 tests, including 43,365 RT-PCR tests and 7,266 rapid antigen tests. With 30 patients recovering from Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, the number of active cases stood at 386 on Sunday. The number of patients recuperating in home isolation as on Sunday is 115, and the number of patients admitted in hospitals is 235. Out of the total 11,750 hospital beds reserved for Covid-19 patients, 11,515 are vacant. Out of the total 3,539 Covid ICU beds in Delhi, 3,472 were vacant at 9 pm on Sunday, according to the Delhi government’s online Corona dashboard, including 1,300 vacant ICU beds with ventilators out of a total 1,336. As all government vaccination centres remain closed on Sunday, the number of vaccines administered was only around 18,400 till 10pm. The number, however, was just enough for the total number of beneficiaries who have received the second dose of vaccine in Delhi to reach 60,15,056. With the total adult population of Delhi that is eligible for vaccination being approximately 1.5 crore, more than 40% of these beneficiaries are now fully vaccinated. The total number of vaccine doses administered in Delhi till date is 1,82,21,362, out of which 1,22,06,306 were first doses. This means that 81.4% of the population that is eligible for vaccination has received at least one dose. Out of the total vaccine doses administered, 1,13,31,693 or 62.2% of all doses have been administered to those in the 18-44 years age bracket, followed by 45,51,122 doses to those in the 45-59 years age bracket, which is around 25% of total doses administered. Those aged 60 years or above have received 23,38,547 doses, which is 12.8% of all doses administered till date. Taking total numbers into account, the northwest district has administered the highest number of both first (14,97,398) and second doses (6,92,928) of vaccine among all the revenue districts of the national capital. On the other hand, the northeast district saw the least number of second doses of vaccine being administered — 3,10,005.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/60-lakh-people-now-fully-vaxxed-in-delhi/articleshow/86739375.cms||Sidharatha Roy

She was rushed to a local hospital, where she was declared dead. Police recovered a three-page suicide note containing some religious text. The victim, who enrolled in Vedic Gurukulam in 2015, took ‘sanyas deeksha’ in 2018. Later on, she went on to become a part of Patanjali Yogpeeth as a sadhavi and also took care of routine affairs at the institution. Parvez Ali, official at Bahadrabad police station, told TOI, “A suicide note has been recovered from her room and we informed her parents.

---||Delhi||Covid may cause complications in newborns, expecting moms must get vaccinated: Doctors||NEW DELHI: Covid-19 in newborn babies is rare. Fortunately, it is rarer for small children to develop complications due to the disease. But it can happen. Recently, doctors at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) said they had a late preterm delivery. At 26 hours of life, the newborn developed breathing difficulty, fullness in the stomach and tests showed perforation in the stomach. An emergency surgery was conducted in the next two hours to close the perforation. Tests conducted later confirmed that both the newborn and his mother had high titers of total Covid antibodies — meaning they had been exposed to the infection. “We suspect that the infection caused inflammation of the intestinal tissue and its death. This, in turn, led to perforation in the stomach. If the baby wasn’t operated on in time, he wouldn’t have survived,” said Dr Pankaj Garg, senior consultant, department of neonatology at SGRH. The newborn was operated at 28 hours of life in which, apart from closing the perforation in the stomach, the doctors also created a surgical opening outside the body so that intestinal waste could exit without passing through the colon, which was also affected by the infection, or the rectum. Postoperatively, the baby had a stormy course. He had to be put on mechanical ventilation and aggressive medication was needed to keep up his blood pressure. “After 10 days, the baby recovered a little and was put on minimal feed. It took another nine days for the baby to be fit enough to be discharged,” said Dr Neelam Kler, chairperson, department of neonatology at SGRH, adding that such complications were rare in newborns, but one needed to be watchful. Kelr said, “We had more than 100 deliveries from Covid-positive mothers during the first and the second waves of the pandemic. Only a handful of the newborns tested positive and there were only 5-6 babies who developed complications. We had two Covid-positive newborns who developed encephalopathy (swelling in the brain) due to the infection. There were 2-3 other cases of perforation in the stomach or intestine due to the infection.” The doctor said it was difficult to save newborns who developed such complications. “Covid-19 can also be dangerous for expecting mothers. It can lead to preterm delivery, preeclampsia (a potentially dangerous complication characterised by high blood pressure), pneumonia, multi-organ failure, encephalopathy and a higher need for ICU admission in them,” added Kler. All expecting mothers need to get vaccinated against Covid-19 to protect themselves against the infection and complications associated with it. “If a pregnant mother gets infected despite the precautions, it’s better to get the child delivery done at a tertiary care facility where there are adequate facilities to manage potential complications,” Kler said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-may-cause-complications-in-newborns-expecting-moms-must-get-vaccinated-docs/articleshow/86739421.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Soon, the IFC will hold meetings with various departments to identify projects. The MoU has been signed in pursuance of the cabinet approval and NOC from the Union finance ministry. As per the MOU, the IFC will do the initial screening and scoping of projects in consultation with different departments and entities, and identify projects across a range of sectors that fit within IFC’s strategic developmental priorities in India. Director of the state’s PPP department, S Shanbhogue, said this includes feasibility studies on select projects. The IFC has appointed Deloitte to execute the initial screening study. The service rendered by IFC will be unpaid, done through donor funding. IFC and Deloitte have formulated a structure for the screening study, and this will include an introductory/kickoff meetings with all secretaries and select departments and corporations and meetings with individual secretaries with HoDs/MDs to identify possible projects. Deloitte will then meet individual HODs/MDs for detailed discussions and crystallisation of the projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-signs-mou-with-ifc-to-develop-ppp-projects-in-goa/articleshow/86739396.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Villages use carrot and stick to up vaccination||MUMBAI: Last week the gram panchayat of Ansing village in drought-prone Washim district threatened to discontinue services offered by it to unvaccinated individuals. “Once the news spread, the number of people turning up for vaccination rose significantly. We were earlier getting 60-70 people per day at centres. It went up to 110-120,” said Madhukar Bodke, rural development officer of the village. The village has a population of 15,000 and is one of the largest in the district and so far only 60% of the population has been vaccinated. “We want a Covid-free village by ensuring complete vaccination. We know we cannot deny services to anyone, but we tried it as an experiment and it seems to be working,” said Bodke. Even as a significant population has been vaccinated in the cities, rural areas are still finding it difficult to get people to vaccination centres. The urban-rural gap for vaccination is wide in the state. Washim district has administered at least one dose to 48% of its population while Mumbai has achieved 90% of single dose coverage. In Ghatane village in Solapur, the gram panchayat has taken the responsibility of providing food to the homes of people who report side effects like fever or body ache after vaccination. “We realised that one of the biggest reasons why people were not taking vaccines was due to the fear of missing work due to side effects,” said Ruturaj Deshmukh, sarpanch of the village. He has achieved 75% vaccination so far and is aiming to complete 100% coverage by the end of the month. Many districts organised special village-level camps for a week ahead of Gandhi Jayanti to take the initiative at the village level. In Gadchiroli, where a significant population is tribal, one intervention has been the most effective. In villages where the reluctance is high, a public health official would take the first shot once the vial was opened. “There are barriers of language, cultures, and even physical distance in districts with high rural and tribal populations. Such interventions have been very effective,” said Anand Bang, joint director of NGO SEARCH that is carrying out a vaccination boosting campaign along with Project Mumbai in the district. He said mobile vans going to villages directly have also started getting a good response. In districts like Jalgaon, vaccination has taken a complete political colour in places such as Chalisgaon. A health official said that the political parties are managing halls, have erected tents and even provided computers and operators for registration. “After it became a hit for one party, all of them want to try it. The race has only started now as we started receiving 1.5-2lakh doses a week,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-villages-use-carrot-and-stick-to-up-vaccination/articleshow/86739382.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Chandigarh||After Chandigarh Housing Board, now hospitality department goes paperless||CHANDIGARH: After Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB), UT hospitality department has become the second department to go paperless by implementing e-office completely in the UT guest house, Sector 6 and UT guest house-2, Sector 18 (earlier known as Panchayat Bhawan). Yashpal Garg, secretary, UT hospitality department, said the idea behind the exercise is to achieve simplified, responsive, effective and transparent working in the hospitality department. Hospitality department staff was trained by the National Informatics Centre for the initiative, he said, adding that the move would help with time-bound service delivery. As per the SoP, dak receipts are being centralised at the reception and all such correspondences are being scanned and converted into e-Dak. The reception will forward the e-Dak to the officer concerned through e-office module, he explained. To improve the functioning of the hospitality department, the hospitality secretary recently ordered recovery of pending bills within 15 days, failing which interest was to be levied at 12% per annum. The amount, he said, would be deducted from the salary of officials against whom dues are pending. Officials were also instructed to pursue bills pending from different departments of the UT Administration, Punjab and Haryana governments and other agencies. In case any outstanding amount for the period prior to March 31, 2021 is not cleared within 30 days, the department will not provide further services to the particular department or organisation. All outsourced staff of the UT hospitality department working at other places not under the purview of the department have been removed with immediate effect. The outsourcing agency is to be informed that wages of such persons will not be paid for the period after September 4, 2021. Further, staff on deputation and working in places outside the purview of the department are to be repatriated to their parent departments. CHB modelRecently, UT adviser Dharam Pal asked to follow CHB model, as CHB was first among the government boards, corporations and departments, in the UT to fully implement the e-Office module in all departments. As some of the departments were facing problems with implementation of e-office model, they were asked to follow CHB model with the assistance of National Informatics Centre (NIC). More transparencyA senior CHB official said that the board switched over to e-Office in the first half of the year. Now, almost all files are moving digitally. The official can withdraw e-movement of a file only to the next level and that too with reason, but if the file movement has passed the next level, then the official will have to submit a detailed explanation for the step. The move has resulted in transparency in the daily functioning of CHB, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-chb-now-hospitality-department-goes-paperless/articleshow/86736994.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Dehradun||Residents protest against irregular door-to-door garbage collection in Doon||Dehradun: Residents of several localities in Dehradun have alleged that the door-to-door garbage collection service is being provided only on alternate days in their respective areas even as they are being charged for the full month. The Dehradun Municipal Corporation’s (DMC) sanitation department has roped in a third-party agency for the day-to-day pickup of household garbage but the residents are unhappy with its service. “The door-to-door collection of garbage should take place daily but we are being provided the service only on alternate days. This is the trend across most residential areas in the city,” said IC Chawla, president, residents welfare association, Aashirwad Enclave. Echoing a similar sentiment, another local said, “The garbage collection charge is Rs 50 per month. Either we should pay less as the service isn’t regular or they should ensure that the pick-up happens daily.” The residents opine that irregular garbage collection will lead to a host of other sanitation problems in the city. “The sanitation workers now only collect garbage from outside the houses. This is very inconvenient for the elderly living alone. In addition, if the pickup happens on alternate days, garbage will keep getting accumulated outside for two days. This will attract stray animals and insects which leads to further littering and unhealthy living conditions,” said Mahesh Bhandari, president, Doon residents welfare front. The DMC has, however, maintained that the garbage pick up is regular. “The agency that we work with collects garbage in the city daily but if there is a locality where the service is not regular, the residents should definitely register their grievance with the Nagar Nigam and we will look into it to ensure that there is smooth functioning across the city,” said Kailash Joshi, chief health officer, DMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/residents-protest-against-irregular-door-to-door-garbage-collection-in-doon/articleshow/86737034.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala legislative assembly session to begin today, 43 ordinances pending||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The third session of the 15th Kerala legislative assembly will begin on Monday. The 24-day session is likely to take up 43 ordinances pending before it. However, the business advisory committee (BAC), which will be meeting on October 6, will decide the number of bills that can be taken up for legislation during the session. Seven bills have been listed for discussion in the first two days. The remaining bills will be decided after the BAC meeting on Wednesday. Kerala Public Health Bill, Kerala Medical Practitioners Bill, etc, are some of the major bills pending before the assembly. The session will conclude on November 12. This is the first time that a session exclusively meant for legislation is being convened. The opposition has been alleging that the state is facing an ordinance rule and the government is not sincere in bringing these ordinances before the assembly. However, the session is set to witness intense political debates over various issues. The ruling front members will have added vigour over several Congress leaders joining the Marxist fold, the Congress-led opposition has a series of issues to raise against the government. From day one, the alleged police support to Monson Mavunkal, including that of former state police chief Loknath Behera, is going to be a hot topic of debate. The opposition is likely to seek an impartial inquiry into the alleged fraud and seek the removal of Behera from Kochi Metro. However, UDF will be at the receiving end if the treasury benches come up with KPCC president K Sudhkaran’s links with Mavunkal. Leaders like V M Sudheeran have already demanded a CBI probe into the alleged fraud, and CPM is likely to use it as a weapon against Sudhakaran. The ‘narcotic jihad’ episode will be another issue taken up by the opposition. Congress has been demanding an all-party meeting into it but was turned down by the chief minister. Congress was of the view that it was the chief minister who made the situation worse by not making the government’s stand clear. The Covid situation will also come up for yet another debate in the session. Even though the opposition favours the reopening of educational institutions and giving relaxations in other sectors, the anomalies in the Covid death data will be raised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/assembly-session-to-begin-today-43-ordinances-pending/articleshow/86737103.cms||---

The lactation centre is said to be the first such facility in Karnataka’s northern region. Many women have misgivings about breastfeeding. To allay their fears and eliminate their doubts, A dentist has opened a lactation centre in Hubballi. Breastfeeding is a learned skill, according to Dr Anuja Joshi, a dentist with an advanced certification in lactation. Some mothers have it pretty easy, while others face emotional and physical difficulties. “Most of the time, all they need is someone knowledgeable to guide them through it, and someone to talk to. A lactation consultant is exactly that. Like our good old ‘ajji,’ who the entire family obeyed when it came to childbirth and nursing,” she explained. Breastfeeding is a topic about which many women are hesitant to speak. However, bigger cities are increasingly supporting these fatigued mothers seeking solace. We've never had very good statistics with mothers being able to exclusively breastfeed for the first six months, let alone two years as recommended by the WHO, she said. Every other milk has the same nutritional content as mother's milk, but mother's milk provides an unmatched level of immunity to the child. And because nursing involves more than just nutrition, a dedicated lactation clinic has been established with the sole purpose of providing answers and relief to mothers and their families. It's about time that we get rid of the embarrassment associated with breastfeeding, Dr Joshi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/lactation-centre-in-hubballi-to-support-nursing-mothers/articleshow/86734738.cms||J Abbas Mulla

---||Chandigarh||MC felicitates 5,000 safai mitras in 2 days||Chandigarh: Banwarilal Purohit, governor of punjab and administrator of Chandigarh on Sunday felicitated safai mitras and frontline workers at Tagore Theatre in Sector 18 of Chandigarh at the closing ceremony of Safai Mitra Amrut Samman Samaroh organised by the municipal corporation (MC) Chandigarh. While addressing the safai mitras, Purohit said Mahatma Gandhi gave utmost importance to cleanliness and called upon the citizens to imbibe personal hygiene and ensure cleanliness of the surroundings. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a concrete shape to the vision of the father of the nation and launched Swachh Bharat Mission. The mission has been hugely successful in not only creating physical infrastructure and facilities, but also generating large awareness among the people. Governor said safai mitras and frontline workers have been working tirelessly to keep our neighbourhoods clean, especially during Covid-19 times, he said, while congratulating the MC for Safai Mitra Samman Samaroh, organised to felicitate nearly 5,000 safai mitras in two days. “We must appreciate the initiative of the Union government to launch safai mitra suraksha challenge. It gives not only the much needed encouragement to our safai sewaks, but also recognise their arduous work aimed at ensuring greater public hygiene. When we discuss cleanliness, the role and responsibility of swachhata sainiks comes very first. The modern parameters of swachhata imply the need for an improved understanding of our resources and the ability to manage that demand in an equitable and sustainable way|,” Purohit said. Governor also emphasised garbage segregation and its proper management. He said it is still one of the challenges faced by Chandigarh. “I would like to solicit support and cooperation of every citizen so that we can achieve the task of 100% garbage segregation at source,” he added. City mayor Ravi Kant Sharma thanked the safai mitras for their contributions. He said without their cooperation during the pandemic, the situation could have been worse.

However, all members of the council are yet to be formally sworn in and remain still ‘corporators-elect’, much to the chagrin of the residents, who had hoped to see the administrative impasse end with the elections, and the newly elected representatives hit the ground running. Dr Mayur Manohar More, elected to the council for the first time from Ward 24, admitted to TOI that disgruntlement was rife among his constituents. “They do not hesitate before asking me if the honeymoon period is over. HDMC officials are cooperating with us, for the purposes of formality. Some of them plainly tell us that they cannot heed our orders since we are yet to be sworn in as corporators,” Dr More said. Tippanna Majjagi, a senior leader elected to the council, recalled having had to endure a six-month wait after the elections to be sworn in as corporators. “We had to wait for a year after the elections in 2013. This negligent attitude of the government works to the detriment of urban local bodies. While corporators who have been elected to the council for the second or third time will be able to get some work done owing to their rapport with HDMC officials, first-time corporators will not be able to do so. They have to face the citizens’ ire, while the officials refuse to disclose any information,” he rued. Former mayor Pandurang Patil said that the corporators were sworn in within a week after the election until two decades ago. “The HDMC commissioner would submit a proposal to the deputy commissioner, along with a list of the winning candidates. This, the DC, would, in turn, submit to the Election Commission in Bengaluru, and once the verification process was completed, a gazette notification would be issued. This practice was promptly followed well into the late 1990s. But successive governments since have not paid enough attention to the affairs of the ULBs. This attitude has percolated to all levels of the government machinery, and they now send the list and letter by post, seldom following up. However, when it comes to swearing in legislators and parliamentarians, they start working with manic energy. The government’s ‘e-governance’ initiative is to be mocked at, given the inordinate delay in holding elections to ULBs, and the subsequent delay in holding mayoral polls,” the former mayor said. More, however, is planning to exert pressure on the government to hold the mayoral polls at the earliest. “We will reach out to all the winning candidates, and demand that we be sworn in as corporators without delay,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hdmc-corporators-yet-to-be-sworn-in-face-citizens-wrath/articleshow/86734777.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

If everything goes as per plan, the vaccine will be introduced in the country’s immunisation programme by October 15-20,” Dr N K Arora, chairman of the Centre’s Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), told TOI on Sunday. The three-dose, needle-free ZyCoV-D vaccine, manufactured by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, is the first vaccine in the country that has received emergency use authorization (EUA) for being administered to people aged 12 years and above. The vaccine is based on the plasmid DNA technology and follows a three-dose regimen with a 28-day gap between each dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-zycov-d-vax-rollout-likely-by-mid-october/articleshow/86739452.cms||Umesh Isalkar

FTE has been ranked at 117th position in the NIRF rankings for engineering colleges released by the Government of India (GOI) recently. An expense of Rs 10 crore shown as capital expenditure in the data submitted by the university officials has raised many eyebrows. Those in the know say no such expenditure has been made. The TTF has demanded that the state government should inquire into the matter. “In the document that is available on NIRF’s website, it is claimed that expenditure of an amount of Rs 10.03 crore has been made in the academic years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20,” said TTF president Dr K V R Murthy. “This expenditure should be physically verified, and a thorough enquiry should be made,” TTF has said in its representation before the Gujarat government. Murthy said that the annual capital expenditure shown in the NIRF document published on the website of GOI’s Ministry of Education has been made only on paper. TTF has demanded that FTE’s former dean, professor Arun Pratap, and vice-chancellor, professor Parimal Vyas, must be held responsible if it is found that funds of Rs 10 crore were misappropriated under various heads. Further, TTF blamed the positions of professors lying vacant for the university getting a poor ranking. “Against 52 positions of professors sanctioned by GoG, only ten professors are working at present. As per AICTE norms, a ratio of 1:2:6 should be maintained for professor, associate professors and assistant professors. The norm is not being followed by the MSU,” said Murthy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msus-rs-10cr-expenses-for-nirf-ranking-raise-eyebrows/articleshow/86737114.cms||---

Slamming the arrest of cleric Kaleem Siddiqui by Uttar Pradesh Police on charges of running a “conversion racket”, the protesters claimed that the government was carrying out such operations to harass people of the minority community. One of the speakers at the event, Naeem Qureshi, president of the Muslim Seva Sangathan, told TOI, “The arrest of Kaleem Siddiqui is illegal. Article 25 of the Constitution allows citizens to peacefully promote his/her religion. But Muslims and Dalits are not allowed to exercise their constitutional rights.” He also demanded that cow should be declared a national animal. “Cow’s killing should be banned across the country. But the government is not prohibiting its consumption in states like Goa and some northeastern states where BJP is in power. It is a double standard,” he said. Qureshi said that a ‘Muslim Act’ should be enacted on the lines of ‘SC/ST Act’ and people who use derogatory slurs against Muslims should be booked. Addressing the gathering, ‘Shahar Qazi’ Mohammad Ahmed Qasmi said, “The duty of the government is to protect the rights of each of its citizens. But hate crimes against Muslims and Dalits have increased.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bring-law-on-lines-of-sc/st-act-to-protect-muslims/articleshow/86737077.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Delhi||Avoid barricading in accident-prone areas in Delhi, cops told||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has asked its officers to ensure that barricading is avoided in accident-prone areas, traffic merging points and loops in the city. Police said this is being done to curb traffic snarls reported during checking. Delhi Police, in a recent order, wrote, “Barricading should be avoided at accident-prone areas, intersections, junctions, turns, traffic merging points, near bus stops, flyovers, loops and other such places where chances of traffic snarls are higher even during short checking duration.” The city has identified more than 100 accident-prone zones. An officer said they use barricades to maintain law and order in the city. “We always keep in mind that there is no inconvenience to the public. But there are situations when we have to place barricades to nab criminals or to stop a crime,” a DCP rank officer said. Meanwhile, the zonal officer or traffic inspector of the traffic circle concerned and ATO (anti-terrorist officer) of a police station are directed to check barricade points at regular intervals to ensure there’s no traffic build-up. “The barricades are not unmanned or left abandoned. Inspectors (ATO and traffic circles) should inform the respective control rooms whenever traffic build-up is observed,” the order read. According to police, the placement of barricades by the local police should not be done routinely. “Prior approval of the district DCP in consultation DCP (Traffic) is required. The timing and the exact place of checking should be intimated to PCR command room and hours of checking should be for a reasonable period only,” it read. The district police were directed to ensure that barricades, which were placed by them, don’t cause traffic congestion or unnecessary inconvenience to general public. Another officer said that in some cases, barricades are placed when they receive inputs about movements of criminals in the area. According to the order, the staff was also directed to keep a checking register in which they can enter the details of drivers and the registration number of vehicles that were checked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/avoid-barricading-in-accident-prone-areas-cops-told/articleshow/86739477.cms||Abhay Singh

A local fisherman brought her out but the couple continued to fight and she kept attempting to re-enter the water. Eventually, the police were summoned. Around 10.25pm, a group of fishermen were seated at the jetty when they noticed a couple fighting. “The woman was accompanied by her sister. After a while, as her sister and boyfriend were walking away, the woman suddenly entered the water. The tide was turning and it was very risky for someone who wasnt a regular swimmer there,” said Nicky D’Souza, a fisherman. D’Souza and the woman’s boyfriend brought her out of the water but the couple continued to fight. The reason for the fight seemed to be a phone that the woman held on to. When the police got there, the couple finally left.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-womans-attempt-to-commit-suicide-foiled/articleshow/86739498.cms||---
---||Dehradun||No passes, over 4k pilgrims en route to Kedarnath shrine sent back||Nainital: At least 4,000 pilgrims heading to Kedarnath shrine have been turned away in the last 15 days as they were not carrying the e-passes made mandatory by the Uttarakhand government. Hundreds of other pilgrims going to the other three shrines of the Char Dham were too told to return for the same reasons. After a promise in the high court, the government of the hill state, in its bid to curb the number of pilgrims visiting the four shrines during the ongoing annual pilgrimage, had made the e-passes mandatory. The passes are being issued by Char Dham Devasthanam Board. The data available with the district administration and the police suggested that the tourist footfall at four shrines has touched the sanctioned limit. Last week, the government again moved the court asking it to lift the cap put on the number of pilgrims. Chamoli’s district magistrate (DM) Himanshu Khurana told TOI, “The number of pilgrims has been increasing for the last few days. On Friday and on Saturday, their numbers reached 1,000, the sanctioned limit.” The situation was almost similar in Kedarnath where 790 people visited on Friday and 796 people came on Saturday. Both Gangotri and Yamunotri shrines have also seen a jump in footfall. “We have been checking the documents of pilgrims. A lot of them are without the registration, that’s why they had to be turned away. But we expect the pilgrim numbers to rise if the high court does away with the limit,” said an official. Their business hit, traders and locals are not happy with the restriction. Businessmen in Badrinath protested on Saturday, shutting down their shops. While in Rudraprayag district, traders blocked the Gaurikund highway for nearly two hours, saying the pilgrims are wary of travelling to the shrines due to the restrictions. “The yatra remained discontinued for months. It started on September 18, but even then, there are several restrictions on the pilgrim movement which is hurting our business. We have barely 40 days left in the yatra and most of us have to manage the entire year with these earnings,” said Vinod Navani, head of a shopkeepers’ association in Badrinath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-passes-over-4k-pilgrims-en-route-to-kedarnath-shrine-sent-back/articleshow/86737116.cms||Prashant Jha

The IMD has forecast light to moderate rain for the city from October 4 to October 7, with cloudy conditions to in the afternoon. On Sunday, the Shivajinagar observatory recorded 19mm of rainfall while Lohegaon recorded 0.4mm rainfall. Rural areas of the district also recorded rainfall with thunder activity in the evening, said Met department officials. “At present, there is no system over the state. The low-pressure area has formed over southeast Bihar and adjacent areas. The westerly wind is blowing from the Arabian sea over the state. Because of this, all regions of the state are expected to get rainfall for the next few days,” said a senior official. IMD officials said Madhya Maharashtra, which includes Pune district, is expected to get fairly widespread rainfall for the next few days. The ghat areas of Pune, Satara, and Kolhapur are expected to get isolated heavy rain. “The withdrawal process is expected to begin from the northeast from October 6. The monsoon withdrawal will be delayed over Maharashtra,” the official added. Meanwhile, rain in October is expected to hamper soybean crop, most of which is at the harvesting stage across the district. “The district recorded a bumper sowing of soybean this year as it got decent rates last year.

---||Noida||Twin towers: Two ex-Noida CEOs among 26 named in SIT’s ‘collusion’ report||NOIDA: Two former CEOs of the Noida Authority are among 26 serving and retired officials named by the UP government’s special investigation team (SIT), which looked at instances of collusion between the government body and real estate company Supertech, in its report. The SIT, which submitted the report on Saturday, was formed after the Supreme Court this August ordered the demolition of two 40-storey residential towers, Apex and Ceyane, at Supertech’s Emerald Court project in Noida and prosecution of Noida Authority officials who colluded to facilitate the construction of the two buildings in violation of law. Other than the two CEOs, who headed Noida Authority in the late 2000s and the early 10s, other senior officials named in the report include two additional CEOs and an officer on special duty, according to a top source in the state government. All of them have retired from service. Only four of the 26 names are of serving officials. Two have passed away. The SIT also looked into the role of executives of the Supertech group. It has recommended a three-pronged strategy to take the investigation to a conclusion. An FIR will be registered against all 26 officials of the Noida Authority who abetted wrongdoing. Sources said two private architects who submitted maps of the twin towers to the Noida Authority will also be named in the FIR. The SIT has recommended disciplinary proceedings such as withholding pension of retired employees and directed the Noida Authority to file a complaint against Supertech for violating building bylaws and urban development norms. The four serving officials are all employees of the planning department at various industrial authorities. Planning manager Mukesh Goyal, who was earlier this year shifted to Gorakhpur Industrial Development Authority, has been already placed under suspension – as reported by TOI earlier. The others are an architect in the Noida Authority, two senior planning managers in the Greater Noida industrial Development Authority and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority. The two former officials who have passed away also worked in the planning department of the Noida Authority. They were posted as planning assistants and handled the amended plans of the real estate group in 2006 and 2009. TOI spoke to one of the serving officials named in the report. The official said, “Nobody has approached us for our version. Though nothing has been declared officially, I have been going through media reports. I would still say whatever was done at that time was done according to the provisions. It is a different matter that Noida Authority has been unable to justify its own sanction before court.” Sources said that the SIT has forwarded a copy of its report to the vigilance wing of Uttar Pradesh Police for the FIR to be filed, likely on Monday. Sources said the Council of Architecture will be advised to blacklist the two architects against whom the FIR will be filed. The SIT has, meanwhile, asked the Noida Authority to identify officials who were responsible for converting 7,000 square metres of green belt at Emerald Court for construction of the twin towers. Infrastructure and industrial development commissioner and Noida Authority chairman Sanjiv Mittal, who headed the four-member SIT, said, “I have submitted the findings of the team to the government. Further action will be decided by the government now.” During the course of approvals granted to the Supertech group to revise the original plan for its twin towers, resulting in the project’s height being increased twice to 40 floors eventually, the Noida Authority revised its building regulations twice. When the Emerald Court allotment was originally made in 2004, the Building Rules of 1986 were applicable. In June 2006, and again in November 2010, the Building Rules were revised. The revised plans for the twin towers were cleared in December 2006, November 2009 and March 2012.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/twin-towers-2-ex-noida-ceos-among-26-named-in-sits-collusion-report/articleshow/86741110.cms||Shalabh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Changes in town & country planning law likely to usurp powers of LSGIs’||Kollam: The proposed Kerala Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Bill, 2021, to be presented in the state legislature on Monday, seems to be usurping the powers of the local self government bodies. The reason cited for the amendment being brought to the principal act of 2016 is to avoid delays in preparing master plans and to incorporate measures in spatial planning in the wake of natural calamities. Based on ‘Rebuild Kerala Initiative’, the government decided to revise Kerala Town and Country Planning Act, 2016, citing the need for better urban area planning, to understand and withstand the impact of sudden high-intensity floods and other natural disasters. But an expert has pointed out that some of the provisions in the principal act for dynamic planning system (medium-term plan) are omitted in the amendment bill. “The recommendations to omit such provisions will not lead to better planning but to a rigid and static system instead of a dynamic planning system. These recommendations will take away the right of local self government (LSG) bodies and are against law,” said Jacob Easow, former additional chief town planner. He said that it is against the government’s declared policy of decentralization. “Such omissions will not help in rebuilding Kerala but rather will lead to further deterioration of the state,” he added. Citing an example of stealing powers of LSGs, Easow pointed out that amendment No. 33 of the bill added as ‘priority action plan’ is not a plan (another plan is not possible within a plan) but part of the master plan. Therefore, the ‘priority action plan’ follows the same procedure for its sanctioning as that of the master plan. This will necessitate very cumbersome procedures and has to pass more than five offices via the district town and country planning office, district planning committee, office of the chief town planner and finally the government secretariat, and the government has to sanction the plan. Such recommendations will take away the rights of LSG bodies for fixing their priority in their jurisdictional area. “Undoubtedly, this approach is very static, rigid and regulatory in nature. It will bring bottlenecks in the development process in a five-year democratic system of Kerala,” said Easow. For the purpose of bringing an amendment to the principal act, a workshop was held at Institute of Management in Government on December 28, 2016. But it could not find any section of the principal act against decentralization. A sub-committee constituted to bring out draft proposals for amendments functioned in an unfair manner and added many new suggestions, which undermines the power of district planning committee and the spirit of decentralization, Easow said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/changes-in-town-country-planning-law-likely-to-usurp-powers-of-lsgis/articleshow/86737163.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Biker’s death first murder case for Shahgarh police station in 28 years||Jaisalmer: International biker Asbak Mon’s death was the first murder case for Jaisalmer’s Shahgarh police station (PS) in 28 years. Until Mon’s death, the police station had no records of rape or murder and the area was known for being crime free. In August 2018, the Shahgarh police station was given the case as it is the only building in the abandoned desert region. The entire population of 4,000 people lives at a distance in hamlets. SP Ajay Singh said that the Shahgarh police station was one of a kind and it recorded the first murder case after 1993. It was converted to a PS in 1996. Earlier, it used to be a check post, which was set up in 1954, said the SP. Usually the PS comprising nine employees, including a sub-inspector, records just 2-3 cases of assault or theft per year. The police station building has barracks for males and females, but no criminal has been put in these barracks for a long time. Mon, a native of Kerala’s Kannur who was residing in Bengaluru’s RT Nagar, was initially believed to have died of natural causes. It was suspected that he lost his way in the Jaisalmer desert during a practice run and died of dehydration or thirst. Later SP Ajay Singh saw the autopsy reports and directed to lodge a murder case in December 2020 at the Shahgarh police station. Based on the statements of Subeda TK, the mother of the deceased, the case was lodged against the victim’s wife Sumera Parvez, and his friends Sanjay, Neeraj, Sabik, Vishvas and Santosh under Sections 302, 201 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code. So far, two of Mon’s friends, Sanjay and Vishwas, were arrested from Bengaluru on Monday brought to Jaisalmer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bikers-death-first-murder-case-for-shahgarh-police-station-in-28-years/articleshow/86739465.cms||---

Pravin Maripelly, a former artist from MS University and a yoga enthusiast, converted part of his ancestral house into a library and reading room for the people of his village back in his home state of Telangana. Maripelly, who is currently pursuing another post-graduate degree in fine arts in four-dimension from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, virtually inaugurated the library on Saturday from the USA. “I was thinking about what I can do about the home. That is when I realized that there is no reading habit in the village, so why not turn the remaining structure into a library and reading room,” said Maripelly. The back portion of the house which had collapsed was completely brought down and the front building was renovated. Its interiors were changed to make it suitable for a reading room. Maripelly also drew motivation from American artists Rick Lowe’s Row Houses and Theaster Gates’s The Dorchester social art projects. Maripelly then ordered books of genres and subjects including literature and fiction, history, culture, economics, spirituality, politics, art, biographies among others in Telugu, Hindi and English languages. “There are around 190 books right now and the number will keep on increasing,” he said. In near future, Maripelly also plans to connect the library globally enabling online lectures, workshops and talks by people from across the world on different topics. While Maripelly is abroad, his cousins and a former teacher have volunteered to manage the library.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msu-prof-turns-ancestral-home-into-library/articleshow/86737175.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Dehradun||Villagers sitting on protest against acquiring land for hydropower project in U’khand picked up by police, jailed||Dehradun: Police and district administration teams early on Sunday morning detained 17 villagers of Lohari village in Kalsi tehsil on the outskirts of Dehradun for sitting on protest against the Lakhwar-Kyasi project coming up in their area. The protesters were jailed under section 107, 116 and 151 of the CRPC for causing obstruction in the construction of the hydel plant and for failing to abide by court directions to not conduct protest within 200 metres area of the plant. The villagers have been on protest since June 5 demanding adequate rehabilitation in lieu of their land being taken for the project. The Lakhwar dam is proposed to be the highest dam (206-metre) on the Yamuna river. The project was announced in 1976 but has not been completed yet. The state government is now pushing to complete it as part of the move to finish all the pending hydropower plants. “For this hydel project, our village’s entire 16.5 hectares land is required. We will give this land only when our rehabilitation is done adequately. We were promised land in Resham farm in Vikasnagar in January 2017 but they have turned back on their word now. We want land in lieu of giving away the land,” said Pratima Tomar, gram pradhan, Lohari village. Echoing similar concerns, 58-year-old Dinesh Tomar, another resident of Lohari village, said, “The compensation has been given based on the agreement done in the 1970s. They didn't complete the work on time and now are forcing us to leave our ancestral village.” However, the local administration has maintained that adequate compensation has been given to the villagers. “Their land has been acquired already and they have been given the compensation money as well and yet they are causing obstruction in the construction works. Therefore, they were evicted from the site and sent to jail on the orders of the magistrate,” said Pradeep Bisht, SHO, Vikasnagar. Reacting sharply to the development, Manoj Misra, former IFS officer and founder of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, tweeted, "More invitation to disaster... Why should hills and hillmen suffer due to wasteful Delhi? Building dams in seismic zones is madness." Misra has also filed a petition against the under-construction dam in the high court. This development comes close on the heels of the move by the Chamoli district administration and hydropower company THDC demolishing houses of villagers in Haat village last month for the construction of the Vishnugad-Pipalkoti hydropower project even though the matter is sub-judice. The villagers, whose houses were demolished, have since camped in a temple and are seeking help from the administration for their rehabilitation. To recall, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change had filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court on August 17 stating that the power ministry, the Jal Shakti ministry and the state government have reached a consensus to continue work on seven hydropower projects in Uttarakhand - Tehri II, Tapovan-Vishnugad, Vishnugad- Pipalkoti, Singoli-Bhatwari, Phata-Byung, Madmaheshwar and Kaliganga II. In 2013, after the Kedarnath deluge, the SC had stopped construction work on these projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/villagers-sitting-on-protest-against-acquiring-land-for-hydropower-project-in-ukhand-picked-up-by-police-jailed/articleshow/86737145.cms||Shivani Azad

This was announced by Haryana assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta during the tribute meeting at Aggarwal Bhawan in Sector 16 on Sunday. Gupta also promised martyr’s father K S Arya and mother Usha Devi that a chowk in Panchkula will soon be named after their son. A large number of Panchkula residents also attended the tribute meeting of Major Rajput in Aggarwal Bhawan. Gupta said, “Entire India is thankful to the parents of Major Rajput who had enough courage to send their single child to the Indian Army to serve the nation. The entire nation will always be thankful to the Major Rajput for his services to the nation.” Major Anuj was posted in the artillery and recently promoted to the rank of Major and joined the Aviation Corps, a month-and-a-half ago after he cleared internal examinations. According to his family, Major Rajput was an alumnus of St John’s School Chandigarh. He had survived a helicopter accident about a year ago, when it had got stuck in a high-voltage wire. He was lucky as the power had been switched off at the time due to repair works. Major Rajput and his partner Major Rohit Kumar of Noida west were on a training sortie when their Cheetah helicopter crash landed in Shiv Garh Dhar area near Patnitop tourist resort in Udhampur district. The two pilots were injured in the mishap and were evacuated to a hospital, but could not survive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sec-20-community-centre-named-after-martyr-major-anuj-rajput/articleshow/86739539.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The issue of raising funds for animal welfare is always challenging, which is why we have to reach out to philanthropists, NGOs.” The purpose of the vaccination drive was also to raise awareness of importance of animal welfare, as lives of humans and animals is interlinked, she added. In this regard, the Rotary Club raised funds from its members by organising an online tambola event. Powai-based animal feeder, Madhavi Desai, told TOI: “While big groups and clubs are coming forward to raise awareness about animal welfare, individual animal lovers have to mostly use our own money to feed and take care of animals... Often we face harassment from societies who object to feeding of animals.” Desai said she was recently fined Rs 20,000 by her society for ‘littering’, though she maintains cleanliness while feeding. Activist Sunish Subramanian of PAWS-Mumbai said that due to social networking sites, awareness can be created and funds sourced for animal welfare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-300-strays-get-vax-with-a-bit-of-human-aid/articleshow/86739524.cms||Vijay Singh

Wagholi is one of the 23 villages included within Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits earlier this year. Many people have bought flats in this area of Wagholi thinking that it is a growing residential hub. Residents said that they felt that the civic amenities, including the condition of the road would improve, but there has been no such development. There are more than two feet deep potholes, which makes travelling on this road for senior citizens, patients and pregnant women very dangerous, they added. Anshu Kumar, who launched the petition on Change.org earlier this week, said, “My wife was advised bed rest during her pregnancy in 2018, but venturing out for check- ups to the doctor was nothing less than a nightmare for us, even then. We have been waiting for this road to be fixed for a long time, so I thought of starting a plea online It has received a lot of support from the residents of the area.” Ravi Bhushan, another resident who digitally signed the online petition, said, “Over 10,000 people are living in the township. My wife, who rides her scooter to work, often loses control of the vehicle and falls due to the potholes. She has injured herself twice during the last year due to minor accidents on this stretch. There are no street lights on this patch during the night, making it even more dangerous.” Unexpected repairs to vehicles are also a part of family budgets here. “I have to spend thousands of rupees to repair my car due to the damage done because of driving on this road. I need to use this route regularly. The highway and the internal road levels are not aligned, and the bumper of my car gets damaged. The unevenness damages the engine and shock absorbers of two-wheelers as well,” Siraj Dokadia, another resident, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/damaged-road-in-wagholi-puts-lives-at-risk-dents-pockets-too/articleshow/86737146.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||India||Tej says Lalu held hostage; Tejashwi refutes allegation||PATNA: The feud in RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s family appears to be growing, with his elder son Tej Pratap Yadav on Saturday alleging that his father is being held “hostage” in Delhi. Tej Pratap, who was addressing an event of the Chhatra Janshakti Parishad in here, said, “Despite getting bail months ago, my father is still being held hostage in Delhi.” Tej also alleged that some people in the party are “dreaming of becoming national president of the party.” Political observers here consider the comment as a reference to his younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and sister Misa Bharti. Lalu is recuperating at the Delhi residence of Misa, a Rajya Sabha member. Leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi, on Sunday said the allegations of being held “captive” do not hold good in front of his father’s personality. “Laluji served as Bihar CM and railway minister. He was also behind having two PMs. He also got Lal Krishna Advani arrested. He can never be held hostage,” said Tejashwi. Taking a jibe at Tej’s statement, JD(U) spokesperson and MLC Neeraj Kumar said though it is an internal matter of Lalu’s family and his party, “the law is ready to help Tej Pratap if he seeks any assistance in the matter”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tej-says-lalu-held-hostage-tejashwi-refutes-allegation/articleshow/86742667.cms||Madan Kumar

Bhatt’s custody ended on Sunday noon, however further interrogation and collection of some more circumstantial evidence is yet to be done for which cops sought his further custody. “Bhatt had sent photos taken by the spy camera installed at the complainant’s house to her, but he has not revealed how he managed to get these pictures and who had installed the camera in the first place at her house,” said assistant public prosecutor Sagar Desai. Police will also take Bhatt to Dove Deck society on Ajwa Road for reconstruction of crime. The complainant had stayed at the society initially when she had come to Vadodara and Bhatt had gone there too, to meet her. Incidentally, the bootlegger Alpesh Wadhwani alias Alpu Sindhi, who is accused by people close to chartered account Ashok Jain of masterminding the entire rape case, was the complainant’s neighbour at Dove Deck society. Meanwhile, the Pavagadh Temple trust has decided to remove Bhatt as the trustee of the board. The board will pass a resolution in this regard during its upcoming meeting for Navratri. Bhatt was also the secretary of the trust, but after the FIR was registered against him, he gave up the position.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/raju-bhatts-police-custody-extended-by-three-days/articleshow/86737209.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pharma company allowed cost of France workshop for doctors as tax deduction||MUMBAI: The “nexus” between pharma companies and doctors is often the subject of tax litigation. Evolutis India, a Mumbai-based private company, had filed an appeal with the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) as a sum of Rs 12.79 lakh, incurred by it in 2014-15, had been disallowed by the income-tax officer. These expenses were largely towards a workshop held by it in France and included travel and hotel expenses of doctors who attended. The Mumbai ITAT bench, which recently heard this matter, held that the income-tax officer was not justified in disallowing this expense. It was incurred by the pharma company, a distributor of ortho implants, “wholly and exclusively in the normal course of its business” and should be allowed as a business deduction. The fallout of any disallowance of expenditure is that the taxable income goes up, resulting in a higher tax outgo. Or, if the company is loss-making, it reduces the loss that can be carried forward to the next eight years. Any loss that is carried forward reduces the tax liability of the future years. The I-T officer relied on a circular issued in 2012 by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) which states that any expenses incurred by a pharma company in providing “freebies” to doctors in violation of the regulations issued by the Medical Council of India (MCI) will be disallowed in the hands of the company. The ITAT bench was of the opinion that the travel, hotel and honorarium fees paid to doctors to participate in the overseas workshop could not be dubbed a gift or freebies and brought within the scope of the CBDT circular. The crux of the order, which will have a far-reaching impact in similar cases, is that the ITAT bench pointed out that it is the medical doctors registered with the MCI who are bound by its code of conduct. The CBDT is divested of its powers to enlarge the scope of the MCI regulation by extending the same to pharmaceutical companies without any enabling provision either under the Income Tax Act or the Indian Medical Regulations. If it does so, it impinges on the conduct of pharma companies in carrying out their business. In arriving at its decision, the ITAT also relied on decisions passed by various high courts. In an earlier case, of Liva Healthcare, reported by TOI on September 20, 2016, the Mumbai ITAT had held that the objective of overseas sponsored trips for the doctors and their spouses was to recommend its pharma products. It had disallowed such expenses in the hands of the company. In this context, the ITAT bench in its September 23 order commented that the tax tribunal in the earlier decision had incorporated the MCI regulations but not elaborated or dwelt upon the issue as to how the MCI regulation, meant strictly for medical practitioners and doctors, could apply to pharma companies and others in the health sector industry. Tax practitioners are of the view that the exact nature of the expense continues to be of importance. For now, based solely on this recent ITAT order, pharma companies are likely to say: Merci Beacoup (Thank you, very much).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pharma-co-allowed-cost-of-france-workshop-for-docs-as-tax-deduction/articleshow/86739550.cms||Lubna Kably
---||Kozhikode||20% quota for women in IUML-linked outfits||Kozhikode: On Saturday, IUML’s state working committee saw the party adopting a policy action plan prepared by the 10-member committee. The panel was constituted to look into IUML’s lacklustre poll performance and suggest remedial measures which included reserving 20% of organizational posts in affiliated organisations to women and constituting disciplinary committees at the district level. The 20% reservation for women office-bearers in affiliated organizations assumes significance due to the controversy over the complaints raised by former office bearers of Haritha (women’s wing of MSF) that IUML’s leadership couldn’t imbibe gender politics. But, the reservation will not be applicable to party office-bearers. The state committee meeting saw many leaders expressing strong dissatisfaction over the public bickering and rift between senior leaders in the Congress. Also many party leaders were seen trying to blame the weaknesses in Congress –including the erosion in vote banks of UDF’s lead party – as the main reason for the recent electoral debacle. They also said that Congress was not able to take a firm, unified stand with respect to issues related to minorities, including the minority student scholarship issue. The meeting noted that while IUML’s defeat in 12 seats in recent assembly elections was a major setback, there was optimism that the party can ensure revival through hard work. As per the policy action plan adopted at the meeting, two-member committees comprising a state office-bearer and an MLA have been constituted to examine the reasons for the defeat of candidates in 12 assembly seats. The committees were told to submit their reports in 15 days. The party will constitute Seethi Sahib Institute of Political Science and Research to train a new generation of leaders. All 60 state committee members will be given training in the political school of the institute. Party will constitute a think tank comprising writers, intellectuals, educationists, scientists, among others. Briefing the media at Manjeri, PMA Salam said party offices will be transformed into smart service centres for the benefit of the public. The party will also take steps to strengthen dalit, backward and minority movements. The meeting also decided that state leadership would provide a schedule of party leaders who would take part in news channel discussions and they will be given clear guidelines. Party high-power committee member Panakkad Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal presided over the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/20-quota-for-women-in-iuml-linked-outfits/articleshow/86737227.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||After months, city residents take a Tree Walk||Chandigarh: The Chandigarh Tree lovers CTL group resumed its activities, which were stopped for a few months due to the Covid pandemic. The group conducted a Tree Walk in the Hibiscus Garden, Sector 36, Chandigarh on Sunday morning. A group of nature lovers, members of CTL and Tricity residents wanting to know more about the city's landscaping and green heritage participated in the walk. They benefited from the knowledge that tree experts Dr Rajnish Wattas and Dr Harjeet Singh Dhillon shared. The highlight of the walk was the “Mickey mouse tree” (Monkey-ear-tree) enterolobium cyclocarpum, called such because of its flowers, which bear a strong resemblance to Mickey Mouse ears. Dr Dhillon pointed out a tree that had been planted in the mid-1970s. The group was impressed by the tree, which had spread out over the years and stood majestically in the corner of the garden. Another specimen of this rare tree of Chandigarh can also be seen near The Tribune Chowk roundabout. Besides various species of Hibiscus shrubs planted in the garden, trees like Kusum, Papdi, Barringtonia, Gular, Baheda, Tacoma, koeleteuria and many others were also pointed out. The group listened attentively as experts explained their characteristics. A key feature of the garden is the dense plantation of bamboos planted along the N-Choe -- a seasonal rivulet running through the entire stretch of the Leisure Valley and the garden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-months-city-residents-take-a-tree-walk/articleshow/86737183.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||AMC takes stand to deny citizen access to birth, death numbers||AHMEDABAD: If you were to seek the official birth and death figures for Ahmedabad city under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, the municipal corporation will outright deny any access to this information. In the final order of the first appellate authority, dated September 15, the AMC has directed the applicant that the civic body “will not part with the data.” The applicant had only required numbers of total birth and death registrations undertaken by the AMC, which is updated realtime in the municipal registry network system, for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. The order was passed by appellate authority Bhavin Joshi at the AMC. After being denied the information, Kalupur applicant Pankaj Bhatt had written to the AMC’s registrar for birth and death that under Section 19 of the birth and death registration Act, 1969 the registrar has to place the yearly death and birth figures in public domain, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation contrarily believes it to be ‘third party information’. Bhatt had approached the AMC’s birth and death registry with his RTI application on June 14 for month-wise numbers of death and birth certificates issued and also applications made by the public. This is not the first time that the department has turned down RTI Act requests seeking death figures for Ahmedabad city for 2020. The department cites two Gujarat information commission orders of 2007 and 2008, a Delhi high court order of 2009 to turn down RTI requests on death figures during 2020 Covid year. The AMC has in all turned down four applications making similar requests between October last year and June this year, claims a senior AMC official. The superintendent of the registry wrote back saying that the information sought was “bulky” and that most of “department employees may have to be engaged in gathering the information during such Covid times. The superintendent refused to part with the information. “I have copies of month-wise data of birth and death figures supplied by the same office two years back under the RTI Act. What makes the same information bulkier this time is strange. I have applied for first appeal,” says Bhatt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-takes-stand-to-deny-citizen-access-to-birth-death-numbers/articleshow/86737345.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: 23 yrs on, Harpur stadium remains incomplete, cost rises five times||NAGPUR: Even 23 years after construction began, the indoor stadium at Harpur on Umred Road in South Nagpur remains incomplete. The project cost has escalated five times, causing loss of public money, and depriving sportspersons of facilities. Now, Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) wants take over the project for operation and maintenance (O&M) from Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA), and issue tender to appoint O&M agency for the completed portion. NIT board of trustees will take a decision on this on Monday. The agenda itself mentions sports and youth welfare minister Sunil Kedar had on August 8, 2020, and September 29, 2020, directed NIT to transfer the project to sports department for O&M. However, NIT chairman Manoj Kumar Suryawanshi has sought powers to take further decisions in the project. NIT had handed over 9.50 acre to Directorate of Sports and Youth Welfare for the sports complex in 1998. In 2003, NIT entered into an agreement with Maharashtra Kamgar Kalyan Mandal for execution of project. The mandal was to construct the stadium from labourers’ funds by 2007. The mandal roped in controversial Unity Infra Project Limited to make the stadium for Rs12 crore. Unity constructed outer part of indoor stadium for Rs7.05 crore till 2007, before the project got stuck. In 2019, the mandal gave Rs10 crore to NMRDA to complete the project. NMRDA finish levelling surface layer, badminton, carrom areas, compound wall, storm water drain, internal roads etc. Now, NMRDA needs Rs49.56 crore to complete the project. This will take total cost of project to Rs66.61 crore, which is 5.5 times the initial cost. The mandal spent Rs17.05 crore meant for welfare of workers on the project, but abandoned it in 2019. Despite Kedar’s directives, the mandal also delayed giving NOC to NMRDA to transfer the project to sports department. Even the sports department has not given administrative approval for additional expenditure of Rs49.56 crore. The government reinstated powers of planning authority of NIT some months ago. Citing lack of funds at NMRDA, NIT, which owns the land, wants to take over the project for O&M. NIT sources told TOI NMRDA superintending engineer Leena Upadhyay will suggest handing over the project to sports department as per Kedar’s directives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/23-yrs-on-harpur-stadium-remains-incomplete-cost-rises-five-times/articleshow/86739559.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Most hoteliers and shopkeepers did brisk business, parking lots were full and cars were seen parked on the roads. On Sunday, places like Mall Road, Mallital and high court (HC) road were brimming with tourists. “The first week of October has been very good for us. Most of the hotels in the town are already on 100% occupancy. Almost every tourist spot and square is full and we expect more tourists in the next few days,” a hotel owner said. The tourist numbers also meant that most of the locations in Lake Town were plagued with long jams. “All the entries to the town were choking and saw hours of long jam. The hotel parking as well as parking spots at flats were full and police were having a hard time managing the cars,” said Ramesh Kumar, a local. The district administration meanwhile said that as winters and peak tourist season approach, it will make efforts to smoothen the tourist movement in the next few days. “As Covid cases continue to go down and more and more people are vaccinated across the country, we expect the tourist season in the winters to be very good. Therefore a traffic plan is being devised to ensure that tourists do not have to wait for long to park their vehicles,” said a senior official of the police department. Mussoorie also witnessed a similar situation. Long weekend led to an influx of tourists. Majority of hotels reported 80 to 100% occupancy on Saturday, however heavy influx of tourists also resulted in traffic jams in various parts of the town starting Friday evening. Long queues of vehicles were seen at Gandhi Chowk, Masonic Lodge, Landour and Char Dukan. However, traffic jams caused misery to tourists and they were stuck in the jams for several hours. "My family was stuck for nearly two hours between Kincraig and Picture Palace,” said Sumit Kumar, a tourist from Ludhiana. Station officer Mussoorie, Girish Chand Sharma said that a large number of police personnel had been deployed to man the traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tourists-throng-nainital-mussoorie-on-weekend/articleshow/86737245.cms||Prashant Jha

The victim was identified as Abdul Fathah Reihan of Riyas Manzil. The accused, Muhammedshan, 43, alias Sunil Kumar, is the brother-in-law of the victim’s mother Safia, 38, said police. Police arrested Muhammedshan from Muthuvankudy near Anachal on Sunday evening. The evidence collection will be conducted on Monday, said police. There was a dispute between the families and a case was registered in this regard with Vellathooval police. Muhammedshan, residing at Vandiperiyar, entered the victim’s house at around 3:30am by breaking open the back door. He attacked Safia, who was sleeping with her son, with a hammer. The accused then went to the house of Safia’s mother, Sainaba, 73, living closeby and attacked her. He forcefully took away Safia’s 15-year-old daughter from the grandmother’s house and tied her up with a rope. The girl managed to escape and informed local residents. Idukki deputy SP Immanuel Paul said that the girl informed that the accused told her that he would show her the dead bodies of her mother and brother. “The girl said that she escaped from the accused’s custody and informed other family members. The accused, a resident of Vandiperiyar has another wife and children, shifted to Amakkandam and married Safia’s sister and stayed there. Safia and Muhammedshan’s wife are not on good terms. We will probe the reason for his sudden provocation,” he said. “Sainaba and Safia are in stable condition now. The boy’s body was shifted to Adimali taluk hospital for postmortem,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/seven-year-old-boy-dies-as-relative-hits-with-hammer-on-head/articleshow/86737301.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: East in class, west online; twain don’t meet||AHMEDABAD: According to the estimates of some schools and associations, institutions in the east are recording 80-85% attendance as compared to the schools in the west where the attendance is 25-30% of the total approved class strength. Currently, Covid-19 restrictions apply to schools. Contrary to the notion that the western part, home to a large number of popular schools, has a higher number of students attending classes in person, the reverse is true today. Hitesh Patel, the president of Ahmedabad Self-Finance School Management Association, said that Shreeji Vidyalaya which he runs in Bapunagar in the east is drawing 90% in-person attendance. “Most schools east of the river are registering 80-85% attendance,” Patel said. “Unlike in the west, the penetration of tuition classes is less here and the schools have made a lot of effort to draw children for on-campus studies.” In the west, some institutions such as Prakash Higher Secondary School in Vastrapur haven’t re-opened for physical classroom studies four months after the government allowed them to do so. They offer online classes. Mrugen Shah, the principal of Prakash School, said none of the parents are ready to send their children for in-person studies. Schools in Gujarat re-opened in July for in-person studies for Class 6 to Class 12 students and in line with Covid-19 restrictions, only 50% of the total classroom strength is allowed. In the east, most schools lie in the vicinity of residential areas so commuting is not as major an issue as it is in the west. Raju Desai, the principal of Uma Vidyalaya in Nikol in the east, said that the attendance level has reached 90%. “We use the odd-even formula for calling students to school,” Desai said. “Transportation is not an issue here as many students live close to their schools.” Indrani Banerjee, the principal of HB Kapadia School in Memnagar in the west, said that only 25-30% are attending her school. “Children are by now used to online studies and hence they do not want to take the risk of going to school,” she said. “Transportation is a major issue for parents and children. After the first term exam in October, the picture will be clear as the exams are to be held in the pen-and-paper format.” Pratiksha Parekh, the principal of Tripada International School in Ghatlodia in the west, said that about 60% of the parents have given written consent to allow their children to attend school. “But they are very reluctant to send them to school and this can be seen from the attendance level which is 30-40%,” Parekh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/east-in-class-west-online-twain-dont-meet/articleshow/86737387.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Free aid in mosque clinic helps poor save money, better lives||HYDERABAD: Osman Nagar in the Old City has become synonymous with misery due to constant flooding during the monsoon, but a local mosque has emerged as the messiah. Come rain or shine, the mosque has been providing shelter to locals and offering free medical facilities through a clinic on its premises. The money saved on medical bills has even helped the poor better their lives and put more food on the table. After treating about 60,000 patients in just nine months since January this year, perhaps a first for a mosque clinic in the country, it is now actively campaigning against dengue. Apart from blood tests to detect the virus, the Masjid Omar Shifa clinic also conducted a massive sanitisation drive in Osman Nagar under Maheshwaram mandal with the help of local civic authorities and NGO Helping Hand Foundation (HHF). Osman Nagar has been perpetually waterlogged since October 2020 rains. Uncleared garbage, overflowing drains and frequent waterlogging after rains have turned it into a breeding ground for vector-borne diseases, particularly dengue and malaria. A survey across 700 households by the mosque clinic in association with HHF showed that 95% of the respondents highlighted unhygienic conditions and overflowing drains as the major civic problems affecting the area. “The survey was taken up after the primary health care centre at the mosque clinic in Osman Nagar received 25 dengue cases of children between 10 and 18 years old within a month,” said HHF managing trustee Mujtaba Hasan Askari. Another survey earlier in September revealed that the mosque clinic had helped in improving the social indices in Osman Nagar. About 65% residents said that out-of-pocket expenses that they had saved thanks to the free treatment at the mosque had improved their food security and helped them meet school fees of children, Askari said. He said the area faced a double-whammy of flooding and Covid-induced lockdown, making life miserable for residents already plagued by poor infrastructure in their area. Job losses, poor health, loss of property and displacement was found to be the common thread running across most households. The mosque clinic also runs a minor operation theatre, besides giving dental, ophthalmological services and a free ambulance. The services are free for all irrespective of caste or creed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/free-aid-in-mosque-clinic-helps-poor-save-money-better-lives/articleshow/86739640.cms||Syed Akbar

The Congress leaders have alleged that the condition of Sector 15 is quite bad. They said even the parks in Sector 15 are in deplorable condition, not even the lights are functioning properly, making it difficult for people to go for walks after dark. While the children are standing on the sidewalks, as the swings are broken and grass overgrown, they alleged. “Garbage is not cleared regularly. Manhole covers are broken, and side lanes are covered with overgrown grass, due to which they are closed during the rains,” a Congress leader said. The Congress leader also said a former Congress councillor had got the iron gates installed in Sector 15 for security, but today the condition of the gates is so bad that it does not serve the purpose. “But there is no one to make inventory of such things,” he alleged. Congress has appealed to the commissioner of municipal corporation Chandigarh, Anidita Mitra, to visit Sector 15 of Ward No 12 to understand the lack of basic infrastructure in Sector 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-alleges-swachhta-campaign-skipped-sec-15/articleshow/86739642.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Aryan Khan was apologetic, his friend hid drugs in his shoe, says NCB||MUMBAI: In its remand application seeking custody of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, Arbaz Merchant, and Munmun Dhamecha, the NCB said the trio was arrested for consumption, sale and purchase of contraband under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. An official, however, said that Khan has been booked only for consumption under Section 27 of the Act, which attracts a maximum punishment of one year or with fine which may extend to Rs 20,000. Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha were picked up late Saturday and were questioned at the NCB office at Ballard Pier. “Khan was apologetic when we asked him to accompany us to the NCB office,” an official said. They were taken for medical examination at JJ Hospital at 4pm on Sunday. Khan was wearing a black T-shirt and cap and wore a face mask. They were brought back to the NCB office within 40 minutes and produced before a holiday court at 7pm. NCB officials said that they did not recover any contraband from Khan, but found a small quantity of charas in Merchant’s shoes. The duo was sharing a room in the cruise liner, the NCB said. The remand application submitted in the court stated that the NCB has found WhatsApp chats “clearly showing the nexus of those arrested with suppliers and peddlers on a regular basis”. NCB counsel Advait Sethna argued for their custody, while Satish Maneshinde said police remand for a bailable offence would be unfair. Seeking the trio’s custody, Sethna submitted that while some were produced on Sunday, others will be produced in a day or two, so he wanted two days’ “reasonable custody” as the NCB has apprehended a supplier and wanted to probe a “link shown through WhatsApp chats”. But Maneshinde said nothing was shown to have been found on Khan. “He was invited by the organisers. He had no boarding pass,” he said, adding that Khan’s mobile phone was examined but apparently nothing significant was found on it. NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede said if required, they will seek Khan’s further custody in the sessions court on Monday. Khan and Merchant were given free entry on the cruise liner and the organisers hoped to capitalise on the former’s celebrity quotient for furthering their business interests, an official said. There were six organisers for the voyage who had charged anything from Rs 60,000 to Rs 3 lakh for a ticket. “The Austrian owner of the ship has been summoned,” said an NCB officer. Officials said they had been working on the information that drugs would be consumed and raided the Cordelia Cruises. “We have been working on it for the past 15 days. We visited the international cruise terminal, posed as passengers and while entering the ship we disclosed our identity to the private security guards,” an official said. The NCB said that in the rooms, they found material to facilitate consumption of drugs like ready-to-roll joints, paper and the like. “Hence, we need to establish if the organisers were unaware about the drugs consumption,” an official said. Jurgen Bailom, CEO and president, Waterways Leisure Tourism Pvt Ltd, said, “Cordelia Cruises is in no way, directly or indirectly, connected to this incident. Cordelia Cruises had chartered its ship for a private event to a Delhi-based event management company...We... condemn all such acts ... and are cooperating with the authorities”. On Sunday, Bailon visited the NCB office where his statement was recorded.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Just 65km from sea, sludge kills Sabarmati||AHMEDABAD: River Sabarmati — stinking and sluggish and dark as tar — runs between the living, breathing world and the dead. Just 500 metres downstream of the Vasna barrage, where the city vomits its nauseating expulsions, one is left to wonder about the stench. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) in its latest report has officially acknowledged that in its 371km journey, the Sabarmati is choked at its 306th km milestone, Ahmedabad, before the dead river meets the sea after Vautha. At the Vasna-Narol bridge, the river is reduced to a channel carrying effluents from industries of Naroda, Odhav Vatva, Narol and sewerage from Ahmedabad city. This is reflected in biological oxygen demand (BOD) levels measured by GPCB which increased by 644% higher than permissible levels. In the case of chemical oxygen demand (COD), the GPCB found the levels 60% higher than permissible levels. As per the norms BOD — which is the amount of oxygen that would be consumed if all the organic materials in a one-litre water sample were oxidized by bacteria and protozoa — should not exceed 10 milligrams per litre (mg/l) while COD — an indicative measure of the amount of oxygen that can be consumed by reactions — should stay within 50 milligrams per litre. The annual report of the GPCB clearly shows that when the river waters are tested at Dharoi, they are well within the parameter. The BOD at Dharoi was as low as 0.8mg/l while COD levels are 6mg/l. This changes when the river reaches the Vasna-Narol (VN) bridge. “We have begun issuing notices to industry associations to ensure that their members discharge treated effluents. But such warnings have not helped us to improve the situation. Following the HC directive, we plan to intensify the drive against erring industries,” says a senior GPCB official. The GPCB official also pointed out that even the sewage treatment plants of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) are not able to treat domestic wastewater properly. The GPCB report indicates that against the limit of total faecal coliform bacteria of 500 particles/100ml the STP’s treated water has 695 particles/100ml.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/just-65km-from-sea-sludge-kills-sabarmati/articleshow/86737356.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Chandigarh||Abandoned children find new homes||Panchkula: Since its institution in the year 1981, the district child welfare department, Panchkula has helped 550 abandoned children find homes and families. District child welfare officer (DCWO) Bhagat Ram said in most cases a child was abandoned by the family either if the mother was a minor or the child was a girl. There were few cases of abandonment due to financial reasons. DCWO informed that under the Palna scheme of the state government, a cradle has been placed outside the Shishu Greh in Sector 15.The cradle sounds an alarm when somebody puts a child in it. The alarm rings in the office of the supervisor and security guard of the premises, who are trained to bring the child inside and provide immediate medical assistance. DCWO Bhagat said that this has been done so that people do not leave/abandon infants at isolated places, exposing them to danger in the form of animals or extreme weather conditions. DCWO Bhagat said, “While we have not placed lights or CCTV cameras on the cradle, but we surely follow the law and FIR is registered for each newborn abandoned. Strict criminal action under the law is required, otherwise people will start abandoning their babies.” The DCWO also informed that from 1982 till date, they have helped 550 children under the age of 12 find families. Out the 550 children adopted, 158 were adopted by the foreigners. They included 133 girls and 25 boys. Besides, 392 children, including 237 girls and 155 boys were adopted within the country. The district child welfare department takes the help of various NGOs working in this direction to help children find a good family. Background of the family which comes for adoption is checked thoroughly before the child is given for adoption. Department officials also keep meeting the child and their family till he/she fully grows. Those who do not get adopted by a family are taken care of by the district child welfare department through different facility homes including Shishu Greh, Bal Sadan, Bal Bhawan and Ashiana. The department pays for their living, education, health and other facilities. On tracing of parents of abandoned babies, the DCWO said that a team of Aanganwadi and NHM workers helped DCWO trace parents based on their record of pregnant women. As Panchkula is surrounded by Chandigarh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, their teams also visit the neighbouring states if parents of the abandoned baby are not traced in the district. BOX: Protecting infants One cradle is placed outside Shishu Greh in Sector-15 so that people do not abandon children at isolated places and expose them to mortal danger. FIR is registered and strict action under law is taken against the parent who abandons the newborn. BOX: Adoptions so far Total children who found families: 550 (August 1981 to August 19, 2021) Inter-country adoption: 158 (133 girls and 25 boys) In-country adoption: 392 (237 girls and 155 boys) BOX: Tracing parents A team of Aanganwadi and NHM workers helps DCWO trace parents of the abandoned babies based on their record of pregnant women. As Panchkula is surrounded by Chandigarh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh borders, their teams also visit neighbouring states. Cops help in the investigation through CCTV cameras and other modes of investigation.

---||Delhi||Eco-tourism plan at Delhi's Sanjay Van to harm green lungs: Residents||NEW DELHI: While Delhi Development Authority (DDA) plans to develop Sanjay Van in south Delhi as an eco-tourism spot, locals are opposing the move as they feel the move would disturb the habitat of birds and snakes and degrade the green lungs of the city. Spread over 784 acres, Sanjay Van is known for its tranquility, sound of birds chirping, butterflies fluttering around, dense tree cover and five ponds. Part of the south-central ridge of Delhi and situated in Vasant Kunj, Sanjay Van was developed by DDA in the 1970s. The reserve forest attracts scores of walkers, birdwatchers, cyclists and nature lovers every day. However, after the land-owning agency floated an expression of interest to develop nature-based tourism activities under the public-private partnership model, regular visitors to Sanjay Van objected to the move. Volunteers associated with “There is no Earth B”, which conducts cleaning exercises every Sunday at Sanjay Van since April 2019, has started a campaign to demand cancellation of the EOI notice. A total of 88 people have directly written to LG Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to drop the plans of introducing adventure and other activities, including rock climbing, paragliding, forest safari, archery and crossbow and rope course. Sheranya Gurtu, a sociology student at LSR who takes part in the cleaning drive here every Sunday, said: “Watching the rich flora and fauna of Sanjay Van is a recreational activity and one cannot have a dull moment here. Opening it up to more business activities will cause more damage to the forest. If anyone wants to do adventure activities, he or she should go to an amusement park.” Dr Aniruddho Karak, a dental surgeon, claimed that as a nature enthusiast, he was awestruck when he first visited Sanjay Van a few years ago as he got to see a different side of Delhi. “Developing Sanjay Van as a tourism spot will impact the beauty and tranquility, and will damage the green belt of the city,” he said. “Some visitors litter this urban forest with non-biodegradable waste, including plastic bottles and wrappers of eatables. If the planned activities are introduced, it would increase the garbage generation here in the next few years,” said Dhrstadyumn, a volunteer with There is no Earth B. He added that the group had collected 24.8kg of non-biodegradable waste from Sanjay Van last Sunday. A number of morning walkers, too, objected to DDA’s plans. SK Raghav and Geetav Raghav, who have been coming to Sanjay Van for over six years for morning walk, said, “The air and noise pollution in Delhi is a matter of concern. Sanjay Van is one of the few places in the capital that is known for its peaceful atmosphere. Our aim should be to save nature and not cause further damage to it.” A regular visitor for nearly 15 years, retired Colonel OP Pahuja said Sanjay Van should be kept natural and introducing activities for commercial purpose would spoil the serene environment. DDA officials, meanwhile, were unavailable for comments.

Nidhina was killed by her classmate Abhishek Baiju (20) who cut her throat with a paper cutter at St Thomas College, Pala, around 11:20am on Friday after she exited the exam hall. They were pursuing Bachelor of Vocation education (BVoc) in food processing technology and were writing the final year exams. Police had said the incident was the fallout of a strained relationship. Abhishek, who did not move away from the crime scene, was arrested by the police. The accused was later remanded in judicial custody. Nidhina’s funeral was held at her mother’s ancestral home in Udayanapuram near Vaikom on Saturday. Women’s commission chairperson P Sathidevi visited Nidhina’s mother at her home on Sunday. Meanwhile, investigating officers are of the view that the murder was pre-planned. The accused had bought a new blade for the paper cutter a week ago after Nidhina rejected him. The way he executed the murder made the officers suspect that he had practiced the act. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nidhina-died-of-excessive-blood-loss-autopsy-report/articleshow/86737346.cms||---

Scores of students in their last year of graduation were suddenly not sure what will happen in the months following the lockdown. Some were stranded in foreign countries and others spent months away from their families, coping with despair and loneliness. Abhirami Suresh, an exhibition design student of National Institute of Design (NID), decided to chronicle these tales for posterity. As her graduation project, she created a web repository ‘White Lines’ containing narratives, short stories, artwork, and visual journals from students across the globe. The site also tried to measure coping mechanisms through surveys which found that 22% of the respondents felt unprepared for the changes, whereas 50% accepted that they spent more time on social media than before. “I quickly message everyone from my friends’ groups and if they’re free, I call someone up or start texting them,” read one of the narratives. Another said: “I hope that this would make people understand the value of a relationship (of any kind).” It went on to say: “Being apart for so long has placed an importance on being in touch with our loved ones.” Tanishka Kachru, associate senior faculty member of communication design at NID, said that several projects of the graduation display at NID explored the theme of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/truth-isolated-were-designed-to-connect/articleshow/86737375.cms||Parth Shastri

This happened during the pandemic when some children turned into orphans after family members succumbed to Covid. These are a doctor couple who have fostered an eight-year-old boy during the pandemic. Dr Sahul Bharti and Dr Bhavneet Bharti took the decision more than a year ago to give domestic care to a traumatised child. After consistent home visits and counseling by Chandigarh Child Welfare Committee, they are now parents to the boy staying in an orphanage. “This was not easy to get back into parenting after so many years. I have been visiting orphanages and I felt that at least this would change the world of a child,” said Dr Bhavneet, director principal, BR Ambedkar State Institute of Medical Sciences, Mohali. The provision of foster care started in India in 2016, where unrelated families could give care in a family set up to the child. “We have prospective foster parents who are being interviewed, but there is one success story till date. In fact, Chandigarh is the only place in the Tricity to have a foster parent,” said Dr Satinder Kaur, chairperson, Chandigarh Child Welfare Committee. She said, “There is a lot of loneliness in the city, such a scheme can give company to parents and the child will have a good life. We do a lot of counselling with the prospective parents and the child only after a few months when we are sure about their mutual adjustment, the child gets a foster family.” There is no such case of foster parenting in Mohali at present but two to three such queries are there in the pipeline, said district child protection officer (DCPO) Navneet Kaur. Committee callIf the child is not adjusting in the family after various sessions of counselling, the committee can decide to send him/her back to the orphanage. The counselling is done so that the parting does not have emotional strain on the child After five years of foster relationship, the family can adopt the child after the committee’s reviews and evaluation||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/just-one-success-story-of-foster-parent-in-city/articleshow/86737323.cms||Shimona Kanwar

It also demanded a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the drugs haul at the Adani-operated port last month. “There is a news that a actor’s son has been arrested. Where did this drug come from? The NCB has come out and all of sudden saying that it has caught drugs from a cruise ship,” Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed said. The real issue is Mundra port, the drug cartels in the country and drugs that is smuggled from Afghanistan, she alleged. “They (NCB) catch some people here and there so that media will show that case, (that will) divert the attention. But I want you all to write about Mundra port, why it is not investigated?” She questioned the silence of PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah on the drug seizure at Mundra port.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Lured by lottery prize of Rs 75,000, IAF jawan loses Rs 8 lakh||AHMEDABAD: An Indian Air Force employee first cheated by cyber crooks who managed to swindle Rs 2 lakh from him in the garb of providing him a bumper prize of a motorcycle worth Rs 75,000 in a lottery. Now, he was about to suffer double whammy. When he realized that he was cheated, he dialled the customer care number to freeze his account to prevent any further transactions, but got connected with another cybercrook who duped him of Rs 6 lakh using various tricks. Omprakash Agrawal, 34, a native of Ranchi in Jharkhand and a sergeant deployed in Gandhinagar, said that he had on September 25 received a message congratulating him for winning a motorcycle worth Rs 75,000. Agrawal dialled a number given in the message to claim his bumper prize, where a person picked up the call and told Agrawal that his superior would call him up. After few minutes, a person named Anil Kumar called him up and took his address and banking details on the pretext of sending his bumper gift and also to give him some other cash prize. Kumar told Agrawal that he would have to pay Rs 15,650 as registration fees and the amount was supposed to be transferred to a bank account. Agrawal followed his advice and made the first transaction of Rs 15,650. But the cybercrook kept luring Agrawal with different guaranteed lottery schemes and kept taking money from him. He said in the FIR that they swindled Rs 2.25 lakh on pretext of different lottery schemes. After losing this amount, Agrawal realized that he was cheated by cybercrooks. Without thinking twice, he googled the customer care number of his bank and dialled it. But the number was busy at that time. After a couple of minutes, he got a call from the number where a person introduced himself as customer care representative of the bank and asked him about Agrawal’s problem. Agrawal narrated the entire sequence and told him that he wanted to freeze the payment which he made to the cybercrooks and also to ensure that no unscrupulous transaction would be made by those cheaters who had taken Agrawal’s banking details. The customer care employee then sent him two links to download two different applications. But Agrawal was not aware that those apps were supposed to give access of his cellphone to another cybercrook. After taking access on his phone, the cybercrooks took away Rs 6 lakh from his bank account in four different transactions on September 26 and September 27. He then went to the bank and froze his account and later filed a complaint of cheating along with charges under jnformation technology act with Gandhinagar range cybercrime police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lured-by-lottery-prize-of-rs-75k-iaf-jawan-loses-rs-8l/articleshow/86737349.cms||Ashish Chauhan

But this Navratri, sheri garbas are back in business. The sheri garba organizers are both excited and worried as they are expecting a huge crowd at their venues.  “Not a single big venue is hosting garba this year due to government restrictions. So, we are expecting a large crowed of revellers and audience at our garba this time. While we are happy that people are turning to sheri garba there is also a concern as we have to follow all Covid guidelines including a maximum limit of 400 persons,” said Minesh Shah of Mehta Pol Sheri Garba.  “We have decided to upgrade our music system this Navratri and go for a better decoration too,” Shah told TOI. The state government has barred big venues and party plots from hosting garbas and only residential colonies have been allowed to host Navratri along with sheri garbas.  “Many youngsters from our locality, who used to play garba at big venues, have inquired about our sheri garba this year,” said Nikunj Tamboli of Tamboli Pol Yuvak Mandal in the old city.  The number of revellers playing in sheri garba is definitely going to increase. I hope that our traditional sheri garbas that had lost popularity get revived now, Tamboli added.  In most sheri garbas, only residents of that locality participate along with their friends and family members who stay in the other areas. Over the last two decades, the popularity of big garba groups hosting Navratri on party plots and grounds had shot up. . “After a long time, sheri garbas are again earning the same popularity and it is heartening to see so many inquiries coming in. We will follow the government guidelines as a big crowd is expected at most sheri garbas this year,” said Vijay Shah, organizer of Siddheshwari Mataji Mandir garba in Narsinhji Pol. Vadodara is famed for its commercial garba, mostly United Way, which attracts garba revellers from across the state. However, it won’t be organized this year due to government Covid guidlines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sheri-garbas-set-for-a-revival-after-two-decades/articleshow/86737366.cms||Tushar Tere

In his complaint, activist Deepak Kante alleged that walls have been broken at the club one of the oldest in the country without MHCC’s permission. “All heritage norms are being broken. The ceiling and pillars are covered with bison board and the appearance of the verandah is being changed, not maintaining the heritage structure and style. Bison panels are being placed all over the walls and ceiling, and even on the pillars, in a violation of heritage norms. The pillar style and the ceiling style and look have been changed,” Kante said in his complaint. The Bombay Gymkhana on its part maintained that there were no violations of any heritage norms. “We are a 146-year-old sporting institution and take great pride in our heritage and culture. Owing to the age of our structure, we carry out a maintenance exercise of painting, polishing and repair work every year. We have never intended nor ever intend to violate the heritage norms, or alter in any way the character of our iconic premises,” said Bombay Gymkhana CEO RN Ranjan. MHCC chairperson Ramanath Jha did not respond to a query from TOI. According to heritage norms, prior approval from MHCC is required for repairs or making any changes to designated heritage structure. Kante’s complaint further reads: “It is surprising that the authorities have taken no cognisance of the rampant violations. Not only should a show cause notice be issued to stop work till heritage approval is given, but they should be penalised. Also, the land lease should not be renewed unless the statutory obligations are assured in future projects.” Interestingly, in 2016, the Bombay Gymkhana and BMC were in a major tussle over a road widening project, for which the civic body wanted the elite club to give up a portion of its sprawling grounds. At the time, the Bombay Gymkhana had claimed that the entire estate, including the sprawling grounds, was a listed Grade IIA heritage property and could not be altered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-gym-fends-off-charge-of-heritage-neglect/articleshow/86739797.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The impact of a deep depression in Bay of Bengal and intense rain in a short span of time has left farmlands across districts under water. The gap between demand and supply has increased and prices are unlikely to drop during festive period, say those associated with the vegetable trade in Kolkata. TimesViewAll efforts should be made to keep the price deviation (from normal) as low as possible and for as short a duration as possible. Agencies should also ensure that the middle of the supply chain does not profiteer at the expense of the farmer and the buyer.Prices of vegetables at retail markets across the city have more than doubled in a week. Parwal (pointed gourd), for instance, rose to Rs70 a kg, which was hovering around Rs30/kg a week ago. Tomato was selling at Rs25-30/kg and is now priced at Rs50. Price of brinjal (eggplant) was Rs35-40 and is now selling at Rs70-80 a kg. Parwal, bottle gourd, long beans, cucumber and okra are particularly susceptible to stagnant water and rot faster than other vegetables, if they are under water for more than 2-3 days. “A sharp drop in the supply of vegetables from Hooghly, Howrah, Midnapore, where barrage water inundated farm fields, have left farmers hapless. The impact of their losses are being felt by the city markets,” said Kamal Dey, president Bengal Farmers’ and Vendors’ Association. In fact, the rain water has not receded from several farmlands in Bashirhat, Bongaon, Canning, Baruipur as the rivers, which are supposed to drain out the water are still overflowing. “The water is flowing back into the fields even if they are pumped out into the canals. That is why the damage to crops is far worse than what we experienced in the aftermath of Yaas,” said Rasul Miyan, a farmer and member of Joint Action Forum of Farmers and Vendors at Barasat. “Moreover, the transportation cost has risen once more, with diesel prices inching towards a century. Since September 24, the prices of diesel rose by Rs2 per litre. Now, there is an increase of Rs100 per tonne of vegetables from the haat to wholesale market and from wholesale market to retail ones,” said Gobindo Naskar, a wholesaler at Jinjira (Base Bridge) wholesale market. “The rising prices of vegetables are ominous for us before the festivals. The prices of all edible commodities across categories have risen. LPG price too has had a shocking rise. The fluctuating vegetable prices are burning a bigger hole in the pockets,” said Ashwini Kumar, an engineer with the railway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/veggie-prices-shoot-up-before-durga-puja/articleshow/86737402.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The office order in this regard has been circulated by the BSL. The step is taken to keep motivation of the employees high. BSL spokesperson Manikant Dhan said that it has been decided by director in charge Amarendu Prakash that interior painting of employees' quarters as well as exterior repair and extension of painting of blocks will be done on occasion of wedding. For this, an application has to be made to the personal department along with proof of wedding. “The application should be submitted at least 2-3 months in advance,” he added. President of Bokaro Steel Officers Association (BSOA) A K Singh said they are in constant touch with the management on the issue of development related to the township. Singh said, “This time in the SAIL-SEFI meeting held in Delhi on September 16, the officials had a detailed discussion with SAIL chairman Soma Mondal on electricity, road, development and encroachment. The chairman had said that BSL has been given huge funds for the development of the township. Now it is the responsibility of the management to develop the city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bsl-plans-house-facelift-as-wedding-gifts-to-their-employees/articleshow/86737308.cms||Divy Khare
---||Ranchi||Ex-Cong minister seeks JPC probe into Amazon bribery case||Ranchi: Congress national general secretary and former Union minister Tarik Anwar has demanded a joint parliamentary probe (JPC) in connection with the Amazon bribery charge which surfaced recently prompting the central government to launch an investigation. Last month, a whistleblower blew the lid off the murky deals allegedly by the legal representatives of the global e-commerce company. The company, accused of paying bribes to Indian officials, announced an independent internal probe claiming that it has zero tolerance for corruption. Lashing out at the Narendra Modi government on Sunday during his visit to Ranchi, Anwar said, “Na khaunga, na khane dunga coined by our PM after he came to power in 2014 has now today become a popular jumla (joke) in the country going by the increasing trend of corruption in this government. Even when the Rafale deal scam broke, Congress has been asking for a JPC probe and we demand the same now in the Amazon bribery scandal. If the Union government has nothing to hide, it must agree to it.” Anwar said the Amazon bribery scandal is in the tune of over Rs 8,000 crore and accused the Modi government of being hand in gloves. “The Modi government’s mantra of governance is first destroy the existing businesses in the country and then sell/lease out to his friends,” he said, referring to the recent national monetization pipeline under which Union government has decided to open gates for private players in PSUs, banks and railways among others. “All the assets of the country built in last 75 years has now been put up for sale by Narendra Modi government, which has failed to create jobs,” he said. Alleging the BJP-led government of being hand in gloves with drug peddlers, he said the recent drug haul from the Adani-run port in Gujarat is a testimony to it. “If that is the Gujarat model of development, the country should stand against it. By denying jobs to the youths of this country, the Modi government is pushing them to drugs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ex-cong-minister-seeks-jpc-probe-into-amazon-bribery-case/articleshow/86737508.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Cloth merchants eye profits despite rising infection rate||Ranchi: The retail apparel store owners of Ranchi are an unhappy lot even though Durga Puja is little over a week away. With the state disaster management authority (SDMA) directives having dampened the spirit of this year’s Puja, the apparel merchants have not been able to meet their business projections ahead of the festivities. “The business has improved a bit if it is compared to last year. As per our estimates, there has been a 15% increase. But the footfall of customers is quite low compared to 2019 and other years as a large section of the society has still not got its purchasing power back,” Binod Modi, the owner of Beena Vastralaya in Upper Bazar, said.  “The state government has not permitted apparel stores to open for business on Sundays as a preventive measure to check a possible surge in cases. This has dampened the sales to a great extent,” Modi added. On Saturday, there was heavy footfall at the apparel stores throughout the evening which resulted in traffic snarls across the city’s main streets. As per an estimate, the apparel stores across Ranchi witness a cumulative transaction of Rs 120 crore before the Durga Puja every year. However, 2020 turned out to be a forgettable year for the 1,100-odd apparel stores here as cumulative sales dipped by around 70%. “At this point, we are hopeful that the sales will improve by around 40% from last year. A large chunk of the buyers usually begin their Puja shopping after Mahalaya (which falls on October 6). So there is still time for business to recover,” Suresh Malhotra, the owner of Kashmir Vastralaya, told TOI. But more than the Durga Puja, the apparel store owners of the city are banking on the wedding season to make up for the dip in their sales. “Last year, there was a cap on the number of attendees at a wedding. So, there was not much of a business. But this year, there is no cap on the number of attendees for the time being and bulk orders have already started coming in,” another Upper Bazar based cloth merchant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cloth-merchants-eye-profits-despite-rising-infection-rate/articleshow/86737781.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||As cases rise, health experts in J’khand sound Puja alert||Ranchi: With active cases of the Covid-19 infection in Jharkhand showing an upward trend in the past week touching the three-digit mark, health experts have warned that the rise is a result of negligence and people should be vigilant enough to treat this surge as an early warning of a third wave. Talking to TOI, public health expert and assistant professor of community medicine at Rajendra Institute of Medicine Sciences, Dr Dewesh Kumar said: “People have become negligent as they think that Covid-19 has ended but they do not know the reality yet. People have forgotten Covid-appropriate behaviour and are not following social-distancing norms. Apart from that, mask compliance has gone down among public and crowds are thronging the markets.” Dr Kumar added that with Durga Puja approaching, people who haven’t been able to celebrate it for the last two years are thinking that they can do whatever they feel like. “I have been observing that people are thronging the markets without following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Apart from that opening of schools has also contributed to the spread and we need to ensure that stringent protocols are implemented on school campuses,” said Dr Kumar. According to health department records, the number of active cases in Jharkhand reached 97 on October 2 from 50 on September 28 which shows that the infection graph which was on a decline for the last four months, is rising. Critical care expert at RIMS, Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya, said: “We need to ensure that people are taking precautions and should avoid gatherings, congregations and should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour as the virus mutates. People should be careful.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/as-cases-rise-health-experts-in-jkhand-sound-puja-alert/articleshow/86737842.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Vaccinators face stiff hesitancy from residents of Palamu village||Daltonganj: The residents of Orya village under Lesliganj police station in Palamu district have refused to take the Covid-19 vaccine for a variety of reasons, which range from common cough and cold to enlarged hydrocele, despite the authorities trying their best to convince them, district epidemiologist Dr Anup Kumar Singh said on Sunday. The village, located around 28km away from Daltonganj, has a total of 128 eligible beneficiaries. The district health department has been conducting a vaccination drive in the village and not a single beneficiary has turned up to take the jab. Orya ANM Kumari Poonam Verma said, “These beneficiaries have given a variety of excuses for not taking the jab. The most common excuse is that they are suffering from cough and cold or they are menstruating or they have taken a few injections or they have enlarged hydrocele.” As an example, Verma pointed towards a woman who was washing clothes near the session site and said that they have been asking to get the vaccine but the woman has not made up her mind. Singh said he and one health worker named Nilesh went to at least half a dozen houses but people were indifferent towards the vaccination drive. Najeeban Bibi, who is in her 20s, said she has not taken the jab and is neither interested in it. In sharp contrast, another session site at Jaitu Kharn Anganwadi centre under Lesliganj police station has recorded a good turnout of beneficiaries. The people are enthusiastically lining up to take the jabs. Officials here are, however, battling issues of a different kind as those who are turning up for their second dose aren’t able to tell the name of the vaccine that they took before. For example, a woman named Shakuntla said that she has no idea about the name of the vaccine that she took. She wasn’t even aware about the phone number registered as she claimed that she took the first dose with the help of another villager’s phone. Singh said he has directed the ANM at Jaitu Kharn Phool Kumari, to find out her date and the name of the vaccine before giving her the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vaccinators-face-stiff-hesitancy-from-residents-of-palamu-village/articleshow/86737725.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In the past five days, 21 new cases have been reported in the urban circle, including nine on Saturday. Out of these, seven are from Mango, while Baridih and Bistupur reported one case each respectively. "The families infected in the past few days are the locals who contracted the virus in the city," said additional chief medical officer Sahir Pal. Contact tracing is underway to identify people who came in contact with the infected families in Mango. The gradual increase in the positive numbers has pushed the total count of Covid-19 cases to 51,902. 50,825 people have recovered and 1,058 died so far. At present, nine people are undergoing treatment. The first Covid-19 positive case was reported in the district on May 12, 2020, while the first death on July 4, 2020. Dhalbhum SDM Sandeep Kumar Meena said the administration aims to provide Covid-19 vaccination to maximum number of people to minimise the threat. "With Durga Puja around, people who have not taken the first dose so far should take the vaccination at the earliest as it would minimise the risk," said Kumar, who is also in charge of the district vaccination cell. The beneficiaries, waiting for the second dose, should take it on schedule, SDM added. In the rural areas, 121 vaccination centres and in urban circle, 21 centres were operational on Sunday. "Along with the thrust on the vaccination, mask-checking drive will be launched to ensure people follow Covid-19 guidelines," Pal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/admin-on-alert-over-spurt-in-covid-19-cases-in-east-singhbhum/articleshow/86737568.cms||---

The campaign, which will be held till November 14, is part of the National Legal Services Authority’s (NALSA) pan-India awareness programme. The scheme is devised to empower people, particularly those living in rural, tribal and remote areas. DLSA plans to educate people on NALSA schemes, litigation and pre-litigation mediation, human trafficking and rehabilitation of children affected by drug abuse. It will also hold special camps for Birsa Munda Central jail inmates and the senior citizens and collect applications for free legal aid. The drive aims to cover every village in the district. Earlier in the day, the judicial and district administration officers, Ranchi District Bar Association members and DLSA mediators along with a panel of lawyers took out a ‘prabhat pheri’ from the multi-purpose hall on Kanke road to the district court. DLSA secretary Kamla Kumari said that the para-legal volunteers distributed pamphlets and leaflets related to legal rights among the people, including vegetable sellers, building construction workers, auto drivers and hygiene workers, along the way. The participants, including judicial commissioner Navneet Kumar, garlanded a statue of Mahatma Gandhi at the civil court before flagging off the legal awareness van for Kanke. Additional judicial commissioner-1 S K Sashi, principal judge at family court Rashikesh Kumar, chief judicial magistrate Binay Kumar Lal and other judges were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dlsa-starts-mass-awareness-drive-on-legal-rights/articleshow/86737376.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Health department officials said they have started fulfilling academic as well as infrastructural requirements for NMC’s recognition. Talking to TOI, additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said, “We are happy with NMC’s approval to allow admission to 100 medical seats at the Phulo Jhano Medical College in Dumka. We are hopeful that we will get the nod for admission at our two new medical colleges at Palamu and Hazaribag.” On the shortcomings which led NMC to halt admissions since last year, the additional secretary of the state health department, Alok Trivedi, said, “All infrastructural shortcomings which were highlighted by the NMC assessment team have been almost fulfilled. Currently, 98% of the total infrastructural work at the Hazaribag college and 96% at the Palamu college have been completed. We only have to fulfil the academic shortcomings and we are already working to sort that out on a war footing.” He further said, “We have already advertised positions to recruit assistant professors through the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) a month ago and that is being done on priority. Besides, we have also started recruitment of faculty members, including assistant professors, associate professors and professors for the new medical colleges on a contract basis. The contractual positions have been made lucrative as we have to get them filled up as soon as possible.” In its advertisements for hiring faculty members, the health department has published an advertisement saying the positions will be filled up on a contract basis for two years and senior residents who are working in the state health services, retired teachers of medical colleges and specialist doctors from state hospitals will be eligible for the posts. Trivedi said, “We are offering a monthly salary of Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 2 Lakh for the positions of professors and associate professors to fill up the lack of senior faculty members in the new medical colleges. We have also removed the age bar for doctors of the state health services so that they can apply for the positions.” On the NMC assessment teams’ expected visit to Palamu and Hazaribag colleges for reassessments, Trivedi said inspection of the Hazaribag college has already been completed and the department is awaiting a visit to the Palamu college. “We have requested NMC for an inspection of the medical college in Palamu and if a team does not visit by October 11, the state health department will submit a report to the regulatory body for the required approval,” he added. Meanwhile, sources in the health department said retired faculty members have expressed willingness when they were approached to participate in the recruitment process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-expects-admission-nod-to-hbag-palamu-med-colleges/articleshow/86737885.cms||Gaurav Pandey

This novel approach to make the poor and needy, women facing sexual assault, harassment or domestic violence, physically challenged, acid attack survivors and destitutes aware about availability of completely free quality legal assistance is a milestone decision in the 25-year existence of National Legal Services Authority (Nalsa). Justice Lalit said Nalsa has held talks with Bar Council of India (BCI), which grants recognition to law colleges and prescribes the curriculum for law courses, and that BCI has agreed to make changes in the curriculum that would enable the final year law students to act as paralegal volunteers for at least six months. There are 530 law colleges recognised by the BCI. If each law college has 50 seats in the final year course, the 530 colleges would provide a healthy paralegal force of over 26,000 students, who can fan out to the hinterland and educate almost the entire rural population in a matter of months about their right to free legal aid. Justice Lalit said Nalsa, in collaboration with state, district, taluk legal aid services authorities, paralegal volunteers and NGOs, would try to reach out each of the 6.65 lakh villages at least three times during the 45-day long campaign, which would end on the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru on November 14. The Nalsa chairman also said the quality of legal aid has been a sore point for the last 25 years and promised a substantial improvement in the next few years. Litigants in just 1% of three crore pending cases avail free legal aid. He said it required established lawyers and designated senior advocates in the Supreme Court and the high courts to do three cases of poor litigants pro bono every year to make a huge difference to the quality of free legal aid available to the marginalised section. Even President Ram Nath Kovid, while launching Nalsa’s 45-day long pan-India awareness programme on Saturday, agreed with Justice Lalit and advised the senior advocates to give back to the society by taking up more and more cases pro bono.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/like-docs-law-interns-also-to-do-rural-service-nalsa-chief/articleshow/86742696.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||India||Turf-conscious parties spoil Sonia’s push for opposition unity||NEW DELHI: The fledgling attempts at creating opposition unity on the ground in the light of discussions that were initiated by Congress president Sonia Gandhi have proved a nonstarter, with the turf-specific fault lines proving too strong to overcome, at least for now. The joint protests that were scheduled between September 20-30 have only been held in Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Telangana and Bihar where Congress and other dominant parties are either in opposition or in the ruling alliance. Otherwise, the protests have largely been a Congress affair. The joint protests against BJP were announced by a declaration after a meeting of the opposition parties chaired by Sonia Gandhi on August 20. The idea behind holding joint protests was to translate the anti-BJP consensus at the leadership level to a grassroots alliance, which would prepare the parties for a possible seat-sharing in states for 2024 Lok Sabha elections. An ambitious intent, the protests were being watched for what happens in places where Congress and some regional parties have been at loggerheads for a long time like in West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. West Bengal has proved the biggest dampener as Mamata Banerjee‘s participation in Sonia Gandhi’s meeting has not stopped her from being at her confrontational best with Congress and the Left. Nor have rivals Congress and CPM come together in Kerala. While JD(S) participated in the opposition meeting, it was not part of the Congress-Left protests in Karnataka and held separate shows, sources said. The opposition had announced that while SP leader Akhilesh Yadav could not attend the meeting, he had given his nod to the joint declaration. However, SP and Congress have been without any coordination in Lucknow and there has been little hope of their joining hands. In fact, given the assembly elections in coming months, Akhilesh has been at pains to underline that he will have no tie-up with Congress. Realising the tenuousness of the unity attempts and the sensitivities of “allies” about their political turfs, AICC general secretary incharge of organisation K C Venugopal had shot off a letter to all Congress state units underlining the schedule of the protest while urging them to take the initiative to coordinate with state units of like-minded parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/turf-conscious-parties-spoil-sonias-push-for-opposition-unity/articleshow/86742745.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

After the chief minister had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the central government had on Saturday allowed the Punjab government to undertake paddy procurement from October 3, instead of October 11. The CM, while interacting with farmers, commission agents and labourers at the grain market, said all necessary arrangements for smooth and seamless procurement, lifting and storage of paddy had been made by the state government. At the same time, the CM urged farmers to bring their produce within specifications of moisture content laid by the central government. Channi said every single grain of the farmers’ produce would be lifted from the market and strict adherence to the prescribed norms of timely payment to the farmers would be ensured. He also directed secretary (food and civil supplies) Gurkirat Kirpal Singh to ensure smooth and hassle-free procurement of paddy during the ongoing season. Meanwhile, Punjab food minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and industry minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli were in Khanna in Ludhiana on Sunday to start paddy procurement from Asia’s biggest grain market. The ministers okayed the arrangements and passed orders for procuring "every single grain and lifting it without any delay". All the procurement agencies, mandi board officers, and district administrations received instructions to make timely payment to the farmers. The ministers also checked the arrangements for protecting the produce from rain, and whether the procurement centres had electricity, sheds, potable water, and equipment for quality tests or not. The government claims that paddy was cultivated on about 2.57 lakh hectares in Ludhiana and the district’s arrival estimate is 17.53 lakh metric tonnes of the crop. Apart from 108 regular grain markets, Ludhiana district has 94 temporary yards and 203 mandi yards in the rice mills to decongest the procurement centres under Covid protocol. The state government targets lifting the crop within 48 hours of procurement. Thanking chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and making him call off the late-start plan, the ministers promised to deliver hassle-free procurement, prompt lifting, and timely payment, besides catching bogus billers. They also met the arhtiyas (commission agents). Zila Parishad chairman Yadwinder Singh Jandiali, Khanna Arhtiya Association president Harbans Singh Rosha, and Khanna market committee chairman Gurdeep Singh Rasulra were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-cm-launches-procurement-of-paddy-at-morinda-grain-market/articleshow/86741308.cms||---

Under the mission, the public sector undertaking (PSU) will get its first four-tonne Ku-band communication satellite Gsat-24 built by Isro and have it launched by Ariane-5 rocket, belonging to French company Arianespace. Thereafter, NSIL will lease the satellite capacity to Tata Sky. As part of the reforms initiative, NSIL, which was set up in March 2019, has been given the mandate to undertake operational satellite missions on a “demand-driven” model, wherein the PSU has the responsibility to build, launch, own & operate a satellite and provide services to its committed customers. Gsat-24 satellite, too, will be owned and operated by NSIL, which will fund the entire mission. “The entire satellite capacity on-board Gsat-24 will be leased to its committed customer M/s Tata Sky for meeting their DTH application needs,” NSIL said in a statement issued on Friday. NSIL is planning to launch Gsat-24 during the first quarter of 2022, it said. Recently, Isro chairman K Sivan said NSIL would acquire three communication satellites — Gsat-20, Gsat-22 and Gsat-24 — made by the space agency. Earlier this year, NSIL had kicked off its first dedicated launch of PSLV-C51, which successfully lifted off Brazil’s Amazonia-1 satellite and 18 co-passenger satellites from Sriharikota on February 28. Amazonia-1 was the optical earth observation satellite of National Institute for Space Research (INPE) of the south American country. Besides these projects, NSIL, led by CMD Durairaj Radhakrishnan, is also involved in contracting Isro’s yet-to-be-launched Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV or mini-PSLV) project and other rockets. The Department of Space (DoS) plans to realise entirely-built rockets — PSLV, GSLV-Mk III and SSLV — from Indian industry partners. NSIL has recently received three bids from HAL-L&T, BEL-Adani-BEML and BHEL in response to the request for proposal floated by it for end-to-end production of PSLV and is currently going through the techno-commercial evaluation of the bids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/isro-commercial-arm-nsil-to-launch-first-demand-driven-satellite-will-lease-it-to-tata-sky/articleshow/86742766.cms||Surendra Singh
---||Goa||Trevor Fernandes: The hockey star from Zanzibar who won many Indian hearts||In 1965, when the Pakistan national hockey team embarked on a tour of East Africa for a series of friendlies, they had a stopover in Zanzibar. Pakistan were a strong side and took control of the match no sooner Zanzibar’s initial enthusiasm had died down in the first five minutes. The Asian champions took the lead too, but the hosts soon levelled scores at the Mao Tse Tung Stadium. The equaliser was scored by a 15-year-old Goan school boy, Trevor Fernandes. Having seen him make an impressive debut against Dar es Salaam, the home fans were not alarmed. Pakistan eventually won the clash 2-1, but it was the “promising, bright forward” – in the words of local newspapers -- who grabbed all the attention. Trevor was a champion athlete in school at St Joseph’s Convent. He played football too; represented Kikwajuni Sports Club in the first division, but hockey came naturally. His father, Reginald Theoten, was the national coach, while brother Mervyn and sister Beryl both played for Zanzibar. The Fernandes family moved to Goa in March 1967 and Trevor, who studied at St Anthony’s High School in Monte de Guirim, worked his magic again. “When I came to Goa, it was not just hockey for me, but football too,” says Trevor, who played football for Academica, a top-division team, and hockey for Dempo-Souza. Despite the limited opportunities and poor infrastructure, Trevor stayed focused and excelled wherever he played. At first it was with St Anthony’s where he helped them win the Inter-Schools tournament. As goals started to flow from his stick and everyone took notice, it was only a matter of time before he was picked for the All India Schools XI team. His journey had just begun. “The infrastructure for hockey was quite poor. There was absolutely nothing; no facilities, no coaching. Whenever we went for nationals, Goa were in the bottom half,” says Trevor, who has his house in Calangute, but now settled in United States. It was while at St Joseph’s College in Bangalore, now Bengaluru, that Trevor’s career really took off. At the Inter-Zonal league finals of the All-India Inter-University hockey tournament for example, Trevor scored the first six goals as Bangalore University demolished Benaras Hindu University (East zone champions) 7-0. In the final, Trevor was at it again, this time scoring the only goal against Bombay University to deliver his team the title. The star act meant Trevor was the top pick for All-India Universities team that toured Australia in 1971. On that tour, he scored 15 goals in five matches to emerge as the highest goal-scorer. Wherever he played, goals followed. Trevor soon broke into the India team for the Pesta Sukan regional hockey championship in Singapore. He also played Test matches against Great Britain, all this when he had not even turned 21. “Blessed with an athletic body and possessing quick reflexes, Trevor's game is a connoisseurs delight,” Sportsweek, a popular sports magazine in the seventies, wrote in one of its reports. It wasn’t hyperbole. Trevor was a genuine talent and one of India’s leading centre-forwards during his school and college days. However, he was unlucky not to make it to the World Cup (1971, Barcelona) and Olympics (1972, Munich) with the Indian hockey team. “In 1972, I picked up an injury during the Olympics camp and was not selected. I was confident that I would eventually make it,” says Trevor. Life, however, had different plans for him. His hockey career was temporarily interrupted when, as a BSc graduate, he moved to the United States for further studies. “I could have achieved a lot more in hockey, if I had stayed in India,” feels Trevor. “I was still very young. Goan families emphasised on education and mine was not an exception.” When he landed in Seattle, United States, it was football that he embraced. There was no hockey in sight, so along with his brothers Mervyn and Hector, he stuck to football. “There was no hockey here, so we got together and formed a club team with those who played the game in their own countries, mostly Ireland and Scotland,” says Trevor. That proved to be a blessing in disguise. When Los Angeles hosted the Olympics in 1984, United States had a hockey team of its own. Trevor, at 33, was the oldest, and without a doubt, their most influential player. Guess who United States played in their opening game? India. It ended in a 1-5 defeat against the mighty defending champions, but for Trevor, being at the Olympics was a dream come true.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/trevor-fernandes-the-hockey-star-from-zanzibar-who-won-many-indian-hearts/articleshow/86738398.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Chandigarh||No paddy procurement in many districts, cops man Punjab borders||PATIALA: The procurement of paddy began on Sunday but, in many districts, the entire arrived crop was not procured from the grain markets. The mandi board and police man the state’s borders round-the-clock for rogue trucks. The district has recorded 11,470 metric tonnes of paddy arrival, so far. This includes 4,197 MT that arrived on Sunday. The government procured 4,399 MT by this day, while the entire news stock of 10,788 MT Basmati was procured by private agencies.  In Ropar, where chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi started the procurement process on Sunday, the entire arrived 1,867 MT crop was procured, while of the 36,627 MT that reached Fatehgarh Sahib, 4,870 MT was procured. The Patiala checkpoints are at seven places along the inter-state border or major influx routes of illegal paddy.  District mandi officer Patiala Ajaypal Singh said: "The spots include Shambu, Dakala, Patran, and Devigarh. Our staff of 145 includes 32 officers and our job is to stop the paddy trucks from entering Punjab. The Shambu barrier in Patiala is a high-vigil sector." Patiala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sandeep Garg said: "We have 200 cops on the borders to stop the paddy trucks from entering Punjab." Meanwhile, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi reached Morinda grain market in Ropar district on Sunday to launch paddy procurement operations for kharif marketing season (KMS) across the state. After the chief minister had met PM Narendra Modi, the central government had on Saturday allowed the Punjab government to undertake paddy procurement from October 3, instead of October 11. The CM, while interacting with farmers, commission agents and labourers at the grain market, said all necessary arrangements for smooth and seamless procurement, lifting and storage of paddy had been made by the state government.  At the same time, the CM urged farmers to bring their produce within specifications of moisture content laid by the central government. Channi said every single grain of the farmers’ produce would be lifted from the market and strict adherence to the prescribed norms of timely payment to the farmers would be ensured. He also directed secretary (food and civil supplies) Gurkirat Kirpal Singh to ensure smooth and hassle-free procurement of paddy during the ongoing season. Meanwhile, Punjab food minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and industry minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli were in Khanna in Ludhiana on Sunday to start paddy procurement from Asia’s biggest grain market. The ministers okayed the arrangements and passed orders for procuring "every single grain and lifting it without any delay". All the procurement agencies, mandi board officers, and district administrations received instructions to make timely payment to the farmers. The ministers also checked the arrangements for protecting the produce from rain, and whether the procurement centres had electricity, sheds, potable water, and equipment for quality tests or not. The government claims that paddy was cultivated on about 2.57 lakh hectares in Ludhiana and the district’s arrival estimate is 17.53 lakh metric tonnes of the crop. Apart from 108 regular grain markets, Ludhiana district has 94 temporary yards and 203 mandi yards in the rice mills to decongest the procurement centres under Covid protocol. Hooda slams Khattar for ‘jumlebaazi ’Former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday took on the Manohar Khattar-led government over paddy procurement, and claimed that the announcement to start procurement was yet another ‘jumla’ of the BJP government. He also slammed the government for repeatedly changing the dates for starting procurement. To ascertain the ground realities, Hooda visited grain markets at Ladwa, Pipli and Thanesar, where farmers and arhtiyas alleged that the procurement of paddy has not started in the markets yet. Flying squads to check illegal arrivalsFor checking the recycling of paddy and bogus billing, Punjab food minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Sunday directed all the deputy commissioners to make flying squads to raid the market committees and catch the illegal stock coming in from the other states. Every flying squad will have a representative each of the deputy commissioner, mandi board, excise and taxation wing, and police department. The squad will give a daily report to the DC concerned about the impounding of trucks and slealing of warehouses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-paddy-procurement-in-many-districts-cops-man-punjab-borders/articleshow/86740578.cms||---
---||India||Dal Lake’s Char Chinar to get back lost glory||NEW DELHI: Char Chinar, the iconic tourist spot in the middle of Dal Lake in Srinagar, is set to regain its glory that had somewhat faded in the wake of the decay of three of the four majestic Chinar trees from which the island got its name. The Jammu & Kashmir administration has decided to translocate three fully-grown Chinar trees from elsewhere to the very spots on the island where the decayed trees once stood in the ‘green’ of health. The translocated trees, which have been identified by the state forest department and will be of the same height as the single intact tree, are expected to be translocated sometime in December 2021 or January 2022 as weather conditions would be ideal at the time. The restoration of the island with Char Chinar — a famed backdrop of numerous films shot in Kashmir — will attract the locals and tourists who can once again enjoy a good view of the surrounding lake and mountains in shade of the four trees, as they break their ‘shikara’ ride on Dal for a brief stopover on the island. Sources told TOI that J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha was particularly keen on restoring the ‘Char Chinari’ garden — created by Murad Baksh, brother of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb — to its original glory and has held a series of meetings with forest department officials over the past year to discuss a successful way to do so. This is because past efforts to save the decaying Chinar trees have failed. In fact, an attempt in 2019 to revive the tourist spot by planting Chinar saplings also did not make much headway as to ring true to the name ‘Char Chinar’, the island would have to have four Chinar trees of the same height and girth. The effort this time is to do the translocation scientifically. The forest department was asked to test the soil on the island so that the reasons for decaying of the trees could be identified and conditions created to ensure that the translocated trees survive and flourish. J&K has been receiving a swarm of tourists this year, with September recording the highest arrivals at 12.82 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dal-lakes-char-chinar-to-get-back-lost-glory/articleshow/86742794.cms||Bharti Jain
---||Goa||Parking facility in 30 days at Dona Paula jetty, Goa govt tells HC||PANAJI: The government will make its parking facility for tourist vehicles visiting Dona Paula jetty, accessible within a month, it has assured the high court of Bombay at Goa. Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court that within four weeks, the entry as well as exit to the parking facility will be made accessible by removing all obstructions. The petitioners submitted to the court that taxpayers’ money has been spent on the parking facility, but it has no entry and exit. Nine months ago, the state government stated that 90% of the parking facility is ready and that fixing of the gates will be done soon. Despite the high court directing the government to use the land acquired for parking in Dona Paula for the same purpose, vehicles ferrying tourists to Dona Paula jetty continue to park along the road margins on the way to the jetty and Raj Bhavan causing chaos and nuisance to residents in the area. Affected residents of Dona Paula knocked on the doors of the high court in 2019 seeking immediate creation of parking and toilet facilities in the acquired land and seeking orders refraining the government from using the land for other purposes. The residents till date have succeeded in getting the government to axe plans of construction of a restaurant/hotel on the acquired land. The residents had opposed the tourism department’s construction of the proposed 120-room hotel and restaurant in the past. Between 2015 and 2018, a small portion of the land was made available for parking tourist vehicles. Since December 2018, the area has been fenced, thereby making parking space out of bounds for visitors. The chaos at the Dona Paula jetty is being caused due to the lack of parking spaces, the traffic police had earlier submitted to the court. Further, they maintained that it is not feasible to deploy more personnel at the junction. In a letter to the director of tourism, traffic police had requested to provide parking facilities in the acquired land on a “priority basis”. The haphazard parking around NIO circle and also on the road leading to Raj Bhavan cause great inconvenience to the movement of convoys during the sudden visits of VIPs to Raj Bhavan, the traffic police had stated in their letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parking-facility-in-30-days-at-dona-paula-jetty-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/86738454.cms||---

---||Goa||Environment damage review at Ayurveda college site begins||PANAJI: The process to assess the damage caused to the environment at the site of the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) at Dhargalim has begun. The move comes following the finding that construction work on the project commenced without environment clearance. The Goa State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (Goa-SIEAA) has sought a detailed report on any adverse impact caused to the air quality, ground water, soil, and flora and fauna at the project site. The institute, under the ministry of Ayush, is coming up on an area of 2 lakh sqm. The land was originally acquired by the state government for a sports city. “The following terms of reference are proposed to conduct an environment impact assessment in order to ascertain the damage to the environment if any due to the commencement of work prior to obtaining environment clearance. Assessment of flora and fauna in the vicinity of the site and impact on the same due to the construction activity,” the Goa-SIEAA stated. The foundation stone for the All India Institute of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy was laid in November 2018. “Assessment of impact on air quality as well as flora and fauna due to non-compliance to the guidelines of the central pollution control board for dust mitigation during construction phase. Assessment of damage to ground water, soil due to non-installation of sewage system for treatment of sewage during construction phase”, have been set as the other terms of reference by the Goa-SEIAA for the environment assessment. Damage caused due to non-preservation of top soil at site and due to non use of storm water as per the central ground water board and bureau of Indian standards guidelines should also be assessed, the authority said. Of the total land area of 2 lakh sqm earmarked for the AIIA, 47,500 sqm will be the built-up area. The first phase of the national institute will be built at a cost of almost Rs 300 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/environ-damage-review-at-ayurveda-college-site-begins/articleshow/86738933.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: 77% of 21L traffic violators in Maharashtra have not paid fines||NAGPUR: Of the 21,00,983 motorists who were issued e-challans for violation of various traffic rules across the state between March 1, 2021 and August 31, 2021, only 4,84,739 or a little over 23% have paid the fine, reveals data from 45 city and rural police station jurisdictions compiled by the office of director general of police in Mumbai. The data further revealed that the cumulative unpaid fine amount in the state is to the tune of over Rs102 crore. The respective traffic police departments in every city and rural areas had launched a special drive between September 13 and 25 and also organized a Lok Adalat recently to recover the dues. However, only 23% of the violators paid the fine during the drive. The police have recovered Rs22.77 crore against 4,84,739 challans, but they are struggling to recover pending fine of over Rs79.61 crore from 16.16 lakh motorists. The highest amount of fine was levied in Mumbai with Rs35.39 crore penalty against 9,37,755 challans issued. Of this, around Rs5.91 crore was recovered against 1,50,817 pending challans. The unpaid fine still stands at Rs29.49 crore, to be recovered from 7,86,938 violators. Similar is the situation in Pune city police commissionerate jurisdiction. Against a pending fine amount of Rs26.13 crore (against 5,46,973 challans), the police there have managed to recover only Rs6.33 crore (from 1,43,249 challans issued). Even after the special drive, Rs19.80 crore fine is yet to be recovered from 4,03,724 violators in Pune. In Nagpur city, over Rs3.68 crore fine was slapped by way of 53,143 e-challans. However, the city traffic police managed to recover only Rs85.68 lakh from 18,085 motorists. Moreover, most of the violators from Nagpur city ignored the special Lok Adalat organized on September 25. Only 545 violators used the opportunity and settled their pending challans and paid a cumulative fine of over Rs3 lakh. Penal action taken across the stateSimilarly, of the total Rs11.62 lakh due from 3,109 motorists, Nagpur rural police managed to recover Rs3.34 lakh from 381 violators. Traffic experts expressed concern over pending e-challan fines. They stressed the need for enforcing stringent measures like suspension of driving licence of the violators and 100% recovery of penalty. Though the data suggests that the number of e-challans issued to motorists for violating various provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act across Maharashtra has increased manifold, the penal action has failed to bring discipline on roads. The reason is lack of deterrent action against the violators defaulting on traffic fines, say the experts.

---||Goa||Panaji looks at December 13 to take on ‘smart’ status||PANAJI: Trailing behind in the implementation of the Smart City Mission, Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Ltd (IPSCDL) has decided to push ahead with the Goa intelligent city management system (GICMS). The Rs 180 crore project, which had been languishing because of Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate’s criticism, is now likely to be completed by November 30 and will go live on December 13, former chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s birthday. As part of the GICMS project, an integrated command and control centre (ICCC) has been setup at the IT hub, Altinho, for complete surveillance not just in Panaji but right up to Old Goa, Corlim, Porvorim and other entry points of the capital. As part of GICMS, sensors and cameras will keep track of traffic violations, crime and theft, littering, solid waste management, pollution emissions, and smart city lighting, while also offering WiFi hotspots at around 500 locations in Panaji. L&T, which won the GICMS contract in June 2018, has already installed 100 smart CCTV cameras out of the 338 cameras that were planned to be installed. The high resolution advanced cameras have facial and number plate recognition capabilities, and can automatically generate traffic violation challans. “Hopefully, by this December 13, we are looking to roll it out, but by November 30, the entire system will be ready,” said Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) mayor and Panaji MLA’s son Rohit. “As of now, we are still laying a lot of the groundwork, the cabling and everything.” Ironically, Monserrate had objected to the installation of cameras and had demanded that the project be scrapped and the money spent on improving the roads, water supply and basic amenities. Currently, one of the biggest hurdles for the GICMS project is delay in permissions. L&T has found that permission for digging, road cutting and laying of key fibre cables is difficult to obtain, and the process has only been complicated due to the other unmarked utility lines laid along the roads. Implementation of the ICCC is a key criteria for the Smart City Mission, and the Centre has made it clear that the project has to be completed for more funds to be disbursed. “We don’t have a choice. We need to implement the ICCC and we plan to go live as soon as possible,” said chief executive officer of IPSCDL Ravi Dhawan while addressing CCP councillors, who were given a glimpse into the functioning of GICMS and ICCC. L&T has also started a smart parking project at the EDC Patto complex, where 1,000 sensors are being installed at parking slots. The sensors will identify the number of vacant slots which will be displayed on a large LED board at entry points. Online payment options have also been introduced for pay parking. Representatives from Goa police, traffic cell, transport department, CCP, disaster management cell and other emergency services will be present at the ICCC at the IT hub.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panaji-looks-at-dec-13-to-take-on-smart-status/articleshow/86738952.cms||---

Nearly 4.7 lakh doses were administered every day on average during September. According to the department of health and family welfare, more than 4.9 crore people in Karnataka are eligible for vaccination. This means the state needs more than 9.9 crore doses to fully inoculate them. As of 4pm Sunday, the state had administered 5.7 crore doses, of them more than 5 crore doses are Covishield and 66 lakh Covaxin. State fully jabbed 35% of its eligible population; over 1 crore yet to get first dose  More than 3.9 crore people — 79.2% of the eligible population — have received one dose, while more than 1.7 crore have been fully inoculated. As on date, the state has fully vaccinated 35% of the eligible population. This leaves more than 1 crore people among those eligible yet to be vaccinated even with one dose, while nearly 2.2 crore will be due for the second jab. The state would require 4.2 crore doses to administer two jabs to all of them. If not for the huge gap between the two doses of Covishield — which accounts for 88% of all doses administered in the state so far — the state has the capacity to cover the population with both doses. Health commissioner Dr KV Trilok Chandra said: “There’s a lot of discussion about reducing the gap between doses. Regardless of that, we will complete 100% first-dose coverage and around 80% of the people would have got two doses by December-end. If the gap is reduced soon, more people would get both doses.” Stating there were no supply issues now, Chandra said the state was set to receive more than 1.3 crore doses in October. Of the 5.7 crore doses the state has administered so far, around 44% or 2.5 crore doses were administered in just two months: August saw 1.2 crore doses and September bettering it with 1.4 crore doses. While the issue of some groups, including healthcare workers, not being covered completely may affect the state’s target, a health official said: “Given that vaccination is voluntary, there will be some people who may choose to not get the vaccine. We have had very good response and our target is to ensure all those eligible get it at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/ktaka-likely-to-jab-100-target-with-1-dose-by-dec/articleshow/86750591.cms||Chethan Kumar

---||Mysuru||Covid-19: Karnataka likely to jab 100% target with 1 dose by December||BENGALURU: Karnataka is likely to achieve 100% coverage of the eligible population with one dose and fully inoculate at least 80% of them by December end if the current pace of vaccination against Covid-19 continues in the coming weeks. Nearly 4.7 lakh doses were administered every day on average during September. According to the department of health and family welfare, more than 4.9 crore people in Karnataka are eligible for vaccination. This means the state needs more than 9.9 crore doses to fully inoculate them. As of 4pm Sunday, the state had administered 5.7 crore doses, of them more than 5 crore doses are Covishield and 66 lakh Covaxin. State fully jabbed 35% of its eligible population; over 1 crore yet to get first dose  More than 3.9 crore people — 79.2% of the eligible population — have received one dose, while more than 1.7 crore have been fully inoculated. As on date, the state has fully vaccinated 35% of the eligible population. This leaves more than 1 crore people among those eligible yet to be vaccinated even with one dose, while nearly 2.2 crore will be due for the second jab. The state would require 4.2 crore doses to administer two jabs to all of them. If not for the huge gap between the two doses of Covishield — which accounts for 88% of all doses administered in the state so far — the state has the capacity to cover the population with both doses. Health commissioner Dr KV Trilok Chandra said: “There’s a lot of discussion about reducing the gap between doses. Regardless of that, we will complete 100% first-dose coverage and around 80% of the people would have got two doses by December-end. If the gap is reduced soon, more people would get both doses.” Stating there were no supply issues now, Chandra said the state was set to receive more than 1.3 crore doses in October. Of the 5.7 crore doses the state has administered so far, around 44% or 2.5 crore doses were administered in just two months: August saw 1.2 crore doses and September bettering it with 1.4 crore doses. While the issue of some groups, including healthcare workers, not being covered completely may affect the state’s target, a health official said: “Given that vaccination is voluntary, there will be some people who may choose to not get the vaccine.

It’s less than the construction area. On the concluding day of the three-day ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari inaugurated city’s natural asset map and gave an assurance to the citizens that the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will take forward all the learnings from these activities undertaken by Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) and create awareness of conservation of biodiversity among the citizens. As per the copy of the natural asset map available with TOI, the city’s total area is 217 sq. km. The natural asset area is 94.53 sq. km which comes to 43.55% of the total area of the city. The scrub area accounts for the highest total natural asset area. It’s 39.43 sq. km (18.17%) followed by crop land — 14.45 sq. km (6.66%), forest — 12.21 sq. km (5.63%), open space — 9.3 sq. km (4.29%), tree patches — 7.66 sq. km (3.53%), parks — 3.54 sq. km (1.63%), ponds and lakes — 2.77 sq. km (1.27%), streams — 1.77 sq. km (0.81%), grassland—1.27 sq. km (0.59%), plantation—1.22 sq. km (0.56%), marshes — 0.73 sq. km (0.33%), avenue trees — 0.13 sq. km (0.06%), sand and silt—0.04 sq. km (0.02%) and aquaculture — 0.01 sq. km (0.001%). Therefore, the greenery is 30.17% while 13.38% of the total area accounts for water bodies and open space. Though not specifically mentioned in the natural asset map, it is understood that the remaining area of 122.47 sq. km (56.45%) is construction area. It’s the city’s first-ever natural asset map prepared by the NSSCDCL under ‘accelerating climate action through the promotion of Urban Low Emission Development Strategies (Urban-LEDS-II) project’ which is funded by the the European Commission and implemented by ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, South Asia and UN-HABITAT. Under the project, NSSCDCL has also initiated the preparation of Local Biodiversity Strategy Action Plan (LBSAP) which will guide and support the city in effective management of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Along with LBSAP preparation, NSSCDCL in association with the NMC’s garden department, ICLEI South Asia, World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and NGO Punarnava Ecological Services has carried out the tree census in the pilot area of Dharampeth and Dhantoli zones. According to the census, there are 12,298 trees of 131 species in the pilot area. Labelling of trees has been completed at Maharajbagh Zoo, Dagdi Park and Lendra Park which falls in the pilot area. Under the URBAN LEDS-II project, NSSCDCL and ICLEI South Asia has also converted Trikoni Park situated at Bidipeth into a Children Centric Climate Resilient Park with design assistance from Another Earthling Studio and implementation from E-pathshala team. The park has been re-designed to raise awareness among children and their care takers about climate change and actions they can take to conserve nature. Interventions such as rain water harvesting, urban farming, plantation of native species, edible landscape, bird and squirrel houses are undertaken in the park. Information boards and tree labels have been placed to promote sustainable lifestyle. Sensory walkway, bicycle track and sand pits have been provided for children and to reclaim the dead spaces of the park. This initiative has been undertaken under the Nurturing Neighborhoods Challenge supported by the Ministry of Home and Urban Affairs. ABOUT THE NATURAL ASSET MAP* Scrub area, crop land, forest, open space, tree patches, parks, ponds and lakes, streams, grasslands, plantation, marshes, avenue trees, sand and silt and aquaculture are known as natural assets of the city * Of the total 217 sq. km area of the city, the natural asset area mapped at 94.53 sq. km (43.55%) * 122.47 sq. km (56.45%) construction area * Mapping of city’s various ecosystems done to prepare natural asset map * Important in sustaining life in the city and crucial step to initiate integration of ecosystem management into urban planning * Also, natural asset mapping identifies, visualizes and determines existing natural resources or assets in a defined geographical area important to the communities * Mapping and evaluating natural assets critical for economic development, public health, safety and aesthetics and a good step towards raising awareness||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/natural-asset-area-43-55-rest-of-nagpur-city-concrete-maze/articleshow/86738874.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The couple was rescued by the cops, who helped them to return home. Namdeo Hatkar, 75, and his wife Tarabai, 70, were found near Laxmi Nagar Chowk last week by alert citizens, who informed Zonal DCP Noorul Hasan. He, in turn, asked senior inspector Shubhangi Deshmukh of Bajaj Nagar police station to look into the issue. At the first instance, a bike-borne patrolling police personnel met the couple, and asked them to accompany him to the police station. However, the couple politely refused, maybe fearing police action. Then, Senior PI Deshmukh went to meet the couple at the spot to convince them to take their help, and avoid more hardship in the city, as they were clueless regarding their return journey. Deshmukh said the Hatkar couple had lost hope of meeting their son after getting lost in the city. “The couple did not seem to have any money in their possession. They knew their son worked at Hingna but had no address or cellphone number to contact him. Exhausted after a brief search, the couple had lost hope of meeting their son and were aimlessly loitering,” Deshmukh said. Deshmukh said that a team of cops then went about helping the couple to relax and provided them food and water. “The couple was taken to the railway station but there were no trains scheduled in the evening. Hence, they were escorted to Ganeshpeth bus stop to send them back home,” she said. Head constable Badkal said the couple had ran out of luck as the last bus too had left. “Bajaj Nagar police team provided the couple refreshments and looked after them. We were preparing to arrange for night shelter and dinner for the couple when another person from Washim too arrived at the bus stop. The couple knew him as he was from their village,” said Badkal. “The man agreed to take care of the elderly citizen and they agreed to stay with him and take the early morning bus to Washim. We left only after handing over some cash, food and water to the couple. We also ensured bus service attendants too would help them,” said the head constable from Bajaj Nagar police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-help-elderly-washim-couple-lost-in-city-get-back-home/articleshow/86739132.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Business||Vedanta to invest $20 billion, eyes PSUs on selloff list||NEW DELHI: Vedanta group chairman Anil Agarwal says his companies are looking to invest around $20 billion in India, including in the privatisation of BPCL, Shipping Corporation and Hindustan Copper. In an interview to TOI on the sidelines of the Dubai Expo, he suggests there is pressure from foreign entities to block manufacturing in India, including through concerns over environment and other issues. Excerpts: What are the companies & sectors that interest you on the disinvestment list?In a democratic country, the government does not run business. Our existing assets can be swept three times and so privatisation is a good move. At today’s market price, the government can get $1 trillion. I think, 20% should be privatisation and the rest should be corporatisation, where public shareholders come in and no one should own more than 10%. A professional board can do phenomenal work. We will evaluate everything, and we are evaluating BPCL, Shipping Corporation and Hindustan Copper, if it comes. If BPCL comes to us, people will be most happy since we are not going to retrench anyone. At the same time, they will have a backward integration in terms of fuel supply from Cairn. The government should sell things on an as-is-where-is basis so that things can be faster. Probably, this month they will tell us when the financial bids have to be submitted and it should happen in the next two-three months. How will you finance it?We have floated a fund for $10 billion and we have received tremendous response from several investors, including some sovereign wealth funds. Funds will never be an issue. You had proposed to delist Vedanta, is it still on the table and how will it help given the concerns?We had a 51% shareholding, which is now 66%. I am very happy that the shareholders are with me and we have no plan to delist the company. What is the plan to tackle debt in future?We have the lowest debt in the corporate sector. We have profits of $7-8 billion this year and debt of around $12 billion, including in the parent company. We have invested almost $50 billion to create assets, which have huge value. We are looking to invest $20 billion to expand our capacity . We have sweet crude and the government is framing a policy for freedom of marketing through self-certification. Your companies have faced a lot of criticism from environmentalists and your Tamil Nadu plant is shut. Why are you always at the centre of such controversies and do they impact your investment?Vedanta is in natural resources and the world does not want India to produce. We have the highest certification from several agencies. When Tuticorin was shut down, we went to the Supreme Court and NGT looked at it and have come up with a clean report. We are a democratic country, people can enter anywhere and ask for stopping production. We have the highest level of ESG (environmental, social and governance) compliance. When the US was growing, people used to say Rockfeller is taking away oil from sand. We can’t depend on exports, which is resulting in money flowing out from India. It is important to speed up forest clearance as time is of essence and we should move to self-certification. If anyone violates the norms, he should face the highest penalty. Are you suggesting a ‘foreign hand’ at play?Always. The world does not want India to produce but be a market. We don’t have to be an import-dependent country. We are very conscious of our responsibility and we have to move forward. There are issues around Videocon bankruptcy, where you are the highest bidder, amid allegations about the whole process. Your bid is just above the reserve price. Your views?Anybody can say anything. The process took two years and it was evaluated by the committee of creditors. We have given equity and have offered Rs 3,000 crore. The SC has said that we have to move forward once it has been approved by the CoC. We offered the highest price. We are very conscious that electronic manufacturing has to come to India. We have full trust in our banks and the judiciary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vedanta-to-invest-20bn-eyes-psus-on-selloff-list/articleshow/86742829.cms||Sidhartha
---||Goa||Public transport fares may be hiked in Goa||PANAJI: Awaiting his turn to ferry passengers in his autorickshaw from Panaji bus stand, Sharfoddin Khan sees only one or two passengers a day. The second wave has been tough on him, but the rising fuel prices threaten to hit him and his fellow rickshaw-wallahs harder than a tsunami. The price of petrol crossed the Rs100-mark in Goa on Saturday putting additional strain on the public transport system. A few months ago, commuters had negotiated for a humbler fare, making the business even more difficult for the likes of Khan. “The fare accumulated from one or two trips doesn’t even cover the petrol cost of the ride. We have been borrowing money from friends to make ends meet. If fuel prices do not decrease, how will we operate the vehicles?” he says. Autorickshaw drivers say that their vehicles operate very differently compared to others as it needs to be balanced with fuel and oil owing to which they end up spending more money. They are not alone in this predicament. The frequently rising fuel prices also seem to be pushing bus operators to the brink of financial devastation. “From March this year till now, there has been an increase of almost Rs 35 in diesel rates. We require anywhere between 40 to 50 litres of diesel per day depending on the routes, owing to which we end up spending almost Rs 2,000 per day on fuel alone. It is very difficult to run a business in a situation such as this,” says Shiva Kambli, president of the All Goa Private Bus Owners’ Association. Majority of the buses are off the road owing to poor footfalls due to the pandemic. The load factor is only seen during peak hours on weekdays. “We are already struggling due to the pandemic. The fuel price rise will further affect the transport sector. If the government doesn’t intervene, we will have no choice but to demand enhancement of bus fares,” Kambli says. Though bus operators did have a fuel subsidy, they have had to manage this expense on their own ever since it was discontinued a few years ago. This, however, hasn’t proved to be a deterrent for taxi operators. “The pandemic has already burned a hole in our pockets and the rise in fuel prices has further set fire to our wallets. There is a huge question mark on our survival. All we ask for from the government is a fuel subsidy that can cover these skyrocketing costs,” says tourist taxi union leader, Laximan ‘Bappa’ Korgaonkar. Even if the transport department decides to play genie, offering subsidies doesn’t automatically resolve the issue of steep fuel prices. With Kadamba Transport Corporation limited (KTC) leading the way by introducing electric vehicles (EVs) in its fleet, the current predicament should ideally serve as an opportunity to revolutionise the public transport sector. Of the 30 EVs with KTC, 25 are currently operational. However, this set of its fleet has not faced the direct impact of the fuel price rise. “The charging station at Margao is currently operational to recharge 30 buses and the additional EVs that are expected to arrive. We have also tendered for 100 mini-bus EVs and plan to have 24 charging stations across the state,” says KTC general manager Sanjay Ghate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/public-transport-fares-may-be-hiked/articleshow/86739153.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Chandigarh||Paddy procurement: Capt attacks Pargat for alleging his collusion with BJP||Chandigarh: Punjab’s former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has lashed out at sports and education minister Pargat Singh for his “irresponsible” statement that he had conspired with BJP to delay paddy procurement in the state. Pargat had levelled these allegations on Saturday and reiterated on Sunday. Reacting sharply to his party colleague from the Congress, Amarinder tweeted on Sunday, “What nonsense? Do you really think the people of Punjab will believe I’d ever collude with @BJP4India to delay procurement? And have you forgotten it affected BJP-led Haryana too? Or are you too naïve to understand these things?” The former chief minister in his subsequent tweet added, “And do you have any proof for these lies? Or are you so irresponsible you believe you can get away with such trash? People of Punjab know me & know I always have & will stand with the farmers. I expect honesty from a former Indian hockey Capt.” The Union ministry of food and public distribution had on September 30 announced to postpone the paddy procurement at the minimum support price (MSP) to October 11 in Punjab and Haryana, whereas it was earlier scheduled to start from October 1. The Union ministry’s announcement was made a day after Capt Amarinder had met Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi and thus Pargat had alleged his connivance with BJP. However, later the central government decided to start the paddy procurement from Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/paddy-procurement-capt-attacks-pargat-for-alleging-his-collusion-with-bjp/articleshow/86741025.cms||---

The victims were waiting at a bus stop on the service road near Satnavari village on the Nagpur-Amravati highway. A woman was also injured in the freak accident. Three medicos were in the car which met with the accident while on its way to Nagpur from Amravati. It's learnt that Dr Ashutosh Tripathi, a Mumbai native, was behind the wheel of the speeding car, with two women riding along. Police said Tripathi lost control of the vehicle which was on top speed. The three medicos had a miraculous escape with mild injuries. After scrambling out of the mangled car with the help of local bystanders, Tripathi tried to revive the victims. Though he was manhandled, Tripathi tried to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to the victims. He, along with the two other medicos, were rescued by Kondhali police of Nagpur rural. The deceased have been identified as Bandu Salwankar (57), his grandson Shaurya Dongre (8) and granddaughter Shaurali (6), and another 15-year-old Chaitali Sonbarse. A 55-year-old woman, Lalita Sonbarse, was injured. Additional police superintendent (addl SP) Rahul Maknikar, who along with SP Vijaykumar Magar visited the spot, said Tripathi lost control of his vehicle after a smaller vehicle abruptly crossed its lane. “Tripathi had to take his vehicle towards the left to avoid dashing a smaller vehicle. In the process, he rammed into the roadside divider before somersaulting twice and crushed the victims waiting for a bus,” Maknikar said. It's learnt that the medicos were heading to Nagpur to meet with an acquaintance whose father had passed away a couple of days ago. Postgraduate students at Panjabrao Deshmukh medical college in Amravati, the medicos reside in the college hostel. Tripathi is studying orthopaedics and his father is a senior judicial official at Bombay high court, it's learnt. Kondhali police of Nagpur rural have registered an offence against Tripathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/somersaulting-car-crushes-3-minors-man/articleshow/86739187.cms||Soumitra Bose

Police personnel nearly gave up their rescue operation after six hours of search yielded no breakthrough about the whereabouts of Pradeep Sagar. It was the beep of a WhatsApp message — ‘I’m stuck here, where are you all?’ — to his friends around 3.30am Sunday that rekindled hope among the rescue personnel, who successfully pulled Pradeep out around 7am on Sunday. Pradeep, who’s from Jewargi taluk of Kalaburagi district and working with Belagavi branch of a bank for the past two years, suffered injuries on his face and bruises on limbs. He has been admitted to a hospital in Gokak and his condition is stable. The mishap occurred when Pradeep and five friends were visiting Gokak Falls during the weekend. It was around 6.30pm that Pradeep took out his phone to click photos of the sunset in the backdrop of the falls and ventured through a rocky terrain to take a selfie. He lost balance and plunged 140ft into the gorge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bgavi-man-falls-into-140ft-gorge-rescued-in-12hrs/articleshow/86741729.cms||Basavaraj Meeshi
---||Bengaluru||NIA court files charges against 2005 IISc attacker||BENGALURU: Sixteen years after two men shot dead an academic participating in a conference at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) campus here, the NIA special court recently framed charges against the lone accused currently in the custody of the authorities, reports Santoshkumar R B. Prof MC Puri of IIT-Delhi was killed on Dec 28, 2005 in IISc in what is said to be the 1st terror attack in Bengaluru. Accused helped Lashkar’s Hamzacarry out IISc terror attack in 2005  Among the eight other accused, Habeeb Miya was the only other accused to be arrested in 2017 and acquitted in June this year for lack of prima facie evidence. Charges were framed against Sabahuddin Ahamad alias Sabha alias Farhan under the IPC, Arms Act, Explosive Substances Act, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on September 23. The court will set the date for commencement of trial against Ahamad, from Bihar. Ahamad, accused No. 1 in the case, is said to have aided Lashkar-e-Taiba’s Abu Hamza enter and exit India. While Hamza and six others connected to the incident were never captured, Ahamad was picked up from Nepal in 2008. The accused was produced before the Bengaluru court through video conferencing from the Lucknow District Prison. Ahamad raised no objections to the framing of charges through the video conference. The charge for the offences was read over and explained to Ahamad in Hindi and English languages which he claimed to know. The accused pleaded not guilty. Jail officials from the Lucknow district court co-ordinated the hearing for the framing of the charges. According to the chargesheet, Abu Hamza, Mujamil alias Yusuf, Abdul Azeez, Athif, Abubakar, Zaki-ur-Rehaman Lakvi, Mohammed Habeeb alias Habeeb Miya and Basheer were the other accused in the case. Ahamad was the only accused who had been arrested when the chargesheet was filed in 2008. He had been arrested by UP police in another terror case. Lakvi was reportedly convicted in Pakistan on the charges of terror financing in January this year. Ahamad confessed that he along with Hamza had carried out the attack in IISc in December 2005 and also named Habeeb Miya as the one who helped him cross the Indian border illegally from Tripura to Bangladesh. Miya was arrested on March 22, 2017, by Central Crime Branch, Bengaluru, following which a split up charge-sheet was filed in the case. Miya, who is from Agartala and was accused No. 7 in the case, filed a petition before the court in 2018 seeking to be discharged as the prosecution failed to prove his involvement in the case. He was acquitted by the court on June 14 this year. According to prosecution, Ahamad was engaged in jihadi activities and terrorist organizations in Pakistan trained him to commit terrorist and disruptive activities in Bengaluru. Ahamad met many LeT people in Dhaka. He came to India with Hamza. He barged into the compound of IISc, Bengaluru, and escaped after assisting Hamza in commiting the act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nia-court-files-charges-against-05-iisc-attacker/articleshow/86741742.cms||---
---||Goa||Seafood set to get more expensive in Goa||PANAJI: At the beginning of the previous fishing season, diesel stood at Rs 54 per litre — a price that trawler owners in Goa considered high in the face of the pandemic. Little did they anticipate that it would increase to Rs 94 per litre by the time the season ended in May. With fishing operations resuming and fuel prices touching Rs 100 per litre, boat operators, apprehensive about their margins and the consequent impact on fish prices, are seeking timely reimbursement of the VAT subsidy. “This is going to be very difficult for us,” a trawler owner from the Vasco fishing jetty, Cruz Cardozo said. “We require over 100 litres of fuel per day to operate, but it is not every day that we are able to get a good catch. Days on which we return to the jetty without any catch are hard, but with the rising fuel prices, such days are only going to get harder,” he said. There are a few states like Tamil Nadu where the state government gives boat operators a subsidy on the VAT charged for diesel. The VAT is approximately Rs 20 compared Rs 94 of the diesel price in Goa. Though fishermen in Goa are also entitled to a VAT subsidy, many boat owners claim that they are yet to get their reimbursement. “The state government has reduced the fuel subsidy for fishermen from Rs 50,000 to Rs 30,000 since last year. It has been more than a year since the pending subsidies were released. How are we to survive in such challenging times?” Nerul-based fisherman, Ozer Mendes said. Reiterating that it was not feasible to run their boats at such diesel rates, president of the all Goa Purse Seine Boat Owners’ Association, Harshad Dhond said, “We therefore want the government to give us the VAT reimbursement trip-wise. That is the least it can do to help the fishing sector in Goa.” While trawler owners are dependent on diesel, traditional fishermen or ramponkar require petrol to run the motors of their canoes. However, the need to mix oil in the petrol for the smooth-functioning of the motor leads to the fishermen shelling out more money in order to fuel-up. Moreover, due to the lack of availability of fish these days owing to rough sea conditions, the ramponkars end up spending more time at sea raising their fuel requirement to two tanks instead of the usual one. “We used to require 25 litres, but now we need 50 litres costing roughly Rs 5,000 for a single day’s trip. This is not only unaffordable for us but is non-profitable when sufficient fish isn’t caught,” general secretary, National Fishworkers Forum, Olencio Simoes said. He added that there will be a direct impact on fish prices if the petrol prices are not regulated. “The fisheries department must see to it that the government understands that the subsidy acts as a relief for fishermen and ultimately has an impact on the price of fish as well,” Simoes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/seafood-set-to-get-more-expensive/articleshow/86739205.cms||Nida Sayed

No one was present in the church during the incident which occurred around 9.10pm when thundershowers and lightning swept the area for a brief while. Parish priest Fr Agnelo Fernandes was having dinner in the residential quarters behind the church when the incident occurred. “I was having dinner when we suddenly heard a loud sound, like a blast, and realised something had hit the church. I sent one of our staff to see what had happened and when he came back, he informed us that one of the towers had collapsed,” Fernandes said. “Immediately, I informed the fabrica (church committee) and within 10 minutes they came to the church.” Stating that it is difficult to estimate the exact damage monetarily, he said the damaged portion has been covered to prevent rainwater from entering the church. Fernandes said this is the second time in his living memory that such an incident has occurred. “In 2005-06, a similar incident had happened and lightning had struck the same tower, damaging it,” he said. Built during the Portuguese era in 1630 at a scenic spot alongside Fort Aguada overlooking the mouth of the Mandovi river, it is known as ‘Sao Lourenco Igreja em Sinquerim’. The annual feast, celebrated on August 10, marks the opening of the navigation channel of the Mandovi river. Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has installed additional lightning protection systems in the centuries-old monuments at the world heritage complex of Old Goa as an extra shield in severe weather.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sinquerim-church-tower-hit-by-lightning-crumbles/articleshow/86739261.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Rally joining India’s tiger dots to save big cats||NAGPUR: To raise awareness about the importance of tiger conservation and bring together people from different walks of life, the ‘India for tigers - A rally on wheels’ reached Nagpur and proceeded to Bor Tiger Reserve, on Sunday. On October 6, the rally will culminate at Melghat reserve. The rally is part of the events to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Indian independence on August 15, 2022. The government has planned to celebrate ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ as an intensive, countrywide campaign that will focus on citizen participation, to be converted into a ‘janandolan’, where small changes at the local level will add up to significant national gains. The rally started from Achanakmar, Udanti-Sitanadi, and Indravati tiger reserves in Chhattisgarh and reached TATR, NNTR, and Pench on Saturday. On Sunday, it was in Bor and will reach Amravati on October 4. It will move through the entire Melghat landscape and culminate at Chikhaldara on October 6. To celebrate the occasion, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) plans to undertake other activities like 5th cycle of All India Tiger Estimation (AITE) and Management Effectiveness (MEE) of tiger reserves, awareness and outreach activities to promote tiger conservation, synchronized pan-India protection patrol in tiger reserves, besides India for Tigers – A Rally on Wheels. “The proposed pan India outreach activity has twin objectives of celebrating India’s 75 years of independence and spreading the message of biodiversity conservation under the ambit of Project Tiger. The rally on wheels is being spearheaded by field directors. The rally will journey across 51 tiger reserves, 18 tiger states where field directors, deputies, and associated staff will follow the assigned routes and unite at the designated focal point of celebration,” said forest officials. The field directors started off from their designated tiger reserves. The idea is to culminate the event at Ranthambore, Kanha, Melghat, Bandipur, Similipal, Sunderbans, Manas, Palamau, and Corbett tiger reserves, representing our country’s initial nine tiger reserves designated under Project Tiger in 1973. The rally will cover a distance of over 7,500km in 7 days (October 2-8, 2021) traversing diverse and picturesque landscape spanning across India, conducting outreach activities along the way. “Coverage of the event will enable its global outreach,” says RS Govekar, Pench field director, who welcomed the rally in Pench from NNTR. As per AITE-2018, the tiger population in India is estimated at 2,967. India has doubled its tiger numbers in 2018, well before the targeted global deadline of 2022. Today, India has more than 70% tigers, yet there is an increasingly uncertain future in the country. “If tigers in India are to survive this century and beyond, their habitat urgently needs protection and restoration. Furthermore, there is an urgent need for sustained support from various stakeholders — government agencies, private business sectors, and communities in the field of tiger conservation,” said Govekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rally-joining-indias-tiger-dots-to-save-big-cats/articleshow/86739293.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Pench turns 250 hectares of concrete jungle into forest||NAGPUR: In a major eco-restoration and climate-adaptation project, supported under National Adaption Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC), Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR) Maharashtra is working on restoring degraded 250 hectares of forest land, equivalent to 467 football fields, right in the heart of the tiger reserve. The PTR has demolished over 40 concrete buildings and transported about 40,000 tonne debris to suitable sites last year. These quarters, belonging to irrigation department, were constructed in about 50 hectare of reserve forest land temporarily diverted for building a colony for officers and making labour camps for Totladoh dam project between 1974-94. However, encroachments and additional construction by labourers led to the degradation of over 250 hectares land due to various anthropogenic activities. A visit to Pench on Saturday revealed that the 250-hectare land is now being resorted under the Rs22 crore project to its original condition. Soil and moisture conservation works such as brushwood dams, gabion structures, loose boulder structures, cement dams etc have been undertaken in a large area to enrich soil moisture and check erosion. About 1.5-hectare high-density plantation of 33 local/indigenous species has been taken up at the degraded site. Besides, meadow development has been done in over 50 hectares. “This project is only of its kind anywhere in India involving multiple objectives such as eco-restoration inside a tiger reserve, creating green cover and improving soil quality with improved carbon sequestration contributing to India’s nationally determined contributions (NDCs) for climate targets, improving living standards of the forest-dwelling villagers, promote ecotourism and lastly creating a climate-sensitive, climate-resilient society. This project will act as a guiding force for others,” said Ravikiran Govekar, CCF, PTR. The National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) of Rs350 crore was created in 2014 with the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) as the nodal ministry to support the climate adaption actions at the state level based on the priority areas in the State Action Plan for Climate Change (SAPCC). NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development) has been designated as the implementing agency for such projects. Deputy director (core) Prabhu Nath Shukla said, “The ongoing activities include livelihood generation in 8 villages with fruit tree plantation, poultry, various other activities identified by the beneficiaries etc. It will also include preparing education and awareness material on climate sensitivity for tourists, students, and villagers. We will go for eco-friendly tourism by pitching in for battery-operated eco-vehicles.” ACF Atul Deokar said, “The project will improve canopy cover, carbon sink, additional carbon stock of about 11,000 tonne due to afforestation, improved soil indices, and water table and improved ecosystem services. It will also go in a long way to boost wildlife and offer better livelihood opportunities for villagers.” Retired DFO GK Vashisht says, “Restoring the land is a herculean task. The routine habitat development activities are non-feasible as there were a large number of concrete buildings, extremely degrading the site and poor soil strata. We are now restoring it to its natural habitat through afforestation and allied activities.” WHAT IT MEANS* People from 8 villages with a population of over 4,000 to get improved livelihood opportunities * Students, eco-tourists, and guides to get improved ecotourism, climate education * Wildlife, in general, will get a boost due to improved habitat * In 5 years, initial eco-restoration will be completed. Extension may be sought from MoEFCC, if needed * As habitat management is part of regular management of tiger reserve, further maintenance activities can be met through annual plans * Project may act as a ‘pilot project’ and can be extended to other areas * Improved canopy cover and additional carbon stock of about 11,000 tonne due to afforestation||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pench-turns-250ha-concrete-jungle-into-forest/articleshow/86739413.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Everybody’s interest will be taken into consideration and a balanced and a very robust policy will be finalised... Longer and detailed consultation, better will be the policy,” commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said, adding that the rules are meant to serve for years. The comment came amid reports that several government agencies had flagged their concerns over the draft e-commerce rules for consumer protection. Reiterating his earlier stand, Goyal said the idea of releasing draft rules was to have wider consultations and feedback. He cited the examples of the proposed data privacy law, the National Education Policy and hallmarking norms for jewellery, which have helped create a strong policy framework after detailed stakeholder consultations. Consumer affairs ministry, which is also headed by Goyal, had released draft rules for e-commerce for public consultation, which have resulted in howls of protest from e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, which are lobbying to block the norms. Besides, Indian players such as the Tata group have their own concerns over the current design, which the consumer affairs ministry may seek to address when the final set of rules are released.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-commerce-norms-to-weigh-all-stakeholders-interests/articleshow/86742924.cms||Sidhartha

GSAI alleged that his death was due to negligence of the ship's master, shipping company and its DPA (designated person ashore). GSIA president Frank Viegas on Sunday demanded that the director general of shipping initiate a fair inquiry into the cause of Sequeira’s death. “Prompt action by authorities will send a clear and positive message to the shipping fraternity and boost the morale of seafarers,” Viegas said while expressing the association’s solidarity and support to Sequeira’s family. The deceased’s brother, Eldon Sequeira told reporters that Bejoy died on board MV Jabal Alkawar on September 17 after being sick from September 5 onwards when the vessel was in port in Malaysia. “His condition deteriorated and there was no initiative taken by the ship’s master and the company to evacuate him or divert the ship to the nearest port. The company has not told us about the events that led to his death but merely informed us about his death,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/probe-death-of-seaman-when-ship-was-at-malaysia-port/articleshow/86739427.cms||---

AICC national spokesperson Shama Mohammed said that the drugs were found in two containers that arrived from Afghanistan via Iran and imported in the name of Aashi Trading Company of Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. “A point of concern is that these drugs have been sourced from Afghanistan. The money earned on the illegal sale of these drugs can be used against India... to destabilise our country by funding separatists and terrorist activities,” Mohammed told a press conference at the state Congress headquarters. The Narcotics Control Bureau, which has been tasked with the matter of drug law enforcement, is without a full time head for the past 18 month, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-for-probe-by-supreme-court-judges-into-drug-haul-at-mundra-port/articleshow/86739472.cms||---

It has pointed out that the proposals should go before the DC’s office first, which would take an initial call on allotment of land. A number of aspects need to be considered before this, it said. MADC is a state government company and also the developer of Mihan project, which includes the SEZ and a domestic tariff area (DTA). The developer sets up the infrastructure in a SEZ. The DC is an official of the ministry of commerce and is responsible for legal compliance at the SEZ. The current DC is Sraman Vasireddy an officer of Indian Trade Service (ITS) cadre. The letter was sent to the MADC office here, said Vasireddy. The crux of the letter is that proposals need to be scrutinized by the DC office first. Various aspects, which mainly includes the ability of a unit to generate net foreign exchange (NFE) earnings , have to be considered first. After which a decision can be taken to allot land in a SEZ. At present, the provisional allotment happens first, after which the process of granting approvals begins. It should be the other way round, says the letter. The units in a SEZ are supposed to be export oriented. Their net earnings after taking into account the imports of inputs should be foreign exchange surplus. Vasireddy said MADC has been asked to change the procedure and allow the DC office to take up the cases for scrutiny at its end before a decision on allotment is taken by MADC. With this even the process of final allotment can be expedited. The cases need to be put up before a local approval committee. This has members from the central and state governments, apart from representatives of the developer and the investing unit. After that the proposal goes to the board of approval (BOA) under the ministry of commerce for a final consideration, said a source. IN A NUTSHELL MADC is developer of Mihan-SEZ Development Commissioner (DC) office ensures legal compliance DC has said proposal from units have to be scrutinized at its end first Decision on land allotment can happen later||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/devpt-commr-office-says-mihan-land-allotment-should-come-before-it-first/articleshow/86739461.cms||Shishir Arya

Most of the farmers were yet to get a message to bring their produce to the markets. Some farmers even held a protest by blocking a road outside the Jundla grain market over delay in the procurement process. Long queues of traitor trailers were witnessed outside the Karnal mandi. Even some farmers faced difficulty getting gate passes. While a lot of farmers wanted the government to relax moisture content rules in view of a recent spell, some said that they (government) can deduct as per the high moisture content, but they should not delay procurement. “I brought my produce to Karnal mandi on September 28, but the procurement agency official rejected my crop saying it had 22% moisture content. Due to the inclement weather, the government should relax the moisture criteria,” said Naveen Kumar, a farmer from Kheri Naru village, Karnal. Deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav visited the Karnal grain market and took stock of the procurement. He said four government agencies have started paddy procurement at 15 purchase centres in the district. But a large quantity of produce could not fulfill the procurement criteria due to higher moisture content. He said there is a target to procure 15 lakh metric tonne of paddy in this Kharif season in the district. Karnal district food and supplies controller (DFSC) Ashok Rawat said till Sunday evening, a total of 4,210 quintals of paddy has been procured in the district. Sources said most of the paddy was lying in the mandi in the absence of lifting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-face-several-hurdles-on-first-day/articleshow/86741105.cms||---

He also slammed the government for repeatedly changing the dates for starting procurement. To ascertain the ground realities, Hooda visited grain markets at Ladwa, Pipli and Thanesar, where farmers and arhtiyas alleged that the procurement of paddy has not started in the markets yet. Addressing a press conference after visiting the markets, Hooda said the mandis are littered with paddy and the situation is such that there is no place to even set foot in the market. He also warned that if there are unseasonal rains, then the entore crop may get destroyed. “Farmers are forced to sell crops to private agencies below MSP due to the threat of rains,” he alleged, and added said farmers need clarity on the schedule of procurement. “During Congress government, the crops were purchased when they landed in the mandis and simultaneous payments were made. Today, farmers are being harassed, and they are asked to register on portals and on the pretext of high moisture content. As soon as our government is formed, we will eliminating the hassle of portals and registrations,” he said. Hooda also claimed that the state had a extended rainy season this year, , so the government should give concession to farmers in the standard moisture content. “Far from giving relief, the standard moisture content is being continuously reduced and it is clear from the policies of the government that they do not want to give proper price to the farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hooda-visits-grain-markets-slams-khattar-govt-for-jumlebaazi/articleshow/86741135.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Buoyant Trinamool names 4 candidates for Oct 30 bypolls||Kolkata: Emboldened by the bypoll victories in Bhowanipore, Jangipur and Shamshergunj, Trinamool Congress on Sunday named its candidates for the four seats that go to polls on October 30. The choice of Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay for Khardah and Udayan Guha for Dinhata (Cooch Behar) didn’t pack any surprise, but the two other candidates — Brajakishore Goswami from Shantipur and Subrata Mondal from Gosaba — appeared to be surprise picks. CM Mamata Banerjee, while announcing the candidates, also appealed to the Election Commission to restrict public campaigning during the nine Puja days from October 12-20. “On this auspicious day, I want to announce the names of the four candidates for the upcoming by-election in four places. At Shantipur, we will field Brajakishore Goswami; he is just 32 years old and hails from the Goswami Thakur family. We will plead with people of Shantipur to vote for us this time. There is no point voting for BJP,” she said. “Udayan Guha,” she continued, “will contest from Dinhata and at Khardah, we will field Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay. For Gosaba, I need to consult with Partha Chatterjee and Subrata Bakshi before finalising the candidate. There are two contenders — Bappaditya Naskar, who is the son of Jayanta Naskar, and Subrata Mondal. We need to discuss who will get the ticket before finalising the name.” Later, Trinamool released a press statement announcing Mondal as the Gosaba candidate. Bappaditya is a Kolkata Police personnel and contesting polls would have meant giving up his government job, sources said. That Sobhandeb was headed to Khardah was announced by Banerjee herself when she contested from Bhowanipore, which he had vacated. Sitting Khardah MLA Amit Mitra didn’t contest the 2021 assembly polls due to ill health. Guha’s renomination from Dinhata was a foregone conclusion after the manner in which he fought against BJP MP Nisith Pramanik and lost by only 50 votes. Goswami’s nomination from Shantipur has surprised many. Former MLA Ajoy De — who won the seat six times — was replaced with Goswami, a political greenhorn but with links to a family among the most respected in Shantipur. The CM also iterated her appeal for a breather from public campaigning during Pujas. “Had they announced by-elections for all seven constituencies at a time, that would have been better. We will manage it. But we have a small request before the Election Commission that during the festive period of October 10-20, when revellers would be out on the road visiting Puja pandals, political parties should not indulge in campaigning in open. All campaigns should again start from October 20. We will want people of our state not to be disturbed during our biggest festival,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/buoyant-trinamool-names-4-candidates-for-oct-30-bypolls/articleshow/86740530.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||DVC cuts water release, relief operations gain pace||Burdwan/Hooghly/Midnapore: The flood situation in Bengal has improved a little as DVC has reduced the release of water and the quantum released from Durgapur barrage was comparatively less on Sunday. The scene in Arambag, Khanakul, Pursura, Goghat and Tarakeswar, however, remained unchanged as many were living in relief camps after they lost homes to the flood. Many roads were still inundated. “We released 1.04 lakh cusecs water from Durgapur barrage on Sunday around 4pm,” executive engineer Sanjoy Singh told TOI. DVC’s executive director (civil) Debashish Deb said: “We are releasing 65,000 cusecs water from Maithon and Panchet dams. From Maithon, 25,000 cusecs were released and 40,000 cusecs from Panchet on Sunday around 4pm.” Asansol South police station provided relief material to flood-hit people of Kalipahari area of Asansol in West Burdwan. IC Abhijit Chatterjee said: “We provided relief materials to 700 people that included food and dry food, chocolates and garments for kids.” In Khanakul, which was the worst-affected, many people were spending sleepless nights and many were waterlogged in their houses. The Hooghly administration sent food to various relief camps. Villagers of Ghoshpur, Marokhana, Bandipur, Jagatpur and Dhannaghori were waterlogged. DVC water had also flooded Tarakeswar area and many nearby villages. Tarakeswar MLA Ramendu Singh Roy said relief was being provided to the flood-hit. “We are giving ORS and tarpaulins,” he added. Four wards of Arambag municipality are still under water. In West Midnapore, the flood situation improved though Ghatal remained under water. The body of Tapan Patra (40), missing since Thursday, was found floating in Jaikundu in Ghatal on Sunday. It has been sent for autopsy. The levels of Jhumi and Shilabati rivers fell below the danger level on Sunday. Ghatal BDO Suman Biswas, however, said 13 wards, along with some adjoining villages, were still under water. It will take time to remove the water, he added. Various areas of Daspur and Chandrakona too were still waterlogged, bringing the boats out. In Mansukha, an NDRF team ferried a pregnant woman to hospital on a speed boat. In West Midnapore, 24 deaths were reported since September 14. Even in Pingla, Narayangarh, Kharagpur, Midnapore Sadar and Keshiari blocks, several thousands were waterlogged. Over 8.24 lakh were affected and 21,000 houses completely damaged. District magistrate Rashmi Kamal said 135 relief camps were being operated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dvc-cuts-water-release-relief-operations-gain-pace/articleshow/86740397.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||Kolkata||‘Party hobe’: CM Mamata Banerjee’s supporters paint the town green||KOLKATA: Some danced to the tunes of ‘Khela Hobe’ and ‘Mamatadi Arekbar’ playing on loop, while others were busy painting the streets green, even as a group smeared abir on each other’s faces and distributed sweets while yet others were busy designing new and innovative banners, congratulating Mamata Banerjee on her landslide victory, and putting those up for display outside her home. The road outside Banerjee’s residence in Kalighat resembled a carnival after her landslide victory. With Harish Chatterjee Street (popularly known as the road to “Didir bari) cordoned off with a heavy contingent of police force preventing outsiders’ entry, the party supporters had started gathering on the stretch of Hazra Road outside Harish Chatterjee Street since the first trends of the day started coming in around 9am. Over the next hour, when Banerjee had gained a healthy lead of 6,000-plus votes by the third round, boom boxes were set up on the road and the party favourite, ‘Khela Hobe’, was playing on loop. Since then, the number of supporters increased by the minute. “I cannot express my happiness in words. Didi is like our own elder sister. I feel like my own sister has won today. We want to see her as the Prime Minister now,” said Mangala Pakhira, leading a group of women smeared in green and dancing on the road, waving party flags. Pakhira works at a government hospital as a Group D staffer, but had taken a day off to celebrate “Didi’s victory.” Sporting shades painted in green and orange, with photos of Banerjee and the TMC symbol pasted on it, 45-year-old Rajat Mukherjee had joined the roadside party straight from work after slogging 10 hours on night duty at a private firm in central Kolkata. So did Kalighat Road resident Dilip Roy Chowdhury, who was found dancing with abandon while holding his right hand — still in a cast — in the air. “A bit of pain doesn’t matter on days like this. I fractured my hand days before the announcement of the election, but that didn’t deter me from participating in the campaign. How could I then miss celebration day?” said Roy Chowdhury. As the day’s DJ, Rahul Das, kept on playing TMC party chartbusters — ‘Khela Hobe’, ‘Delhi Jabe Hawaii Choti’, ‘Shishir Babur Chheleta’ and ‘Mamatadi Arekbar’, peppy Bengali songs written and sung mostly by young party worker Debangsu Bhattacharya — even senior leaders joined in. “On a day like this, it is difficult to hold back the emotions of party workers and supporters, who were hurt after the chief minister’s loss in Nandigram,” said Kartik Banerjee, one of the eight campaign managers of the TMC chief, celebrating with party workers at Kalighat. The list of visitors joining the celebration party was not only limited to supporters in Bhowanipore; as the day progressed, hordes of supporters — on mini trucks, cars and bikes — started joining in from Baruipur in the south to Dum Dum in the north, and from Metiabruz in the west to Bhangar in the east. “This is a special day and I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to meet and greet Didi,” said Dolly Das, a resident of Durganagar in North 24 Parganas who went to Kalighat to congratulate the chief minister in person even though she has difficulty walking. Artisans from the nearby potters’ colony, too, took a short break from the hectic Puja schedule as many of them joined in the celebrations. They were soon joined by a large group of Sikhs, all local residents, who brought two quintals of laddoo and distributed it among the supporters. As the counting neared conclusion and trends made it clear that the chief minister was going to sail past the 55,000 victory margin, bettering her own previous record, members of TMC’s women’s wing at ward 83 reached Kalighat with a giant banner, renaming the chief minister as “ModiShahsuromordini”, a play on words, referring to the duo of PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah as an asura, “slayed” by Banerjee, like the goddess Durga had slayed the asura Mahishasur. “Didi is the epitome of Ma Durga for us and in this election, she has once again slayed the BJP asuras,” explained one of the supporters, erecting the banner opposite Harish Chatterjee Street.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/party-hobe-didis-supporters-paint-the-town-green/articleshow/86741104.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Speaker may move SC against HC order on Mukul||Kolkata: Bengal assembly Speaker Biman Banerjee is planning to move the Supreme Court against a recent Calcutta High Court order on the Mukul Roy disqualification plea case. The HC had last Tuesday asked Banerjee to decide on the petition to disqualify Roy, under the anti-defection law, by October 7. Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari had filed the petition against Roy, who had switched over from BJP to Trinamool. While the hearing was pending, the speaker appointed Roy the PAC chairman. Banerjee consulted legal opinion following the HC directive and said he was mulling moving the Supreme Court this week. Sources hinted that some top lawyers were going to represent the speaker as he wanted to point out that the HC was making an attempt to exert its power on the legislature and the HC was overstepping its jurisdiction in issuing directives to the speaker. The HC division bench of acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Rajarshi Bhardwaj had said that in case of failure to meet the deadline, it would decide further course of action. BJP MLA Ambika Roy had challenged Mukul Roy’s appointment as PAC chairman as the latter had joined Trinamool but did not resign from BJP or from his MLA post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/speaker-may-move-sc-against-hc-order-on-mukul/articleshow/86740337.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bhowanipore votes for West Bengal’s CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Bhowanipore’s voters have given Mamata Banerjee the mandate she needed to continue as Bengal’s CM, electing their “ghorer meye” to the legislative assembly by a margin of 58,835 votes. The Trinamool also retained Jangipur and Shamsherganj — the first by an even more staggering margin of 92,480 votes — to maintain its strength of 213 in the 294-member state assembly. But it was the nature of its victory in Bhowanipore that would help the party set the agenda for the four bypolls later this month and the civic elections after that, Trinamool seniors said. Sunday’s win is the first time since 2014 that the Trinamool has led in all eight wards of this multi-lingual and multi-cultural constituency, a fact that gives Banerjee and her party the ammo they need to respond to the BJP’s jibes that it is overly dependent on specific voter blocs. This was a point that Banerjee herself emphasised on Sunday. “Every ward has given us a lead. This is a seat where Hindus stay with Muslims and Sikhs and Bengalis stay with Gujaratis, Punjabis, Odiyas, Biharis and people from Uttar Pradesh. I thank every one of them,” she said after her overwhelming victory. Banerjee — by recording a victory margin of 58,000-plus votes — also won her biggest win in an assembly poll and as CM, bettering her own 2011 margin of 54,213 (that, too, was a by-election). Sunday’s victory margin was more than double the party’s April 26 victory margin of 28,719 votes, when it trailed in two wards (Chakraberia-Paddapukur and Alipore). Banerjee, after the last vote was counted, had got 71.9% of the votes cast, leaving only 22.2% for BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal; the BJP had got more than 35% votes barely five months back. The CPM, too, was handed a body blow, getting only 3.5 % of the vote share and losing its deposit in a seat that was labelled “mini India” during the bypoll campaign. Banerjee — clad in her usual white cotton sari with blue and green borders — stressed on all these points in her victory speech delivered on the lane outside her Kalighat home in the afternoon, when she was flanked by her sisters-in-law, nephew and party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and his school-going daughter. The backdrop came in the form of a giant photo-collage that supporters had put up a few minutes back; on the collage was written “Modishahsurmardini (slayer of the Modi-Shah asura)”. “There were so many conspiracies against me. The people of Bhowanipore have given a befitting reply to those conspiracies and the conspirators. Our entire party and myself are indebted to Bhowanipore’s voters and will remember this forever. You have inspired me to work harder,” Banerjee said as the crowd around her started its “Didi, Didi” chant. “They sent 3,500 central force personnel to this small constituency. But the people of Bhowanipore have given an answer on behalf of Bengal and India,” she added. Banerjee, in the course of her seven-minute-31-second address, also cautioned party workers not to bring out victory rallies and not to go overboard with the celebrations; they should, she added, focus on helping flood victims across the state. The date of Banerjee’s oath-taking ceremony was awaiting a nod from Raj Bhavan, Bengal assembly speaker Biman Banerjee said. Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said the party accepted the people’s verdict. “But we have to ask whether the result truly reflects the mandate of the people when only 57% have voted,” he added. Bhowanipore, like the rest of Kolkata, usually has turnouts lower than the rest of the state even in general elections. Tibrewal emphasised that she had got over 25,000 votes “in a contest against the CM”. “I am overwhelmed by the affection of people and the commitment of my party leadership and workers,” she said, admitting there was some “organisational weakness” that plagued the party in Bhowanipore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bhowanipore-votes-for-bengals-cm/articleshow/86741075.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Jakir sweeps Jangipur bypoll by a margin of 92,480 votes||Berhampore: Trinamool Congress candidate Jakir Hossain on Sunday pulled off a stunning 92,480 vote lead in Jangipur despite his inability to walk without help after his severe injuries in the February 12 Nimtita railway station blast that confined him to hospital for two-and-a-half months. Jakir had filed his nomination in a stretcher. Along with Jangipur, TMC also won Shamsherganj constituency in Murshidabad, increasing its vote margin from the last polls in 2016. Jakir, who had a 33.3 % vote share in 2016, increased it to 68.8%. He got 1,36,444 votes on Sunday compared to the 66,869 votes in 2016. Back then, CPM and Congress had failed to reach an understanding for this segment, ending up dividing a 45.1 % vote share between themselves. BJP then had only 13% votes. On Sunday, however, BJP’s vote share shot up to 22.1 % while RSP’s share dropped below double digits to only 4.5% in Jangipur. In this five-year period, Md Sohrab, the Congress candidate in 2016, joined TMC and former Jangipur MP Abhijit Mukherjee, too, defected to Trinamool. A visibly relaxed Jakir, however, refused to go into the reasons while greeting supporters at his Jantar Darbar home. “These votes are for Mamata Banerjee. Abhishek Banerjee, while campaigning for me, had urged people to vote for the CM and to avenge the attack on my life. People have heard him and voted,” he said. In Shamsherganj, Amirul Islam stretched his vote share to over 51% from 30.4% in 2016. In 2016, he had won the seat in a very close contest with CPM winning 29.3% votes. CPM was reduced to 3.2% votes on Sunday, but Congress fought to get a 37.1% vote share. In 2016, Congress had a 26.6% vote share in Shamsherganj. Jakir was seriously injured in an explosion six months before the election. An industrialist, Jakir, who was a staunch campaigner against cow smuggling across the border to Bangladesh, was possibly a target of a smuggling racket. Poll pundits said Jakir was blessed with a wave of sympathy votes. At Shamsherganj, the election was cancelled following the Covid death of Congress candidate Rezaul Haque. TMC candidate Amirul increased his margin of victory from 1,780 votes in 2016 to 26,111 votes in the September 30 election. However, Congress proved its solid support base with party candidate Zaidur Rehman garnering more than 70,000 votes. While the Left vote bank suffered a major erosion, the BJP candidate also lost some from his vote bank. Poll pundits found a common factor behind Trinamool’s thumping success in Jangipur. On September 27, three days before the poll, the labour cost for binding of every 1,000 bidis was raised from Rs 152 to Rs 178. Since Jangipur subdivision has more than 8 lakh registered bidi labourers, the hike in remuneration proved vital for increasing the margin of votes of Trinamool candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jakir-sweeps-jangipur-bypoll-by-a-margin-of-92480-votes/articleshow/86740585.cms||Sukumar Mahato

Sidhu had resigned from the Punjab Congress president’s post on September 28, stating that he cannot compromise on Punjab’s future and agenda of Punjab’s welfare. Though the party has not accepted his resignation till date but after that he has not held any meetings of the party unit. In Sidhu’s support, cabinet minister Razia Sultana had also resigned from the post before formally taking over charge of her department but her resignation has also not been accepted till now. Day later, Sidhu had a nearly 2-hour-long meeting with chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi at Punjab Bhawan on September 30, in which it was mutually agreed to constitute a coordination committee to have prior consultation on major policy decision of the Punjab government and to leave the decision on appointment of advocate general to the party high command. One of the four working presidents of the Punjab Congress, while requesting not to be named, said, “We are also helpless till the party high command conveys to us the final verdict. Sidhu sahab is adamant and is not going to budge till the DGP and advocate general are changed and the high command knows this very well.” The chief minister clarified on Sunday that the DGP of the state would be chosen from among the three IPS officers who would be there in the UPSC approved panel sent to the state, after consulting Sidhu, cabinet ministers and MLAs. It is expected that apart from the chief minister and state party president, the coordination committee could have Rajasthan revenue minister Harish Choudhary, who could soon replace state party in-charge Harish Rawat due to the forthcoming elections in Uttarakhand. Rawat’s office in Dehradun told TOI that he has no plan to visit Chandigarh at present, though he is going to Delhi on Monday or Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhu-refuses-to-budge-state-cong-awaits-delhi-decision-on-coordination-committee/articleshow/86741202.cms||---

The number of patients undergoing treatment, which was on the decline for a long time, started to increase from the first week of September and went above 17,000 on September 22. But it has come down to 16,972 now. This was because even when the infection count rose, the recovery rate never dropped below 98%. On an average, 1,500 to 1,600 got discharged after treatment every day. On Sunday, the number of daily corona positive cases also dropped to a 32-day low of 1,531. For the sixth consecutive day, Chennai topped the state's infection chart. As many as 184 people tested positive in the district. However, Chennai's test positivity rate (TPR - 0.8%) is below the state's average figure of 1%. Coimbatore with a slightly higher TPR of 1.5% reported 158 fresh cases. Thanjavur (97 new cases) and Mayiladuthurai (27) are the only two districts in TN with a TPR of above 2 %. On the flipside, TN's case-fatality ratio hasn't dropped and continued to hover around 1.3% for the last two months. Every day, 10 to 30 people have succumbed to the disease. Overall the death toll rose to 35,650 with another 23 passing away from the virus on Sunday.

The common computer-based tests to recruit SIs in four wings — investigation, district, armed police and intelligence — of Punjab Police were held from August 17 to August 24 at different centres in the state. The examination was scrapped on the directions of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa to maintain the integrity and fairness of the examination process.  The dates for fresh examinations for the recruitment of SIs will be notified soon. The recruitment board constituted for the recruitment of SIs had recommended scrapping of the examinations after cheating and the use of malpractices were widely reported. The report in this regard was received by the DGP office on September 27 and the DGP on Saturday (October 2) gave approval to the recommendations of the recruitment board. The Punjab Police have already registered three FIRs in Mohali, Patiala and Khanna districts. On September 15, the DGP had constituted an SIT headed by ADGP Parmod Ban, ADGP special crimes and economic offences wing, to carry forward the fair and expeditious investigation of the cases registered in this regard. The SIT has already started the investigation of the cases and has so far arrested 20 accused in three FIRs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-police-recruitment-exam-for-560-sub-inspectors-scrapped/articleshow/86740329.cms||---

The CM also said any employee who has attained the age of over 58 years would not be allowed to serve anymore by way of extension in service, so that the youth could be given a chance for government jobs. Channi said the Punjab government was now awaiting a panel from the central government regarding three names finalised for the post of DGP. Thereafter, the name of DGP would be finalised in consultation with Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, all ministers and MLAs, he added. He was talking to the media on the sidelines of the state-level function of debt-waiver scheme for farm labourers and landless farmers, and launch of a pilot project of drone technology for mapping rural properties under Mission Lal Lakir at Morinda. The CM added the state government was functioning with dedication and the priority would be to ensure transparency in its administration. He, however, said organisational work was being looked after by the Punjab Congress president and a committee had been constituted for better coordination between the government and the Congress party. Sidhu firm on standMaking it clear that he still stood firm on the removal of officiating DGP Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota and advocate general A P S Deol, Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu tweeted on Sunday that these appointments would rub salt on victims. “Demand for justice in sacrilege cases and for arrest of main culprits behind the drug trade brought our government in 2017. Due to his failure, people removed the last CM. Now, AG/DG appointments rub salt on wounds of victims; they must be replaced or we will have no face,” he tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/channi-says-dgp-to-be-chosen-from-centres-panel/articleshow/86741315.cms||---

Despite ED officials having received complaints from 40 people, officials are expecting more complaints from the victims against businessman Dhanraj Kochar and his family members, who usurped properties valued several crores from the victims under the pretext of offering them loans. Out of the six places where searches were conducted by ED officials, two places remained locked. Officials sealed two places and assigned policemen on guard duty for two days before it was opened on September 30. Narrating Dhanraj Kochar’s modus operandi, the officials said Kochar including his three sons Inderchand, Suresh and Ramesh along with their families and siblings had conspired and cheated gullible persons by offering loans in cash, with upto 10% collateral, apart from taking property documents as collateral along with blank cheques. They also took a general power of attorney (GPA) in their names and promissory notes, citing that their seizure includes third-party property documents. Irrespective of whether the repayments are made or not, the land was transferred in the name of Dhanraj Kochar and his family.ED officials learnt about this modus operandi and conducted searches at their residential and business premises on September 28 and 30. Officials seized Rs 1.5 crore in cash, gold and diamond jewellery worth more than Rs 11 crores, along with more than 150 original property sale deeds and registries in the name of Kochar’s family. The net worth of the seizures is more than Rs 225 crore. An officials said that the Kochars used their money and muscle power to intimidate gullible persons pushed them into a vicious debt circle. The interest rates charged by the Kochars is in the range of 24% to 48% which is in violation of Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest (TNPCEI) Act. The complainants who lost their properties to businessman Kochar can reach ED officials to retrieve their properties, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ed-team-seizes-assets-worth-rs-250-crore-in-raids-in-chennai/articleshow/86743128.cms||---

The former chief minister attended a rally organised by SAD at Bathinda on Sunday for seeking compensation to aggrieved farmers, whose cotton crop has been damaged due to pink bollworm attack. At his political best, Badal claimed that the cause of farmers’ is so dear that he and the party had not made such circumstances at the worst of the times in the past, which he and party has made now against the farm laws. The 93-year-old party patriarch claimed that as now, he has met people after long, he had added years to his life and will make a century of years. Before attending the party rally, Badal went to the rally of INLD supremo Om Prakash Chautala at Jind on September 25. The party says if the compensation is not provided to aggrieved farmers in a week, they would hold a protest at the residence of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. Badal said the BJP government at the Centre had committed “vishwasghaat” (betrayal) with him, his party and the farmers by going back on the assurances given about not converting the ordinances into acts without taking the farmers — the actual stake-holders — on board. These assurances had followed SAD’s public stance that it would oppose the bills and quit both the cabinet and the alliance if the government hustled the legislation through without taking farmers on board, said Badal. “I felt betrayed and pained when the bills were introduced. It brought back memories of how Jawaharlal Nehru went back on promises made to Master Tara Singh, of Indira Gandhi’s frequent flip-flops with us, and of Rajiv Gandhi’s betrayal of Sant Harchand Singh Longowal. But I thought BJP would be different.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/punjab-sad-patron-parkash-singh-badal-back-feels-betrayed-on-farm-laws/articleshow/86743282.cms||Neel Kamal

She won the seat by 2,696 votes. This will be the second time that Rama Rani will become the Ward 34 councillor — she held the post between 2011 and 2017. She is the wife of the ward’s former councillor, RS Rathee, whose death in May this year necessitated the polls. Though her husband had contested the polls as an Independent in 2017, Rama Rani represented BJP. She said some of the key areas she intended to focus on were infrastructure, security, and sanitation. “Being a former councilor of the ward myself and having seen my husband in the role over the past few years, I am well-versed with the issues in the area. I have a very clear vision for the ward. I plan to resolve infrastructural issues in terms of electricity distribution, water supply, drainage, and the condition of roads. In addition, sanitation as well as security are key areas that I will focus on. I will also develop more green belts in the ward,” Rama Rani said. “The last few months have been very difficult for my family and me. I believe this victory is not just the result of people’s faith in me, but also a sign that my husband continues to watch over and support me,” she said. Ward 34 includes areas such as DLF phases 1 and 2, MG Road and Sikanderpur village. Although it has a total of 28,668 voters, only 8,680 people cast their franchise on Sunday — a turnout of 30.2%. “Voting took place at 30 booths across 12 centres. A four-member team was deployed in each. Additionally, five teams were also kept in reserve. The bypoll was peaceful and smooth,” said sub-divisional magistrate Satish Yadav, also the returning officer. According to data shared by the district administration, a total of 5,342 people voted for Rathee. Of the other three candidates in the fray – all of whom contested as Independents — Zile Singh, president of the Saraswati Vihar residents’ welfare association, secured 2,646 votes. He was contesting for the second time. The other two candidates, Jagmohan and Mohit Yadav, an advocate from Sikanderpur, secured 573 votes and 66 votes, respectively.

---||Chandigarh||CBI to probe Rs 7cr duplicate PNB FD fraud, rules HC||Chandigarh: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will now probe the scam wherein around Rs 7 crore has been allegedly misappropriated by issuing duplicate fixed deposit certificates (FDs) from the Punjab National Bank’s branch at Machrauli in Haryana’s Jhajjar district. The matter will be referred to the investigation agency following the intervention of the Punjab and Haryana high court. In this case, an FIR was registered on January 21, 2021 at Machrauli police station in Jhajjar on the complaint of the manager of PNB’s local branch against one of the staff members, Himanshu Aggarwal. As per the complaint, the accused had allegedly misappropriated an amount of around Rs 6 lakh by issuing duplicate FDs. However, later it was discovered that the misappropriation of funds ran into crores. Thereafter, the matter reached before the HC in the wake of a petition filed by the PNB seeking directions to transfer the probe from the Haryana police to CBI’s banking security and fraud cell (BSFC). The HC was informed that keeping in view the policy issued by the RBI dated July 1, 2016, the frauds committed with the bank authorities wherein money involved is Rs 3 crores or more, are to be investigated by the CBI’s banking security and fraud cell. In the present case, the HC was informed, the fraud committed with the petitioner-bank was more than Rs 7 crores and therefore the case is liable to be investigated by the CBI. The bank also contended that in a similar case, titled Punjab and Sind Bank versus State of Punjab and Others, decided on September 21, 2011, a coordinate bench of the HC held that where the fraud is committed with the bank authorities and the embezzlement is between Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crores, the investigation is to be carried out by the CBI. “These findings returned by the coordinate bench were based upon the circular of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), Government of India dated March 30, 2005 and the guidelines dated July 1, 2008 issued by the RBI,” the HC was informed. After going through the judgment and hearing the contentions, Justice Harsimran Singh Sethi observed that although the counsel for the respondents-state concedes that the prayer of the petitioner in the present case is squarely covered by the decision in Punjab and Sind Bank case, the proceedings in the PNB case by the Haryana police were initiated at the request of the petitioner-bank wherein, the embezzlement was reported only to the tune of Rs 6 lakh and this amount was later enhanced to more than Rs 7 crores. “Once, the parties concede that the prayer of the petitioner is squarely covered by the decision in the Punjab and Sind Bank case, the present petition is also disposed of in the same terms,” observed the HC while sending the matter to CBI for the probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cbi-to-probe-rs-7cr-duplicate-pnb-fd-fraud-rules-hc/articleshow/86740111.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Chandigarh||50 years of victory 1971 war: Martyred at 24, his legacy of bravery lives on||ISSEWAL (LUDHIANA): Jaswinder Kaur was 12 years old when she last saw her brother Sepoy Sarup Singh Sekhon in 1971. “The last time he was here, he had promised to get me educated and my elder sister married,” says Jaswinder, who is about 62 years old now. Sepoy Sekhon was aged 24 when he was martyred in the 1971 war. Unlike many others, his martyrdom was not documented too well. “I got married after the martyrdom of my brother-in-law, but I had heard that he was a bold person. He was unmarried and served the Army for less than two years when he sacrificed his life in the war. We heard that he didn’t come out of the tank even as he was asked to leave,” says Rashminder Kaur, the widow of Sepoy Sekhon’s brother Kulwant Singh, who died five years ago. Rashminder now lives in the family home with her daughter-in-law and two grandchildren live at the house of the family. Her son, Harmanjot Singh, is working in Dubai. The martyr is also survived by two sisters, Jaswinder Kaur and Nareshpal Kaur, both married. Rashminder says Sepoy Sekhon’s father Bhan Singh worked as a security guard in a factory on the banks of Hoogly river in West Bengal. After his death 33 years ago, Kulwant worked there, but he too died five years ago. The family still has pictures of Sepoy Sekhon and the citation given to the family by chief of army staff in December 1999. Jaswinder says her brother had been brave since childhood. “My elder sister and my mother told me that there was a bush forest on the sides of the canal that passes through our village, Issewal, where thieves would hide and loot persons returning from work in Ludhiana. My brother, who was in Class VIII at that time, had seen two thieves in those bushes and went to Mullanpur to inform police, after which they were arrested. The police officer had given him Rs 10 for bravery at that time,” says Jaswinder. She says Sepoy Sekhon had come home on three occasions after joining the Army. “After he had joined Army, he had come twice on leaves of 28 days each and then a two-month vacation in about two years. During that time, he got a borewell dug in our fields as we would face water problem. He also had said that he wished to get me educated and get my elder sister married after he came on leave next time, but he died in the war. We lived in a kucha house at that time and he wanted a pucca roof,” she adds. She says the whole village is proud of her brother. Nareshpal, who was three years younger to Sarup, says when they got the telegram informing them about the martyrdom of her brother on December 7, 1971, he was posted on the Gujarat border, but they don’t know where he attained martyrdom. “He was posted with artillery wing as wireless operator and had died after a tank was attacked. This is what Army officials who came to return his belongings, including his uniform, after around two and half months of his death had told us,” says Nareshpal Kaur (68), whose husband Captain Balbir Singh Gill died four months ago. Nareshpal says the government had promised to get a bus stand constructed in the village, but it didn’t happean. “The little grant we got for Sarup’s sacrifice has been spent on the memorial in front of our parents’ home in Issewal, so that people know about our brave brother,” she adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/martyred-at-24-his-legacy-of-bravery-lives-on/articleshow/86740433.cms||Shariq Majeed

While the India Meteorological Department (IMD) says it will arrive on time, private forecasters said most of TN will receive pre-monsoon spells every other day before that. The IMD’s long range forecast says “Northeast monsoon 2021 over south Peninsular India including Tamil Nadu is most likely to be normal.” The spatial distribution of rainfall for October-December suggests it will be above normal over many parts of Tamil Nadu and below average for Chennai and surrounding districts. However, it may be above normal over many parts of TN including Chennai in October. N Puviarasan, director of IMD’s Area Cyclone Warning Centre in Chennai, said there are indications the southwest monsoon may completely withdraw around October 15 and the northeast monsoon may arrive around October 20, its normal onset date with a deviation of six days. “We can expect a normal monsoon. The spatial distribution of rainfall is based on global climate phenomena and other conditions and can be taken only as a guideline because weather systems like cyclones are not taken into consideration. A circulation or a cyclone could change everything,” he said. During the northeast monsoon, TN receives 447.4mm of rain 48% of its annual quota and Chennai gets 867.4mm 63% of its annual quota. IMD said phenomena like La Nina, cooling of sea surface temperature over the Pacific, may re-emerge and a negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) may turn neutral. These two may influence the monsoon. La Nina is normally considered not favourable for the northeast monsoon. “Models show monsoon will be normal,” said Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet. Dry spells will reduce and showers may increase in the coming days in many parts of the state including coastal areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/northeast-monsoon-wont-disappoint-imd/articleshow/86743558.cms||U Tejonmayam

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Solar power ends dark days of dry spells||LUCKNOW: The plan to extend piped water supply to all districts of Uttar Pradesh and the massive energy costs that would have been required to sustain the infrastructure forced the government to turn towards sustainable sources of energy. Under Jal Jivan Mission, the state government is powering water supply in 66 districts through solar mode, while tubewell schemes in the regions of Bundelkhand and Vindhya are also dependent on solar light for their operation. Anurag Srivastava, principal secretary, Namami Gange, said that work of installing solar power systems had started in 7,585 of the 34,257 villages identified for the project. The detailed project reports for another 16,000 villages are ready and being processed. “As per the feasibility studies done, we will be setting up solar powered water supply systems in 95% of the area in these 66 districts. Even though there is a huge cost involved in setting up a solar system, the savings in terms of power consumption are massive and the maintenance cost is also much lower,” he said. Srivastava said that UP has an average of 330 days with sufficient sunlight available to power solar systems and on days when sunlight is not sufficient, DG sets could be used. In Bundelkhand and Vindhyachal, said another official, it was not feasible to put up massive solar power plants due to paucity of land. There, instead, solar energy based stand-alone water supply systems are being used as the main source of energy for the schemes. “In Hamirpur, there are 125 solar tubewells, 270 in Jalaun and 28 in Banda,” he said. Listing the advantages of using solar pumping systems, the official added that it had lower operation and maintenance costs and can be easily installed in the scattered, isolated, hilly villages which are mostly found in Bundelkhand and Vindhya regions, especially since they require very little maintenance. The solar energy material is prefabricated and can be installed in a short time span. “Solar energy is clean energy and less polluting than conventional means of energy generation through fuel. By using freely available sunlight, they avoid the constraints of weak or expensive rural fuel supply networks. Solar pumping systems are durable and reliable and their PV panels have a design life of over 20 years,” the official said. He added that since the solar pumps have few moving parts, they require little maintenance and can be tailored to current power needs and if required, they can be expanded by adding PV panels and accessories. He explained that if properly installed, solar energy systems are safe and low risk due to low system voltage and adequate protection also minimizes the risk of fire.
